 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal migrations are some of the most remarkable spectacles of nature and can result in significant engineering of ecological processes. For example, migrating animals have the potential to move large amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and other important nutrients among ecosystems. The Mara River in East Africa supports the largest remaining overland migration in the world: 1.5 million wildebeest and over 4,000 hippopotami. This project will use small-scale and whole-stream experiments, river sampling and theoretical models to test how nutrient inputs into the Mara River by wildebeest and hippopotami interact with river discharge to influence ecosystem processes such as primary production, nutrient cycling, and whole-ecosystem metabolism. The Mara River is one of the few remaining unregulated rivers heavily influenced by large wildlife populations, and provides a unique opportunity for research. Findings will improve understanding of ecosystems where large wildlife play an important role, and provide a baseline for comparison with systems where wildlife have disappeared or been replaced by humans and domesticated animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will have relevance to regional concerns relating to both wildlife and water quality. The Mara River is critical to the Serengeti Mara ecosystem and provides water for nearly one million rural poor. Declining water quality has been linked to outbreaks of typhoid and cholera, and eutrophication of Lake Victoria. In addition, wildebeest migration and mass drowning events are of local concern to managers in the Maasai Mara National Park. Research will also address human inputs into the river, which may inform decision makers about how more effective sewage treatment could benefit the region. The project will train undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoc from the USA, and graduate students from around East Africa. Partnerships with the National Geographic Society and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) will distribute research results through print, video and web-based initiatives. The WWF partnership will use real-time monitoring data from the Mara, photos from live camera traps, and blog updates to disseminate findings to stakeholders, resource managers, and the public.",

The very high rates of organic matter and nutrient loading by hippopotami result in the rapid development of anoxic bottom waters in hippo pools which, when flushed by high flows, cause rapid declines in dissolved oxygen in the tributaries and mainstem of the Mara River. Hippo pools are biogeochemical hot spots that strongly influence biogeochemical cycling and produce methane and carbon dioxide at concentrations that are an order of magnitude higher than previously documented for small inland waters. Hippos are also major vectors of biogenic silica into aquatic ecosystems, which may have a large impact on downstream wetland and lake ecosystems. Mass drownings of wildebeest contributed an average of 6,250 carcasses and 1,100 tons of biomass, 107 tons of carbon, 25 tons of nitrogen, and 13 tons of phosphorus to the Mara River each year. Carcasses are composed of 44% bone and 56% soft tissue. Bone contains most of phosphorus and decays slowly, lasting around a decade in the river bottom. Soft tissue, in contrast, decays rapidly over a few weeks, and these nutrients are released to the river, assimilated by biofilms, transported downstream or moved back into the terrestrial ecosystem by scavengers. Hippos and wildebeest strongly influence gross primary production and respiration, and the diets and assimilated nutrients of fishes and aquatic insects.&nbsp;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span><br style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none;\" /><span style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">This project has produced five published papers, three manuscripts in review, and four manuscripts in preparation for submission.

In Kenya, we employed a Kenyan field naturalist to help with our research, and we collaborated with a Kenyan postdoc. We taught short courses on Stable Isotopes and Food Web Ecology, and on River Nutrient Uptake and Metabolism. Both courses were taught in Kenya and included classroom lectures, field sampling, and a day of instruction in data analysis. We also taught a one-day course on open-source low-cost technologies for monitoring water resources to students and faculty at the University of Georgia.
