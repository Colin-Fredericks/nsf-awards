 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Arkansas, located in Fayetteville, AR, will support the training of 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-2016. The theme of the REU is sustainable management in ecosystem services. Students will select from a diverse group of field- and laboratory-based projects designed to integrate biogeochemical, hydrological, and ecological processes.  Additionally, students will engage in cultural enrichment activities through which they will explore the social and economic factors that influence ecosystem services. For example students will take a field trip to Tar creek in Pitcher, Oklahoma to witness first-hand the consequences of ecosystem destruction. Students will meet with experts from the Tribal Environmental Program and learn about how Tribal governments have developed explicit land use and land management policies that both support sustainability and reflect the unique cultural perspectives of the Tribe. Students will also participate in professional development seminars on the ethics of sustainability, responsible conduct of research, preparation for graduate school, and leadership development. At the end of the program, students will present their research results in oral and written form at the REU Student Symposium. Applicants will be selected based on academic record, background and experience, two letters of recommendation, and a short essay. Members of groups traditionally under-represented in science are strongly encouraged to apply. \r\n\r\nOne of the major goals of the REU is to provide Tribal communities, in particular, with a gateway to scientific educational and research opportunities. It is thus anticipated that students will present their results at regional and national scientific meetings. The effectiveness of the program will be assessed using the BIO REU common assessment tool \r\n\r\nStudents are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.bioreu.org, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Michelle Evans-White at mevanswh@uark.edu) or the co-PIs (Dr. Thad Scott at jts004@uark.edu; Dr. Marty Matlock at mmatlock@uark.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview: This REU program on Assessment and Sustainable Management of Ecosystem Services located at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, AR provided a research experience and career development for approximately 10 undergraduates per year (total cohort 2014-2016 size = 30).  This REU site matriculated our 9th summer cohort in 2016; 98 students have matriculated since 2008.  The program objective was to provide an integrated research experience focusing on sustainable management of ecosystem services for undergraduates working with federally-recognized Native American Tribal programs in Oklahoma, Nebraska, and South Dakota.  This experience integrated classroom and field research with Tribal management of ecosystem services.  Recruitment efforts focused on 1) Tribal educational programs from Native-serving two-year colleges, four-year universities, and research universities, 2) personal connections to the Tribal communities including service to aid the stewardship of Tribal environmental resources.  Tribal connections formed within these 9 years include the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Miami, Pawnee, and Quapaw and the Santee Sioux Nations in Oklahoma and Nebraska, respectively.  These tribal relationships serve as recruitment nodes for other undergraduate research programs. Our program incorporated structured lectures with laboratory and field research, and cultural enrichment activities that emphasize the process of science, the ethic of sustainability, and the cultural connections of ecology with tribal traditions. \n\nIntellectual Merit:  Ecosystem services are critical for economic, social and ecological sustainability.  The goal of this project is for students and faculty to explore sustainable management of ecosystem services across landscapes and cultural traditions and from the nanoparticle to biome scales.  Projects are selected by students and designed to integrate biogeochemical, hydrological, and ecological processes based upon the unique ecological management challenges of each Tribal locale.  Ecological services are a human construct; therefore, socio-economic considerations are also explored.  Field trips to the Tar Creek Superfund site near Quapaw and interaction with Native citizens via trips to museums and pow wows enhance the cultural relevance of the research experience.  Students also develop a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges of sustainable ecosystem management for tribal nations and US citizens.  Further, they learn how to think and work like a scientist and gain personal confidence in their scientific abilities and skill by the end of the program.\n\nGreater than 70 presentations were given at regional, national, or international meetings by cohorts 2008-2014.  All students completed a manuscript at the end of the program and 7 students are first authors or co-authors on published, peer-reviewed journal articles; two students are co-authors on articles submitted and in various stages of review by peers.  These communication activities illustrate intellectual contributions to the field.\n\nBroader Impact:  The Biology REU \"Assessment and Sustainable Management of Ecosystem Services\" has and will continue to support research experiences for under-served STEM communities and colleges and universities, particularly Native American students and institutions serving their communities.  Our goal was to recruit 50% of participants over nine years from Native American communities; we were able to exceed that goal (52%), and 74% of our participants were from minority groups.  In addition, we have been successful at recruiting women to the REU (57%).  Three high school students successfully participated in this program as well, demonstrating the flexibility of the format.  Approximately 10% of our students have entered a graduate program in a science, technology, engineering, or math field and 60% of those students belong to under-represented minority groups.  Five of our Native American students have completed degrees in a medical-related field and one has received a Clarks River National Refuge Internship.  This REU has been a gateway for Tribal communities to access the opportunities for education and program building from NSF and other agencies.  Project mentors have broad service ties to Tribal Nations facilitating not only mentorship of science to Tribal members but also data generation and technical advice for Tribal natural resource management. Additionally, project mentors have a strong record of scientific communication via local and national meeting presentations and peer-reviewed manuscripts with undergraduates as coauthors. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle A Evans-White"
