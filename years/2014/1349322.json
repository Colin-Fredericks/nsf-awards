 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fossils tell us about life on Earth over the past 3.5 billion years, but they can also help us predict what will happen to life in the future, as the Earth's environment continues to change. Museums hold millions of fossils used by researchers worldwide. Each individual collection of fossils, regardless of its size, is a vital piece of evidence, providing it is well maintained and documented. The fossil plant collection at the University of Iowa Paleontology Repository (UIPR) is no exception. Since 2005, scattered individual faculty research collections have been transferred from the UI Biology Department as faculty retire. These collections are now consolidated as a single unit under UIPR care. To preserve this new collection, specimens will be organized in museum-grade cabinets in storage media designed to mitigate deterioration, risks from pests, and high and/or fluctuating humidity. To make the collection accessible for research and education, specimen identifications will be verified and updated, specimens will be cataloged and photographed, and the digitized information made available on-line.  Earth and Environmental Science undergraduate students, Museum Studies interns, and McNair Scholars will receive training in collection management and will investigate new techniques for determining the locality from which specimens were collected. All training efforts will target students from groups underrepresented in STEM. Trainees will participate in sharing data on-line and will present papers at conferences under the mentorship of project staff. They will also participate in the outreach activities by assisting with the development of educational resources, based on the collection, to engage K-12 students and the public.\r\n\r\nThe specimens targeted by this project are currently stored in far from ideal conditions and, in the case of humidity-sensitive fossils, are actively deteriorating with pyrite disease. To halt this loss of scientific evidence and enable research access of this unique and irreplaceable material, the collection will be secured and rejuvenated by physical preservation in new museum storage according to modern standards and best practices, catalogued in the UIPR's Specify Collections Database, and digitized (high resolution photography). Data will be shared with on-line resources through initiatives such as iDigBio, the Paleobiology Database, GBIF, and the Iowa Digital Library. In the process of securing and preserving the collection, two research studies aimed at improving curatorial and management practices will be conducted. We will develop and test new curation methods for the care of pyritized material and coal ball acetate peels. In addition, we will investigate the geochemical \"fingerprinting\" of unprovenanced coal balls. The results of these studies will inform strategies used by the paleobotanical community. Much of the collection has been inaccessible to research since the 1980s. However, through this project collections will be made accessible to researchers and educators, including Sternberg's Cretaceous Dakota Formation Collection, critical to understanding the early evolution of angiosperms and their role in the changing structure of terrestrial ecosystems; Midwest coal ball collections, providing a unique record of Pennsylvanian floras critical for paleoecological reconstructions of ancient mire forests and fueling a rich array of phylogenetic hypotheses; the Pella Collection, a Pennsylvanian compression flora of significant research value due to its biogeographic, stratigraphic and lithographic context; and Macbride's 1893 Cretaceous Cycadeoid Collection, from the famous Minnekahta site, South Dakota. More information about the collection and its outreach program is available at http://geoscience.clas.uiowa.edu/paleo/.",

This collection of c. 20,000 specimens contained research material collected since the 1890s, including historic collections of cycadeoids from South Dakota, and Cretaceous leaves from Kansas, specimens cited in scientific publications and student theses, a large collection of coal ball concretions, and large and beautiful fossil plants from Iowa&rsquo;s Carboniferous coal swamp. At the time of the transfer, the UIPR was given emergency collection facilities in the basement of an adjacent building. Unfortunately, the space was not environmentally suitable for the paleobotany collection, which experienced attack from pests that ate labels with important data, and high relative humidity in summer that caused the coal ball concretions to deteriorate with pyrite decay. With no alternative space yet available, it was determined, through use of environmental monitoring in other areas, that installation and use of museum-grade cabinets would be the best method for preserving the fossils.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the UIPR and paleontology faculty in the UI Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences were awarded $196,751 by the National Science Foundation to renovate and revitalize the UI paleobotany collection and preserve it from further deterioration. The project aimed to rehouse the collection in protective cabinets; reorganize and properly document the collection (including computer database data entry and historical research); train Museum Studies and earth science undergraduates in collections management and collections-related research, and to provide outreach to the public through talks and educational materials.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, on being awarded the NSF grant, new space in the same building as the UIPR was made available for the collection. Twenty-nine metal, powder-coated cabinets with silicone gaskets, and drawers or reinforced pull-out shelves, were professionally installed. The cabinets were custom-built so that drawers are interchangeable with existing cabinets in the UIPR. The collection was prepared for transfer by making sure everything was labeled, and allocating specific space in the new cabinets on a drawer-by-drawer basis, to ensure that collections were kept with their documentation. A team of undergraduates moved the collection drawer by drawer, supervised by the UIPR Collections Manager. Each student was given a subsection of the collection to curate, starting with a curation assessment, then re-boxing into new specimen trays, organizing, numbering, marking, labeling, and entering data into a spreadsheet prior to database entry by the Collections Manager. Students were trained by a faculty member to photograph selected specimens using photo-stacking photography, and taught to process images for use. &nbsp;Students were encouraged to investigate their collections further through archive or paleontological research, and several students presented and/or co-authored posters and oral presentations at undergraduate research fairs and international conferences. One student attended the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections annual meeting in Florida.</p>\n<p>The new collection environment was monitored and data analyzed to determine if the new storage was providing the right environment for the moisture-sensitive collections. Two years&rsquo; worth of data were analyzed by students in a Museum Studies class and determined to be, on average, at or below the maximum-desired relative humidity of 45%. Potential at-risk specimens were photographed for bench-mark condition reports that will form the basis of an on-going monitoring procedure. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additional paleobotany collections that were already in the UIPR or in faculty offices prior to reorganization were amalgamated into the new storage and curated. An undergraduate student was awarded an Iowa Center for Research by Undergraduates (ICRU) Fellowship to curate the Quaternary Paleobotany collection with Emeritus Professor Richard Baker, enhancing the student&rsquo;s skill set for their archaeology degree. Another undergraduate was awarded an ICRU to work on rehousing coal balls and associated peels made from them. A third student received an ICRU to carry out research on the geochemical fingerprinting of coal balls using pXRF with an aim to identifying unprovenanced material. While no correlation was detected, the student gained valuable experience in specimen sampling, data gathering and data interpretation and was introduced to new techniques and procedures. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Accessibility to the collections and collections data has been greatly enhanced and data is in the process of being shared with the scientific community to enable future research.

Students and project PIs presented talks to local fossil groups and members of the public about these historical collections, as well as the project itself.</p>\n<p>In all, c. 20,000 fossil plant specimens and their associated information are now preserved for future research.
