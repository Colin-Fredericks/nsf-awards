 "awd_abstract_narration": "Explosive volcanic eruptions can disperse large amounts of pyroclastic material (tephra) over a wide geographic range. When preserved in the sedimentary record, these layers often serve as important stratigraphic marker beds that can be correlated spatially and temporally and related to the magnitude, source, and timing of eruptive activity. Sedimentological analysis of these deposits enable investigation of fundamental geologic questions related to arc generation, maintenance, and destruction processes. These include: (1) the rates, timing, frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, 2) identification of systematic patterns or variance in the time series of volcanic eruptions in terms of eruptive style, eruption magnitude, and repose periods, (3) assessing the completeness of the onshore record, especially if the marine record contains events not archived onshore, and (4) the nature of volcanism during the construction of a volcanic complex (magma evolution, production rate, eruptive styles, spatio-temporal distribution of eruptive vents and products, and importance of constructional vs. destructional processes). This information is essential to inform assessments of present-day hazards from active arc volcanoes. However, while constraining the long term eruptive history of a volcanic arc before the start of written historical records or beyond well-preserved subaerial tephra fall deposits (often representing only a few thousand years) is important, it is inherently difficult. \r\n\r\nKey to establishing an accurate geologic record is the development of a methodology capable of accurate, replicable, quantitative, and routine identification of these tephra layers in marine sediment sequences. Traditionally, tephrochronologic methods have been applied to visible tephra beds that are typically characterized by discrete, often dark-colored depositional layers. This limits tephrochronology studies to areas proximal to volcanic sources capable of producing voluminous deposits. Cryptotephras, fine layers of ash that may not be visible to the naked eye, may either represent smaller eruptions or eruptions from more distal sources. Identification of cryptotephra has now become essential in order to fully constrain the eruptive history of a volcanic center. Previously cryptotephra have been identified by a variety of time-intensive and destructive methods. The goal of this proposal is to document and characterize different sedimentary properties and semi-quantitatively identify the distribution and magnitude of cryptotephras in the sediment record at millimeter scale resolution from the surrounding sedimentary matrix using high resolution continuous scanning techniques. These techniques include: (1) magnetic measurements, particularly magnetic susceptibility; (2) reflectance spectroscopy; (3) core XRF scanning using the ITRAX system; and (4) Computer Tomography (CT) scans. While these four techniques have demonstrated their potential for the identification of tephra, they have rarely been used together, especially at the resolution required to document cryptotephra. Combining these three methodologies will provide a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the sedimentological, geochemical, magnetic, and spectral properties of sediment, all of which have independently been shown to vary substantially with the presence of tephra and also allow evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques for cryptotephra identification. The described techniques will be applied to IODP cores drilled off Montserrat to establish a long term tephrochronologic record of Montserrat and to better constrain the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc. This research will generate: (1) an expanded geologic history of the volcanic system driving Montserrat and an associated hazard assessment; (2) a better understanding of the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc; and (3) an evaluation of a set of techniques that can be used to rapidly identify cryptotephra layers in sediment sequences by non-destructive means.",

Improved assessment, prediction, and mitigation of these hazards relies on our ability to better understand these systems. By identifying the timing, frequency, and magnitude of tephra (erupted volcanic products) deposits in the geological record we can potentially gain insights into the frequency and cyclicity of eruptions, the potential for specific systems to generate catastrophic events, and the underlying cause of the hazards. The onshore record of tephra close to the volcanic center is frequently where the thickest deposits occur, however, this record is often incomplete as surface processes erode these deposits away soon after eruption.

These deposits are often smaller than those on land, and can be invisible to the naked eye (cryptotephra), however they are also the most complete records of volcanic histories. In this award we developed a method for rapidly and non-destructively identifying the presence of cryptotephra in the marine sediment record using a combination of techniques; magnetic susceptibility (sensitive to the iron-oxide content of tephra), visible/near-infrared spectroscopy (light reflectance bands sensitive to iron content of tephra), and X-ray fluorescence (sensitive to geochemical signatures of tephra) to discriminate between the tephra and the background ocean sediment. We applied this method to marine sediments recovered at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1396, a 153 m sediment record spanning approximately 4.5 million years (Myrs) located 36 km southwest of the Soufriere Hills volcanic complex on the island of Montserrat. Our approach involved three phases; Phase 1 was concerned with developing the method and testing that our techniques were sensitive to tephra and could discriminate them from the surrounding sediment. Phase 2 involved testing this method by measuring the sediments deposited over the last 250 thousand years (kyrs) at Site U1396 and comparing them to a known tephra record from the region.

We were able to show that tephra contains several times the magnetic susceptibility values of the background sediment, that tephra have a unique fingerprint in the reflectance data, and that geochemical properties can easily distinguish between biogenic carbonate in the background sediment and layers enriched in iron, titanium, and aluminum that contain tephra. For the last 250 kyrs we combined these rapidly and non-destructively acquired datasets to identify 29 individual visible tephra and cryptotephra in the sediment record.
