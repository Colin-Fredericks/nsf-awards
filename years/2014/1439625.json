 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an award for summer internship support.  HACU, a national, non-profit organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities through the organization?s National Internship Program (NIP).  Through NIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various federal government agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping students make informed career choices and solidify career objectives.  By partnering with public and private sector partners, HACU has been able to successfully place over 10,000 students in internships since NIP commenced in 1992.  In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  Internships create a unique opportunity to assist in the preparation and engagement of a future STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers of science and engineering research. By integrating research and education, the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the human capital infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education and research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThanks to our partnership with NSF, the HACU National Internship Program (HNIP) hosted 17 students in the summer and one student in the fall sessions of 2016.  Planning for the session began in September of 2015 with the opening of our summer application through our online portal.  HNIP staff marketed NSF opportunities through an array of outreach options.  We visited over 60 colleges and universities and talked to students, faculty, and administrators about NSF internships.  We also promoted the program through social media, several mass-mailings to member institutions, posted the internships on more than 1,200 job boards, and engaged program alumni at their respective higher education institutions.  Our efforts generated a pool of more than 1,500 eligible candidates for the summer term.  In conjunction with our recruitment efforts, HNIP event management staff began securing facilities and speakers for our summer intern orientation and professional development events. \n\n \n\nIn February of 2016, NSF provided HACU with a list of desired majors, technical skills, and project descriptions for the offices that were planning to host an intern.  Staff provided candidate pools matching the criteria.  NSF reviewed candidates and then selected the best qualified.  HNIP staff proceeded to make an offer of employment through our acceptance process.  Once the student completed his or her online internship agreement, HNIP program coordinators began making logistical arrangements such as housing, travel, and orientation.  Our finance team also began setting up the students in our payroll system.  Intern onboarding was completed at orientation.\n\n \n\nOur orientation was held on June 3, 2016, at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Arlington, VA.  Interns got a chance to hear from Ms. Lisa Pino, Special Counsel to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Ms. Pino is a HNIP alumna.  We also went over HNIP policies and procedures regarding housing, professional development, payroll, safety and security, and non-disclosure of confidential information.  HNIP alumni also held a panel focusing on how to make the most of the internship experience.  We capped orientation with a cultural enrichment activity at George Washington?s residence in Mt. Vernon. \n\n \n\nOver the course of the 10-week summer internship, interns were invited to participate in professional development activities focusing on preparing them to compete for federal government employment opportunities.  Interns and host agency supervisors and mentors were also asked to complete a number of monitoring and evaluation forms such as our work plan, mid-term intern performance evaluation, final intern performance evaluation, and intern and supervisor program evaluation.  Overall, the feedback was quite positive.  Interns excelled in many of the tasks assigned to them and interns and supervisors expressed high satisfaction in the administration of the program.  All NSF interns presented on research they conducted over the course of their internship or they provided a summary of the knowledge and exposure they obtained of their respective field while interning at NSF.  At the conclusion of the internship, our program held a farewell reception on Capitol Hill in which our keynote speaker, Mr. Moe Vela, former Director of Administration to Vice President Joe Biden. \n\n \n\nHNIP staff would like to thank NSF?s Program Manager, Dr. Sherrie Green, for serving as our liaison at NSF and coordinating with all the host mentors.  NSF interns and HNIP are grateful for the time and financial investment made in propelling the professional careers of our interns. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan Santeliz"
