Micelles can be composed of molecules made of two kinds of linked polymer chains, called block copolymers. Micelle behaviors can be finely tuned by changing the molecular structure of the block copolymers, and thus purposely designing the uptake amounts and release rates of interior compounds (such as drugs). This collaborative project explores the structure of block copolymer micelles as well as the block copolymer motions. By combining advanced analysis methods, the investigators will determine how the micelle-encapsulated compounds affect micelle structure and motions, and the exchange of compounds between micelles and their surroundings. This information will help scientists and engineers precisely formulate micelles for new applications in drug delivery, advanced lubrication, oil extraction, personal care products and other industries.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to systematically examine the effects of small molecule additives, co-solvents, and encapsulated drug molecules, on the structure and dynamics of block copolymer micelles. Targeted model additives (tetrahydrofuran and doxorubicin) will be employed to uncover the influence of such additives on micelle structure and dynamics. Small angle neutron scattering and multi-modal nuclear magnetic resonance will be used to investigate the effects of additive-polymer interactions on micelle equilibrium structure, polymer chain and micelle dynamics, and release rates of encapsulated compounds. The combination of these techniques will provide a comprehensive picture of key micellar dimensions and highly specific dynamical information including free unimer exchange kinetics, block and polymer chain dynamics, micelle diffusion processes, detailed solvent dynamics and exchange of additives in and out of micelles, and rates of fission and fusion.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMicelles are nanoscale self-assembled capsules, or \"nanocarriers,\" that can be customized for a variety of technological applications, which include carrying drug molecules to a specific location inside the body, cleaning up environmental spills and doing environmentally friendly industrial chemistry.  Micelles can be composed of molecules made of two kinds of linked polymer chains, called block copolymers.  We can finely tune micelle behaviors by changing the molecular structure of these block copolymers.  In this way, we can purposely design the holding capacity and release behaviors of compounds inside (such as drugs).  This collaborative project between University of Houston and Virginia Tech has explored the structure of block copolymer micelles as well as the motions of the copolymer chains and drug cargo molecules.  By combining advanced analysis techniques and basic theory, the investigators have built understanding of how the micelle-encapsulated cargo molecules affect micelle structure and motions, as well the exchange of molecules between micelles and their surroundings.  This information will help scientists and engineers precisely formulate micelles for new applications in pharmaceutical delivery, advanced lubrication, oil extraction, personal care products, and other industries.\n\nFigure 1 (at left) shows a schematic of block copolymer micelles, with hydrophobic \"core\" polymer chain sections (blue) and hydrophilic \"corona\" polymer chain sections (red).  These different polymer chain sections, which are bound together to form a block copolymer, can be tuned to carry molecular cargo (green) and release it under specified stimuli.  Figure 1 (at right) shows the molecular exchange and partitioning processes studied by this project.  How fast do cargo and polymer chains exchange in and out of such cargo nanocarriers?  What fraction of drug molecules and copolymer chains exist outside the micelles in free solution?  These are key unknowns that are impeding progress toward developing cargo-carrying (e.g., drug delivery) methods.  This UH and VT team has fruitfully combined advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) techniques to learn about the behaviors of these micelle and cargo molecules.\n\nFigure 1 here.\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of the block copolymer molecules and two example drug cargo molecules (HCT and IND) studied in this project.  The schematic at lower left depicts drug cargo molecules with populations of cargo in free solution (pdrug,solution) and inside the micelle cores (pdrug,micelle).  Pluronic block copolymers such as this are one of the relatively few clinically relevant (and commercially available) nanoscale agents used in drug delivery.  However, these systems are still poorly understood in terms of how the cargo affects the micelle structure and the partitioning (relative populations) of cargo in and out of the micelle.  The chart at lower right shows our precise quantitative results for partitioning of drugs.  Here, the percentage of drug inside the micelles (y axis) increases as you increase the amount of polymer in solution (x axis).  Furthermore, the more hydrophobic drug (IND) partitions more strongly into the micelle core.  The team has also begun study on the behavior of the major anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol) in micelles.\n\nFigure 2 here.\n\nAs part of this project, the Robertson and Madsen groups have so far published five (5) articles in strong scientific journals including Macromolecules and Soft Matter, with two (2) new articles recently submitted for publication and several more in preparation.  The team has disseminated this work in over 33 lectures and poster presentations at national/international conferences, at universities, and at corporate research labs.  Two (2) students have graduated with Ph.D.s from this project, with three (3) more contributing and currently proceeding toward their degrees.  Three (3) undergraduate researchers have participated in this research, with one having graduated and started a Ph.D.\n\nUnder this project, this team has also undertaken a program for encouraging scientific curiosity in children (K-12), through hands-on interactive activities.
