 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE) is proposed as a way to connect researchers at Minority serving institutions (MSIs), including their students, with each other and with the research community at large nationally funded labs in order to enable collaborations and sharing of facilities to support basic research.  The objective is to connect early career faculty from MSIs with successful national laboratory research teams and create a plan for their development into successful authors of competitive proposals and high impact research publications.\r\n\r\nNational laboratories such as the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the SLAC National Laboratory (formerly know as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) have access to specialized research equipment that is frequently too costly for any one educational institution to provide.  Through INCREASE, a consortium of institutions will become part of the Department of Energy facility user community, enhancing their efforts to establish research activities at their home institutions.  They will be able to utilize highly specialized and unique equipment in support of their research.  In turn the equipment will experience increased utilization as it is now accessible to a larger community of researchers at minority serving institutions.  Both graduate and undergraduate students at the institutions will also benefit through exposure and involvement in cutting edge research and direct research connections with federally funded laboratories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intent of this project was to continue the successful workshops for Minority Serving Institution (MSI) engineering faculty at DOE facilities using the model of the Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Education Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE).  Workshops were supported at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) in 2014 and at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, SLAC (Formely the Stanford Linear Accelerator), and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in 2015, and a tutorial supported at BNL in 2016.  These workshops exposed MSI faculty to lab facilities and the process for submitting user proposals.  In all cases, the MSI participants submitted short research summaries that werer shared withthe DOE lab so that the presentations and tours could be customized to the participants' interests.\n\nThe INCREASE team (the PI is the INCREASE chair) worked closely with the DOE facilities to arrange these meetings and emphasized researcher to researcher connections in order to help build strong user proposals.  The result of efforts such as this project has been a dramatic increase of MSI faculty users at BNL (from 2 to 54 over the past ten years), and INCREASE is working to continue to increase these numbers.  Most of the outcomes were at BNL, due to the number of workshops held there, but because of htis project, discussions have started to hold workshops at other DOE labs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric J Sheppard"
