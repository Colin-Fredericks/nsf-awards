 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview:\r\n\r\nIn this project, KMlabs will work with the currently active ERC in EUV Science and Technology\r\nin an effort to optimize and commercialize a tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet source\r\nbased on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), targeted specifically for 13.5 nm wavelength.\r\nThe end goal of this project is to produce a commercial prototype that can produce efficient\r\n13.5 nm light to support EUV lithography tool development. Such a small-scale laser source\r\ncan be used for a variety of lithography support applications including optics characterization,\r\nmetrology, and mask inspection, which can help to ensure the rapid deployment of this critical\r\ntechnology, currently planned for ~2015.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nCU-Boulder, as a part of the EUV ERC, has been developing coherent EUV technology for more\r\nthan a decade. Their recent work has led to a more comprehensive understanding of how to optimize\r\nthe HHG upconversion process to generate EUV or x-ray light at a particular target wavelength.\r\nThis for the first time allows us to identify specific approaches that may allow for significant\r\n(up to 3 orders of magnitude) increases in coherent flux capability at 13 nm.\r\nKMlabs has proven track of record for successfully commercializing cutting edge scientific\r\nresults?for example the eXtreme Ultraviolet Ultrafast Source (XUUS), introduced in 2009. The\r\nXUUS is a broadband coherent ultrafast EUV source optimized to generate 30 nm light, and >15\r\nXUUS setups have been delivered to research customers worldwide. Optimization of this source\r\nfor 13 nm will make it possible to address a much greater range of industry needs. We have\r\nidentified three possible approaches for optimizing 13 nm flux. In this project we plan to\r\nperform a direct comparative evaluation of these approaches. Based on our physical understanding,\r\nwe believe we can determine the global optimum for HHG conversion to 13 nm.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nKMlabs and the EUV ERC will each leverage their technical strengths, and this project will\r\nserve to leverage the impact of EUV ERC technology on the science and technology enterprise.\r\nThe rapid advance of microelectronics technology, as described by Moore?s law, has been a\r\nmajor driver of the global economy. This advance has been driven primarily by progress in\r\nlithography that allows for shrinking feature size. Current visible wavelength tools are straining\r\nagainst fundamental limits, and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors has\r\nbeen anticipated a shift to EUV lithography for quite some time. The timeline for EUV had\r\nrepeatedly experienced delays because the use of EUV light, which is strongly absorbed by\r\nall materials, is radically more difficult to work with than visible/UV.\r\nNevertheless, recent progress in 13 nm EUV light sources for lithographic exposure has made\r\nits adoption for the 22 nm node-size in the next generation computer chips a high priority.\r\nEUV lithography remains untested at the systems and large-scale production level, with many\r\nunknowns. Improved capabilities for mask defect detection and characterization, for characterizing\r\noptics degradation with long-term use, and for tasks such as alignment and quality control,\r\ncan all benefit from a usable tabletop at-wavelength laser source. An HHG-based coherent 13\r\nnm EUV light source is a relatively low cost, small-scale, contamination-free coherent source\r\nsuitable for industrial application, and which has already been proven to enable new capabilities\r\nsuch as coherent diffractive EUV imaging with near-wavelength resolution, and for materials\r\ncharacterization. KMlabs plans to build on this proposed work in future with development of\r\nreflectometer/ellipsometer instruments, as well as an inspection microscope for EUV lithography\r\napplications.",
