Kotov\r\nProposal Number:  1403777\r\nInstitution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor\r\n\r\nTitle: Detection of Protein Misfolding Using Nanorod Assemblies\r\n\r\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Parkinson's or Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases (CJD) pose a great challenge for our society because of their devastating impact on patients, their relatives, and health system.   One of the problems is that these diseases do not induce any immunological response and thus, traditional diagnostics methods based on antibody detection cannot be used. New methods of diagnostics that are highly sensitive and selective are required.  In the future, novel tools developed during this proposal may enable diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe common cause of these diseases is self-assembly of the nanoscale biological molecules - amyloid peptides and proteins - into larger structures represented by oligomers and micrometer scale fibers. We shall develop a new diagnostics technique utilizing this property of the disease agents that will be revealed in their interactions with inorganic nanoscale particles.  The project will involve evaluation of two methods of self-assembled structures of amyloid peptides and proteins.  The first one will take advantage of self-assembly of uniform gold nanorods into large supercrystals and our ability to make large patterns with them.  Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) will be the key spectroscopic technique that would allow us to differentiate benign and misfolded peptides.  The second diagnostics method will take advantage of chirality of nanorod pairs that can rotate the polarization of light.  Amyloid peptides and other species will change the twisting angle between the nanorods that can be detected by the circular dichroism spectroscopy. Additionally, complete theoretical analysis and characterization of their photonic properties of nanorod assemblies with amyloid peptides will be carried out.   The expected impact will range from the understanding of self-organization of nanorods and peptides into larger mesoscale structures.  We also expect to test the proof-of-concept techniques to detect the misfolded disease agents in saliva and urine.",

A new method of detection of not only amyloid peptides but other diseases indicators, such as prostate specific antigen, were found.   The detection limit exceeds that of the best NP-based techniques by ca two times.  The method was also extended to detection of the siRNA specific to cancer with the first example of their successful identification in blood.\n\nThe first steps toward translation of these findings to industry are made in the framework of the Coulter translational project application at the University of Michigan.  The project is aimed of utilization the SERS and chiroplasmonic methods to rapidly &ndash;within 30 min- detect infections in septic patients.
