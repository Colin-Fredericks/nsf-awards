 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kentucky State University (KSU)'s Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Targeted Infusion project supports science, technology, engineering and technology (STEM) interventions in support of a minor degree program in Geoscience.  This STEM education project aims to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups by strengthening STEM skills at the precollege and undergraduate levels in this discipline.  The project's objectives are to: (1) develop curricula for a minor at the undergraduate level; (2) develop a Summer Bridge Program for college preparation and STEM education; and (3) enhance geoscience teaching, learning, and research pedagogy and infrastructure using cyber-learning resources and techniques. Major activities include development of a sequence of geoscience courses; design of effective recruitment tools and geoscience career awareness materials; development of research projects for undergraduate and high school students to strengthen curricula, teaching capability, laboratory, cyber-learning-based teaching, learning, and research. Faculty development activities include engagement in integrating research, technology, and innovative pedagogy in curricula with an emphasis on learning science through many multidisciplinary activities via cyber technology- and visualization-based participatory learning modules.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes of this three-year project include the availability of a sequence of three new courses for students who intend to minor in geosciences; an enhanced Geospatial Laboratory with a spatial database, software, and other innovative and cyber-teaching and\r\nresearch resources; increased networks with high schools, state and federal agencies and other universities for recruitment and teaching; increased cross-program coordination at KSU for recruitment, management of minor and caption research projects; and effective advising and\r\ntimely graduation of students. Annual assessment and evaluation of project activities and impacts will be evaluated every\r\nyear. \r\n\r\nThe overall impacts of the project enhance quality teaching, innovative curricula and research, and increased production of competitive underrepresented students in the STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nOver the 36-month duration of the project, more than 100 students will be impacted by the project's implementation.  Dissemination efforts will address successful practices in attracting, recruiting and retaining underrepresented minority students in geoscience and environmental science fields at minority-serving institutions.",
