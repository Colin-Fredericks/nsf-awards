 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis Small-Business ERC Collaborative Opportunity transitioning agile broadband\r\ntransmitter for integrated access networks to market will address the challenge of achieving high\r\nbandwidth (100+ Gb/s), low power, low cost wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical\r\ncommunications links of distances up to 2 km for applications such as data centers and\r\naggregation networks. These links are necessary for next generation data center and\r\nsupercomputing applications that are a focus of the CIAN ERC?s research.\r\nSpecifically, this project will improve the lasers in these systems, which drive much of\r\nthe cost, performance, and power requirements for the links, to meet current commercial\r\nspecifications. The tunable VCSELs offer a 10X reduction in power and cost over conventional\r\nsolutions and enable high bandwidth links within data centers that not economically feasible with\r\ncurrent technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a drastic reduction in the cost\r\nand energy requirements of optical links inside of data centers and supercomputers. Companies\r\nsuch as Google, Microsoft and other large data-centric companies have been clamoring for this\r\ntype of product in the last year to maintain the rate of growth in their data center facilities.\r\nPresent WDM laser array solutions using DFB lasers require 10X the power and 10X the cost of\r\na VCSEL-based approach and are not economically feasible. Present 850-nm VCSEL-based\r\nlinks, on the other hand, cannot be made into a WDM source without power-hungry TEC coolers\r\ndue to their lack of precise, gridded, wavelength control, limiting the overall link speed. Using a\r\n1550 nm tunable VCSEL solves both the problem of gridded wavelength control and allows the\r\nuse of low cost single mode fiber and the developed infrastructure for 1550 nm WDM optical\r\nlinks. The realization of tunable VCSELs in WDM systems will result in a 10X reduction in\r\nboth cost and energy requirements in high-speed optical links for data centers, enabling the\r\nfurther scaling of computational power for next generation data center and supercomputer\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nBesides the technological impact, this collaboration program will offer CIAN students\r\ninsight and experience with the real world commercial product development process. The\r\nstudents will be testing and giving feedback into the product development process, enhancing\r\ntheir educational experience. The enhanced capabilities of the VCSELs will enable new\r\napplications and enhance CIAN in it?s mission of supporting transparency wherever possible\r\nwith flexible wavelength conversion and optical switches, and supporting dynamically\r\nreconfigurable heterogeneous traffic in the network.",
