The goals of LEO are to permit controlled study of land surface fluxes of water, energy and carbon at the hillslope scale where key observables are monitored at sub-meter scales across a moderately complex landscape.  The observed spatial and temporal variability of fluxes and their relationship and feedbacks to controlled and observed climatic parameters would then be used to inform improved models of land-surface water, energy and carbon cycling processes at larger watershed, continental and even global scales.\r\n\r\nLEO consists of three replicated 340 m2 convergent experimental watershed mesocosms constructed inside a 5,000 m2 environmentally controlled facility at B2.  The LEO mesocosms have as their basic design, three, 30 m length, 12 m width, 1 m depth, sloped (approximately 10 degrees from horizontal) steel tanks that have been filled with a grain size homogenized basaltic tephra as a starting soil. The tanks have as part of their frame design, arrays of distributed load cells that permit precise determination of weight changes across the tanks and located above the surface of the tanks are precipitation simulation systems that are rate controllable and can be varied across the surface of the soil tanks.  An aspect of the design is that overland flow and erosion is specifically prevented by subsurface pumping and removal of water as the soil horizon saturates ? LEO is not designed for erosion process studies.  The tanks are densely arrayed with sampling ports for drawing pore waters and gases and numerous sensor modalities have already been added including soil moisture content probes, soil temperature sensors, soil water potential sensors, soil water samplers, soil gas samplers, CO2 sensors, surface heat flux plates, electrical resistivity tomography probes, piezometers, and water flow and drainage flowmeters.  The initial plan calls for 1-2 years of studies of the experimental landscapes devoid of vascular plants followed by the planting of an array of vascular plant types to allow for study of the co-evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological systems in the mesocosms and their influence on the land-atmosphere exchanges of water, energy and carbon.\r\n\r\n***",

The cameras are installed inside the box such that they can swipe left to right in order to observe each location on the slope, allowing for precise repeat monitoring of each point on the landscape. The technical capabilities of the cameras allow us to measure bare soil evaporation (a land surface flux that is extremely difficult to quantify otherwise), as well as plant transpiration and photosynthesis.

Assessing the impact of increasing temperatures and changing precipitation regimes on our ecosystems heavily relies on our ability to monitor and model changes in ecosystem response. At the same time, understanding how ecosystem changes feed back to the climate system greatly depends on our capability of measuring and modeling turbulent flux exchanges of energy, water, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurately quantifying these land surface turbulent fluxes at hillslope and small catchment scales is challenging. This is due to difficulties in closing energy and mass balances at such scales, as well as heterogeneities that exist at larger spatial scales (tens to hundreds of meters) as a result of small-scale (&lt; 1 meter) variations in soil moisture, soil and vegetation characteristics (such as hydraulic conductivity, leaf area index (LAI), root density, and albedo), and energy distribution. The current generation of land surface models (LSMs) for use in Earth System Models (ESMs) operate at even larger spatial scales (10 &ndash; 100 km) due to lack of sufficient computing power and data availability of land surface characteristics. Improving our understanding of how small-scale variations in land surface properties and states affect large-scale turbulent fluxes is urgently needed to improve existing parameterizations adopted in LSMs. For this purpose, the observational facilities created by this grant will play a critical role in predicting ecosystem changes under climate change.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/18/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Troch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558762086_Project_Outcomes_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558762086_Project_Outcomes_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558762086_Project_Outcomes_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Artist impression of the Landscape Evolution Observatory at Biosphere 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Adams</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Troch</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558828439_Project_Outcomes_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558828439_Project_Outcomes_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558828439_Project_Outcomes_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Panoramic view of the rail systems being installed in the center and west bay of the Landscape Evolution Observatory</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nate Abramson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Troch</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558897845_Project_Outcomes_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558897845_Project_Outcomes_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1340912/1340912_10329312_1471558897845_Project_Outcomes_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Front view of cameras installed in temperature-controlled box</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Sibayan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;A&nbsp;Troch</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhere does water go when it rains? The answer is: it depends.  Exactly how rainfall gets partitioned between evaporation, infiltration into soils and aquifers, and discharge into streams depends on the unique features of the climate and landscape where it falls.  We are utilizing a groundbreaking new experimental infrastructure to better understand how landscapes store and transmit water; it?s called the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO).\n\n \n\nLEO includes three artificial landscapes constructed inside the University of Arizona?s Biosphere 2.  Each landscape consists of over one million pounds of loamy sand packed to a depth of 3.3 feet within a supporting structure.  Each landscape surface covers more than 3,500 square feet and has a 10&deg; slope.  The downslope portion converges into a gully, creating similar topography as exists in upland landscapes in the southwestern US.  The landscapes have a bare-soil surface, though in years to come they will be colonized by microorganisms and plants. \n\n \n\nWhile we can directly measure the amount of water available in a river channel or aquifer, those measurements alone don?t tell us much about why that amount varies over time.  LEO is designed to advance our knowledge of the physical and biological processes occurring at the land surface that control those fluctuations.  We can leverage the climate control capabilities inside Biosphere 2, and an engineered irrigation system, to create different scenarios of rainfall and air temperature and evaluate how those conditions affect the movement of water within soil, plants, and the atmosphere.  Each landscape is equipped with more than 1800 sensors and sampling devices that enable more precise monitoring of water than would ever be possible in a natural landscape.\n\n \n\nFunding from the Instrumentation and Facilities program of the National Science Foundation allowed for the purchase and installation of advanced camera systems to remotely observe changing land surface conditions of the three landscapes.
