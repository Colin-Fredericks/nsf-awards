 "awd_abstract_narration": "The INFORMS Computing Society NSF Student Poster Session is proposed to be held at the 2015 INFORMS Computing Society (ICS) Conference, which would be the first student poster session for the regularly-held ICS conference. This poster session is set up to encourage graduate students to interact with faculty, industry and fellow students by giving a technical poster presentation on a research project useful to operations research computing and related areas.  The student poster session encourages students to engage in high quality, sound, and original research, strengthen their comprehension of research and research methods, and provide an opportunity for students to develop their effective writing and communication skills for the dissemination of research information, and become creative and self-reliant lifelong consumers of the knowledge. As such, the students will acquire necessary professional development skills to become an integral part of the operations research and computing profession. \r\n\r\nThe experience gained through the professional development, the presentation of research, and the interaction with senior professionals in the field will positively affect the students' persistence to obtain a doctoral degree and practice in related fields.  The abstracts of accepted posters together with the abstracts for other presentations will be published on the conference website. Students will also have the option to submit a paper to be reviewed for inclusions in the conference proceedings. If successful, the efforts supported by this grant will increase the number and diversity of operations research and computing professionals. The interaction of the students with known professionals in the field along with other students will assist in developing a network of colleagues to provide guidance to advance their careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 14th INFORMS Computing Society (ICS) Conference was held in Richmond, Virginia at the Omni Hotel from January 11-13, 2015.  The ICS membership includes many of the leaders in computational operations research.  The software and algorithms produced by researchers in this field result in better modeling capabilities and resource management.  The goal of this grant was to engage students to pursue advanced investigations in this area by enhancing their opportunity to attend the conference.  The students had the opportunity to present their research in a poster session and meet leading researchers in an intimate setting.\n\nThere were 240 attendees at the conference, including 94 students.  We believe this was the largest ICS Conference ever by attendance.   This grant directly supported student travel for participation in the Student Poster Session.  Ten students received awards of up to $500.  There were a total of 22 posters presented. \n\nThe poster session was held on the first evening of the conference from 6:30-8:00pm on Sunday, January 11th, 2015.  Students were asked to have their posters set up before noon and to leave them up for the following day.  The posters remained in the main lobby of the hotel meeting area where conference attendees could easily view them during coffee breaks.\nThe poster session was held between the ICS business meeting and the COIN OR business meeting, and was well-attended, attracting most of the conference attendees.  \n\nOther conference events attracted and engaged students.   A cohort of approximately 10 students were brought each day by Professor Rex Kincaid  and Professor Larry Leemis from William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia to the conference in Richmond.  On the day before the conference, COIN-Fest was held, a hands-on guide to open source operations research software.  The workshop was attended by more than 40, including many local students from Virginia Commonwealth University and other students attending the conference.  The materials from the workshop are available online and are linked from the conference website http://go.vcu.edu/ics2015.\n\n\nDavid Applegate (AT&amp;T Research),  George Nemhauser (Georgia Tech), and Richard Stallman (Free Software Foundation) gave plenary talks.  Karla Hoffman (George Mason University) and Suvrajeet Sen (University of Southern California) gave advanced tutorials.  \n\nThere were 185 presentations organized into seven parallel tracks over the two and one half days.  Many of the presentations were given by advanced graduate students.\n\nA conference proceedings volume with 19 papers was published by INFORMS.   The conference proceedings papers are available as a printed volume and also for free online open access at https://www.informs.org/Find-Research-Publications/Multimedia-Books/ICS-Proceedings/2015-Conference-Volume. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James P Brooks"
