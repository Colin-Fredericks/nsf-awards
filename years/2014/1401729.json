 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics and physical sciences. The Fellows are expected to be leaders of the nation's scientific workforce of the future. This fellowship to Tanya Cheeke supports a research and training plan that integrates microbial ecology and bioinformatics to characterize the role of soil microbes in the success or failure of native plant establishment in disturbed ecosystems. Understanding the fundamental differences in soil microbial communities in disturbed ecosystems is vitally important for informing restoration efforts, especially in areas such as prairies where plant-soil feedbacks have altered the native soil microbial community. The host institution for this fellowship is Indiana University and the sponsoring scientists are James Bever (Department of Biology) and Yuzhen Ye (School of Informatics and Computing).  The fellowship provides for a unique collaboration to provide interdisciplinary research training for the Fellow.  Educational outreach is directed to a diverse group of undergraduate students who will gain practical research skills in molecular biology and restoration ecology.\r\n\r\nThis study tests novel methods of improving native plant establishment in disturbed ecosystems and has broad applications in conservation biology and restoration ecology. Specifically, the research evaluates the efficacy of re-introducing native soil organisms, for example, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, to improve native prairie plant establishment in tall fescue dominated grasslands. The overall goal is to understand the mechanisms that drive monotypic dominance in disturbed landscapes and to evaluate the role of plant-soil feedbacks in improving, maintaining, or limiting plant community diversity in disturbed systems. Research results are being shared with key stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers, conservationists, and policy makers through public lectures and by providing a research summary to local extension agents upon completion of the project.",

Although efforts to restore native tallgrass prairies are increasing, non-native species are often aggressive competitors that are difficult to remove or control. This is because some invasive plants have competitive strategies (e.g. chemical compounds, low responsiveness to soil microbes) or life history traits (e.g. dense sod that prevents native seedling establishment) that facilitate their own dominance in a landscape, creating a feedback loop that prevents native plants from re-establishing. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that drive biological invasions and to investigate the role of invasive plants in altering biotic and abiotic factors in the soil ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This study focuses on the restoration of grasslands dominated by non-native smooth brome (<em>Bromus inermis</em>) and evaluates the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, a key soil microbial group, in the success or failure of native plant establishment in disturbed ecosystems. Results from this work demonstrate that native prairie plants are highly dependent on AM fungi and have difficulty establishing in areas where the soil community has been disrupted. In contrast, smooth brome and other non-native plants have low responsiveness to AM fungi, which can positively influence their own dominance in the landscape. In a prairie restoration field experiment, plots inoculated with whole prairie soil (containing a variety of native soil organisms) or AM fungi isolated from prairies had higher species richness of desirable native plants compared to uninoculated plots. Native prairie plant survival and growth was also significantly higher in field plots inoculated with native soil microbes. Collectively, our work shows that re-establishing key groups of soil microbes at the time of plant community restoration efforts improves the success of native plants establishing in disturbed ecosystems.<strong> </strong>In addition to informing restoration management strategies, this work adds to our understanding of the different factors that regulate diversity in plant communities, linking microbial genetic diversity to ecosystem function.</p>\n<p>There are several broader impacts to this research. This project provided interdisciplinary research training for 11 undergraduate assistants, including a McNair Scholar.
