 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multivariate linear regression (MLR) is an approach to understand relationships between predictors and responses, and it is broadly applied for estimation or prediction in many disciplines.  With the development of modern technology, it is possible to measure more and more characteristics and potential factors for a subject, resulting in very large data sets in many contemporary problems.  In such situations, MLR is inefficient because it fails to distinguish between information that is useful to the scientific goal and a likely overabundance of irrelevant information that can obscure the useful information. The envelope model is a new area in statistics.  By identifying the irrelevant information, the envelope analysis is based on the useful information only and is therefore more efficient.  In this project, new directions will be explored to broaden the applicability of the envelope models, especially the applicability in public health and medical sciences. Students involved in the project will have opportunities to interact with faculty from other disciplines, and gain crucial experience on how to operate across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  Software will be developed to make the new methodologies available to the statistical community.  \r\n\r\nThis project will develop new models that enrich the area of envelopes, making the envelope method more flexible and adaptive to more practical problems.  For example, prior information is often available from medical history, past experience and other sources, the Bayesian envelope model will enable investigators to incorporate prior information in the analysis. As medical studies often involve missing data, envelope models that handle missing data will be studied.  While most existing variable selection methods are applied to the predictors, sparse envelope model focuses on identifying inactive individual responses, leading to more efficient and interpretable results.  The project connects the envelope model with several branches in statistics, including Bayesian analysis, Markov chain Monte Carlo, variable selection and covariance estimation, which will generate new theory, methods and algorithms in the area of envelope models.",

It has been shown in the literature that the envelope model is more efficient than standard methods and the efficiency gains can be substantial.  However, the scope of envelope model was largely limited in the context of standard linear regression and it also has some restrictions on the data structure.\n\nThe main result of this project is to broaden the applicability of the envelope model by deriving a class of different envelope models including groupwise envelope model, Bayesian envelope model, sparse envelope model and envelope quantile regression model.  The groupwise envelope model allows for heteroscedastic error structures for different groups.  It is motivated by a study on the associations between genetic variants and brain imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer patients.  It is known that brain structure of males and females is different.  The groupwise envelope model is desired to incorporate such group information.  Bayesian analysis allows investigators to combine prior information and current data to make better decisions.  Bayesian envelope model is constructed such that prior information about the immaterial information can be incorporated in the analysis of the envelope model.  The sparse envelope model is developed to perform variable selection and extends the applicability of the envelope model to the high-dimensional situation, where we have a large number of variables to study but only have a few samples.  The quantile regression is used when researchers are interested in studying how predictors are associated with certain quantiles of the response variable, for example, how a sale tax increase affects high and low income groups. The envelope quantile regression model is developed to achieve an efficient estimation of the model parameters, which can lead to a more accurate prediction.\n\nAnother result of this project is the development of a class of new partial least squares methods.  Partial least squares is an alternative to ordinary least squares for estimation in linear regression. It is the dominant method in chemometrics and is now widely used in many other applied scientific disciplines such as behavioral sciences, food sciences, medicine, psychology, and social sciences. It is known that partial least squares often has superior prediction performances compared to ordinary least squares, especially in high-dimensional settings.  In this project, many new methods including scale-invariant partial least squares, sparse partial least squares and Bayesian partial least squares are developed based on a connection of partial least squares with envelope models.  These methods enrich the theory and applications of partial least squares. \n\nIn addition, a new algorithm for computing estimators from envelope modes is developed.  To identify the material and immaterial information, the existing method requires an optimization on Grassmann manifolds, which can be slow in sizable problems.  The new algorithm developed in this project converts the Grassmann optimization problem to a standard optimization problem via reparameterization.  Thus it is much faster than the existing algorithm.   Open-source software for computing the envelope estimators based on this algorithm has been developed and posted online. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhihua Su"
