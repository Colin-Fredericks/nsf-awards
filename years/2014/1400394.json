 "awd_abstract_narration": "Topology optimization is a computational process for designing structures and materials that meet some optimality criteria, e.g. minimum weight or maximum stiffness. The technique has gained significant traction among design engineers and has been shown to identify designs where efficient use of materials resulted in unprecedented performance. The objective of this research is to develop a new topology optimization framework capable of designing structural topologies that are robust in the presence of geometric uncertainties. Accounting for dimensional uncertainties in the optimization process is of paramount importance in many engineering applications, for example in processes involving extreme miniaturization of the material architecture, where the physical realization of the optimal design is generally subjected to significant tolerances. The application of this research to state-of-the-art commercially available manufacturing technologies, including additive manufacturing, will greatly impact the development of architected cellular materials and promote technology transfer. Results of this research will be incorporated into graduate courses within the Engineering and Applied Science PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. This project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students at UMass Dartmouth (where many students are first generation college students), the University of California, Irvine and Johns Hopkins University.\r\n\r\nThis research will result in a new design optimization framework capable of designing structural topologies that are robust in the presence of geometric uncertainties. A number of strategies will be explored based on novel integration of stochastic analysis and uncertainty representation and propagation methods with efficient topology optimization techniques and inverse homogenization-based material design frameworks. Stochastic topology optimization frameworks for both continuum and discrete structures will be developed where flaw-tolerance is achieved through careful incorporation of nodal and boundary uncertainties. Novel methodologies for the characterization and representation of geometric uncertainties are planned, including an experimental effort aimed at carefully measuring typical geometric flaws in architected cellular materials fabricated with state-of-the-art additive manufacturing techniques, and quantifying their impact on the statistical variations of the macroscopic mechanical properties. This experimental investigation will feed into the development of a topology optimization framework centered on flaw-tolerance.",

Robust performance refers to performance metrics, such as stiffness and strength, that are relatively insensitive to fabrication flaws, typically quantified and assessed via statistics of mean value of the metric, standard deviation of the metric, and/or probability of failure.  The new design optimization methods are based on topology optimization, a systematic approach to optimizing the distribution of materials in space to form a \"structure\".

The developed approaches integrate methods from gradient-based optimization, solid mechanics, and uncertainty quantification to design lightweight materials and ultimately components that are robust, stiff and strong. This is in contrast to the more traditional framework to development that has largely been based on trial-and-error design and experimental testing, a time-consuming and expensive approach.\n\n \n\nBoth truss-like and continuum (monolithic solid) geometric representations were considered to enable application of the design methodology to very low density cellular materials and structures, as well as more general cellular materials and components with larger load carrying requirements.   Specific advancements made during the research program included creating novel representations of geometric uncertainties and imperfections that may arise due to manufacturing flaws, new approaches to manufacturing constraints to ensure designed solutions are directly manufacturable (without requiring manual geometric repairs by designers), new methods for optimizing the nonlinear response of cellular materials to (for example) maximize energy absorption in materials, and new methods for optimizing the dynamic response of components and structures under random excitations (for example) to minimize motion under random vibrations or a seismic event.  Additionally, a subset of the developed methods were found to be applicable to the design of bandgap materials that are capable of preventing transmission of elastic or acoustic waves occurring over a range of frequencies.\n\n \n\nNew design optimization methods such as those developed herein are needed to fully leverage the potential of manufacturing technologies and enable creation of manufacturable materials and components that are robust and thus offer substantially improved stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios.
