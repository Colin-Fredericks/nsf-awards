 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the \"Neolithic Revolution\" - the domestication of plants and animals - a fundamental change occurred in the relationship  between humans and the environment in which they lived. A central goal of this research is to gain insight into the forces which underlie this process.\r\nUnder athe direction of Dr. Gayle Fritz, Natalie Mueller will conduct doctoral dissertation research. From c. 1000 BCE - 1400 CE, a suite of native seed crops known as the Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC) was cultivated in Eastern North America (ENA).  Previous studies have demonstrated that several of these crops were domesticated based on morphological changes such as seed shape, size, seed or fruit coat thickness, and texture. Two members of the EAC, sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus) and acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo var. ovifera), are still familiar foods, but the other members of the crop complex have not been cultivated for several hundred years.  These lost crops include two domesticated plants: Chenopodium berlandieri  ssp. jonesianum, which is a native relative of quinoa; and a species of marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa). For one important ancient crop, knotweed (Polygonum sp.), complex and variable seed morphology has so far stymied efforts to establish criteria for domestication. This case study will develop new morphometric methods to examine changes in the morphology of knotweed and determine whether or not it was domesticated.   \r\nMorphological changes in domesticated plants are the result of human selection and ecosystem engineering.  Past agricultural practices can be inferred from the modifications they caused in plants and animals. This study will use multivariate and spatial techniques to uncover correlations between morphological changes in knotweed and environmental, archaeological, and temporal factors. These correlations will be used to reconstruct forgotten agricultural practices.  Recovering the details of agricultural economies in ENA is particularly interesting because early farmers in this region, while developing a highly productive agricultural system, did not follow the archetypal Neolithic Revolution trajectory towards institutionalized social stratification and urbanism.  This project uses a case study of one important crop to gain new insights into the development of this unique agricultural economy, while enhancing understanding of a plant that was once an important crop in ENA.  In an era when new seed crops are rapidly being developed, this study is a first step to assessing its potential usefulness to modern society.\r\nThis research will also provide several concrete benefits to professional archaeologists and students.  This project will generate a web database of integrated archaeological and botanical data from publications and collections that are currently scattered in inaccessible reports. The methods developed in the course of this project will also be used as teaching tools.  Opportunities to participate in this research will be built into a new multidisciplinary course: Historical Ecology of North America. The new methods developed for using digital photography and morphometrics to study domestication will enrich Washington University's Paleoethnobotany Laboratory, where students and faculty are involved in studying the origins of agriculture around the world.  This methodology will also be integrated into a course on microscopy for archaeologists.  The proposed research is part of a larger movement to historicize pre-Columbian America.  The dissemination of this research will be directed towards the goal of increasing public and academic awareness of ENA as a region with a long and rich pre-colonial history that is relevant to an understanding of global processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research was to rediscover one of eastern North America?s lost crops.  Thousands of years ago, Native Americans cultivated native annual plants in the Midwest for grain, long before maize and beans arrived from Mexico.  By the time of contact with Europeans, these crops had largely fallen out of cultivation and were forgotten for centuries.  They have been rediscovered through the analysis of plant remains from archaeological sites.  Some of these crops were domesticated by ancient farmers &ndash; that is, they were altered from their wild state, both physically and genetically, by human selection.  My research shows that erect knotweed (Polygonum erectum L.) can be added to the list of plants domesticated in eastern North America by Native American farmers.  Erect knotweed was cultivated beginning in the Early Woodland period, more than two thousand years ago.  By the Mississippian period, 1000-600 years ago, archaeological assemblages of knotweed fruits from sites like Whitney Bluff, AR, and Hill Creek, IL, are outside the range of variation found in any modern native species.  They are larger, more homogenous at the population level, and have thinner inedible fruit coats than their wild relatives. \n\nThe morphology of Mississippian erect knotweed fruits can tell us a lot about the hundreds of years of interaction between farmers and plants that preceded them, but only if we understand how these little fruits germinate, grow, and reproduce themselves.  I collected data on where erect knotweed grows using both field surveys and herbarium specimens.  I discovered that this lost crop has become very rare.  It was once common in human disturbed environments such as farm yards, fairgrounds, and dirt roads, but it is being out-competed by its invasive Eurasian cousin, prostrate knotweed. It can still be found in out-of-the-way locations, such as organic farms and wildlife reserves protected from herbicide spraying, but it badly needs conservation.  By making collections from wild plants, I was able to quantify natural variability in fruit production for comparison with the archaeological record.  Then I carefully sorted the seeds I harvested under a microscope, separating them into different categories based on size and shape, and planted these in batches in Washington University?s greenhouse.  I now have data on how seed size and shape effect germination rates, early growth, and reproductive output, that will allow me to model how domestication occurred.  I also have a seed bank collected from wild populations in three states that is being subjected to genetic analysis.  This modern DNA will soon be compared with ancient DNA from archaeological specimens to shed more light on how erect knotweed changed through its interaction with people.  Most importantly, my seed bank can provide a basis for species conservation and what I like to think of as lost crop revival, as greenhouse cultivation continues.  \n\nFor this project, I photographed and analyzed 1100 individual archaeological fruits and over 500 modern and historical fruits spanning a period of almost 3000 years.  The micro-photographs I took are artifacts &ndash; just like pieces of pottery or stone tools.  By studying the shape and distribution of erect knotweed seeds, I can add to the story of ancient Native American environmental engineering, or niche construction.  It seems very likely that erect knotweed started as a camp follower &ndash; a name for a plant or animal that would naturally have colonized human settlements.  But over time, ancient farmers began saving seeds and planting them, selecting the most robust seedlings just as modern gardeners do, and harvesting all of the plants at the same time.  These actions resulted in plants that produced more food &ndash; more and larger fruits, and a more reliable crop &ndash; seeds that germinate reliably the year after they are harvested.  Experimental cultivation shows that when cultivated under optimal conditions, what looks like an unassuming little weed can be very productive.  It is my goal to rescue this lost crop from obscurity and bring it back into cultivation.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Natalie G Mueller"
