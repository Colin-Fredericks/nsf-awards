The research aims to explore whether a network of new tree-ring records from southern Africa can provide unique paleo-proxy data to help address a variety of questions about hydroclimatic variability, its causes, and impacts.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impacts involve collecting data from a poorly sampled region with potentially important insights into climate, supporting a U.S. graduate student, and helping build strong scientific ties with African scientists and students.",
