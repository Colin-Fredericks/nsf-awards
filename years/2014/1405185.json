 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question of Geometry and Topology is how the global topology of a space is determined by local geometric data, in particular, the curvature of the space. Nonpositively curved manifolds (spaces) has been a subject where there are a lot of rich theorems, and it has been a central object of study not only in geometry, but also in related fields of mathematics, such as geometric group theory and dynamics.  The field, however, seems to have been abandoned in the last two decades although there are a lot of unanswered questions, some of which are within reach. Constructions of smooth, nonpositively curved manifolds are poorly understood in the sense that most examples known are of a very restrictive type, such as hyperbolic manifolds and pinched negatively curved manifolds, which do not illustrate more generic properties of nonpositively curved spaces. One of the aims of the proposed research is to construct more nonpositively curved manifolds, especially with interesting properties that are not seen in hyperbolic or pinched negatively curved manifolds. If a space is known to have a nonpositively curved metric, one can deduce a lot about it. The question whether a space admits a nonpositively curved metric has become of great interest in different areas in topology. The proposed research also aims to find topological properties shared by large classes of nonpositively curved manifolds and topological obstructions to having a nonpositively curved metric. Specifically, the PI will study the topology of ends as obstructions to having nonpositively curved metrics.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project aims to study noncompact, complete, finite volume, bounded, nonpositively curved manifolds M. Objects to be studied are the topology of ends, invariants of the fundamental groups of these manifolds (such as the cohomological dimension and the action dimension), and the relation between the topology of the end of such a manifold of the set of non-horospherical limit points. The problem of how to distinguish which locally CAT(0) manifolds have a smooth nonpositively curved Riemannian metric will also be studied. In particular, in the case when M has tame ends, the question which manifold C can occur as the cross section of each end of M will be studied extensively. In low dimension, such as when M has dimension 4, the goal is to show that each cross section of an end of M is aspherical by computing the second homotopy group of the ends of M. Once this has been proven, and with the result of the Geometrization Theorem in three-manifold theory, a classification of all manifolds C that can occur as cross sections may be within reach, or at least progress can be made using recent techniques of Ontaneda's Riemannian hyperbolization procedure. The relation between the topology of the end of such a manifold and the set of non-horospherical limit points will be studied. For the case when M is a locally symmetric space of noncompact type, it will be shown that the set of non-horospherical limit points is the same as the rational Tits building using Saper's tilings. The question whether a similar phenomenon happens in more general nonpositively curved settings will be investigated. This project also aims to construct new examples of locally CAT(0) manifolds that do not admit a smooth nonpositively curved metric. Obstructions that will be used to distinguish these from smooth nonpositively curved manifolds are invariants at infinity that come from embedded flat tori in the manifolds that are locally linked with linking number greater than one.",

A bear walks South for some distance, then he turns left and walks for a bit more, and then he turns left again and walks for some distance just to find himself at the same place where he started. How is it possible for him to get back to the initial point after turning left only twice? Experience shows that he definitely does not live in Manhattan. The correct answer is that ``this is probably impossible\" although the usual answer is that the starting point is the North Pole and the bear is a polar bear. One day he leaves his little house at the Number 1, North Pole and decides to go for a walk. In the riddle, he walks all the way to the equator, then turns left and walks along the equator, so when he turns left again he is heading toward the North Pole, where he started. How this polar bear could survive the weather at the equator is absolutely mind-boggling, but what the riddle really tries to tell us is the notion of <em>curvature. </em></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Many of us can still remember the day we learned that if you add up the three angles in a triangle, you always get 180 degrees. In the riddle, however, the bear walks along a triangle whose angles are all 90 degrees each, so the sum of the angles is 270 degrees instead of 180. While it is true that many things we learn at school are false, this is not one of them. What we learn in school is flat geometry, which only applies to flat objects such as the plane. This is, in a way, the simplest kind of geometry, and though it seems good enough for everyday life in a small village - the polar bear would not have seen anything strange had he stayed his whole life around the North Pole because he got tenure there - it is no longer an accurate description of the way things are on a larger scale - when the polar bear walked so far that he reached the equator, things got strange. The curvature is one of most basic notions in geometry and is responsible for large-scale phenomena. So what is this thing called the curvature?</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>\n<p><span><span>The curvature measures ``the rate of divergence of geodesics\". There are three qualitatively different behaviors, which correspond to positive curvature, zero curvature and negative curvature. The <em>plane</em> has zero curvature, the <em>sphere</em> has positive curvature, and the traditional example given for a space with negative curvature is a <em>saddle</em> although a certain population in Brooklyn would prefer kale leaves as examples. The plane has zero curvature means that if two ants starting at the same place in the plane decide to walk away from each other in different directions, assuming that they walk at constant speed, then the distance between them increases linearly, i.e. the distance between them after 2 minutes is 2 times the distance between them after 1 minute (see Figure 2). The situation is different if two ants are on the sphere, the distance between them does not grow as fast. This is what positive curvature means. Lastly, as much as negative is the opposite of positive, if the two ants live on a surface with negative curvature, the distance between them will grow faster than if they were on the flat plane. How fast the growth in the distance is determines how large the curvature is.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>This suggests in a negatively curved space there is in general more room than in flat spaces, and positively curved spaces have even less room. It is not surprising that the sphere has finite diameter while the plane is infinite. One generally expects there to be more wonders in things that are infinite, and even in the case of surfaces this sentiment is true: many interesting things happen in negatively curved geometry. It takes a little imagination to think of a surface that looks like a saddle everywhere because, unlike the sphere, it would take up more room than we can afford. Nonetheless, there is such a space as much as there are natural numbers and it has even more room than the flat plane.
