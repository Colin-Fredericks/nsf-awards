 "awd_abstract_narration": "Towards a molecular mechanism of how plant cells divide\r\n\r\nCells reproduce by duplicating their genomic content and then dividing the genome into two identical daughter cells. The final step of division is cytokinesis, where the two daughters are physically separated from each other; its success is absolutely essential for normal growth and development, as well as reproduction in all organisms. Eukaryotic organisms from different kingdoms have developed cytokinesis mechanisms that share certain features but differ in others.  In advanced green algae and plants, cytokinesis is brought about by a sophisticated apparatus called the phragmoplast, which contains a core framework of structural microtubules.  Phragmoplast microtubules serve as tracks that transport vesicles used to assemble the cell plate, the structure that physically separates the two daughter cells.  Microtubules undergo rapid remodeling while the developing cell plate expands outward toward the cell cortex.  The phragmoplast is considered to be an evolutionary landmark that enabled the emergence of land plants on earth, but little is known about how plant cells assemble this structure.  In order to understand plant cytokinesis, this project will dissect mechanisms that regulate microtubule reorganization in the phragmoplast.  This work will not only advance knowledge of plant cell division but also shed light on how eukaryotic cells harness protein-based machineries to accomplish sophisticated tasks. Knowledge obtained here will be applicable to all plants, and aid understanding of how marine green algae transitioned into land plants during evolution.  Undergraduate and high school students from the UC Davis campus area will join the discovery, and receive hands-on training in modern cell biology.  The PI & Co-PI emphasize training undergraduate students whose curiosity and talent in research are shadowed by their relatively low GPAs.  The impacts of the proposed project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups, and aim for their advanced training upon graduation or prepare them to be technically competitive when seeking jobs in academia and the biotechnology industry.\r\n  \r\nThe PI's group uses the mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system to dissect cytokinesis because of its advanced genetics/genomics and well developed cell biology tools. As preliminary work, the PI has prepared necessary reagents, insightful mutants, and informative fluorescent marker lines to make the system ready for the proposed experiments.  Prior accomplishments have resulted in a model hypothesizing that the phragmoplast is assembled in modular form, where a core of interdigitating microtubules are surrounded by non-interdigitating ones.  The current project will test this modular model to learn how this apparatus is assembled to execute cytokinesis and taken apart upon the completion of cell division.  Specifically, the project will examine proteins that act at microtubule plus ends in the phragmoplast and integrate their functions in order to generate the dynamic array.  The proposed work has two objectives: 1) Towards establishing a quantitative model of microtubule organization in the phragmoplast. Efforts will be devoted to analyzing the kinetics of the phragmoplast microtubule array by the state-of-the-art live-cell imaging technologies.  Research will use a photoswitchable microtubule marker to test whether microtubule translocation takes place in the phragmoplast.  Available mutants will be employed to test specific functions of the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-3, the motor Kinesin-12, and the kinase MPK4 in the assembly and disassembly of the array.  Results from these studies will be integrated into a quantitative model recapitulating microtubule dynamics and reorganization during cytokinesis.  2) To uncover the novel function of MAP65-4 in the phragmoplast. The project will examine MAP65-4 localization by immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging in transgenic lines.  Genetic experiments will be followed to test for any redundant functions of MAP65-3 and MAP65-4 in the phragmoplast.  The outcome of these investigations will advance our knowledge on how the anti-parallel microtubule array is established. Overall, this project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCytokinesis concludes the cell division cycle to give rise to two daughter cells.  Among eukaryotes, advanced green algae and plants have acquired a cytokinesis mechanism different from that found in fungal and animal cells.  Their cytokinesis is brought about by the phragmoplast apparatus that has the cytoskeletal microtubules organized into a bipolar array.  Vesicle transport takes place along these microtubules towards the division site.  During cytokinesis, this microtubule array expands centrifugally towards the cell periphery while the cell plate forms concomitantly.  In this project, we aimed to advance our knowledge of molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation and dynamic reorganization of the phragmoplast microtubule array using the mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system.  We first addressed how cells assemble the array by examining the generation of new microtubules between segregated chromatids.  We discovered a mechanism that allows plant cells to generate new microtubules in a cell cycle-dependent manner by employing a novel microtubule-associated protein in order to activate a pathway for nucleating new microtubules in the mitotic spindle and phragmoplast.  This is the first example that illuminates how plant cells control microtubule nucleation differently in dividing cells vs. non-dividing cells.  We also focused our investigations on the organization of microtubules in the phragmoplast.  Our findings revealed coordinated contributions of two homologous microtubule-associated proteins to the engagement of microtubules initiated from opposite sides of the cell.  Their engagement is essential for cells to synthesize the cell plate efficiently.  Another important discovery uncovered a novel function of an evolutionarily conserved protein in the regulation of microtubule engagement.  Previously, this protein had been thought to function exclusively in monitoring chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules.  We found that the protein actively regulates the interaction between microtubule-associated proteins and phragmoplast microtubules in order to ensure the progression of cell plate assembly during cytokinesis.  In summary, we have brought new insights into the phragmoplast-based cytokinesis in plants and uncovered molecular events that are essential for the evolvement of the phragmoplast. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bo Liu"
