 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Chemistry at The University of Alabama is hosting 9 participants in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program for the summers of 2014 to 2016. These young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in chemical problems of relevance to the environment, materials, or biological chemistry. Students will be recruited primarily from the southeastern United States, and the Site will emphasize recruitment of students from underrepresented groups. The site will provide research experiences for a diverse student cohort who might not otherwise have access to research opportunities and help to prepare them for their future careers.\r\n\r\nAll participants will carry out projects under the supervision of active research faculty with experience in directing undergraduate students. Participants will choose research projects on a well-defined interdisciplinary problem in environmental, materials, or biological chemistry. Training gained during performance of these projects is enhanced by Monday and Friday one-hour seminars that together foster independence, maturity, and confidence and will develop researchers to think independently, search out new avenues of investigation, and to speak confidently in public. The program is enriched by a series of Wednesday seminars exploring ethical issues pertinent to chemical researchers. Students are housed in furnished on-campus apartments to promote social and intellectual interactions. Early in each summer's program, participants attend a series of meetings and activities designed to introduce the basics of scientific research while building camaraderie and a group identity. The program will help to improve the quality of the domestic graduate student pool.",

A total of 28 undergraduate chemistry majors participated in the program over 4 summers (2015 - 2018).  The group consisted of 16 women (5 African-Americans and 3 Hispanic) and 12 men (2 Hispanics and 1 African American; 1 former military) - 57% women and 39% underrepresented minorities.  These students to date have given or are scheduled to give 29 poster presentations or talks on their work at regional and national meetings, more than 1 regional or national presentation per student.  These included the spring 2016, 2017, and 2018 National ACS meetings (including 8 at the spring 2018 in New Orleans, which is a very popular location for our students from the Southeast), the 2016 and 2017 Southeast Regional ACS meeting, the 2015 joint Southeast/Southwest Regional ACS meeting, the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) REU meetings, 2016 Southeast Magnetic Resonance meeting, 2017 Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM, and 2017 Arkansas INBRE Research conference.  Students in this period have published work to date in the journals Biological Trace Element Research, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, and Chemistry &ndash; A European Journal.  Several faculty have manuscripts in preparation.  Two students? home institutions had pictures or articles on their students? REU experience or meeting presentation on their website. \n\n         Most of the students came from small colleges or universities in the Southeast US with only undergraduate programs or with masters programs. 4-8 different states were represented each year 2015-2017, and a total of 12 states (AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, MD, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, WV) and Puerto Rico were represented over the period of the grant.  Notably, no participants came from The University of Alabama Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Program in the last 4-year period.  We generally select one student from a research institution and one or two students from outside the southeast to have more variety in the student backgrounds.  Schools represented by the REU students in this period include Agnes Scott College, Alabama A&amp;M University, Alcorn State University, Arkansas State University, Catawba College, Centre College, Colorado College, Erskine College, Fairmont State University, Georgia Southern University, Huntingdon College,  Inter American University of Puerto Rico &ndash; Guayama, Kennesaw State University, Mississippi College, Piedmont College, Salisbury College, Spring Hill College, Tennessee Technological University, Tougaloo College, Troy University, Tuskegee University, University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, University of Central Florida, University of North Georgia, University of Tennessee-Martin, University of the Cumberlands, and Wofford College.  Faculty with support outside the REU program have had students participate in the entirety of our REU program from UA (8) and from schools outside UA at no cost to the proposal: Southeastern Louisiana University (2), Kennesaw State University (2), Saint Francis University, Brown University, Rutgers University, University of Missouri, University of Texas at San Antonio, Gordon College, Swarthmore College, Spring Hill College (2), Houghton College, Mississippi College, North Carolina AT&amp;T State University, and Hillsdale College; these students benefit from our structured program while they serve to broaden the diversity of the REU program.  UA students on other support are a significant benefit as they help orient the students from outside UA.\n\n         A survey of the participants for the three year period indicates that ~82% are either in, will attend, or plan to attend graduate school, ~11 % area attending or planning to attend physician assistant or medical school, and ~7% have industrial positions.
