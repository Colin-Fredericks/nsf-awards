 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unstructured data spread across a gamut of mediums - electronic communications such as emails, chat transcripts, and telephone transcripts.  The gamut of unstructured documents makes it a time consuming, labor-intensive, and at times an impossible task to derive intelligence from unstructured text. The proposed technology solutions in this proposal will have a significant impact in many different areas. For example, since unstructured data represent up to 80 percent of all data in the Banking and Finance Industry domain, the proposed solutions will provide a means of sifting through this data much faster than the existing ones, resulting in identifying frauds and compliance breaches, and cost savings for taxpayers and financial firms. Similarly, in the Healthcare domain, more efficient representations of digitized medical data can help physicians better tailor treatments by patient history, or identify health trends to benefit public health.\r\n\r\nThis team is leveraging their research in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and social network analysis (specifically for extracting social networks from narrative text using the notion of a 'social event') to build a tool called eExplorer product suite. Rather than trying to convert unstructured text into traditional structured database design, eExplorer creates an adaptable, flexible and dynamic soft-structure on the unstructured text. eExplorer significantly reduces the time between data collection and analysis by supporting an interaction between an analyst and the data. While exploring the data, an analyst may provide examples of the kind of structure he/she wants to impose on the data. Using NLP and ML techniques, eExplorer learns the type of structure an analyst is trying to impose and adds a flexible and soft-structure on the entire data. This has an additional advantage that each analyst may build a different and their own view (or soft-structure) of the data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe award was given to our proposal titled eExplorer - Unstructured Data Analyzer.  eExplorer consisted of a set of algorithms that could process a large amount of unstructured text - emails, chat and phone transcripts and any such text, extract out the relationships  based on the context to identify who talked to whom about what, when and where.  The work was funded by a prior NSF grant as well as another grant from DARPA.  This was primarlly the PhD research work of Apoorv Agarwal at Columbia University.  He teamed up with Manoj Pooleery, who acted as the Principal Investigator, who was leading the commercialization activities at CCLS, Columbia University.  The team as made complete with Ted Antkoviak, VP of strategic partnerships at NextGen Invent, who acted as the business mentor.\n\nThe initial process of identifying the most suitable domain to apply the algorithms was challenging.  Towards the end of the initial session at Arlington, VA, having completed about 15 customer interviews, the team had narrowed the domain down to about four&ndash; healthcare, pharma, security and legal. After another ten to twelve customer interviews, it became apparent that while there were needs in other domains, the chances of the algorithms being useful and effective was in the legal domain, specifically in the process of eDiscovery.\n\nThe team then set out to find as many legal professionals to do additional customer interviews.  It applied several techniques, including cold calls and emails.  The PI, Manoj Pooleery, devised innovative ways of reaching out to a wide audience but with a customized personal touch.  The EL, Apoorv Agarwal found ways of identifying legal professionals by focusing on the Columbia Law School professors and adjuncts directory.  This process was further enhanced by usage of LinkedIn.\n\nAs the team worked through the list of potential customers, multiple problems started to emerge, that needed solving  in the eDiscovery domain.  While there were a number of legal tech companies in the domain, there was one problem that most of these companies had not solved &ndash; identifying whether some information that was being requested by a party was privileged or not.  This was due to the fact the decision is highly subjective and open to interpretation.  As such, this process of identifying privileged information prior to a document getting produced during information discovery as part of litigation is still a very costly process.  This involves the utilization of time from some of the senior attorneys/partners at a legal firm, who typically charges multiple hundreds of dollars.\n\nThe team conducted a total of one hundred and twenty two customer interviews.  Out of this, close to sixty  percent of them were in person.  There was a phenomenal level of interest from legal firms who are pioneering the use of technology and even a few funding offers.  After successfully completing the requirements for the grant, the team decided to go ahead with starting a new company called TextIQ (www.text-iq.com).   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Manoj Pooleery"
