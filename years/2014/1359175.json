The research projects supported at this Site are in areas of biological, green, and materials chemistry. Undergraduates are recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack extensive infrastructure to support undergraduate research, and include students from underrepresented groups. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site is well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Site supports ten students per summer in a ten week program. A sample of the projects include: (1) the synthesis of bioactive natural products; (2) the synthesis of biodegradable polymers from renewable resources; (3) the design of metal-organic framework for the reversible adsorption of carbon dioxide; (4) the tuning of surface interactions for the control of friction and wear; (5) synthesis of conjugated ladder polymers for organic solar cells, and (6) the computational design of transition metal free catalysts. Exposure to the modern research methods and tools used in the research expands the undergraduate participants' technical training. In addition, the students are exposed to areas of science with important societal impacts in health, energy, environment, and materials. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, and will have expanded opportunities for presentation of their research at national disciplinary meetings.",

Many of these students would not otherwise have access to this valuable training, which is a critical stepping stone to further internships, employment, or graduate studies, and therefore our program represents a critical effort for retaining students in the STEM fields. This diverse group of students included 20 women, 17 men, and 1 person of non-binary gender, of whom, 5 identified as African Americans and 7 as Hispanic American students. In additional to technical training in synthesis, instrumentation, and analysis, students also received training in safety, ethics, and scientific communication. Each student was assigned a project in either biological chemistry, green chemistry, or materials chemistry &ndash; areas of research that have broad applications across society. These projects involved a variety of approaches, including developing new synthetic methods, making new compounds, and characterizing the compounds&rsquo; structural, magnetic, and electronic properties.</p>\n<p>Twenty-five of these students attended a national meeting of the American Chemical Society, the largest scientific society in the world, where they presented the results of their research, attended technical presentations, and networked with professionals in chemistry. So far, five publications in high-quality, high impact journals have resulted from this work, covering a broad range of potential applications, including the design of more efficient and stable solar cells and more efficient methods of extracting oil from emulsions, as well as a number of potential commercial applications including molecular electronics, field effect transistors, and computing.
