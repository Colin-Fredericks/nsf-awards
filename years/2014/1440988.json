 "awd_abstract_narration": "Successful science teachers need high quality teaching materials, sustained professional development opportunities, and a school structure that aligns local goals and policies, and supports sustained teacher networks.  This project addresses all three of these essential elements in the context of a key topic in the sciences: the role of carbon in the flow of materials and energy through living systems, human engineered systems, and Earth systems at multiple scales.  The project builds on previously funded projects that have developed student learning progressions for these topics, and it will develop and test a new professional development model for teachers that is based on a teacher learning progression framework.  The framework is based on four core teaching and learning practices advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS): formative assessment, inquiry, explanations, and decision making.  Online and in-person teacher networks will also be developed and studied for their effects on teacher knowledge and practices, and on student learning.\r\n\r\nThe project engages the University of Michigan, the National Geographic Society, the Seattle Public Schools, the Institute for Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, and others in a partnership spanning schools in four states, in diverse sociocultural settings, and located in urban, suburban, and rural environments.  Case-study methods will be used to develop the teacher learning progression, including analyses of written assessments, online data capture techniques, interviews, and classroom videotaping.  Collected data and analyses will be used to develop a professional development model with blended online and face-to-face experiences.   A design-based implementation research approach will be used to develop and test teacher implementation networks.  Longitudinal and online network data will be used to identify the conditions under which teachers are influenced by others in their networks, and how those influences affect student outcomes. Findings from this project are expected to provide new knowledge on how to sustain responsive and rigorous science teaching that is anchored in the NGSS and situated in the culture of typical middle schools and high schools.",

For each strand we pursued design goals through an iterative process along with data collection and analysis. Our key design products and research findings are available on the website (<a href=\"https://carbontime.create4stem.msu.edu/\">https://carbontime.create4stem.msu.edu/</a>) and summarized below.</p>\n<p>1. INSTRUCTIONAL AND ASSESSMENT MATERIALS</p>\n<p><em>Design products:</em> We used learning progression research and an iterative design process to develop six teaching units and assessments of students? three-dimensional learning. The units focus on carbon cycling and energy flow at multiple scales, from cellular processes such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration to global carbon cycling and energy flow. Four of the units (<em>Systems and Scale, Plants, Animals, Decomposers</em>) focus on investigations of macroscopic-scale processes and explanations using atomic-molecular models. The other two units (<em>Ecosystems, Human Energy Systems</em>) focus on ecosystem and global-scale processes.&nbsp; The units were built around an instructional model that engaged students as questioners, investigators, and explainers (Image 1) and included multiple scaffolds for students? three-dimensional sensemaking such as the Three Questions (Image 2).</p>\n<p><em>Research findings:</em> Over five years we worked with 145 teachers and over 25,000 students. Data include a total of 197,000 student assessments, 881 teacher surveys, plus interviews with teachers, classroom video, examples of student work, and interviews with students in case-study classrooms. The 94 participating schools included urban, suburban, and rural schools. There were 26 middle schools and 68 high schools. In the participating schools the percentage of students receiving free and reduced lunches ranged from 3% to 99%, with a mean of 41%; the percentage of marginalized students of color ranged from 0% to 100%, with a mean of 43%.</p>\n<p>Our findings included: First, the project?s curriculum and professional development were associated with substantial improvements in overall student achievement (Image 3); within classrooms, students with lower pretest scores had higher learning gains. Second, differences among individual teachers accounted for more of the variance in student learning gains than other variables including school demographics and students? prior knowledge (Image 4). Third, school demographic factors (percent free and reduced lunch and percent marginalized students of color) had statistically significant but small effects on students? learning. Finally, student learning gains improved across years for the project as a whole, and for individual teachers as they gained experience and participated in professional development (Image 5).</p>\n<p>2. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</p>\n<p>Design products: We designed a two-year course of study that included face-to-face (six days) and online (six days) of professional development. The course responds to the realities of teachers? current classroom communities while providing rationales, modeling, and support for classroom communities that scaffold and assess three-dimensional science learning. Teachers, researchers, and developers worked together to develop the practical knowledge it takes to understand students and enact the <em>Carbon TIME </em>instructional model.</p>\n<p>Research findings: As Image 5 shows, there were learning gains in all classrooms, but wide variation among individual teachers. Our analyses of classroom videos, interviews with teachers and focus students, and student work showed that all teachers responded to local expectations for successful classroom management, curricular content, and assessments that enabled almost all students to receive passing grades. Teachers with higher learning gains also used strategies that engaged students in three-dimensional sensemaking and scaffolded three-dimensional performances (through sensemaking about phenomena and cognitive apprenticeship<ins datetime=\"2021-11-01T08:58\" cite=\"mailto:morris73@msu.edu\">)</ins>.</p>\n<p>3.

There were, however, important variations in how teachers in higher- and lower-learning gains classrooms described teaching and learning. The teachers in higher-learning gains classrooms talked specifically about their commitments to students? three-dimensional learning and provided examples of students? success. They described ways that they used and modified the unit materials to scaffold students? three-dimensional sensemaking performances. Differently, teachers in lower-learning gains classrooms described how they made their teaching fun or interesting for their students. They described their students? interest in investigations and hands-on activities while indicating that students were less interested in sustained work toward difficult three-dimensional performances. They modified units to add science content; reduce what they saw as repetitive activities; or simplify tasks (generally reducing them from three to one-dimensionality) so that students would be more successful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;W&nbsp;Anderson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1440988/1440988_10333731_1635864375011_Image1_Instructional_Model--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1440988/1440988_10333731_1635864375011_Image1_Instructional_Model--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1: Carbon TIME Instructional Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1440988/1440988_10333731_1635864375011_Image1_Instructional_Model--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1: Carbon TIME Instructional Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each unit is organized around an instructional model that scaffolds students\ufffd roles as questioners, investigators, and explainers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carbon TIME Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;W&nbsp;Anderson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1: Carbon TIME Instructional Model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1440988/1440988_10333731_1635864773495_Image3_baseline_vs_CTIME--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1440988/1440988_10333731_1635864773495_Image3_baseline_vs_CTIME--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 3: Comparing posttests between Carbon TIME and non-Carbon TIME students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1440988/1440988_10333731_1635864773495_Image3_baseline_vs_CTIME--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3: Comparing posttests between Carbon TIME and non-Carbon TIME students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The histograms compare performances of students of the same teachers the year before they began using Carbon TIME units and during their first year in the project.
