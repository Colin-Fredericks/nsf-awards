Conference experience is critical for training undergraduate and graduate students to be well-prepared computing force in the future. CCGrid is a premium forum for the latest research findings on the design and development of parallel computing, Cloud computing, and high performance computing systems. Participation in such a premium conference will provide an excellent opportunity for students to interact with peers and world-renown researchers at an international stage. Awardees will be selected via a rigorous application and review process that considers both expected benefits and interests of prospective participants. This project will have an impact in stimulating students' enthusiasms about parallel computing, Cloud computing, scientific computing, and high performance computing and training future computing workforce for the nation.",
