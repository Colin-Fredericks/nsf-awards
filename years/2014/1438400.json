Upsides include low cost fuel and chemical industry feedstocks, resulting in a boost to the economy and in new and expanded plant capacity. Downsides include concern about environmental degradation of groundwater, and about the impact of air emissions of air toxics and ozone forming precursors such as nitrogen oxides and reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the resulting immediate impact on public health, as well as air emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This project will lead to toolsets that can be used by a variety of constituents to improve predictions of fate and transport of air pollutants, and to identify effective regulatory policy measures to reduce impact of NG operations. Products of this research will include improved understanding of vertical mixing parameterization for improved accuracy in predicting regional scale transport of area source emissions, model-ready updated emissions estimates, and well documented scenarios available for evaluating impacts of policy changes. Concerns regarding transport of area source emissions extend beyond NG operations to emissions from non-electricity generating NOx sources and vehicle emissions as well as biogenic emissions. Model-ready emissions estimates can be used by a variety of constituents including regulatory and community organizations and the oil and natural gas industry. Hands on research activities for high school and undergraduate students will support personnel development. The emphasis of this work is the Marcellus shale play but approaches and products developed will be useful for other regions of the US and world.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will investigate the regional nature of emissions from NG production operations including modern horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The primary testable hypothesis is that ground level air emissions of even short-lived species can be significant regional sources of pollution through vertical transport and advection. Rigorous analysis of ground level and aloft aircraft measurements of methane, VOCs, NOx, and PM2.5, including those made during the NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign will be performed. Receptor based source apportionment will be conducted for multiple sites in the mid-Atlantic region. To improve our ability to simulate regional transport, existing vertical transport parameterization schemes available within the Community-scale Modeling and Air Quality (CMAQ) platform will be evaluated for several episodes in the mid-Atlantic region of the US for 2007 and 2011. Regional ground level monitoring data will be aggregated from several states and combined with a short aircraft field campaign, using upwind and downwind spirals and plume transects to evaluate degree of agreement between our model predictions of vertical transport and downwind dispersion and measurements. Building on a long-standing cooperation with State (MD, CT, DE, NH) and regional (OTC/MANE-VU) Air Quality managers the PIs will partner to develop and evaluate possible future case scenarios.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objectives of the project were to characterize the regional nature of air emissions resulting from natural gas production in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and to train the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Towards characterizing the regional nature of volatile organic carbon (VOC), our group performed analysis of hourly ground level measurements at photochemical assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) at various locations in the Mid-Atlantic region during June through August from 2007 through 2017, using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF).  General trends included a reduction in industrial emissions from 2013 to 2017, and also vehicle related emissions over the years 2007 to 2017.  Natural gas emissions rose to contribute nearly the same or greater percentage on a carbon basis to total non-methane VOC as vehicle emissions from 2014 to 2017.  As the photoactivity of the molecules associated with the natural gas source are typically less photoactive than VOCs associated with vehicles, the overall VOC reactivity towards ozone formation has been reduced over the past decade.  However, the PAMS do not measure methane; ethane and propane are surrogates for the natural gas source.  The natural gas may be resulting from local sources including leaks from natural gas infrastructure or upwind, from natural gas drilling operations.  Work in progress includes use of pipeline natural gas composition measurements to resolve local vs upwind contributions. \n\n Towards establishing air emissions from upwind natural gas production, methane (CH4) emission rates were estimated for the southwest Marcellus Shale based on airborne observations made during August and September of 2015.  See Figure 1 for a schematic of the mass balance approach and an example flight transect.  A mean emission rate of ~21 kg CH4/s was observed from a 4200 km2 study area. Methane and other components including CO2, SO2, NO2 and aerosol absorption and scattering, were measured with high time resolution (1 min or less) and other VOCs including ethane were measured using grab samples (5-6 per flight).

A chemical transport model Weather Research and Forecasting Model, with chemistry enabled (WRF-Chem) was used to model methane enhancements, using the EPA?s 2012 inventory, adjusted to 2015 and 2016.  Methane was adjusted using a scaling factor to match airborne measurements.  Methane emissions from coal mining appeared to match inventory estimates without adjustment, but methane emissions from natural gas production appear to be underestimated by a factor of 5.  Despite this discrepancy, energy generated through natural gas produced in the region is found to have a smaller greenhouse gas footprint compared to energy produced by coal, by nearly a factor of 2. \n\nThe project has resulted in opportunity for training of one MS student, six PhD students, eight undergraduate students and two high school students. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheryl H Ehrman"
