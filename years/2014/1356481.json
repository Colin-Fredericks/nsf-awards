 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics Scholarships (CMaPS) S-STEM scholarship program at Howard University is to increase student graduation rates while improving academic performance. The program is enhancing the academic environment for S-STEM scholars as they complete undergraduate degrees in Chemistry, Mathematics, or Physics. The project provides approximately 18 scholarships for first-year or second-year students. All of the first year S-STEM scholars and some of the second year students live in one of Howard's Living and Learning Communities, which has the theme of  \"Technology: Interdisciplinary Usage.\" The mission of the living-learning communities is to extend student learning opportunities outside of the classroom to heighten student intellectual and personal growth. These living environments foster faculty and resident interactions that build a strong sense of community for the students. In addition, a one credit hour course is being developed around this theme. All S-STEM scholars take this course, which is also available to other Howard students. S-STEM scholars also have the opportunity to take a summer research course. \r\n\r\nThe S-STEM program recruits scholars from underrepresented groups through high school admission counselors, fair visits, and outreach programs offered by the participating departments. S-STEM scholars are connected to the career/advising/mentoring services of the university and the support structures designed specifically forthem. The project builds strong ties between the S-STEM faculty and the scholars through the living and learning communities, a structured mentoring program, and the research opportunities. The success of the project will be evaluated based on a comparison study between a matched control cohort and the S-STEM scholars using surveys, focus groups and observational studies.",

That year we awarded scholarships to 15 students, 5 in mathematics, 5 in chemistry, and 5 in physics. We lost3 first-year physics majors to poor grades. Two withdrew from the university and one changed majors. The one who changed majors is in good standing at the university. However, after being placed on probation for the Spring semester, he did not satisfy our requirements to be reinstated. Two math majors changed majors to non-CMaPS disciplines and were separated from the program. One chemistry major changed majors to a non-CMaPS discipline and another left for poor grades. The chemistry major who was separated from the program for poor performance is in good standing at the university. She was placed on probation for the Spring semester but did not meet the agreed requirements to be reinstated. Out of the 15 awardees, 8 remain.&nbsp;We were not pleased with our performance in the first year of awarding scholarships. We decided to address the retention rate by enforcing the requirement that students meet with their CMaPS advisors at least once a month and provide reports on their progress. Of the seven students who were separated from the program, five were first-year students. Hence, we decided to award scholarships to second-year students who have shown some success at the collegiate level. One benchmark we considered was their performance in mathematics courses. We came to this conclusion because six of the seven students who left the program did poorly in their mathematics courses, even though we provided them with an experienced tutor who has an excellent reputation. By implementing these changes, we saw a very significant improvement. For AY 2016 we awarded 19 scholarships. One more than our plan; however, because two students left the previous year after the Fall semester, we had funds for this. Our retention rates improved; for AY2017 it was 100%, for AY 2018 it was 73%, for AY2019 it was 100%, and for AY 2020 it was 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The program has had a significant impact on the Department of Mathematics. Indeed. Four of our graduates in 2019 were mathematics majors. While this number is small, our department has averaged 7 graduates per year for the past 10 years. Hence, this is a significant number for the Mathematics Department and fits well in their plan to increase the number to more than 20 by 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A CMaPS faculty member gave a presentation at the 50th SE Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing on March 4-8, 2019, at Florida Atlantic University on research that was done with three CMaPS students.
