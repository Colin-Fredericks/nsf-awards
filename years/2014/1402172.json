The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future.  This fellowship to C. Marisa Tellez supports research and training in predicting the health status of aquatic ecosystems by studying crocodilian top predators and their parasites.  The host institution is the University of California, Santa Barbara under the sponsorship of Dr. Armand Kuris.  The lack of data on community diversity of crocodilian habitats hinders the ability of conservation managers to properly assess how anthropogenic disturbances affect wildlife.  Training objectives include techniques in community ecology, biochemistry, and parasitology in order to assay biological indicators.\r\n\r\nThe research examines the significance of parasites as biodiversity and health indicators of crocodilian habitats. First, the study determines if parasite species richness correlates with biodiversity. Second, heavy metal analyses of hosts and parasites, representing three different trophic levels, are being used to evaluate human impact. Analyzing pollutant levels in both hosts and parasites is a novel approach to assess anthropogenic impact. This may provide a more advantageous indicator of ecosystem functioning, and of environmental quality, than is presently available. Overall, the proposed analyses  foster novel theories and ideals about the function of community interactions, energy flow and food web relationships in tropical systems.",

Given the ancient lineage and status of crocodilians as keystone predators, as well as parasites&rsquo; dependency on host and environment, my project examined the use of crocodilians and their parasites as biological indicators of the local biodiversity and health of crocodilian habitats through a cross-disciplinary approach that includes community ecology, parasitology, eco-toxicology, and translational ecology (= utilizing scientific data to implement management and conservation action plans).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My project has focused on three crocodilian habitats in Belize:&nbsp; Ambergris Caye, Caye Caulker, and more specifically Placencia Lagoon in southern Belize.&nbsp; The project included conducting bird surveys, aquatic surveys, and crocodile surveys in addition to dissecting snails and fish for their parasites, as well as collecting poop from the American crocodile (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em>) and Morelet&rsquo;s crocodile (<em>Crocodylus moreletii</em>) or conducting stomach flushing to obtain nematode parasites.

The data did show a distinct contrast of parasite prevalence and diversity between pristine vs. non-pristine crocodilian habitats; the more pristine habitats had a higher diversity of parasite prevalence, including a higher prevalence of trematode parasites that use multiple hosts for their life cycle.  Part of the trematode life cycle includes a free-living stage and it is very sensitive to fluctuations or pollution in its surrounding aquatic habitat, thus low trematode prevalence provides a red flag that something is unstable or negatively affecting the ecosystem.  Additionally, the health and parasitism of crocodiles seemed to reflect the state of the environment, particularly the external parasite known as Paratrichosoma.  This parasites leaves a zig-zag trail on the ventral side of crocs, and it was noticed in hypersaline, low oxygenated, or highly polluted environments crocs did not have this parasite.  More research will be pursued to understand how this croc parasite interacts more with its archaic host and the aquatic environment.\n\n \n\nIn the Placencia Lagoon, my research provided cryptic details of an aquatic environment that was losing its biodiversity; no one had noticed the issues as more traditional methods (water testing and basic biodiversity surveys 1/year) were not illustrating the red flags.  The Placencia Lagoon is currently being considered as a Wildlife Sancutary in Belize, and the data my research provided (the sudden decrease in parasitism in certain areas of the lagoon followed by a noticeable drop of bird diversity as well as diseased birds, the decrease of snails) supplemented information necessary to rapidly incorporate the nation?s Department of the Environment and local NGO?s to further investigate what is harming the Placencia Lagoon.
