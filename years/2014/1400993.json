 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid biodiversity change in North America has significant effects on essential ecosystem services, from impact on soil health and nutrient cycling, to agriculture, forestry and water quality. Exploding populations of invasive species threaten fresh water and terrestrial habitats and potentially impact the natural resources of the nation. Easy access to robust, expertly vetted baseline data for species occurrences, abundances, and distribution ranges, and monitoring how these parameters have changed through time, will facilitate the protection of the nation's natural resources, and vastly improve the capacity for effective restoration, land management planning, and conservation management.  Numerous undergraduate students will receive training in digitization technologies and a modular exhibit will be developed to engage public interest in biodiversity changes.\r\n\r\nEffective monitoring requires easy electronic access to historical specimen baseline information for temporal and regional species diversity comparisons that can facilitate informed land management decisions. Vast amounts of specimen data are housed within the nation's natural history collections, but most of these data are not readily accessible from digital resources. Size and complexity of scientific specimen collections require major technological advances in capturing specimen data. The goal of this four-year collaborative project is the rapid digitization of  >2 million specimens and their locality data from ten arthropod and mollusk collections housed at six major US museums in six states (Il, OH, AL,MI, DE, PA). This project will significantly automate specimen data capture by utilizing optical character and voice-recognition technologies. The digitized data from this project will be immediately deployed for habitat-based distribution modeling and analyses.This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

The intellectual merits of having these data available are myriad. The data can be applied to research on numerous biological phenomena, including imperfect mimicry (Why do some flies seem to mimic wasp species that don't exist?), changes in phenology (Are bees emerging from their overwintering sites earlier now?), and the impacts of invasive species (How is spotted lanternfly impacting the bug fauna of the northeast?). There have been several high profile and troubling reports of dramatic declines in insect diversity and biomass globally. Understanding this phenomenon in a temporal context requires data from natural history collections, especially data from structured, repeatable biotic inventories - a rare asset in natural history collections, which are often built ad hoc. The Frost Museum was able to make such data available during this project, with more than 30,000 arthropod specimens from a standardized survey in central Pennsylvania. (Fort Indiantown Gap).

By having orders of magnitude more data available, the Frost Museum was also able to raise its profile in the research community, with loan requests increasing by at least 50% and data requests by 100% over the life of the project.
