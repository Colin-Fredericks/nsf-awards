 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Robert Houser from the University of Northern Colorado and colleagues Robin Macaluso and Michael Mosher will acquire an X-ray diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of chemistry and physics students as well as high school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) exploring rare-earth magnetic intermetallic compounds; (b) investigating the redox chemistry of thioether amide ligands with copper(II); (c) developing G-quadruplex ligands; (d) synthesizing and characterizing non-traditional semiconductor thermoelectric and photovoltaic materials; and (e) detecting fluorescence of biomolecules.",
