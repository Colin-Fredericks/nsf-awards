 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean sustainability initiatives include both market-based and spatial management strategies, but we have yet to understand what happens when these approaches overlap. This project will investigate the relationship between New Zealand's commercial fishing industry, governed by a tradable quota system, and an indigenous Maori community's governance of a spatially defined marine area, in which commercial fishing is prohibited. In 2004, the Ngai Tahu tribe established the nation's largest customary fishing reserve off Stewart Island to promote fish species' development. Commercial industry representatives, however, argue the reserve's ban on commercial fishing conflicts with the market-based incentives for sustainable fishing practices embedded in the nation's quota system. This project will map changes in commercial fishing data against customary management practices to examine how quota markets are affected by spatial restrictions on commercial fishing. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Brad Coombes at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand, who is a noted expert on indigenous resource management.\r\n  \r\nThe tensions between commercial and customary fishing policies in New Zealand speak to broader concerns regarding the recognition of indigenous rights through market-based solutions to social and environmental problems, exemplified in fisheries quota management systems and carbon cap-and-trade programs. The dynamics of Maori fishery governance are particularly important to examine because Maori tribes are also major players in the commercial fishing industry, owning substantial amounts of fishing quota. This investigation of Maori fisheries management strategies will, therefore, trouble the durability of dichotomies between customary versus commercial interests, and traditional versus modern natural resource management practices. In doing so, this research will broaden our understanding of the ways access to and benefits from marine resources may be more equitably distributed to indigenous and non-indigenous fisheries stakeholders. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcomes &amp; Findings\nIntellectual merit:\n\nThis project contributed to our understanding of the social, economic and ecological effects of intersections between space-based customary fishing reserves, in which non-commercial take is allowed, and quota based fisheries management systems.  Using ethnographic data in which the researcher participated in fishing practices, including fish take and sales, and conducted interviews with fishermen discussing their historical engagement with the fishery, coupled with data on commercial and customary catch levels, the findings from this project suggest that commercial fishing is key to accessing fish for take in customary fisheries.   These findings build upon theoretical examinations of factors contributing to how we derive benefit from resources and the ways that non-legal forms of access, including access to capital and knowledge is needed to realize benefits of legal forms of access.  In this case, legal forms of access granted to Maori fishing communities in the form of customary fishing takes are not realized without access to the capital, technology, and knowledge required to take a boat out and access fish.  These findings are important for our understandings of how market-based environmental management systems for fisheries that restrict access to commercial sales can also serve to restrict community access to fisheries if access to the capital, technology, and knowledge needed to fish is also restricted when commercial fishermen are removed from the fishery.  \n\nBroader Impacts: \n\nThe findings from this work are important to fisheries managers, fishers, and fishing community members in New Zealand and elsewhere working on mechanisms for restricting take from fisheries without restricting economic and social benefits associated with the fishery.  This research is immediately relevant to groups who have both customary and commercial fishing rights, and are currently debating the comparative economic, ecological and social benefits of leasing out commercial fishing rights to fishing companies who can promise high return for large amounts of quota versus establishing programs to allocate quota to community fishers.   This is the case in New Zealand as well as in fisheries throughout North America and Australia that are increasingly managed through systems that restrict commercial access through the establishment of quota while simultaneously including provisions for indigenous customary catch and indigenous community quota ownership.\n\nOutcomes of the award:\n\nThis project took place over the course of eight weeks, during which the researcher lived and worked with indigenous fishers in local fishing communities around Lake Ellesmere, located in the Banks Peninsula in New Zealand.  The researcher conducted ethnographic research that involved participation in fishing practices, in-depth interviews with fishers and fisheries managers, and participation in fish distribution and sales, with analysis of commercial and customary fishing catch data and fisheries management policies.  She spent significant time working with commercial fishermen who were also living in local fishing communities who were commercially fishing quota allocated to tribal fishing communities.  The research she conducted with these individuals illuminated the social, economic, and ecological stakes of allocating specific portions of commercial fishing quota to small-scale fishers who live in local communities as opposed to leasing quota out to the highest bidder on the open market. \n\nThe researcher examined how the economic benefits of commercial fishing are distributed throughout local fishing communities when the commercial fishers live locally.  She found that not only are economic benefits associated with employment, housing, and supplies purchased centralized more locally when fishers live locally, but also the community benefits from the distribution of fish fished under customary permits held by comme..."
