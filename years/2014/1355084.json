 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organisms alive today have exchanged genes with organisms of their own species in their recent evolutionary history.  However, the reasons for the evolutionary success of genetic exchange are unclear.  This research will investigate the possibility that genetic exchange selects for types of interactions between genes that, in turn, select for continued genetic exchange. The overarching goal is to develop new empirical and modeling frameworks for studying the evolution of genetic exchange.  The research will (1) extend an existing mathematical model of virus replication to capture the short-term evolutionary dynamics of experimental virus populations, (2) determine whether gene interactions evolve in the virus model as predicted from simpler, less realistic, models, and (3) experimentally test the predictions obtained from the mathematical model in real virus populations.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of genetic exchange is one of the oldest and most intractable problems in biology. In addition, the nature of gene interactions is a central focus for several areas of biology, including physiology and systems biology.  The study of gene interactions will have far-reaching consequences for understanding complex biological processes, including human diseases.  The completion of this work will generate new software tools that can be used to test a variety of additional hypotheses about evolutionary processes.  Finally, this award will be used to expand a Pen Pal Program piloted in 2013 in which graduate students engage middle school students in the process of scientific discovery by writing back and forth about their research and other scientific interests.",

It examined the critical role that interactions between genes play in the evolutionary origin of both recombination and of new species.  In both contexts, when genes interact to determine fitness, one important consequence of recombination is that it brings together into the same genome combinations of incompatible mutations: mutations that are adaptive individually, but deleterious in combination.  This project evaluated experimentally the importance of this consequence of recombination for the validity and generality of the most widely accepted theoretical predictions for the evolutionary origins of recombination and of new species.  \n\n\nThe researchers simulated the evolution of gene regulatory networks to demonstrate that selection against this cost of recombination results in a decrease in the frequency of such incompatible mutations and in the evolution of genomes that are less likely to suffer fitness costs as a result of either recombination or other perturbations to the genome like mutation.  The researchers identified several conditions in which this cost of recombination evolved to be sufficiently small to permit the evolutionary origin and maintenance of recombination. Recombination evolved in large (but not small) populations and in populations that had been subdivided into numerous small (but not too small) subpopulations with limited (but not too limited) migration of individuals between them.  \n\n\nThe researchers also investigated the pattern of accumulation of incompatible mutations among pairs of diverging populations.  They used a model of RNA folding to test one of the best known theoretical predictions in the field of speciation: that incompatible mutations should accumulate between diverging populations faster than linearly, a phenomenon known as the snowball effect.
