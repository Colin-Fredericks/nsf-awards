 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tissue engineering has focused on the generation of tissues using a patient's own cells to transplant failing tissues. By doing so, patients would avoid organ donor lists and immunosuppressive drugs, two of the biggest current obstacles for those in need of new organs. Although tissue engineering has shown success in small volume tissues, larger volumes have posed a greater challenge due to the inability to sustain cells in 3 dimensions (3D) both during growth and after implantation. Recent work has shown that the use of a bioreactor, a system that uses fluid flow to sustain cells in 3D, allows growth of large volume tissues. This research introduces a second population of cells to form a blood vessel network, to address sustaining the engineered tissue once implanted. This engineered tissue will then be implanted and assessed within a large animal bone graft model. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ming-Huei Cheng at Chang Gung Medical Center in Taiwan, who has previously established and translated a large animal bone graft model to human application. Integration and function of a live, engineered tissue implanted into an animal could present a realistic solution for large volume regenerative medicine.\r\n\r\nTo test this concept, adult stem cells previously used to form bone tissue (mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)) and endothelial cells obtained from adult peripheral blood (endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs)) will be used to form live tissue within the bioreactor. ECFCs and MSCs isolated from autologous pigs will be co-cultured using an aggregate angiogenesis assay in fibrin hydrogels to form interconnected vascular networks. Current research suggests that the presence of ECFCs improves the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, forming mineralized scaffolds. Multiple scaffolds will be cultured to form large volume tissues in a perfusion bioreactor. This nascent tissue will be implanted against the periosteum to promote tissue integration and remodeling. To assess integration and function of the scaffold, bone mineralization and vascularization will be quantified over time using histology. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project\u00c6s primary aim was to test the hypothesis that autologous progenitor and stem cells could be utilized to engineer a large volume of functional bone tissue for implantation.  A pig rib-bone graft model was proposed to test this hypothesis.  During the timeline of the grant, we successfully demonstrated the rib-bone graft model in pigs using morcellized bone grafts, which had previously been demonstrated with sheep.  MBG grafts implanted against the periosteum of the animal showed fusion with the host, and maintenance of mineralization throughout the volume of the implant.  To engineer our live bone scaffolds, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells were successfully isolated.  Endothelial colony-forming cells, which stained positive for the CD31 marker, were isolated from pig peripheral blood.  Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from bone marrow aspirate, and confirmed to differentiate to osteocytes using osteo-differentiation media.  This project has received additional funding from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and current efforts are investigating the use of these cells to engineer blood vessel networks within mineralized scaffolds.  During the timeline of the grant, a second project was also established based on the shared interests of the host and PI.  A rat cranial defect model was utilized to assess the use of 3D fibrin scaffolds with a perfusion bioreactor for bone tissue development.  Rat bone marrow stem cells were differentiated to osteogenic lineage using a perfusion bioreactor or under static condition.  Samples were implanted within the rat cranial defect model to assess bone tissue regeneration.  Implants grown in the bioreactor showed the greatest amount of mineralized tissue, as evaluated by uCT images.  This data will be presented at the 2015 TERMIS World Congress conference in Boston, MA as an oral presentation.  The data will also be prepared as a manuscript and submitted for publication.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jarel Gandhi"
