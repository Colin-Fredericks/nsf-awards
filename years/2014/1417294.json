The symposium, which will be held December 8 - 11, 2014, in Hyderabad, India, will bring together leading experts in multiphase fluid dynamics from around the world.  The symposium will feature invited and contributed research presentations as well as several poster sessions that will address important problems in multiphase systems that undergo phase change. \r\n \r\nMultiphase flows with phase change are important in a broad range of biological, geological and industrial applications such as cloud formation, absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by oceans, food processing, spray combustion, and certain chemical processing operations.  The emphasis on phase changes that take place in these multiphase systems makes the IUTAM symposium a unique technical conference.  In addition to formal research presentations, the meeting will include discussions of future research directions, which makes participation by US scientists and engineers especially important.  The award will provide support for young scientists, including students, to participate in the symposium, which will enhance the start of their science and engineering careers.",
