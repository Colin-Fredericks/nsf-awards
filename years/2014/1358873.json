Students will work with mentors who share their research interests and carry out independent research while interacting with graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and faculty in a setting with ready access to the nearshore environment. REU students will participate in a series of workshops designed to develop critical skills in experimental design, scientific writing and presentations. The students, under the guidance of faculty mentors, will then design, implement, analyze and report on independent laboratory and field research projects. Projects will focus on coastal and nearshore processes in the waters surrounding the research station. Research questions may address aspects of ecology, fisheries biology, evolution, ecosystem interactions, conservation, microbiology, biogeochemistry and physical oceanography. The REU students will attend seminars by DISL and visiting faculty, interact with resident graduate students and participate in individual lab group meetings, providing opportunities to explore research topics outside of their own projects. Students will also be encouraged to publish results of their research and to attend scientific conferences to present their work.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>This award provided research and career development opportunities in marine sciences for 19 undergraduate students (8 each year 2015-2016, plus 3 under supplemental funding in 2017) as part of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab?s (DISL) REU program.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 10-week summer session, students participated in a variety of field and lab-based research projects on topics in marine and estuarine sciences of the Gulf of Mexico coast, ranging from biochemistry and toxicology to ecology and applied fisheries. The program provided close interactions among REU students, faculty mentors, and other members of the DISL research and education community. To enhance career development and introduce students to a variety of options for science-based careers, students participated in workshops, field trips, brown bag discussions and seminars. Students presented their work in a poster at a formal symposium and were encouraged to write peer-reviewed papers and present their work at a scientific meeting following the internship.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, 15 presentations were given at scientific meetings by 11 students during the funding period, not including poster presentations as part of the REU program symposium. Two students (2015 REU program participants) matriculated in graduate programs at the University of South Alabama; one completed and published a thesis (MS in Marine Sciences, 2018) and one is continuing work on a dissertation (PhD in Marine Sciences) based on REU research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To increase diversity, recruit students from schools with limited research opportunities, and improve quantitative assessment of these efforts, we made several program enhancements: 1) We partnered with and recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities/ Minority Serving Institutions and Alabama?s Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium schools. PI Carmichael made 16 visits to campuses to raise awareness for the REU program and recruit students during the award period. Additional campuses were reached via presentations by former REU students and sending outreach materials to campus representatives. 2) We updated the online application system to better meet the needs of diverse students and allow more detailed demographic assessment. Improvements were aligned with REU program-wide assessment efforts. 3) We modified outreach materials to better reach diverse students and trained DISL faculty mentors to select diverse students.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the number of different ethnic minority groups inquiring about and applying to the DISL REU program increased, primarily driven by students identifying as African American, American Indian, and Pacific Islander. Completed applications from African American and Asian students increased 4-5 fold over previous years. The number of underserved participants, those from institutions without graduate programs or access to marine science programs and with below moderate levels of research activity, approximately doubled compared to previous years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research findings from this program have important scientific and management implications in topic areas of regional, national, and global importance. For example, a recent project on factors that control infestation of commercially harvested oysters by worms has implications for oyster aquaculture practices and the return on investment for shellfish farmers. Another project studied the routes of ciguatoxin accumulation in fish to reduce likelihood of human exposure and illness, and other recent work focused on understanding environmental variation than contributes to coral die-off, large-scale or long-term hypoxia patterns, and biogeochemical cycling at the base of marine food webs.&nbsp;All of these projects are important to&nbsp;protecting coastal resources, guiding resource use, and supporting education of the next generation in technical fields. By recruiting and training underserved and minority students primarily from Gulf-coast schools, we also built and retained intellectual capital in marine sciences and increased the diversity of participants in STEM fields. Students gained a greater appreciation for the inherent value of marine resources in our region while also gaining skills and confidence in doing science, increasing the likelihood that students will be accepted into programs of higher education or jobs in STEM fields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/14/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ruth&nbsp;H&nbsp;Carmichael</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358873/1358873_10305993_1547498079206_18766707_1771063223205265_8946696029051979861_o--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358873/1358873_10305993_1547498079206_18766707_1771063223205265_8946696029051979861_o--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2017 DISL REU program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358873/1358873_10305993_1547498079206_18766707_1771063223205265_8946696029051979861_o--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2017 DISL REU program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2017 DISL REU program participants</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">DISL REU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ruth&nbsp;H&nbsp;Carmichael</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2017 DISL REU program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358873/1358873_10305993_1547497288409_18518078_1766305903680997_8415147323256929031_o--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358873/1358873_10305993_1547497288409_18518078_1766305903680997_8415147323256929031_o--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MTabor-DISLREU2017\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358873/1358873_10305993_1547497288409_18518078_1766305903680997_8415147323256929031_o--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MTabor-DISLREU2017\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">DISL REU M.
