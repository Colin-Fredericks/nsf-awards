Some leading experts in these areas are confirmed as participants and will give lectures. Special attention is paid to recruit junior participants and members of underrepresented groups. Ample opportunity is provided to  graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.  The workshop is a part of a one semester thematic program including several minicourses in the research areas at the University of Pittsburgh.",
