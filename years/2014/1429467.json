 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for the acquisition of a shared high-performance computing (HPC) cluster to be used for data- and computation-intensive applications. The infrastructure supports research in three research areas: computational biology and bioinformatics; machine learning and data fusion; and infrastructure resilience and environmental sustainability. In each of these areas, there are multiple projects that benefit from the infrastructure. \r\nThis HPC cluster is the first such public infrastructure in South Jersey. Coupled with education and research programs focused on real-world problems, the HPC cluster aids classroom instruction in relevant courses in parallel processing and advanced computer architecture. HPC computation is incorporated into the curriculum of many general courses including the courses in Biomedical engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mathematics, Biological Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering program.\r\nThe HPC facilitates expanded educational opportunities at the undergraduate level in all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) areas.",
