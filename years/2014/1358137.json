 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Greece International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project annually offers eight U.S. senior undergraduate engineering students advanced training through cooperative research on sustainable indoor living environments at the Greek Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL) and the University of Crete (UoC). All activities are guided by the West Virginia University principal investigator, Konstantinos Sierros, and his Greek counterpart, George Kiriakidis who directs the Transparent Conducting Mterials Lab at IESL. While abroad, student participants will gain exposure to research trends and engineering challenges that concern functional materials, devices, and smart systems for sustainable living technologies.  Specifically, each student cohort will work collaboratively in several distinct sustainability areas at the interface of applied physics and engineering by conducting research on: metal oxide-based indoor gas sensing devices; printable photocatalytic materials for improving air quality; phase change materials and vacuum insulation panels for thermal insulation; and life-cycle analysis of materials and devices. Key to the overall research experience abroad is access to the partner's unique European prototypal facility located at the combined premises of IESL and the Science and Technology Park of Crete.  This site will serve as a test-bed and technology integration facility for the IRES activities. \r\n\r\nThe early career training and international research experience for undergraduate students on sustainable technologies can contribute to future U.S. competitiveness by helping to develop the next generation of experts on energy-efficient and sustainable living environments. Such globally engaged students are expected to become the backbone of our future engineering, energy and sustainability workforce. Their valuable training and cultural engagement are ensured by providing participants with careful mentoring while at IESL/UoC and by fostering effective collaboration with international counterparts before, during, and upon completion of the IRES experience.  For broader impact, the results of this project also are expected to strengthen future, long-term sustainability research collaboration between West Virginia University and IESL/UoC.",
