 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nThe project \"Mare Nostrum Caribbean\" (\"Our Caribbean Sea\") implements coral reef science in service to ecological stewardship, with the goal of understanding how best to improve coral reef sustainability in a region threatened by overfishing, marine pollution, sedimentation, invasive species, and climate change.  High-resolution coastal oceanographic models are being developed to increase understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances.  These efforts are creating a comprehensive understanding of the effects of climate change on coral reefs and associated ecosystems, and assisting in the development of potential climate change mitigation strategies.  \r\n \r\nThe project is increasing the intellectual involvement of Virgin Islanders with coral reef ecosystems and the stewardship of natural resources.  The Virgin Islands Institute for STEM Education Research and Practice uses five strategies to understand and develop best practices for formal and informal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the Territory.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe research will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and its resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states (i.e., ecological resilience).  Understanding these complex relationships is of paramount importance, especially considering that within the last decade corals in the U.S.  Virgin Islands have experienced nearly 50% mortality due to climate-induced stress from warm-water bleaching and disease.  Reef degradation increases the risk of coastal flooding, reduces fishery resources for local communities, is linked to reduced human health, and represents a tremendous loss of yet-undiscovered biological diversity.  Studies integrate ecological, oceanographic, environmental, and socio-economic factors to investigate the complex relationships found within coral reef ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands' ability to enhance environmental stewardship and implement economic change relies on an informed public, trained workforce and improved educational system.  Specific broader impacts include an increase in 1) the numbers of K-12 through graduate students in STEM research activities and educational advancement; 2) underrepresented minorities in STEM fields; 3) opportunities to improve STEM teaching at all levels; and 4) the knowledge of and participation in coral reef science by the general public and students of all levels.",

Marine diseases have devastating impacts on ocean ecosystems, including here in the US Virgin Islands. Our VI-EPSCoR Marine Disease project lead, Dr. Marilyn Brandt, has spearheaded a series of studies with her graduate students and research collaborators that characterized the ecology of various marine diseases and the variables (such as host susceptibility) that influence their spread- primarily targeting corals. Near the midpoint of our <em>Mare Nostrum </em>project, a new coral disease (Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease -SCTLD) was discovered in the VI and gave Brandt and her team a unique opportunity to track the disease from its introduction and study the physical factors (ocean currents, distance from nearby infections, etc.) that could influence disease spread and transmission. The insights from those observations led to a larger set of studies that have now culminated in the first grant awarded by NSF?s multiagency program on the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases to a recipient studying marine diseases. &nbsp;This new multi-million-dollar interdisciplinary research effort will develop a model that predicts transmission of SCTLD that has the potential to impact the economic value of coral reefs, including those located in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Teacher Professional Development.

Dr. Kristin Wilson Grimes and her team have organized several annual ?Great Mangrove Clean Up events in all three islands as part of a larger campaign that targets marine debris here in the US Virgin Islands. &nbsp;Approximately 3 tons of marine debris items have been removed from our mangroves, beaches and neighboring watersheds in community-driven clean-up efforts, including in a NOAA priority watershed and Marine Protected Area. As an example, the largest cleanup effort involved 115 volunteers aged 9-70, from 7 schools and thirteen other organizations who participated in the cleanup and removed more the 1,700 pounds of debris from vulnerable mangrove shorelines. Such effective community engagement efforts led to new funding from NOAAs Marine Debris Removal Program, which allowed Wilson Grimes and her colleagues to continue these annual cleanup for two additional years. In addition, the NOAA funds supported the creation of a Marine Debris Action Plan for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was a first for all U.S. insular areas. The plan has been critical to the coordination and prioritization of future marine debris removal, research, and prevention activities in the Territory, including policy decisions and future management actions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kim&nbsp;Waddell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632933415823_IMG_0720--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632933415823_IMG_0720--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coral Health Assessment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632933415823_IMG_0720--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coral Health Assessment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MMES graduate student Kyle Jerris assesses coral health condition after the passage of category 5 Hurricanes Irma and Maria.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M Brandt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kim&nbsp;Waddell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Coral Health Assessment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632933601860_IMG_0741--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632933601860_IMG_0741--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Great Mangrove Cleanup, Marine Debris Restoration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632933601860_IMG_0741--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Mangrove Cleanup, Marine Debris Restoration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Volunteers remove hurricane debris from mangroves in the St. Thomas East End Reserves, a marine protected area on St. Thomas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KW Grimes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kim&nbsp;Waddell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Great Mangrove Cleanup, Marine Debris Restoration</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632934381679_thumbnail_IMG_7249--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632934381679_thumbnail_IMG_7249--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Marine Debris Litter Shoreline in USVI\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632934381679_thumbnail_IMG_7249--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Debris Litter Shoreline in USVI\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Beverage bottles are the most commonly-collected item at marine debris cleanups of territorial mangroves.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KW Grimes</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kim&nbsp;Waddell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Marine Debris Litter Shoreline in USVI</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632934656855_IMG_8017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632934656855_IMG_8017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Assessment of Disease on Corals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1355437/1355437_10327473_1632934656855_IMG_8017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Assessment of Disease on Corals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">White plague disease affects reef-building coral in Brewers Bay, St. Thomas.
