Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2014 program will feature four principal speakers (Alice Chang, Frank Merle, Maciej Zworski, and Alexandru Ionescu), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.",
