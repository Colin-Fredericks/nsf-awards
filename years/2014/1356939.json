This conference is proposed in order to highlight the recent advances and new perspectives in applied analysis and computational mathematics, focusing on theoretical, computational and applied aspects of partial differential equations. The meeting will bring together researchers from different disciplines and provide a unique opportunity for in-depth technical discussions and exchange of ideas in all areas involving mathematical and computational sciences, modeling and simulations, as well as their applications. The conference topics are: the study of time-dependent partial differential equations including hyperbolic conservation laws and their numerical approximations, nonlinear wave patterns, image processing, kinetic PDE models in biological processes, social network dynamics, traffic and pedestrian flows, theory and numerics of interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will serve as a forum for researchers at different stages of their career to share experiences, exchange ideas, and explore new collaborations.  The conference will provide opportunities to promote scientific advances at the interface between mathematics and the physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering. The meeting will be used to identify new large-scale problems that require innovative mathematical approaches. The organizers will take several measures to attract young scientists. Graduate students, postdocs, and early-career professors will be encouraged to attend.",
