 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given society's dependence on information technology, the commercial impact of a variety of cryptographic products is clear.  The proposed 'homomorphic'encrypton methods can help companies and individuals protect privacy of their data in various electronic interactions, especially those carried out in a shared public infrastructure such as a Cloud.  The I-Corps team's proposed cryptographic encryption methods provide the security for Cloud users at a lower computation cost (hence, faster and cheaper) than existing methods.  Some of the potential segments that can be served by this project are: (1) hospital and medical providers or medical insurance companies who do not have the resources to maintain their own data storage but want to do statistical analysis, process billing, etc; and (2) manufacturers of small devices that outsource  computations or storage to the cloud.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses privacy issues in the Cloud. In this project, this team forwards cryptographic encryption software that can integrate with clients' specific needs in two main areas: cloud storage/computing and cloud computing with 'vanishing' key.  The main goal of this proposal is to explore new avenues and new approaches for the construction of homomorphic encryption, with the primary motivation of designing schemes that would be substantially more efficient than the known ones, and therefore would have practical and commercial value. This is not just a matter of improving the existing schemes but requires a totally new and different approach, one that could lead to further insights and understanding of this research field.",
