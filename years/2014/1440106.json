The summer school is titled: Flowing Soft Matter: Bridging the Gap between Statistical Physics and Fluid Mechanics.  The theme of the summer school is to understand how the complimentary tools of statistical physics and fluid mechanics can lead to new insights into the physics of flowing soft matter.  The materials under consideration at the summer school will include polymer solutions, colloidal suspensions, gels, and emulsions, which are found in many important products.  Improving our ability to process these materials effectively and efficiently will benefit a variety of industries.  By participating in the institute, US students and young researchers will gain unique opportunities to learn from international experts, meet key international leaders in their research fields, and exchange ideas and experiences with international peers. \r\n\r\nThe summer school will provide participants with an overview of the field of flowing soft matter and will examine methods that use statistical physics and fluid mechanics to improve our ability to predict quantitatively the behavior of rheologically challenging materials.  The instructors and participants in the institute will be from the US, UK, France, Italy, and other European countries.  The institute is supported by the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) and UNESCO.  European participants are supported by their home countries.  This award will provide similar support for US participants.",
