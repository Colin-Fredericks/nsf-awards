 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Jong-in Hahm and her students in the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University conducts research to advance understanding of the common but very complex phenomenon of protein adsorption onto polymer surfaces. The process of protein adsorption onto solid surfaces impacts essential everyday applications in food processing/packaging, health devices, diagnostic tools, and medical products.  Specifically, Prof. Hahm's research team focuses on investigating the nature of protein-surface interactions at the nanoscale whose size regime is increasingly becoming crucial for the development of highly miniaturized protein detection and diagnostic devices.  The multifaceted approach of this project aims to provide fundamental insights for protein-domain specific adsorption on nanoscale polymeric surfaces which, in turn, will be valuable in laying the foundation for guiding principles to create next generation protein arrays.  Through this research, graduate, undergraduate, and local high school students learn the state-of-the-art techniques of optical imaging and materials characterization.  Students also gain experience in conducting solid-state protein assays in a quantitative manner using newly developed polymer-based protein nanoarrays.\r\n\r\nIn this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Hahm's research team elucidates both static and dynamic interaction preferences between individual proteins and polymeric domains at the single- and sub-biomolecule level.  Sub-biomolecular resolution structural imaging of individual proteins is carried out by high-resolution atomic force microscopy.  In addition, kinetic measurements of protein adsorption onto various size-scale polymeric surfaces are performed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.  This research aims to narrow the nanoscale-macroscale gap and promote our understanding of nanoscale protein adsorption through combined experimental and theoretical approaches.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project was focused on examining the main interaction forces that govern protein adsorption to nanoscale polymeric surfaces that exhibit periodically arranged, nanoscopic areas of different chemical properties.  Nanoscale protein self-assembly processes on these surfaces were systematically elucidated.  Using a model protein called fibrinogen, key protein-surface interaction forces such as hydrophobic/hydrophilic, electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonding interactions were studied.  The exact roles and degrees of interactions involved in the adsorption and assembly process between individual fibrinogen proteins and the nanoscale block copolymer surface of polystyrene-b-polymethylmethacrylate were determined.  Fibrinogen adsorption behaviors that uniquely occur only from its interaction with the nanoscale, chemically heterogeneous polymer surfaces were revealed. Fibrinogen has a high biomedical importance as it plays a pivotal role in hemostasis (the process that stops blood loss from a damaged vessel) and wound healing.  The basic knowledge gained and the experimental parameters identified from the study, particularly those responsible for the unique interactions at the nanoscale regime, can be used to control the affinity and self-assembly behaviors of proteins on the nanoscale polymer surfaces.  In addition, the project led to the training of undergraduate and graduate students from a diverse background in the highly disciplinary research topic that can ultimately impact the development of advanced biomaterials, biodevices, and bioimplant materials.  The project results were disseminated as multiple scientific journal papers.  The results were also presented to the science community as well as to the public in the form of invited/contributed talks/posters in various meetings and seminar series.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Angel De Dios"
