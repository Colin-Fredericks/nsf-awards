This fire burned for nearly 10 weeks and was reported 100 % contained October 26, 2013.  The research team has already collected the first set of samples which are post-fire and pre-rain.  The next sampling will be post-rain as close to initial runoff as possible.  One of the big questions is how did this fire affect the water quality of the reservoirs in and around Yosemite National Park and what might be the impact subsequently on drinking water quality.  The burning will likely increase the concentration of chemicals controlled under the Safe Drinking Water Act, namely polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  However; little to no information is known on the potential formation of black carbon, soot to most of us, and its impact on water quality or drinking water quality.  Another unknown is the impact of the fire on natural organic matter from the forest floor.  This organic matter from \"leaf litter\" is normally transported to streams, rivers and lakes by rain and it may lead to the formation of disinfection by-products during water treatment.  The impact of fires on this organic matter is unknown and because the waters in the surrounding area are the source of drinking water it may affect drinking water quality.  Through the association of the PIs with California Department of Fish and Game and the CA State Water Resources Control Board material will be developed for use by the Agencies education and outreach programs.",
