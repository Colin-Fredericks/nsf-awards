However, the potential impact of increasingly sophisticated recent advances in optical technology, such as rapid switching and elastic wavelengths, have not yet been realized.  The main cause of this is that such technology, while possible to integrate into the data plane of planetary networking, is difficult to accommodate in the current planning, management, and control strategies.\n\nIn this project, funding from the National Science Foundation allowed us to work hand-in-hand with collaborating researchers from NICT, Japan, who had been working to realize a novel technology of hybrid optical packet/circuit switching.  Such a technology could be immensely useful to large transport network operators, but there are no existing algorithms that can easily determine how a provider can provision their resources between the circuit and packet possibilities on an ongoing dynamic basis.\n\nWe took a novel approach to this problem, utilizing the concept, introduced by our own previous research project, of a \"choice marketplace\" that embodies sophisticated rendezvous semantics between customer and provider, and allows them to cooperatively guide network resource provisioning to dynamically fulfill network objectives such as maximizing performance received by network traffic.  Our approach also allows balancing of various objectives, such as network utilization, latency, and the increasingly important metric of energy expenditure in the network.\n\nStep-by-step, we designed, and built demonstration prototypes for, the key conceptual pieces of the envisioned system.  One of our first results were a seamless fashion in which a specific service could be inserted into the path of a single application flow at an intermediate switch or router, without slowing down the rest of the traffic transiting that switch.  Next, we designed a marketplace specifically designed to enable network providers with futuristic hybrid packet/circuit optical switches to provide path and service alternatives to customers with specific source-to-destination traffic flows.  We designed the software agents to engage in the marketplace on behalf of providers and customers, and studied their interactions to identify useful win-win strategies that allow co-optimization of network resources, to benefit both customers and providers.  To do so, we needed to craft an entire semantic \"language\" to allow the agents to exchange appropriate negotiation messages.  At the heart of the concept of choice is that more useful services will win out in competition in the marketplace, but this mechanism does not work unless the choice is backed by actual purchasing power.  Accordingly, we need not just a marketplace, but a completely \"economy plane\" of the network.  To complete a working economy plane, some of our research efforts went to showing how our marketplace and user agents could integrate seamlessly with both existing and futuristic automated payment systems such as PayPal and bitcoins.\n\nBeyond disseminating our research in the traditional academic papers and presentations, we made actual demonstrations of our working prototypes at appropriate venues.  We demonstrated our prototype for a marketplace and an integrated payment system at Infocom Live in 2016.  Another prototype, of our research on extending Openflow for service insertion and payload inspection (which was published at ICNP), was demonstrated live twice ? once at the 22nd GENI Engineering Conference in Washington DC in March 2015, and another time at the Global City Teams Challenge organized by NIST and US Ignite, in Washington DC in June 2015, both times in collaboration with Extreme Networks, and using their commercial grade equipment.
