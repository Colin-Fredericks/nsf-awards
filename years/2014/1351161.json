It exploits the characteristics behind the operation of supercapacitors and flow batteries, combining (i) the scalable energy capacity of flow batteries with (ii) high power ratings, rapid charging and long cycle-life characteristics of supercapacitors.&#8232;The main idea is capacitive energy storage in a flowable media. As such, the unique aspect is the utilization of flowable capacitive slurry electrodes&#8232;that contain porous activated carbon particles suspended in an electrolyte. Although much&#8232;is known about suspension flow and capacitive charge storage in thin film electrodes, currently&#8232;there is no theoretical framework describing the coupling between these two processes. As&#8232;a result, there are a number of fundamental questions that need to be addressed in order to&#8232;develop this concept into a practical technology. Motivated by this, the research objective&#8232;here is to establish the enabling science necessary to address the critical scientific gaps related to the capacitive charge storage in flowable media. In line with this&#8232;goal, the PI will conduct studies to (i) explore the nature of charge percolation between&#8232;the carbon particles in the slurry; and (ii) assess the interplay between slurry composition, performance, system architecture and operational losses.  To amplify the impact of this research, an integrated educational plan is planned that targets&#8232;a large body of students ranging from K-12 to graduate level. The educational objectives are&#8232;a) to inspire young people, especially females and minorities, to explore careers in STEM,&#8232;and b) to enhance energy education at Drexel University. These activities include development of a new course on energy storage and research experience for undergraduates, K-12 students&#8232;and teachers by leveraging international and domestic programs at Drexel. In addition, the&#8232;PI will develop a parental engagement program that targets the parents of minority students&#8232;in Philadelphia to better utilize them as partners in STEM education. The goal will be to increase parental awareness of opportunities in STEM and help them motivate&#8232;their children to pursue careers in STEM.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis project will constitute a major step toward establishing the enabling science of flowable capacitive slurry electrodes for use in electrical energy storage. Specifically, it will provide an in-depth understanding of the nature of charge percolation between the capacitive carbon particles in a flowable slurry and help establish a framework for describing the coupling between suspension flow and capacitive charge storage. Moreover, this work will expand the knowledge in colloidal science by investigating a unique class of capacitive suspensions that can be used for energy storage. Besides contributing&#8232;to this concept, the resulting knowledge will help better understand the particle interactions and double layer formation in conventional supercapacitors, and will provide useful insights into other slurry electrode systems (e.g. capacitive water deionization and semi-solid batteries).\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe project will facilitate the implementation of a new energy storage concept, which can potentially approach ~10x higher power density and ~100x faster charging rates with longer lifetime (~100k cycles) than batteries. Development of such systems will overcome challenges associated with grid-scale energy storage and enable better utilization of renewable resources. This project also offers significant opportunities to extend the impact of the research to a larger audience. A large number of students will be affected by this work. Two Ph.D. students, several undergraduates, K-12 students and high school teachers will be directly involved in energy research through international and domestic programs at Drexel. Additionally, more than thirty students per year are expected to enroll in a newly developed energy storage course. Connections between research and service to society will be fostered through the parental engagement workshops that will focus on the role of engineers in society. Special emphasis in these workshops will be given to the parents of students from traditionally underrepresented groups to help increase their enrollment in STEM.",
