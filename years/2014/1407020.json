 "awd_abstract_narration": "What factors drive a female to choose a particular mate? This is an important question to scientists interested in animal behavior, sexual selection, and life history theory. Individual variation in female mate preferences and choice is common.  However, our understanding of the mechanisms behind this phenomenon is still quite limited. There are a few proposed sources of individual variation in mate choice, and the purpose of this research is to investigate the role of reproductive age in female mate preference and choosiness.  The research team will experimentally accelerate reproductive aging in young female hamsters to determine if reproductive age modulates mate choice behavior. This will be the first study to assess the effects of reproductive aging on behavior in mammals.  The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of animal behavior, the factors that might affect individual differences in behavior, and animal reproduction. \r\n\r\nReproductive quality declines with age in female mammals at a more rapid rate than other bodily systems.  This rate varies among individuals, making it a potential source of variation in mate choice behavior. To decouple the effects of reproductive and chronological age on choosiness, young adult female Syrian hamsters will be treated with 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), which specifically accelerates ovarian aging through oocyte depletion without compromising other physiological systems or life span. VCD-treated females will be given an opportunity to choose between a dominant and subordinate male hamster, and their preferences will be compared to vehicle-injected females. Young females typically choose the dominant male in this situation. If the preference for dominant male hamsters by young VCD-treated females is reduced relative to controls, then this result will emphasize the importance of reproductive quality, independent of chronological age, in explaining the individual variation in female mate choice. The products of this research will be widely disseminated and used for educational purposes.  The project will also enhance scientific training of both graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of reproductive biology and animal behavior. Data generated by this project will include video recordings of female mate choice behavior and the tabulation of those data in Excel files. These data will be stored indefinitely in eCommons, a digital repository system at Cornell University. All eCommons content will be openly accessible worldwide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research was to better understand the factors that influence a female's decision to choose a particular mate. Individual variation in female mate preferences and choice is common. However, our understanding of the mechanisms behind this phenomenon is still quite limited. There are a few proposed sources of individual variation in mate choice, and the purpose of this research was to investigate the role of the ovarian reserve (i.e. number of ovarian follicles) in female mate preference and choosiness. Reproductive quality and ovarian reserve decline with age in female mammals at a more rapid rate than other bodily systems. This rate varies among individuals, making it a potential source of variation in mate choice behavior. We experimentally accelerated ovarian follicle depletion in young female Syrian hamsters with the chemical 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) to determine if the ovarian reserve modulates mate choice behavior. A prior study showed that chronologically old female hamsters displayed a reduced preference for dominant over subordinate males.\n\n\n\nIn this study, VCD effectively reduced the ovarian reserve in young hamsters. VCD-treated and control females were allowed to choose between a dominant and a subordinate male in a Y-maze on the day of proestrus. Both VCD-treated and control females demonstrated preference for the dominant male by leaving a greater proportion of vaginal scent marks near him, which is a behavior that females display when soliciting prospective mates. However, there was no effect of VCD treatment on the proportion of vaginal scent marks left for the dominant male. The data suggest that the ovarian reserve alone does not influence female mate preference in the hamster \n\n\nTo our knowledge, this was the first study to specifically evaluate the role of reproductive quality in female mate preference in a mammal. The results of this study provide a direction for future studies on aging and female mate choice, which may involve the extra-ovarian characteristics of aging.  \n\n\nData generated by this project included video recordings of female mate choice behavior and the tabulation of those data in Excel files. These data are stored indefinitely in eCommons, an openly accessible digital repository system at Cornell University. Researchers interested in female mating behavior may find these products useful. Over the life of this award, the Co-PI broadened her training to include animal behavior research. This project was also served as the final chapter of her doctoral dissertation. In addition, an undergraduate student was trained and participated in the research. The results of this research were disseminated at a national meeting (Animal Behavior Society) and in a peer-reviewed journal (Physiology and Behavior). \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ned J Place"
