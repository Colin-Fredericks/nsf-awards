The themes of the meetings scheduled for the period covered by this award are the following: harmonic analysis and spectral theory, with principal lecturer Sasha Volberg and with a special afternoon session honoring the contributions of Cora Sadosky to the discipline and featuring talks by Jill Pipher, Sergei Treil, and Svitlana Mayboroda (2014, Albuquerque); dispersive partial differential equations, with principal lecturer Monica Visan (2015, Las Cruces); partial differential equations and harmonic analysis, with principal lecturer Chris Sogge (2016, Albuquerque). The conference format provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
