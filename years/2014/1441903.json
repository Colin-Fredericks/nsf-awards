The impact on\r\nthese students? education and enthusiasm for research in high-performance computing and distributed\r\nsystems will be high. They will have the opportunity to witness first hand cutting edge research,\r\npresentations, and discussions, an experience they would likely not otherwise.\r\n\r\nHPDC seeks to increase student participation in the symposium as well as the field in general.\r\nThe funding will support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients\r\nwill be able to attend the main conference and associated workshops. Travel grants will encourage\r\nthe research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded\r\nand those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering\r\nit. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.",
