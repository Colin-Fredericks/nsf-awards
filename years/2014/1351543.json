The workshop will be held in Cancun, Mexico in May 2014.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to enhance innovation, design, and biomedical applications of colloids, interfaces, and separation systems that could revolutionize research and manufacturing practices in the U.S. In this integrative communications program, it is propose to mix researchers who have dedicated their lives to investigations and discoveries in colloids, interfacial science, and separations with mid-term and young scientists in STEM disciplines to promote their interaction. The objective is to catalyze collaborations that lead to high impact invention, enterprise, and medical research. \r\n\r\nA 5 - 8 day meeting is proposed. It is expect that national and international experts in experimental and theoretical CAI and STEM who would not normally meet to exchange ideas will convene, with the goal of interdisciplinary advances that will benefit all investigators.\r\n\r\nThe organizing committee will develop a website for consolidating registration and disseminating learning and logistic information about the workshop. The PI anticipates having publishing the workshop results in two special issues of Langmuir and the Journal of Colloids and Surfaces. The editors of both journals have expressed interest.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop will be co-funded by the Office of Naval Research.",
