 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PHENO conference series provides a unique forum for experimentalists and theoretical physics to come together and discuss the latest developments in high-energy particle physics and cosmology. The topics discussed include emerging physics made possible by recent experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland. Particle physicists will discuss connections between LHC experimental results and results from other collider- and non-collider based experiments in elementary particle physics. As such, PHENO will emphasize a variety of current topics in particle physics phenomenology, collider physics, neutrino physics, particle astrophysics, and cosmology, as well as new theoretical and computational developments. The 2014, 2015 and 2016 PHENO conferences will be held each May at the University of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nNSF support for this conference is critical for early-career physicists, students and postdocs, to attend the PHENO Symposia. For many graduate students in particle physics, PHENO represents the first forum where they showcase their research. Students and postdocs have the opportunity to meet their peers, gain valuable research feedback, and develop contacts with senior physicists. A series of parallel sessions provides the participants with the opportunity to give brief accounts of their current research and start new collaborations. To encourage young participants to attend, the tradition of the PHENO conferences is that graduate students can attend the PHENO Conferences free of charge, and postdocs have a reduced conference fee compared to more senior participants.",
