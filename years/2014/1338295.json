 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to conduct detailed studies of anatomically preserved fossil plants from deposits in India that were growing at a time when the Indian subcontinent was about to collide with southern Asia. The focus of the research is on the floristic changes that occurred as a result of that continental collision, and the global biological catastrophe that it is hypothesized to have caused. The Intertrappean beds developed during intervals between major plateau basalt eruptions of the late Cretaceous-early Paleocene are famous for their fossil content, including remains of terrestrial mammals, dinosaurs, mammals, molluscs and abundant fossil plants. Fossils that are the focus of this study are among the most extensive and well preserved in the paleontological record. Detailed knowledge of the fossil plants preserved in those beds, and the floristic turnover from the Late Cretaceous through the basal Paleogene will provide a benchmark for understanding the relationship between climatic and floristic change.\r\n\r\nBecause this study will focus on climate-change driven changes in regional and global floristics, it has great potential to provide insights about vegetational changes that are likely to result from the global climate change that is beginning at this time. Obviously, these insights will help predict the types of global vegetational changes that we may expect to see in the near future, and help inform decisions about how to manage such changes through the selective allocation of resources. The disciplines that\r\nare represented by the PI team, and the approach that has been proposed is comprehensive and potentially transformative with respect to the vital insights that will result from characterization of floristic changes through this crucial period in the history of the earth. The combined use of broad-based plant systematics, coupled with detailed studies of flowers, fruits, and wood to address these important\r\nquestions is a most ambitions and creative approach that has not previously been attempted.",

Although the species differ, Paleogene sites are not significantly different in composition at the family level from each other and overlap with the families seen in Maastrichtian sites, suggesting a contraction. Climate over the time period is interpreted as being relatively steady, i.e., not changing in response to the local volcanism or global meteorite impact. However, plants show a marked turnover across the boundary, with a limited set of plants found in both Cretaceous and Paleogene sites, suggesting they are primarily responding to environmental factors other than climate change. This could include environmental stress from volcanic-gas derived acid rain, unresolved shifts in climate seasonality, or could be an artifact of the current age model and the extinctions could be more directly contemporaneous with the KPg impact event. This project supported the training of two female PhD students and eight undergraduates. </span></span> </span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/10/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Selena&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
