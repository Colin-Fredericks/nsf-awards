 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics with profound implications for our view of the Universe. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nThe identification of Dark Matter (DM) poses a challenge that is being addressed with a variety of complementary approaches and technologies. The direct search for DM with the XENON project at the Gran Sasso laboratory promises an extremely cost-efficient approach to cover vast regions of expected DM parameter space. This award will enable the US groups in XENON to participate in the operations and data analysis of XENON100 well into 2015 when the start of the scientific program with XENON1T is expected. With a strong presence at Gran Sasso, the US groups will maintain a leading role in the commissioning and operation of XENON1T. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nA number of students as well as post-doctoral researchers are involved in the XENON project at universities across the US. They are exposed to a variety of subjects in fundamental physics and cosmology, and trained in the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies, preparing them to become future leaders in the field. The instrumentation and techniques used in XENON are relevant to a wide range of applications, from areas in homeland security and medical imaging, to the analysis and statistical treatment of large data sets.",

XENON1T uses ultra-pure liquid xenon in a cryostat made from carefully selected materials to reduce the radioactive background from known particles. It is located about a mile deep underground in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in central Italy to shield it from cosmic rays, and further within a large water tank for additional shielding against ambient radiation as well. The liquid xenon is instrumented with highly sensitive, single-photon sensors in a so-called time projection chamber (TPC) so that each particle interaction can be pictured in three dimensions. This helps to further reduce radioactive backgrounds, which are mostly located near the materials, from dark matter interactions that are expected to occur uniformly throughout the xenon volume.

After a one-year search, XENON1T has found no evidence for the presence of dark matter. The search results, published in Physical Review Letters, are based on 1300 kg out of the total 2000 kg active xenon target and 279 days of data, making it the first WIMP search with a noble liquid target exposure of 1.0 tonne x year. Only two background events were expected in the innermost, cleanest region of the detector, but none were detected, setting the most stringent constraints on WIMP interactions to date.
