 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is optically measured material in the oceans resulting from the degradation of organic matter. While the importance of CDOM in the optical properties and biogeochemistry of marine waters has been well established over the last several decades, the source and structure of this material within the ocean basins remains unclear. Some studies indicate that CDOM is produced primarily in situ from either the chemical or biological processing of marine materials, while others have provided evidence that CDOM is primarily a remnant of terrestrial matter that has been diluted and modified during transit to and within the oceans. In this study, researchers from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies will use complete spectral absorption and emission properties combined with chemical and mass spectral tests on samples from the North Pacific Ocean to determine the source and structure of CDOM. The results will be compared with those previously acquired, or to be acquired, from the Delaware Bay, the Middle Atlantic Bight, and the Equatorial Atlantic. By employing this multifaceted approach, the researchers will significantly advance our knowledge of CDOM.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will provide support for graduate and undergraduate student training, and results will be broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed research publications and presentations at national meetings, where student-led presentations will be emphasized.",
