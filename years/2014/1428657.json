 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Latha Ramakrishnan from St. Cloud State University and colleagues Tamara Leenay, Mohammad Mahroof-Tahir and Mark Mechelke will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at St. Cloud State University and neighboring institutions such as North Hennepin Community College as well as local and regional industries.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigating fundamental biochemical principles such as the function and mechanism of action of major inhibitory and excitatory neural communication systems in flatworms; (b) studying the mechanism of toxicity of natural producs towards cancer cells; (c) investigating structure-properties, i.e., physical, chemical, and electronic relationships of vanadium complexes to decode their potential anti-diabetic mechanisms; and (d) studying the mechanism of cytotoxicity of cyclic Mannich bases.",

Acquisition of modern instrumentation such as the JEOL ECZ 400 MHz has enabled us to continue to provide our hallmark undergraduate research training and senior capstone experience to all of our graduates, thus preparing them for success in graduate school.  During the three years of this project, 20 undergraduate researchers, over 300 undergraduate students in multiple upper-level chemistry lab classes, and 9 community college students have had the opportunity to gain hands-on training/experience on this instrumentation.  The undergraduate researchers working under the close mentorship of faculty advisors have asked diverse research questions and have made significant progress in the following areas: 1) design and synthesis of novel chemotherapeutic and cholesterol lowering drugs using natural products as templates; 2) synthesis and charge carrier mobility determination of polyacene semiconductors; 3) fabrication and characterization of polymeric nanoparticles; and 4)design, synthesis, and characterization of novel cytotoxic agents.  The outcomes from these research inquiries have been disseminated through two peer-reviewed publications and 17 student poster/paper presentations at local/regional research colloquium, including one poster presentation at the National Council on Undergraduate Research conference.  In addition, vertical integration of the theory and operation, and hand-on experience on this instrumentation in multiple chemistry lab classes has helped in preparing our graduates to be workforce ready.  With the recent launch of a professional science Master?s program in materials science and scientific instrumentation (first such program in the region), the eight students in the first two cohorts and students in the future cohort are bound to gain in-depth knowledge about the operation and application of this fundamental analytical chemistry instrumentation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Latha Ramakrishnan"
