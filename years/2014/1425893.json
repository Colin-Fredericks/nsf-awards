 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a 2-day workshop for 40 participants to catalyze relationships between early career disciplinary researchers in the earth, atmospheric, ocean, and polar sciences and discipline-based education researchers (DBERs) in the geosciences. These relationships are critical for two reasons: (1) to address the foundational research needed on how people learn geoscience content and develop into expert geoscientists and (2) to facilitate early career geoscientists in enhancing the broader impacts of their research. The workshop will be convened to grow mutually beneficial research collaborations amongst early career investigators that will build upon the extant literature. This workshop will promote networking amongst geoscience investigators and DBERs to broaden perspectives, develop connections, and nurture a community of future leaders for the geoscience community. The participants at this workshop will establish professional relationships that are likely to inform research and educational practices for the community at large. Moreover, it is expected that through these interactions the teaching practices of both groups would be better informed and training of future geoscientists will be well informed by research results. The workshop will take place in the Washington DC area in August 2014.",

Figure 1 demonstrates that the workshop was successful in promoting networking between the two groups, prepared people to enter into new collaborative research relationships, and gave them ideas for new directions for their geoscience education project. A follow up survey one year after the workshops revealed that the researchers felt this was a valuable use of their time and they have continued their professional development by subscribing to new journals, joining new professional societies, or building collaborations with researchers from other disciplines in their universities. A significant outcome from this workshop is the new research project, teaching projects, and outreach projects that have continued as a result of the relationships build at ENGAGE. The researchers made three important recommendations to advance geoscience education research. First, a dedicated NSF solicitation that could support geoscientists in their disciplinary research and geoscience education in studying domain learning would build scholarship in both domains and foster collaboration. Second, the researchers felt future opportunities to meet are important to continue to broaden the scope of research being done in geoscience education. This approach could accelerate the impact of geoscience education research on the teaching and learning of undergraduate geosciences. Lastly, the community needs to raise the profile of geoscience education research as a scholarly endeavor that contributes to the geosciences and is worthy of tenure and promotion. This would help address the need for more research on how to provide the best training of future geoscientists to ensure the future of the geoscience workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/15/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;Taber</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425893/1425893_10301093_1468619328010_ENGAGE_EOS_Figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425893/1425893_10301093_1468619328010_ENGAGE_EOS_Figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Excerpts from the post-workshop survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425893/1425893_10301093_1468619328010_ENGAGE_EOS_Figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Excerpts from the post-workshop survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The ENGAGE workshop fostered cross-disciplinary networking among participants (n=28) and enabled most to become better prepared to enter into cross- disciplinary (social and physical science) relationships.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Hubenthal and Nicole LaDue</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Taber</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Excerpts from the post-workshop survey</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425893/1425893_10301093_1468619002226_engage_banner_9-3-14c--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425893/1425893_10301093_1468619002226_engage_banner_9-3-14c--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ENGAGE workshop logo\"><i...",
