The PI is formulating a steering committee that is in turn identifying topics and establishing a workshop agenda, including speakers and panelists.  Specific objectives of the PI meeting include:\r\n\r\n- to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC PIs working on different projects;\r\n- to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and researchers in other disciplines;\r\n- to share experiences and learn from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice; and\r\n- to develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nBuilding a strong community among SaTC researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of existing research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate students.",
