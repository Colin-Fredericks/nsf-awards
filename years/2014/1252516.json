Under-represented faculty in STEM have an essential role in the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. In addition, the project will assist in the promotion of the NSF's Career-Life Balance Initiative in an effort to retain, advance and support the early careers of women of color in the STEM workforce. Consequently there will be the broadening of participation, and enhancing diversity within the Foundation's programs as well as address key quality of life issues to aid in the recruitment and retention of early career faculty.",

The project supported the Foundation&rsquo;s broadening participation goals. Workshops were held in March 2014 and March 2015.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NSF Program Officers from various Research Directorates participated in the workshops along with QEM consultants/staff representing the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, engineering education, and physics. Discipline-focused concurrent sessions included the review and revision of CAREER project summaries submitted prior to the workshop by participants. Program Officers and consultants provided feedback on faculty project ideas and scholarly development. Seven (7) NSF CAREER and Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) award recipients from groups underrepresented in STEM served as QEM consultants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A total of 125 STEM junior faculty representing 72 institutions participated in the workshops (1 attended twice). Eighty (80) STEM faculty from 57 institutions (27 HBCUs, 22 HSIs, 5 non-MSIs, and 3 TCUs) in 27 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, attended the March 2014 workshop. Forty-six (46) faculty from 34 institutions located in 16 states, DC, and the Virgin Islands attended the March 2015 workshop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the end of the 2014 workshop, over 50 percent (45) of the participants planned to submit a proposal by the July 2014 deadline. QEM conducted a follow-up survey with participants and nineteen (19) of the 67 respondents (28 percent) submitted CAREER proposals to the NSF BIO/CISE/ENG/MPS research directorates; while 57 indicated they had submitted or planned to submit proposals to other NSF programs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>QEM surveyed the March 2015 workshop participants to determine how many had submitted CAREER proposals in the 2015 competition. Thirty-nine (39) of the 46 participants (84 percent) responded, of which 11 (28 percent) submitted CAREER proposals by the July 2015 deadlines, to various NSF research directorates. Twenty-one (21) respondents indicated they planned on submitting in a later competition. Some inhibiting factors cited by respondents who had not submitted CAREER proposals included: lack of publication record or preliminary research data; teaching load; refining ideas for next submission deadline; and funding received from other sources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>HIGHLIGHT</em>.&nbsp; QEM&rsquo;s March 2017 review of NSF&rsquo;s awards database showed that <strong>35 of the 125 faculty CAREER workshop attendees received 45 NSF awards, totaling </strong><strong>$12,290,661</strong>, since the workshop. Awards included: 8 CAREER; 2 from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program; 17 Research Initiation Awards from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities&ndash;Undergraduate Program&nbsp; (HBCU-UP); and 2 from the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The QEM CAREER workshops emphasized the importance of developing a narrative that adequately addressed the research and education plan components of a CAREER proposal. Participants were exposed to a rigorous process during which they were required to share their ideas and revise their project summaries based on feedback received. This experience was designed to enhance participants&rsquo; proposal development skills and increase awareness of NSF&rsquo;s CAREER Program as well as NSF proposal development and review criteria. Plenary sessions emphasized the integration of STEM research into teaching and outreach/service activities. The agendas, with links to presentations, were posted at the QEM&rsquo;s website to facilitate sharing with a broader audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>QEM continues to promote the NSF CAREER Program through its network of MSI contacts. QEM staff prepared a Workshop E-Resource File that included live links to information and resource materials on: NSF proposal preparation; related NSF and other federal programs; faculty scholarly development; and student mentoring and support. The E-Resource file was distributed to participants via email and in workshop packets as well as placed at the project website <a href=\"http://www.qem.org/career\">http://www.qem.org/career</a> for access and download by the general public. It also was shared STEM faculty at a range of QEM professional development workshops.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NSF/CAREER support for junior faculty at MSIs and for minority faculty at other institutions can help address the underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, and Alaska Natives in STEM disciplines. Faculty members from these groups are encouraged to pursue cutting-edge research, integrate their research and teaching, and mentor minority undergraduate and graduate students. The project&rsquo;s involvement of CAREER and PECASE awardees provided exposure to potential role models and mentors to motivate and stimulate retention and persistence of junior faculty at MSIs. Resulting research opportunities and enriched STEM courses will ensure more students at MSIs are better prepared to pursue STEM graduate degrees and careers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This QEM project was designed to increase the participation, contribution, leadership, and success of groups underrepresented in STEM through successful CAREER projects. Broadening participation in STEM will strengthen the competitiveness of the U.S. workforce of the future. The project also provided an opportunity for STEM faculty to develop relationships and potential collaborations that can add to the knowledge base at their institutions and the STEM community beyond.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/26/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ivory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Toldson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493248096849_AboutQEMNetwork--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493248096849_AboutQEMNetwork--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"About the QEM Network\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493248096849_AboutQEMNetwork--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"About the QEM Network\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">About the QEM Network</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">QEM Network</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ivory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Toldson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">About the QEM Network</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493240797971_DSC00443copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493240797971_DSC00443copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"QEM Professional Development Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493240797971_DSC00443copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"QEM Professional Development Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">QEM HBCU-UP Leadership Development Institute (LDI) Session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">QEM Network - Cos Brown</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ivory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Toldson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">QEM Professional Development Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493239651096_1493227203069--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493239651096_1493227203069--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"QEM Network It's All Linked to Education\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1252516/1252516_10291559_1493239651096_1493227203069--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"QEM Network It's All Linked to Education\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">QEM Network ?
