 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Seventh International Conference on High Dimensional Probability (HDP VII) taking place during May 26-31, 2014 at the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Scientifiques de Carg\u00e8se (IESC), France.  High Dimensional Probability theory is the mathematical root for the analysis of Big Data, and developments in the theory and its connections to other disciplines will benefit science and society as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe topics of the conference will include Limit Theorems, Empirical Processes and their Applications, High Dimensional Statistics, Statistical Learning theory, Spin Glass Methods, Convex Geometry and Applications as well as Random Matrices and Additive Combinatorics. The meeting will consist of a mix of formal and informal discussions and presentations. It is not only intended to present the current state of the art in the field, but also to point out important open problems and to set new directions for the field. The information exchange taking place during HDP VII will enhance cross-pollination among the disciplines of mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and computer science.  Particular attention has been paid to bring as speakers and participants, and ultimately into the future leadership of this conference series, junior researchers and researchers from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nMore information is available at \r\nhttp://hdpvii.gatech.edu \r\nand \r\nhttp://www.iesc.univ-corse.fr/en",
