 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the laws of physics, such as the Einstein field equations, are described using nonlinear differential equations on geometric spaces.  Geometric analysts use nonlinear differential equations to try to classify and understand the possible structures that can occur in geometric spaces.  An equation known as the Ricci flow has been used to great success to show that every three dimensional space can be cut up into pieces, each of which has a well-understood geometry.  The Ricci flow works by evolving a metric, which defines a notion of distance between two points, by a nonlinear heat flow process.  However, for spaces of dimension four or higher (such as the space-time we live in), this process is not yet well understood.  A major goal of this project is to investigate nonlinear equations on spaces of dimension four and higher with the aim of classifying these spaces and understanding the natural geometric structures that live on them.  This project focuses on spaces endowed with a 'complex structure'.  Despite the name, spaces with complex structures are easier to study, since this additional structure limits the kinds of singularities that could occur.  Complex geometries appear in physical theories, such as string theory.  This project will investigate complex geometries in four dimensions, using a new heat flow equation known as the Chern-Ricci flow.   In higher dimensions, an equation analogous to the Calabi-Yau equation (much studied in string theory) will be used to investigate the structure of these spaces.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate nonlinear PDEs in complex geometry, with a focus on spaces which are non-Kahler.  The PI will build on results for the Kahler-Ricci flow on complex surfaces to understand the behavior of the Chern-Ricci flow, a PDE which makes sense even in the non-Kahler case.  This project will investigate the behavior of the Chern-Ricci flow in relation to the classification of complex surfaces.  In particular, the PI will study how exceptional curves are contracted by this flow, and how the flow behaves on Class VII surfaces.  For higher dimensional non-Kahler complex manifolds, the PI will use the complex Monge-Ampere equation to study questions about cohomology and existence of Kahler currents.  In addition, the PI will study a new Monge-Ampere equation for (n-1)-plurisubharmonic functions, which is related to Gauduchon and balanced metrics on complex manifolds.  A solution to this new equation will solve a long-standing conjecture of Gauduchon and have possible applications to deformation problems for projective varieties.  Finally, the PI intends to extend these ideas to a Monge-Ampere type equation of Donaldson on symplectic 4-manifolds with compatible almost complex structures.  A conjecture of Donaldson on existence of solutions to this equation can be reduced to a second order estimate.  If this estimate holds it would give applications to the symplectic topology of 4-manifolds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany physical phenomena are described using nonlinear partial differential equations on geometric spaces.  An example is given by the Einstein field equations which describe gravity.  This project was concerned largely with investigating the behavior of solutions to nonlinear equations and how they can be used to classify and understand the possible structures that occur on geometric spaces.  Most of the results of this project focus on spaces with a 'complex structure'. Despite the name, spaces with complex structures are easier to study, since this additional structure limits the kinds of singularities that can occur. Complex geometries appear in physical theories, such as string theory.\n\nAn equation known as the Ricci flow has been used to great effect to classify the possible geometries in three dimensional spaces.  For this project, the PI and his collaborators investigated the Ricci flow in complex spaces of dimensions four and higher and established new results describing 1) how the flow may collapse multiple dimensions of the space and 2) how in dimension four the flow may contract certain subsets of dimension two defined by algebraic equations.\n\nAnother major achievement of this project was the study of a family of equations known as complex Monge-Ampere equations.  These equations have their origins in centuries-old physical theories of mass transportation, but are also connected to modern notions of curvature and special metrics in complex geometry.  The PI and his collaborators solved a thirty-year old problem, the Gauduchon conjecture, by solving a certain complex Monge-Ampere type equation on all spaces endowed with a complex structure.  This conjecture yields new special metrics on these spaces.  In addition the PI and his collaborators established existence of solutions to the Monge-Ampere equation on 'almost complex' manifolds, greatly extending the existing theory, and they used this to establish some long-standing regularity problems in complex geometry.\n\nA fourth strand of this project is in the study of convexity properties of solutions to linear partial differential equations.  It is now a classical result that if one considers the electrostatic potential between two concentric convex plates at constant charge, the level sets (points where the potential is constant) are convex.  The solution to the partial differential equation inherits convexity properties from its boundary conditions.  Similar results were expected to hold for the parabolic version of this problem:  the heat equation, which describes heat conduction.  However, the PI and his collaborator showed that this was false by providing counterexamples, demonstrating that the problem for parabolic equations is far more subtle.\n\nIn terms of broader impact, the PI has disseminated his research widely by giving talks about his work both nationally and internationally.  The PI has given several introductory mini-courses on his research and related topics aimed at undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.  The PI mentors PhD students at Northwestern University and runs a learning seminar there.  In addition, the PI is active in organizing conferences, workshops and summer schools at Northwestern and other institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Weinkove"
