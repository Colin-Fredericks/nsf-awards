 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telemedicine technologies offer the opportunity to frequently monitor patients' health and optimize management of chronic illnesses. Given the diversity of home telemedicine technologies, it is essential to compose heterogeneous telemedicine components and systems for a much larger patient population through systems of systems. The objective of this research is to thoroughly investigate the heterogeneity in large-scale telemedicine systems for cardiology patients. To accomplish this task, this research seeks to develop (i) a novel open source platform medical device interface adapter that can seamlessly interconnect medical devices that conform to interoperability standards, such as IEEE 11703, to smart phones for real-time data processing and delivery; (ii) a set of novel supporting technologies for wireless networking, data storage, and data integrity checking, and (iii) a learning-based early warning system that adaptively changes patient and disease models based on medical device readings and context.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular disease is a major health problem and the leading cause of death in the United States. Telemedicine technologies developed in this project have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of home health care with low cost for medical community. This research acquires a clear understanding of how to address heterogeneity issues in telemedicine systems, which allows effectively compose and interconnect individual telemedicine components together with low cost. For developers, this research significantly reduces the design and development costs for building interoperable large-scale telemedicine systems. The research content is being integrated into undergraduate, graduate system courses, clinician training course as well as high school research projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project has considered factors that affect the quality of clinical outcomes in remote monitoring of home-based patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure.  Congestive heart failure is a chronic debilitating disease that affects 5.7 million Americans.  Telemedicine is seen as the means to improve disease management of CHF patients and reduce the number of costly rehospitalizations.  Our work was based on the data obtained from 405 congestive heart failure  patients in the outpatient program at University of Pennsylvania Hospital System for the period of 5 years.  Our analysis has confirmed that the quality of connection for the telemedicine system affects the clinical outcomes.  Rehospitalized patients have experienced, on average, larger delays in delivering their data to the monitoring site than the general patient population.\n\nCurrent telemedicine systems report daily updates of patient vital signs.  These infrequent updates allow clinical personnel to detect potentially dangerous developments in the patient's state.  However, our research has shown that such updates are insufficient for the development of predictive algorithms for generating early warnings about imminent relapses of the congestive heart failure conditions.  The most predictive variable at this rate of updates turns out to be patient's weight.  More frequent update rates facilitate early detection, however, they become burdensome for patients, leading to lower rates of compliance with telemedicine protocols.\n\nNetwork performance assurance is essential for telemedicine to provide continuous and quality care. We have designed network protocols to improve network reliability, and provide real-time guarantees with low energy consumption for low power sensor and device networks.  \n\nOne of the goals of the project was to improve security of telemedicine systems. Using remotely controlled insulin pumps as a case study, we have developed techniques for detecting unautorized assess to the infusion pump.  The approach relies on identifying patient-specific patterns of access, using supervised learning over infusion pump logs.  Evaluation of the technique has demonstrated its effectiveness against malicious attacks that cause overdose.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shan Lin"
