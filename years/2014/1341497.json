 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic atmospheric water cycle couples freshwater input to the Southern Ocean. The strength of ocean convective overturning (the meridonal overturning circulation) and its influence on the upwelling of heat is governed in large part by these freshwater sources. Understanding the water cycle is fundamental to estimating ocean heat uptake in the Southern Ocean and determining why Antarctic sea ice has expanded in the last ~30 years, notably different from the Arctic. The hydrologic cycle is in turn strongly coupled to the climate. Precipitation influences the albedo of sea ice, depending on whether it falls as snow or rain, and contributes freshwater to the Southern Ocean, while sea ice and sea surface temperature influence evaporation and atmospheric circulation and their association with moisture and heat transport to Antarctica.\r\n\r\nA series of sensitivity experiments are proposed to gain understanding of the system and test means of improving model biases. The ultimate integration will utilize these model improvements to attribute Southern Ocean and Antarctic climate change over the last ~30 years\r\n\r\nThe project advances understanding of past and future climate change from rising greenhouse gas concentrations and ozone depletion. The results will inform future projections of Antarctic ice mass balance and the resulting global sea level rise.",

In general, the polar hydroclimate response to greenhouse warming is strongly seasonal: locally sourced moisture constitutes a larger fraction of the precipitation in winter while remote sources ?become even more dominant in summer. The increased importance of local sources in winter is coincident with sea ice retreat, which greatly increases local sources of evaporation in the fall and winter months. In summer, however, ?an increase in remote moisture sources is consistent with an increase in moisture residence times and the moisture transport length scale, which ?we find to be central to the robust hydrologic cycle response to CO2-induced warming globally.</p>\n<p>Our work also focused on understanding the result of missing physics in global climate models. For example, models do not take into account the freshwater runoff to the Southern Ocean from the ice sheet and shelf mass imbalance of Antarctica. In our experiments artificially enhancing the freshwater runoff in 1980-2013 climate scenarios resulted in sea ice area increasing over?the period. Experiments that also artificially removed heat from the ocean as if to melt the ice produced the most positive trends in sea ice area. We estimate that a rate of change of freshwater input of as little as 45 Gt/yr/yr &nbsp;would be adequate to yield a positive trend in the sea ice area in the climate model that we used. An observational based estimate of the recent rate of change of freshwater input is 47 +/- 31 Gt/yr/yr for 2003-2012, thus we conclude that the freshwater input could be a significant factor contributing to the observed increase in sea ice area since 2003. The rate of change of the freshwater input is not known prior to 2003, but we suspect it was smaller and therefore this mechanis is probably not an important factor to explain sea ice expansion prior to 2003.</p>\n<p>During our grant period, an extraordinary event occurred whereby the 2016 austral spring was characterized by the lowest by far Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent ever recorded and coincided with warmer Antarctic surface waters. We found two distinct processes contributed to this event:?First, the extreme El Ni&ntilde;o event peaking in December&ndash;February 2015/2016 contributed to pronounced extratropical SH sea surface temperature and sea ice extent anomalies in the eastern Ross, Amundsen, and Bellingshausen Seas that persisted in part until the following 2016 austral spring. Second, the Southern Annular Mode promoted the exceptional low sea ice extent. These results suggest that a combination of tropically forced and internal SH atmospheric variability contributed to low sea ice extent, on top of the slow background changes expected from greenhouse gas and ozone forcing.</p>\n<p>Another major part of our work was on the role of tropical teleconnection on Antarctic sea ice. We performed a series of integrations to drive the tropics so that the eastern tropical Pacific cooled and then examined its role on the Antarctic hydroclimate as well as the global mean surface air temperature. We employed three independent mechanisms to force tropical Pacific variability. We were able to robustly reproduce the teleconnection to the Antarctic in all three experiments, with a deepening of the Amundsen Sea low. The sea ice expanded where the meridional winds transported sea ice northward. However, the teleconnection on the whole caused Antarctic sea ice to decline in our model. Our model, like others that are too stratified in the Southern Ocean, appears to have erroneous sensitivity to any mechanism that tends to increase the westerly winds (such as the tropical teleconnections or a strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode).</p>\n<p>One other part of our wok included a study of the Southern Oceans overturning circulation. We found (1) ocean heat uptake and the lower cell dynamics are very sensitive to ocean and ice model resolution and (2) Resolving sea ice polynyas permits much greater heat loss in a concentrated area over continental shelves and assists in creating far more realistic Antarctic Bottom Water and damping surface warming in the Antarctic. This work has led us to develop a new theoretical framework to reveal how the effects of air-sea heat and freshwater exchange on near-surface density must be transported through the ocean's interior, between distant regions at the surface, in order to permit a steady state in the global ocean overturning circulation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cecilia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Bitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1341497/1341497_10291823_1525033006654_ScreenShot2018-04-29at1.11.04PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1341497/1341497_10291823_1525033006654_ScreenShot2018-04-29at1.11.04PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sources of Antarctic precipitation (in Sv) per tagged region, in (a) DJF, (b) MAM, (c) JJA, and (d) SON\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1341497/1341497_10291823_1525033006654_ScreenShot2018-04-29at1.11.04PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sources of Antarctic precipitation (in Sv) per tagged region, in (a) DJF, (b) MAM, (c) JJA, and (d) SON\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Precipitation source is traced from its point of evaporation within 49 tagged regions.
