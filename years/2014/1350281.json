Therefore, they struggle to make sense of negative integer concepts, which appear to conflict with their current understanding.  The purpose of this CAREER project is to identify language factors and instructional sequences that contribute to improving elementary students' understanding of addition and subtraction problems involving negative integers.   A second objective is to identify how elementary teachers interpret their students' integer understanding and use research findings to support their teaching of these concepts.  This project is expected to contribute to theories regarding the development of integer understanding as well as what makes a useful contrasting case when learning new, related concepts.  Moreover, the results of this project can contribute to our understanding of how to build on students? prior number knowledge rather than contradict it.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will conduct a series of four experimental studies involving a preparation for learning component with students randomly assigned to treatment or control groups.  Study 1 will involve second and fourth graders and will test the language factors that support students' understanding of integers.  Studies 2-4 will involve second and fifth graders and will test the optimal order in which integer addition and subtraction problems are presented in contrast with each other versus sequentially without contrasts.  Using items that measure students? understanding of integers and integer operations, the PI will compare students' gains from pre-tests to post-tests between groups.  Further, the investigator will qualitatively code students? solution strategies based on follow-up interviews and written work for additional information on the differences between groups. Following the experimental studies, the PI will work with elementary teachers over three lesson study cycles, during which teachers will implement instruction based on the prior studies? results.  The PI will compare the performance of students who participate in the lesson study unit versus control classrooms to measure impact of the unit. \r\n\r\nVideos of the lesson study unit, as well as the negative integer lesson plans will be made available for other teachers and teacher educators to use.  Further, the investigator will incorporate the research results into an undergraduate mathematics methods course.  To ensure that the results of this research reach a wider audience, the investigator will create an integer game and storybook, illustrating key concepts identified through the research, that parents can explore together with their children during family math nights and at home.  On a broader scale, this project has the potential to illuminate ways to develop more coherence in the sequencing of mathematics topics to more effectively build on students? current understanding.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGoals and Background\n\nThe main goal of this research project was to identify instructional sequence factors that help improve elementary students? (second graders? and fourth or fifth graders?) performance on addition and subtraction problems involving negative numbers.  A related goal was to determine the benefits of using language that emphasizes distance plus direction from zero (i.e., directed magnitude language) during the interventions on students? interpretations of negative numbers? order and values and operations with them.\n\nDuring experimental interventions, students discussed worked examples that showed the solutions to addition or subtraction problems together with visuals showing a method for solving the problems, such as hops on a number path.  Some students compared two different problems at a time in order to discover an important difference between adding and subtracting with positive versus negative numbers.  The order in which students compared problems was different between groups to test instructional sequences of problems.  In some of the interventions one of the experimental groups discussed each worked example one at a time instead of comparing two worked examples at a time.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nAcross the series of interventions, the researchers found that second graders significantly improved in their understanding of negative numbers, particularly when the instruction included directed magnitude language.  In some cases, the second graders? gains matched or exceeded the gains of the fourth and fifth graders.  Our analyses reveal that having second graders and fifth graders study and discuss worked examples of integer addition and subtraction problems can help them 1) advance in their understanding of the negative sign if they previously ignored negative signs or 2) reconsider the meaning of the negative sign in problems and move toward using the counting sequence to solve integer addition and subtraction problems. \n\nDuring and after the interventions, students? interpretations of what negative numbers are and how to add and subtract with negative numbers varied widely depending on their initial background knowledge and what set of problems they initially explored.  However, there were some general trends.\n\nWhen only learning addition with negative numbers, second and fifth graders benefitted from first comparing problems where the initial numbers are opposite (e.g., 5 versus -5), but they add the same positive number (e.g., comparing 5 + 3 to -5 + 3).  Likewise, when only learning subtraction with negative numbers, students benefitted from first comparing problems where the initial numbers are opposite, but they had to subtract the same positive number (e.g., comparing 5 ? 3 to -5 ? 3). The visuals for these comparisons showed hops on a number path going in the same direction, which may have helped students focus on the role of the negative number in the problems.\n\nWhen learning both addition and subtraction during the same intervention, second graders benefitted from comparing similar addition versus subtraction problems where only the operation changed (e.g., -5 + 3 versus -5 ? 3).  These types of contrasts took advantage of their prior knowledge of adding and subtracting with positive numbers so they could notice the differences when negative numbers were used.  Fifth graders, on the other hand, started out with more familiarity of negative numbers.  For them, they benefitted most when first comparing addition problems with negative numbers and then subtraction problems with negative numbers. Both second and fifth graders also did well when analyzing worked examples presented one at a time (instead of in comparison).  Therefore, having students analyze a combination of worked examples in comparison and one-a-time may be a helpful approach.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nAs part of this research project, I mentored six graduate students and five undergraduate students.  One of the graduate students also expanded on the work in the grant for her master?s thesis and PhD dissertation.  I published research findings from this project in mathematics education journals (both for researchers and practitioners) and conference proceedings and presented at numerous educational conferences. \n\nBeyond these traditional methods of dissemination, I provided a workshop for teachers about elementary students? learning of negative number concepts, and the teachers used what they learned about students? understanding of more and less in their units on comparing numbers.  I also used examples of students? solutions to addition and subtraction problems involving negative numbers into my undergraduate methods course to help preservice teachers practice interpreting students? thinking. \n\nBased on the numerous interviews with elementary children through this project, I wrote and illustrated a children?s picture book, Temperature Turmoil, that investigates the complexities of directed magnitude and understanding negative numbers? values.
