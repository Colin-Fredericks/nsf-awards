By synergistically integrating three separately developed components CNT source, Medipix detector, and interior tomography into a novel interior 5D micro-CT system, the resulted whole system is much more than the sum of the components. The system will provide significantly higher spatial and contrast resolution, finer temporal resolution, and lower radiation dose than the state-of-the-art micro-CT. It will transform the method for studying cardiovascular diseases in mice and rats, make a significant impact on atherosclerosis research through facilitating basic mechanistic studies in mice and advancing our knowledge on pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and has potential in clinical assessment of vulnerable plaques.",
