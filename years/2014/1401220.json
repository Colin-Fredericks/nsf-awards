 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has the goal of improving  understanding of the basic dynamical processes that drive tropical/extratropical interaction on the intraseasonal time by performing both idealized numerical model experiments and diagnostic analyses. Enhanced understanding of tropical/extratropical interaction is crucial for improving medium range (1-4 week) weather forecasts. \r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that different phases of an active tropical Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) are followed 1-4 weeks later by the excitation of the dominant Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (both the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Pacific/North American patterns), and coincide with large changes in the frequency of occurrence of these teleconnection patterns. It has been found that probabilistic weather forecasts based on both MJO and El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation phases outperform state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models for North America with lead times of 2 to 4 weeks. Changes to Arctic surface air temperature have even been observed following an active MJO.",

Therefore, an improved understanding of teleconnection patterns has the potential to improve weather forecasts with lead times of two weeks and beyond.\n\nThe research for this proposal focused on the mechanisms that drive teleconnection patterns, and the impact of these teleconnection patterns.  Research from this grant has enhanced our understanding of how large-scale convection in the tropics (regions of thunderstorm activity in the tropics that span more than 1,000 km) excites teleconnection patterns in the extratropics.

These findings suggest that a fruitful approach for investigating climate variability is to examine the processes that causes slow changes in the frequency of intra-seasonal teleconnection patterns.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven Feldstein"
