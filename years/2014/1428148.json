 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Iowa State University to develop and construct an Enviratron, a facility to test and evaluate the performance of plants under variable environmental conditions. To date most research on the performance of plants under different environmental conditions has been conducted with a limited number of differences, such as a single environmental stress versus control (unstressed) conditions. The Enviratron will permit researchers to incrementally alter multiple critical variables to better simulate changing conditions that will be faced in the future. The Enviratron will be an important research and training tool for students in the plant sciences, particularly for underrepresented minorities who will participate in the project through the George Washington Carver Summer Research Internship Program. It will provide them with the experience of simulating different environmental conditions or different climates of the world and the opportunity to study and improve the performance of plants under those conditions. It will also inspire engineering students to learn how to work hand in hand with plant scientists. The Enviratron will also be a demonstration centerpiece open to farmers and other visitors to promote appreciation and a better understanding of agricultural research.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how organisms in the biosphere can adapt to climate change is one of the grand scientific challenges of these times. This project creates a phenomics platform that will enable researchers to non-destructively monitor the performance of plants throughout their lifecycle under variable environmental conditions. The Enviratron represents a revolutionary new design in plant phenomics facilities. It consists of an array of plant growth chambers to create different environmental conditions. Unlike commercial plant phenomics systems, plants will not be conveyed out of the growth chambers to monitor their growth performance, rather a rover with a robotically controlled arm will periodically visit each chamber to image and analyze the plants. In addition to more standard visible light, fluorescence, near infrared and infrared imaging, sensors on the rover will be capable of imaging and conducting analyses not available on commercial systems such as hyperspectral and holographic imaging and Raman spectroscopy. The robot-assisted sensing approach will enable precise location-specific data acquisition, resulting in improved sampling strategies and data quality. The Enviratron will be used for research as well as graduate and undergraduate student training and will be located in a facility where it can be used to educate the public about climate change research.",

The scheduler provides an interface between the user and the Enviratron system so that the Enviratron is programmed with the environmental settings of each growth chamber, the numbers and locations of plants in each chamber, and activities of the robot.\n\nThe interdisciplinary team met together monthly during the first four years of this project to plan, problem-solve, and evaluate progress.  One group of engineers designed and constructed the plant growth chambers, while another group of engineers developed the robotic rover.  One group of bioinformaticists and data analysts developed the software and the data collection pipeline, while another group developed the image analysis.  A group of facilities personnel designed and built the building and developed the utilities to serve the Enviratron.  A group of statisticians developed experimental designs for conducting experiments and another group of plant scientists evaluated the plant physiological parameters for different species of plants grown in the facility.  These scientists and engineers devoted part of their careers to this project and would not have had the chance to work together under other circumstances.  We have a team of people who are willing, able, and interested to work together across disciplines in the future.  For the young scientists - the undergraduates and graduate students in particular - this was an extraordinary learning experience that they would not have had if they had been working on their own or in their own independent lab groups.\n\nAnother important outcome was the close and productive interaction between the Iowa State researchers and the engineering team at Percival Scientific, which was an important learning experience for both the academic and industrial scientists and engineers.  The partnership went far beyond the usual contractual relationship of acquiring goods or materials from a company.  The engineers at Percival helped to develop the concept, design the components, and met with the team to come up with solutions to challenges in building this unique facility.\n\nFinally, the Enviratron is performing as envisioned by supporting cutting-edge science related to environmental effects on the growth, development, and physiology of crop plants. We have demonstrated that physiological processes that occur in nature also occur in the controlled growth conditions.  One example is the research recently published in The Plant Cell concerning the effects of diurnal temperature cycles on the induction of stress in maize.  The research could not have been done without the Enviratron, because it required the use of all eight chambers in the Enviratron to simulate different daily temperature cycles and robotics to monitor the performances of plants under those conditions.  The Enviratron is one of the few facilities in the world that can grow crop plants, such as maize and soybean, under controlled conditions in many different environmental regimes that simulate past, current, and future climate scenarios. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven A Whitham"
