 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical description. \r\nThe proposed International Research Experience for Students (IRES): Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies - Research Experience at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech -  ENPC, France (?CGPET - ENPC?) aims to expose Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) undergraduate and graduate students to geomechanical research applied to energy technologies, immerse them in the academic culture of a leading European institution (ENPC), and inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to improve the sustainability and security of energy sources and production. Undergraduate and graduate students from Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GT-CEE) will complete a two-month internship at ENPC Navier Laboratory, to work on research planned and supervised by dual ENPC and GT-CEE faculty mentors. Navier Laboratory gathers world?s experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, and has unique experimental, imaging and computational facilities especially adapted for geomechanics. Topics of study envisioned in this IRES involve fundamental research in the physics of thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical coupled processes in geomaterials, multi-scale modeling of porous networks, three-dimensional image analysis and advanced numerical simulation techniques. The ?CGPET-  ENPC? program will start with five teams of dual mentors, who will work on the following subjects: (1) Clay nano-poromechanics for carbon dioxide sequestration, (2) Characterization of particulate pore structures for geological storage, (3) Micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue in salt rock for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), (4) Reactive fluid injection and withdrawal in rock, for oil and gas recovery and geothermal energy systems, and (5) Freeze/thaw cycles and sulfate attacks for improved cement-based buffers. Every year, a GT-CEE mentor will spend the last week of IRES participants? internship at ENPC, to work with his/her ENPC collaborator and supervise GT-CEE students? final research presentations; similarly the ENPC mentor will spend the week following the internship period at Georgia Tech. \r\n\r\nBroader description. \r\nFundamental understanding of soil, rock and cement-based materials is needed to address society?s most pressing needs in energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, geothermal systems), energy storage (e.g., CAES) and waste management (e.g., nuclear waste disposals, carbon capture). Through their engagement in a project aimed to improve energy geotechnologies, IRES participants will discover the responsibility of researchers towards their sponsors, their scientific community and society at large. Students selected for this CGPET ? ENPC program will have an international experience as part of a cohort through cultural and professional activities, and will contribute to build and maintain a global network of scholars through public research presentations at ENPC and GT, wikipage postings, academic publications, and mentoring of new IRES participants. Currently, most students enrolled in Civil and Environmental Engineering discover soil mechanics during their senior year, through the course of Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering. Activities planned before, during and after the ENPC internships will expose a broad population of GT students to geomechanical research, which will provide opportunities to inspire and attract more students in the pursuit of a scientific career. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students from ENPC and GT-CEE is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in energy geomechanics. This IRES will also serve a broader effort to share knowledge, expertise and resources between Europe and the United States, and to explore new ways to initiate scientific collaborations between high-ranked education and research institutions around the world.",

Topics studied by the GT/ENPC teams included: life cycle analysis of cementitious materials; micro-macro modeling approaches for concrete, based on imaging, poromechanics and homogenization theories; physical and numerical modeling of geothermal piles; simulation of root pullout tests to design bio-inspired foundation systems; computational modeling of ant excavation to design bio-inspired burrowing machines; assessment of the poromechanical behavior of construction materials that contain fly ash; optimization of storm water management systems; modeling and simulation of fracture propagation in rock materials with application to fault dynamics and geological storage.

IRES participants took ownership of a project and joined a research group at ENPC, which provided them with an individual experience in a French 'Grande Ecole'. Students also had an international experience as part of a cohort through cultural and professional activities organized before, during and after the internship at ENPC. Each participating student presented their work both at ENPC and at GT. Students wrote a research report, which, in many cases, led to the preparation of an academic publication. This IRES grant supported work that was published in, or led to, six journal articles, three peer-reviewed conference papers, one Ph.D. thesis and multiple public presentations. The IRES grant also gave the opportunity to GT students to attend conferences held in France during the period of their internship. One GT student participated in the ALERT Geomaterials Symposium organized in Aussois (France) in Fall 2016. Three GT students attended the 6<sup>th</sup> Biot Poromechanics conference held at ENPC in July 2017. Participating students worked full time in a top European research institute, in a non-English speaking country. Some participants learnt French. All of them learnt experimental methods, fundamental mechanical theories or numerical simulation tools that they would not have been exposed to at GT.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Outcomes.</strong> During the period 2015-2019, this IRES program financed 23 research internships for Georgia Tech students and supported travel for the faculty advisors. Two ENPC researchers spent a week at GT, and two GT professors visited ENPC. A major outcome of this project is the continuation of the collaborations between GT and ENPC professors throughout this IRES project. Eight teams of dual mentors were formed and continue to collaborate to this day, thanks to another IRES grant which expands the activities to more research topics and more engineering schools in the Paris area: IRES Track I: Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris (MPMS), Grant no. 1854030. The feedback received from the students and from the advisors from both institutions is overwhelmingly positive. One of the 2017 IRES participants decided to go back to ENPC for six months after getting a Chateaubriand fellowship. Two ENPC researchers served in Ph.D. committees of GT students with whom they worked through the IRES program. One of the PI's former Ph.D. students, now a faculty member, continues collaborating with one of the ENPC researchers involved in the IRES.&nbsp; The scientific network that was initiated by this IRES grant has ramifications that span multiple academic generations already. Memorandums of Understanding between ENPC and GT were revisited to allow GT graduate students to get credit for taking geomechanics classes at ENPC, and to facilitate the admission of ENPC alumni in GT graduate program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/18/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chloe&nbsp;Arson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1357908/1357908_10307639_1584585992888_IRES_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1357908/1357908_10307639_1584585992888_IRES_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Simulation of geo-storage in a salt cavern\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1357908/1357908_10307639_1584585992888_IRES_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Simulation of geo-storage in a salt cavern\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Numerical simulation of thermo-mechanical loading cycles of a salt cavern used for compressed air energy storage.
