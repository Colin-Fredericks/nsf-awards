 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unifying theme of this project is the emphasis on combinatorics and computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important role in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics, as the various discrete structures it studies (such as graphs and partially ordered sets) are particularly well suited for encoding and manipulating complex mathematical objects. The PI will use combinatorial techniques in representation theory (which is a fundamental tool for studying group symmetry, and which has important applications in mathematics and beyond, e.g., to theoretical physics), and in Schubert calculus (which has its origins in enumerative geometry, e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions, but is currently related to modern areas such as quantum cohomology). By developing and studying combinatorial models for certain representations and related algebraic varieties, the PI will pursue efficient related computations; furthermore, this work is expected to lead to a better understanding of the mentioned mathematical objects and of the subtle connections between them. Some of the models developed in the project will be implemented in the open source computer algebra system SAGE. \r\n\r\nThis research project uses combinatorial structures and methods to solve problems in two main areas: the representation theory of Lie algebras and modern Schubert calculus on flag manifolds. An important avenue of this research is concerned with the alcove model, developed by the PI in collaboration with A. Postnikov; this is a combinatorial model for integrable highest weight representations of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, as well as for certain multiplication formulas in the K-theory of flag manifolds. New applications of the alcove model were given in recent work of the PI with S. Naito, D. Sagaki, A. Schilling, and M. Shimozono. These highlight interesting connections between Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules for affine Lie algebras, Macdonald polynomials, and the quantum K-theory of flag manifolds. The PI will further explore some of these connections. He will also pursue applications of the alcove model to formulas for Whittaker functions on p-adic groups, which are a basic tool in the theory of automorphic forms. In modern Schubert calculus, the PI will work on: unifying and extending various combinatorial models for the Schubert structure constants in ordinary cohomology, Schubert calculus beyond K-theory (e.g., in elliptic cohomology), and combinatorial aspects of the geometric Satake correspondence (which gives a geometric construction of irreducible Lie algebra representations, based on the affine Grassmannian).",

Representation theory is a fundamental tool for studying symmetry by realizing the elements of abstract groups/algebras as linear transformations (of some vector spaces). Lie algebras are an important class of algebras with many applications to physics. There are interesting related deformations, called quantum groups, which depend on a parameter q, interpreted as physical temperature. At \"zero temperature\", the representations of quantum groups can be encoded in certain colored directed graphs called crystals. <br /><br />Representations of quantum groups, and therefore crystals, have important applications to statistical mechanics. In this area, a physical system is modeled by a grid graph with weights associated to vertices (which represent atoms or particles) and a given number of states for the edges (which represent the bonds). Such a discrete model is called a vertex model. The probability of the system being in any given state at a particular time, and hence the properties of the system, are determined by certain statistical sums. These can be computed as sums over affine crystals of the so-called energy function at a crystal vertex.<br /><br />The graph in the figure is an affine crystal. The energy is constant on the (vertices of the) 4 connected components determined by the edges labeled 1 and 2. For each edge labeled 0, except the last one in a sequence of such edges, there is a decrease by 1 of the energy. So the energy (suitably normalized) on the 4 components is 0, -1, -2, -3, from left to right. As such graphs can be very large, it is much more efficient to compute the energy only in terms of some combinatorial data associated to the vertices (in the figure, we use some fillings of diagrams with numbers). With my co-authors, I developed a very general model (data associated to the vertices), called the quantum alcove model, in terms of which we can efficiently calculate the energy. <br /><br />During the period of this grant, I continued the development of the quantum alcove model, and the related results are contained in 4 papers. These results are concerned with new computations based on this model, and generalizations of previous results to larger classes of affine crystals. <br /><br />Another project on which I worked is related to a long-standing problem in the representation theory of Lie algebras, namely the computation of the so-called Kostka-Foulkes polynomials. These polynomials record an important grading of the pieces/subspaces (called weight spaces) into which an irreducible representation of a Lie algebra splits, and are also related to the energy function mentioned above. We introduced a new approach in this area, based on crystals, and derived the first combinatorial formulas for Kostka-Foulkes polynomials in important cases which were beyond reach with previous approaches. <br /><br />I am also applying combinatorial methods to computations in an area of algebraic geometry/topology called Schubert calculus, which involves geometric objects called flag varieties/manifolds. Classical Schubert calculus, which goes back to the second half of the 19th century, is concerned with enumerating geometric objects satisfying prescribed incidence constraints. The simplest non-trivial example is: given 4 lines in general position in 3-space, how many lines meet all of them? (The answer is 2.) The basic questions in enumerative geometry were reformulated in the framework of flag manifolds, and thus reduced to multiplication formulas in some associated algebraic structures (cohomology rings). I worked on an extension of Schubert calculus in which the usual structures in this area (ordinary cohomology and K-theory) are replaced with more refined algebraic structures (in particular, elliptic cohomology). This is a very recent trend in Schubert calculus. Following a series of foundational papers, the challenge which I addressed is to perform specific computations based on explicit combinatorial formulas, which generalize formulas in the classical cases (ordinary cohomology and K-theory). <br /><br />The combinatorial structures developed in my work, including the quantum alcove model mentioned above, were used by several researchers, and were implemented in the computer algebra system Sage (the related software is publicly available).
