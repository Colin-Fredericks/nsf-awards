 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project aims to catalyze a research collaboration between US and Argentinian researchers.  The project will be led by Drs. Russell Rodriguez at Symbiogenics and Regina Redman of the University of Washington, both in Seattle, Washington, and Dr. Laurie Connell at the University of Maine, Orono, for the US side.  On the Argentinean side, Drs. Diego Libkind, Martin Molino and Virginia de Garcia of INIBIOMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Biodiversidad y Medioambiente, an Argentinean National Scientific and Technical Research Council Institute) and the University of Comahue, are the counterparts for the project.  The Argentinian researchers bring to the collaboration expertise in fungal taxonomy and biodiversity, particularly of cold and extreme environments.  The US researchers bring expertise in fungal and plant adaptation to stresses, particularly in diverse habitats of Antarctica. \r\n\r\nOverall, this collaboration aims to understand how function impacts bacterial community structures, an important challenge in predicting ecosystems responses to climate change.  For this project the researchers will study fungal communities by investigating their diversity, physiology, and ecology in extreme habitats such as glacial water run-off in Patagonia.  The results of these initial studies will lay the groundwork for further large-scale projects.  The collaboration will provide training opportunities for students at different levels and has significant potential to increase our understanding of global nutrient cycling, inter-organismal relationships, and life in extreme environments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was designed to understand how the diversity of microorganisms changes in response to nutritional inputs across habitats ranging from glaciers to vegetated soils.  Habitats such as deserts and glaciers are defined as oligotrophic because they  deficient in nutrients do to the lack of abundant plant life. Yet, these habitats are home to a multitude of microscopic fungi and bacteria, and it is unclear how the organisms reproduce and survive under such low nutrient conditions.  Moreover, it is not known where the microbes originate and establish in oligotrophic habitats. \n\nAn international group of scientists from the U.S. and Argentina collected microbial samples along a transect running from glacial ice to vegetated soils.  The samples were used to define how the microbial community changes across these habitats by extracting &amp; sequencing total DNA.  The sequences revealed dramatic changes in microbial community structure and diversity across along the transect with community structure being completely different, demonstrating the influence of habitat\n\nThe intellectual merits of this study are based on the fact that all plants on earth are symbiotic with microorganisms that play an important role in the health, survival and adaptive potential of plants.  Yet, less than 5% of scientific papers on plant ecology, and adaptation include a symbiotic component.  The research generated in this study will be useful to scientists studying the ecology, adaptation and evolutionary biology of plants as well as habitat restoration efforts.\n\nThe broader impacts of this study will be realized by incorporating these types of data into climate models to predict future impacts of climate change on natural and agricultural ecosystems.  Currently, microbiological aspects of plant life are not considered in most climate models.  However, It is clear that microbes are a critical component of soil health and therefore plant and habitat health.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell J Rodriguez"
