 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. The project will further develop, roll out, and conduct research on a set of materials that will introduce middle school age youth to innovative and engaging engineering challenges in the Boys and Girls Club (B&GCs) context. Building on substantial prior work and evaluation-based learning, WISE Guys and Gals - Boys & Girls as WISEngineering STEM Learners (WGG) will: (1) combine engineering design activities with the (open source, online) WISEngineering infrastructure; (2) scale-up the infrastructure; (3) engage youth in informal afterschool experiences; and (4) collect a wealth of rich data to further our understanding of how youth learn through these experiences. This work will be conducted by Hofstra University's Center for STEM Research in conjunction with Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), The CUNY Graduate Center's Center for Advanced Study in Education (CASE), the Boys & Girls Club of America, and 25 B&GCs in New York and New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe underlying theoretical framework builds on proof-of-concept work supported by NSF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. An open source, on-line interface (WISEngineering) provides numerous virtual tools (e.g., social networking, Design Journal, embedded assessments) that promote learning and collaboration through challenging, thoughtful, and creative work. WGG will explore how to incorporate creativity, social networking, connections to real-world STEM needs/careers, and teamwork into challenges that can be completed in a one-hour period, an activity time constraint in many B&GC settings. Staff from the clubs will participate in face-to-face and virtual professional development in an effort to build their capacity as facilitators of STEM learning. Research will focus on: (1) how activities developed for 60-minute implementation and guided by informed engineering design and interconnected learning frameworks support youth learning and engagement; and (2) characteristics of the professional development approach that support B&GC facilitators' capacity development. By the end of the project, over 6,000 middle school aged youth, the majority from groups underrepresented in STEM areas, will gain experience with engineering design as they develop engineering thinking, new STEM competencies, STEM career awareness, and an appreciation for the civic value of STEM knowledge.",

WGG collaborated with 16 Boys &amp; Girls Clubs (BGCs) in three states?New York, Connecticut, and Virginia. By engaging youth and facilitators at these clubs in STEM activities, we helped the clubs build and expand their STEM capacity. Youth were excited about engaging in the activities and demonstrated increased interest in and learning of STEM. Throughout the five-year project, 2500 youth participated in over 10,000 STEM experiences using the 15 STEM activities created for WGG.</p>\n<p>In terms of Intellectual Merit, we developed a framework to create informal STEM activities that are presented as engineering design challenges. These challenges included building an \"Alka-Seltzer\" fueled rocket, making ice cream without an ice creamer maker, and designing a shoe using recycled materials. By working collaboratively with BGCs we identified and developed activities that were culturally relevant to their youth, including many who are typically under-represented in STEM. WGG developed a framework to guide the selection of design challenges, the presentation, and language as well as support materials. The intent was to create challenges that would be engaging for both boys and girls regardless of their background. The WGG approach was grounded in collaboration and partnership, including having each WGG team member serve as a liaison to at least one club (Principal Investigator included) who provided technical support and visited the clubs during implementation. Over two test cycles, the project team and clubs worked together to refine the activities and support materials, resulting in robust and practitioner relevant materials.</p>\n<p>As part of our research, we analyzed the differences between formal and informal STEM activities (the team has extensive experience in STEM activity development) and what is required in an informal setting. While nuanced, we found STEM activities in informal settings (at least Boys and Girls Clubs) need to focus on engagement and success, while those in formal settings are more often focus on knowledge and ability. To assess knowledge gain in informal settings, we developed an authentic and non-obtrusive approach; and indeed, youth gained a deeper understanding of engineering design as they participated in more activities. However, the challenge had to be presented in a way that intrigued and engaged youth. To promote interest in STEM careers as valuable, each activity was framed from a STEM professional's perspective with video support material, often from other NSF projects, showcasing the particular profession.</p>\n<p>In terms of Broader Impacts, several aspects of the project expanded the field of informal STEM. We created activities and support materials. Then we disseminated these using an innovative and authentic approach. WGG's online learning environment, WISEngineering, made the activities, support materials, youth work (including pictures, videos, and answers to embedded questions) easily available wherever internet connectivity was possible. WGG videos about how to implement WGG activities allowed facilitators to access support anytime from their smartphones, computers, or tablets, While traditional text materials were also created, the clubs preferred the ease and visual nature of the videos. Most of the 50 plus WGG facilitators had no STEM background, yet they were able to implement the activities because of this video support. We also created a unique and authentic assessment strategy called Shark Tank. Youth were given the challenge to create their own engineering design challenge, including constructing a prototype and a 2-3 minute video describing the challenge in engineering STEM terms. We developed the activity and video guidance as well as a rubric for assessing the videos.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the videos indicated an explicit understanding of engineering design challenges and an implicit understanding of specifications and constraints.</p>\n<p>The WGG dissemination strategy expanded the reach of WGG beyond BGCs as well as beyond traditional presentations and publications. Instead, WGG engaged in authentic dissemination that involved working with other venues, such as senior centers, libraries, and families. WGG held workshops and provided access to WISEngineering (the online learning environment), then tracked how participants used the resources. For example, many at the senior center later conducted an activity with a grandchild. This approach was expanded to Parent University in Savannah, Georgia where city mothers and grandmothers learned a WGG activity and then implemented it at home with family members, and/or in other organizations. The experience often changed their own STEM self-image while also providing youth with STEM experiences. A similar initiative was conducted with military families with similar results. Clearly, the WGG activities and implementation strategies and resources can be used in many diverse venues.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Burghardt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071345571_WGG10,000FootOverview--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071345571_WGG10,000FootOverview--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wise Guys and Gals Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071345571_WGG10,000FootOverview--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wise Guys and Gals Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">10,000 foot overview of Wise Guys and Gals project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Burghardt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Burghardt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wise Guys and Gals Overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071415253_WGGPosterpng--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071415253_WGGPosterpng--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wise Guys and Gals Poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071415253_WGGPosterpng--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wise Guys and Gals Poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Accomplishments of the Wise Guys and Gals project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Burghardt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Burghardt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wise Guys and Gals Poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071569910_WGGVirtualPDpng--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071569910_WGGVirtualPDpng--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wise Guys and Gals Professional Development Effectiveness\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1422436/1422436_10333071_1604071569910_WGGVirtualPDpng--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wise Guys and Gals Professional Development Effectiveness\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The virtual professional development created by the Wise Guys and Gals project was very effective for facilitators with and without STEM backgrounds.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Burghardt</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Burghardt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wise Guys and Gals Professional Development Effectiveness</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
