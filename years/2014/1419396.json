 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot project to extend and broaden utilization of existing educational resources created with support from the NSF to each of two PIs in separate large grants 5 years ago.  The extension is through a type of course that has become ubiquitous across American colleges and universities: the \"freshman seminar.\" The information content of the existing educational resources meets the criterion of being important and interesting to a broad spectrum of our society. The materials that underpin this pilot are broad, varied, and adaptable to local circumstance as well as extensible as new knowledge emerges. A positive characteristic of the project is that the base resources (book, video, social media outlets, web sites) exist, the delivery vehicles (freshman seminar courses) exist, a publicly visible scientist is available and interested in participating, and that scientist's MOOC on climate science will continue to be offered and could become part of local courses. This pilot project will test the response of faculty who teach environmental science courses to the opportunity of selecting freely from a rich set of materials that can be used as course building blocks. It will also examine the impact that their use has on enrolled students.",

Passport to Knowledge/Geoff Haines-Stiles Productions, Inc.

Schools included community colleges, state universities, liberal arts colleges, and tribal colleges. Class size and format varied from an intimate four-student seminar to large lecture-based courses of more than 100 students. Some classes included labs, and one was offered entirely online. This variety helped test the ETOM resources in a wide range of environments.&nbsp; Three classes interacted with Dr. Alley via web conferences (Google Hangouts). A total of 1,225 students participated, plus thousands enrolled in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) organized by Penn State University and Coursera.
