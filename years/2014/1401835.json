 "awd_abstract_narration": "1401835 \r\nBaneyx, Francois C. \r\n\r\nTwo dimensional (2D) protein arrays are of considerable interest for the production of advanced materials, devices and systems. For instance, the naturally occurring purple membrane patches of archaeal cells have been exploited for optical information storage; 2D protein layers isolated from archaea and bacteria have been used to produce next generation vaccines and as templates for the fabrication of nanostructured inorganic materials. Yet, these technologies have not evolved beyond proof of concept because they are not robust or scalable, and because neither the geometry, nor the chemistry or assembly of these systems can be precisely controlled from the nano- to the mesoscale. In this work, it is proposed to create an entirely new generation of self-assembled 2D scaffolds that have been designed from the ground up to enable the next generation of advanced materials, biosensors and biodevices. The project seamlessly blends computation, molecular biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, and materials science, and provides a unique opportunity to train students in truly interdisciplinary research. One underrepresented undergraduate student will be paired with a graduate student to broaden participation in science. Results and lessons from the proposed work will be presented to the public and a week-long module on self-assembly will be developed for inclusion in the department's Molecular Engineering curriculum.  \r\n\r\nIt is proposed to computationally design a family of proteins that will be capable of robust self-assembly into 2D arrays by fusing protomers from symmetry-compatible oligomers and redesigning interfacial contacts between unit cells. We will delineate and optimize self-assembly conditions for scalable formation of 2D arrays retaining short-range order at the nanoscale but growing over hundreds of micrometers. We will develop approaches to stack these lattices into periodic 3D structures, and apply strategies to control the adsorption and orientation of 2D arrays at technological-relevant interfaces through electrostatic interactions, surface modification and the engineering of solid binding peptides within permissive sites of the structure. And finally, we will explore the potential of these designer 2D lattices as tunable molds for templating inorganic mineralization and as scaffolds for high-density display of enzymes and proteins and for membrane protein crystallization.",
