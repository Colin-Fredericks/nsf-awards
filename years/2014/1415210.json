 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an NSF/CISE CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop, to be held as a one-day event in March 2014 in Arlington, VA. The workshop will introduce junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program and provide them with invaluable insights from past awardees and NSF program managers on features of effective CAREER proposals. The objective is to better equip junior faculty to write effective, ultimately successful, CAREER proposals. \r\n\r\nThe NSF CAREER program is central to NSF efforts to identify, foster and support the nation's most promising junior faculty in research and education. It is well known that junior faculty have had limited experience on grant writing and few opportunities of interaction with NSF program directors. As many faculty learn during their careers, the opportunity to obtain direct insights and feedback from grant awardees and NSF program directors is invaluable to learning how to write effective, ultimately successful, grant proposals. The purpose of this workshop is to provide such a venue for junior faculty to help them jumpstart their academic careers. \r\n \r\nA limited number of scholarships will be made available for HBCU and other minority faculty, including women, to attend the workshop. The workshop will be a unique opportunity for such faculty to network with recent NSF CAREER awardees. This will enhance the overall research capabilities of HBCU and other minority faculty to perform cutting-edge research. Additionally, presentation materials (slides, videos, etc.) from the panel sessions will be made available on the workshop website for other junior faculty to download; this will allow the impact of this workshop to reach beyond the direct participants to other junior faculty nationwide.",
