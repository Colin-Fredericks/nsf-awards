 "awd_abstract_narration": "Configuration updates are a common source of instability in networks\r\ntoday, frequently leading to outages, disruptions, and even security\r\nvulnerabilities. A key factor that makes updates difficult to\r\nimplement is that networks are complex systems with many interacting\r\ncomponents. A typical datacenter network consists of\r\nthousands of devices, a significant challenge for network administrators\r\nis that each of these devices must be reconfigured after an update. \r\nThe goal of this research is to develop new mechanisms for implementing \r\nnetwork configuration updates using techniques based on software synthesis. \r\n\r\nTo meet this goal, the research is developing (i) new synthesis\r\nalgorithms based on efficient incremental model checking techniques;\r\n(ii) extensions that model bandwidth and fault tolerance using\r\nquantitative constraints and objective functions; and (iii)\r\ntheoretical foundations based on connections to concurrent and\r\ndistributed programming. The project will have broad impact by\r\ndiscovering new techniques that automate a difficult network\r\nadministration task and by training undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents with interdisciplinary skills in formal methods and\r\nnetworking.",
