 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the acquisition of a combined scanning probe-Raman microscope, which provides non-destructive imaging of materials structure, physical properties and molecular composition.  This instrumentation is critical to fundamental research in engineering, materials science, physics, chemistry and other fields, enabling advances ranging from the design of new materials and devices to the identification of the origins of human disease.  The combined SP-Raman microscope will enable high-resolution Raman techniques and will remedy a deficiency in the research and scientific training infrastructure at the State University of New York at Binghamton, which does not have a Raman facility. The proposed instrument will support fundamental research and education efforts on small-scale systems, materials, energy, and biomedical science. The fundamental knowledge from these projects will advance solar energy applications and next generation manufacturing and materials design and will help to broaden the participation of female and underrepresented groups in research. A new course on scanning probe and Raman microscopy will be developed for students in the University?s engineering and science programs. \r\n\r\nA combined scanning probe-Raman microscope is a state-of-the-art research tool used to characterize structural, physical and chemical properties of materials at sub-micron scales. The sharp scanning probe synergistically enables high-resolution Raman techniques such as TERS (tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy), which are essential for the proposed research plan. The research activities enabled by this instrumentation bring together 15 faculty members from the Mechanical Engineering, Bioengineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics and Chemistry Departments and form the basis for collaborative research projects and mentoring for junior faculty.  This instrumentation will also be shared with industry and other academic institutions for their research and development through the University?s Small-Scale Systems Integration and Packing Center (S3IP). The new knowledge gained through this research will have a transformative impact on advancing fundamental science and engineering and enabling new technologies.",
