Racial and ethnic minority groups, including African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, remain substantially underrepresented in engineering and science, especially at the level of Ph.D. researchers and faculty. The Academic and Research Leadership Symposium (ARLS) is a symposium that is co-located with the Annual Convention of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). The purpose of the ARLS is to develop minority engineers in academia, industry, and government laboratories, whose careers involve a strong focus on research, in order to prepare them for leadership and success in their chosen discipline. The ARLS has two threads: (1) a faculty development thread, and (2) a researcher development and networking thread. It provides an opportunity for seasoned researchers (university, corporate, government) to nurture connections with their peers, and be excited and inspired by the latest discoveries and technical advances across many disciplines of engineering and science. Opportunities for new collaborations and strategic career advancements are anticipated. The researcher development and networking thread consists of a networking reception with a keynote presentation by a high-profile researcher, a session on career development in an R&D centric environment (e.g., The Researcher Entrepreneur and Senior Leadership Strategies), and a poster session organized by members of the ARLS network for more in-depth technical discussions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreased support (e.g., research funding, mentoring, professional development opportunities, recognition of significant scholarly accomplishments) is needed for minorities interested in and currently working in academic faculty or Ph.D.-level research careers. The purpose of the Academic and Research Leadership (ARL) Network is to develop minority engineers in academia, industry, and government laboratories, whose careers involve a strong focus on research, in order to prepare them for leadership and success in their chosen discipline. Activities within the ARL Network offer career advancement opportunities for both young and seasoned researchers that can lead to a self-sustaining minority researcher ecosystem. The flagship event of the ARL Network is its Symposium, which is held at the Annual Convention of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project supported the professional development for minority scholars by providing travel funds to assist with the cost of attending the 2016 ARL Network Symposium, which was held in Boston, MA, and was co-located with the 42nd Annual Convention of NSBE. The ARL Network Symposium has two threads: (1) a faculty development thread, and (2) a researcher development and networking thread. The faculty development thread hosts workshops organized by members of the ARL Network that strengthen and demystify fundamental components of academia. The researcher development and networking thread is critical to the goal of a self-sustaining ARL Network ecosystem, which currently includes over 200 members. It provides an opportunity for seasoned researchers (university, corporate, and government) to nurture connections with their peers, as well as be excited and inspired by the latest discoveries and technical advances across many disciplines of engineering and science.\n\nBroader impacts: This symposium provided the following impacts: (1) a meeting place for minority researchers to share and gain new ideas leading to new intellectual products and technologies that benefit society; (2) a pool of diverse faculty candidates for universities as well as researchers for government and industrial laboratories; (3) a pool for program managers of funding agencies who need to diversify their review panels; (4) a pool of qualified senior Ph.D. students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty that can both develop content and teach workshops that are of critical importance to the success of the current NSBE Graduate School Conference (GSC); (5) a critical mass of engaged minority researchers that can introduce ideas for increasing minority interest in the Ph.D. in ways not currently possible; and (6) a showcase of minority researchers on scales that have never existed, that is also strategically placed in a venue with a built-in audience of emerging minority engineers. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William H Robinson"
