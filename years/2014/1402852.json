 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is a leading expert in the field of partially hyperbolic dynamics; dynamics is the study of systems, physical or mathematical,  that evolve over time according to a deterministic set of rules.  Hyperbolic dynamical systems are those which display chaotic, unpredictable features at every point;  they are both naturally occurring and well-studied.  There are other dynamical systems called KAM systems (named after Kolomogorov, Arnold, and Moser), which have stable regions of regular motion.  Partially hyperbolic systems provide a more general class of dynamical systems than either, and include systems that combine hyperbolicity in some directions with KAM behavior in other directions.  Partially hyperbolic systems occur widely in dynamical systems arising in physics; for example planetary motion usually contains partially hyperbolic subdynamics, and the effective construction of particle accelerators (used in biological imaging, as well as theoretical physics) requires a detailed understanding of both KAM and partially hyperbolic dynamics. The PI has a well-developed research plan of over 15 years studying partially hyperbolic systems and is poised to raise the theory of these systems to a new level of generality and applicability. The impacts of this research will be seen in future applications to systems  in biology, physics and engineering.  The PI is currently collaborating with the particle accelerator group at Fermilab to explore some of these potential applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research supported by this grant is guided by the far-reaching goal of developing a general theory of partially hyperbolic systems along the lines of the hyperbolic theory developed in the past 40 years. In particular the PI proposes to study: ergodic properties of conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; physical measures for (dissipative) partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms; rigidity phenomena connected to partially hyperbolic group actions; and ergodicty of singular partially hyperbolic systems.  These research goals will be carried out through a variety of modalities, including published papers in peer-reviewed journals, supervising Ph.D. students, and public speaking, both at research conferences and to the general public.",
