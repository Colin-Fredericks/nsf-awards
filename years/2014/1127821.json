 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER award funds data collection from existing published sources.  The research team hopes to investigate whether or not employee \"spinoff\" organizations in the nonprofit sector are similar to spinoff firms in the private sector.  Spinoffs are new organizations or firms established by a former employee who is able to use skills from his/her previous job in establishing the new firm or organization.  The research team wants to determine whether or not spinoffs are more successful in the non-profit sector than comparable organizations that are started by non-employees.\r\n\r\nThe first step of the exploratory research is to collect and tabulate the characteristics of the founders of employee spinoffs. Were their parent firms mainly in the public, for-profit, or nonprofit sector? Were they mainly performing the same activities or services? Do these answers differ significantly between membership organizations and service organizations? We will gain insight into how these NGOs originate in addition to from where they originate. Are the founding workers exceptionally skilled? Did they occupy managerial positions? Do they tend to be older or more experienced? The second step of our proposed research is to correlate the origins and characteristics of the founding workers with NGO success. Does spinoff from the public sector promote success,possibly due to the establishment of a complementary relationship with a large or stable public entity? Does spinoff from other NGOs make success less likely, perhaps because of diminishing returns to exploitation of a donor base? We can expect higher skill levels of the founding workers to be associated with a higher probability of new NGO survival, but how strong is the connection?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis was an EAGER (EArly Concept Grants for Exploratory Research) Award.  As the name suggests, the research was exploratory in nature. \n\nOur aim was to identify new non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Brazil, find out from where their workers came, and determine the causes of NGO success as measured by size at entry and longevity.  We also wanted to distinguish altruistic NGOs and ideological NGOs from others.\n\nWe were able to divide new NGOs in Brazil into three groups:  altruistic, ideological (mainly religious organizations such as churches), and other.  To do this we used information on the NGOs? industrial classifications and legal forms.  Where these characteristics were insufficient we manually looked up the NGOs? names and classified these by keywords. \n\nThere were nearly 50,000 new NGOs of interest during the period 1995-2009.  We classified 14 percent of these as altruistic and 23 percent as ideological.\n\nIn developing countries NGOs are increasingly seen as substitutes for governments in supplying social services and public goods. Though some part of the change in non-governmental supply is determined by existing NGOs, new social problems arise that can be best addressed by new NGOs.  In future research we hope to build upon the data base of new NGOs we have identified in order to gain insight into the determinants of their capacity. \n\nMany undergraduate students were involved in the project by helping to classify the NGOs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James E Rauch"
