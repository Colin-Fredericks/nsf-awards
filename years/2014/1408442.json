 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantifying Complex Behavior in Large-Scale Systems through Structured Uncertainty Analysis\r\n\r\nLarge-scale systems of interacting dynamical elements are ubiquitous in nature and are increasingly common in engineered systems. Examples of such systems include large networks such as the power grid, vehicular traffic, social networks and many more. Such networks exhibit many complex phenomena arising from dynamic interaction between individual components. Qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction of these phenomena is a major current scientific and engineering challenge. This award supports research to develop quantitative analysis methods based on the techniques of structured stochastic uncertainty. These techniques model large-scale systems operating in uncertain environments, which include external forcing and attacks as well as internal disorder in interaction dynamics. The main observation is that even though individual uncertainty sources may be very small, their aggregate network effect may be large and even catastrophic, leading to loss of network stability or performance. Structured uncertainty analysis aims at quantifying exactly which type of small-scale uncertainty could lead to large-scale network-wide phenomena. \r\n\r\nUncertainties in large-scale dynamic systems can occur in system parameters or structure as well as in uncertain forcing and disturbances. The theoretical aims of the research program are twofold. The first is to develop a unified approach to the seemingly distinct problems of large-scale networked systems on the one hand, and systems over continuum space described by partial differential equations on the other. These two sets of problems will both be treated as spatially distributed systems, but with discrete space being described by the network structure in the former, and continuum space in the latter. This theoretical synthesis enables a comparative development of results and methods in both settings in a manner similar to, but significantly richer, than analogies between discrete- and continuous-time systems. The second aim is to develop highly-scalable, simulation-free performance and stability tests for linear systems with both additive and multiplicative noise. Application areas for which specialized techniques will be developed are network/cooperative control where both the network structure and conditions are stochastically varying, and fluid flow with stochastic field coefficients. This methodological synthesis contributes to the foundations of Control Theory in the area of additive and multiplicative noise. It enables the solution of several problems in uncertain systems that are typically investigated through expensive stochastic simulations, and are therefore not scalable to large-scale systems. The ability to address discrete and continuum space in a unified manner will allow for a new synthesis of concepts and results between uncertain networks and systems described by partial differential equations.",

These range from existing systems such as the power grid, to future, highly interconnected systems of vehicular networks and the so-called Internet of Things. It is fair to say that our ability to build such systems is outpacing our understanding of their emergent behavior, their vulnerabilities and fragilities. This project was aimed at such a theoretical understanding of complex interconnected systems operating in imperfect and uncertain (random) environments. The effects of random events are traditionally investigated using extensive computer (referred to as Monte-Carlo) simulations. This approach is computationally prohibitive and does not scale to the very large interconnected systems that we can build. We developed a theoretical and computational framework to predict vulnerabilities and fragilities (mathematically described as instabilities). This analysis predicts margins of stability, which determine how close is an interconnected system to change from one type of behavior to another. It also predicts the ``shape of the instability\", which in networked systems corresponds to where in the network a potential vulnerability &nbsp;might be present. This can be done without the need for extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, and also provides metrics for distributed control design that can introduce additional feedback loops for better control of the network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Part of our work has been to make connections between the behavior of such large man-made networks and the statistical physics of disordered media. The analogy (though imperfect, but useful) is for example between a large network of vehicles in a noisy environment, and that of atoms or molecules in a fluid or imperfect crystals. The behavior of man-made large networks is just as varied and rich, and perhaps even more so.

Our analysis points to a highly sensitive amplification mechanism within the cochlea that due to network interactions can sometimes transition into an instability caused by minor random events. These random events, while rare, can have a significant impact and produce those spontaneous oscillations. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bassam&nbsp;A&nbsp;Bamieh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1408442/1408442_10320367_1546536414861_d_s_sys--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1408442/1408442_10320367_1546536414861_d_s_sys--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conversion of a stochastic system to a deterministic, matrix-valued system\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1408442/1408442_10320367_1546536414861_d_s_sys--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conversion of a stochastic system to a deterministic, matrix-valued system\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The key idea in analyzing mean-square stability of a stochastic system (left) is to convert to the equivalent deterministic (right) system that operates on covariance matrix-valued signals.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bamieh, B., & Filo, M.
