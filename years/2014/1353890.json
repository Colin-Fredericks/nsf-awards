 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Rutgers University is being jointly made by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Biophotonics, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate).\r\n \r\nScanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a technique that creates images of surfaces using a physical probe that scans the specimen. It provides researchers with unique capabilities of imaging, measuring, and manipulating single live cells and sub-cellular biological specimen on the same platform, with nanoscale spatial and force resolutions. The proposed research aims to develop a scanning probe microscope that overcomes limitations of commercially available devices that have \"stiff\" probes which are detrimental to creating 3D images of live biological specimens. The research outcomes of this IDBR award will be disseminated to the scientific community through (1) patent disclosure and licenses, (2) close collaboration with leading SPM companies, and (3) presentations in major cell biology, experimental biology, and biophysics conferences. The educational activities of the project include (1) Fostering multidisciplinary training by developing research based content for the curriculum in biology and engineering courses, (2) Recruitment and retention of under-represented students at the graduate and undergarduate level in the fields of biology and engineering, and (3) Outreach activities for middle- and high- school girls through open lab tours by leveraging the well-established programs at Rutgers (Rutgers Society for Women Engineers).\r\n\r\nSilicon-based cantilever probes universally used on all commercially available are too stiff and harsh to avoid deforming/damaging live biological surfaces (e.g., cell membrane), particularly for mammalian cells of large volume and soft and corrugated membrane. Moreover, both the contact-mode imaging protocol, currently the most effective mode for imaging single live cells in liquid, and the nanomechanical measurement protocol of open-loop nature, are not only prone to liquid-related disturbances and damage to the cell membrane, but also rather slow and narrow banded in imaging and measuring the nanomechanical properties of live cells. The project aims to overcome these limits through the development and integration of soft polymer-based cantilever probes, an adaptive imaging protocol of minimal deformation, and a control-based nanomechanical measurement protocol. The polymer-based cantilever will be designed and fabricated with contact stiffness and other mechanical properties tailored to SPM imaging and force interaction on mammalian cells. The imaging protocol of minimal-deformation will be developed based on an accurate quantification of the scanning-induced membrane deformation in real-time, to adaptively adjust both the scanning speed and the normal force to minimize membrane deformation and maximize the overall imaging efficacy. Then the control-based nanomechanical protocol is developed to completely remove the cantilever acceleration effect and substantially reduce the hydrodynamic force effect on the indentation measurement of live cells. The developed instrument will be evaluated and for its ability to quantify the viscoelasticity oscillation of cytoskeleton in real-time, and to quantify and correlate the morphological and mechanical evolutions of live cells during the cell division process.",

Through the support of this project, the team successfully designed, fabricated, and implemented a polymer-based cantilever probe for imaging and mechanical property characterization of live biological species including live cells. With the contact-stiffness over one order of magnitude smaller than that of the silicon-based cantilevers that are the standard choice and commercially available, the polymer-based cantilever substantially reduced the deformation and damage of the gentle membrane of live biological species such as live cells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">2. The PI?s group created a series of atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging algorithms that substantially increased the imaging speed in different imaging modes: (a). An adaptive contact-mode (ACM) AFM imaging technique that integrated, for the first time, online minimization of the probe-sample contact force with a data-driven iterative-learning-control as feedforward control into the topography tracking feedback control, resulting in over ten times faster imaging speed. (b). An adaptive multi-loop mode (AMLM) AFM imaging technique that, for the first time, introduced a feedback loop to regulate the mean value of the cantilever tapping into the existing tapping amplitude feedback control, resulting in over ten times faster imaging speed as well. And (c). an adaptive scanning contact-mode imaging for soft sample imaging in liquid, particularly, live mammalian cells, where the lateral scanning speed was adaptively adjusted to accommodate the variation of the sample topography, to minimize the scanning-caused sample deformation (e.g., deformation of the cell membrane) while optimizing the overall imaging throughput. The experimental implementation on live cells also demonstrated an over four times of increase in imaging speed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;3. The PI?s group also created a control-based nanomechanical measurement (CNM) protocol that substantially increased the measurement frequency range while reducing the measurement time when measuring the frequency-dependent viscoelasticity of soft materials such as polymers or live biological species. In the CNM protocol, the adverse effects of the probe-sample interaction force and the hardware dynamics (e.g., the cantilever fixture) on the measurement has been accounted for and cancelled, and the hydrodynamic force effect has been substantially reduced.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;4. The PI?s group has also combined and extended the above imaging and nanomechanical measurement techniques together to create a simultaneous imaging and nanomechanical mapping approach that allows the topography and the nanomechanical properties (particularly, the broadband viscoelasticity) to be correlated together in real-time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">5. The team has also applied the CNM protocol to the following biological studies on live cells: (I). S</span>tudy of&nbsp; nanomechanical evolution of live mammalian cells undergoing endocytotic processes. We found that (a) the plasma membrane of live mammalian cells exhibits a constant and quantifiable nanomechanical property evolutions; (b). Different chemical inhibitors of endocytosis elicit distinct changes in plasma membrane elastic modulus reflecting their specific molecular actions on the lipid configuration or the endocytic machinery; and (c). A previously unknown contribution of Cdc42&nbsp;<span class=\"s2\">to EGF-stimulated endocytosis at plasma membrane was unvealed. (II). Real-time </span>monitoring of the viscoelasticity oscillations of live cells. We found that <span class=\"s2\">t</span>he viscoelasticity of the PC3 cell measured followed the general power law very well, and clearly presented an oscillation with period around 200 second.&nbsp;<span class=\"s3\">And (III). Study of </span><span class=\"s4\">t</span>he cholesterol repletion effect on the nanomechanical properties of human umbilical vein endothelial cell. We found that cholesterol repletion may reinforce the coupling of Factin to plasma membrane by increasing actin stability, and the cholesterol might have modified the submembrane cytoskeletal organization of the cell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The outcomes in broader impacts include:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1. The research outcomes of this project have resulted in two US. patents on AFM imaging and nanomechanical measurements, of which, the one on AMLM imaging technique has been licensed to Bruker-Nano Inc. for ten years.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2. The<span>&nbsp; </span>research outcomes have been disseminated to the scientific community through over 17 journal publications, of which 14 articles have been published.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">3. Seven Ph.D. students have been partially supported by this project, of whom three have been successfully earned their degree, and one of them has become a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Iowa State University.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">4. Over 10 Master students have also been trained through this project. They have worked on research tasks relating to the proposed research objectives, including the use of the polymer cantilever probe for live cell imaging, implementation of the ACM imaging technique to the mapping of piezoelectric properties of the sample at high speed, and design, fabrication and build of a multi-degree-of-freedom precision micro manipulator for large-range AFM operation on multiple live cells.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">5. Over five undergraduate students have been trained through the REU-supplement support of this project. These students gained hands on experimental skills on Matlab-simulink programming, data acquisition, signal processing, and other basic experimental skills.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">6. The team has also hosted open laboratory tours to public during Rutgers Day in Rutgers University, over 40 K-12 students and their parents have visited the PI?s laboratory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Qingze&nbsp;Zou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353890/1353890_10303044_1559844134422_PolyPorbe_Image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353890/1353890_10303044_1559844134422_PolyPorbe_Image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scanning electronic images of the fabricated polymer-based cantilever probe.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353890/1353890_10303044_1559844134422_PolyPorbe_Image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scanning electronic images of the fabricated polymer-based cantilever probe.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Plan-view SEM image of afabricated cantilever array with (g) Au/Cr corrugated and (h) only at the tipregion.
