 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the principal unsolved problems in modern astrophysics is the formation and evolution of galaxies. Astronomers wish to understand when galaxies first emerge, how star formation changes over the history of the universe, as well as the physical constituents of galaxies. This award will resolve long-standing questions about galaxy evolution by performing a massive survey of the neutral hydrogen gas of hundreds of galaxies over the past 4.6 billion years.\r\n\r\nThe survey, named CHILES (the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey), takes advantage of an enormous program with NSF's Very Large Array (VLA) of radio telescopes to observe a section of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. Over 1,000 hours of VLA observing time have been granted, and the CHILES survey will be the first to provide details on the neutral gas distribution and kinematics for individual galaxies over several billion years of cosmic evolution. The data and associated products will be made available to the public, providing a legacy dataset for the entire astronomical community.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative award will also provide funding for six graduate students across the United States, creating a new cohort of skilled radio astronomers. Finally, the research team will incorporate the results of the survey into their general astronomy classes and in their numerous public outreach presentations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit of this project has been to carry out the first true deep field to explore the evolution of the gas content of galaxies over the past 4.6 billions years of cosmic evolution.  To carry out this project our major activities focused on: preparing and carrying out 1000 hours of observations at the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA); designing a fully automated pipeline to calibrate and flag the data without user intervention; optimizing the imaging of the data; scientifically explore the first 180 hours of data, and; preparing for science to be done with the full 1000 hours of data.\n\nWhile the observations were originally supposed to be completed by 2016, the new dynamic scheduling system at NRAO extended the observations to the summer of 2019. \n\nOur project is a true path finder for future surveys for redshifted neutral hydrogen (HI) that are planned for new radio telescopes in South Africa and Australia due the large bandwidth and the effects of man-made interference.   In fact, our data are being used to test the pipelines for both new surveys.\n\nThe major challenge for surveys like ours is processing data that has been strongly affected by man-made interference.  A major outcome of our work is that we have developed innovative new techniques for dealing with this challenge and we are now ready again to operate a pipeline in fully automated mode.  These lessons will benefit future surveys.  Although the testing of the pipeline was done by people around the world, the construction of the pipeline itself was done by Pisano at West Virginia University and it is available for general use via GitHub:  https://github.com/djpisano3/chiles-pipeline.\n\nTo make accurate images of the sky our main challenge has been to remove signal from sources far from our targeted field center.

To date, three students have earned their PhDs working on CHILES and there are at least six more to come.  Two of those students are Native Americans.  The results of this work have been featured in public talks by Pisano in the US and South Africa. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Pisano"
