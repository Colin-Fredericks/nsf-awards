 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves retention and graduate rates in STEM fields at Boise State University. A goal of a six-year graduation rate of seventy percent has been established. To achieve this, the project recruits academically excellent and diverse recipients, establishes  cohorts, and offers 13-15 scholarships and other academic programming annually to civil engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, materials science, and mechanical engineering undergraduates. The project provides scholarships and support for at least two years, and smaller transitional scholarships for up to two additional years.  Outcomes are monitored throughout the course of the project. Funding and cohort participation enables students receiving scholarships both to graduate more quickly and in greater numbers. Boise State University serves the third-largest metropolitan area in the American Northwest and has a particular responsibility in supporting workforce and economic development. This project helps to meet demands created by both increasing enrollments as well as regional economic development. The project helps to increase the number of students that continue education after high school and complete four-year college degrees. This S-STEM project provides a critical component needed to improve college completion rates and increase the state and regional STEM workforce.  \r\n\r\nGiven Federal and regional imperatives to increase STEM graduates, there is merit in promoting educational and research programs that are successful in retaining and graduating students in STEM fields. This project offers detailed assessment, recruitment, and retention data to help establish effective practices in STEM retention. Such data are particularly beneficial in offering insight on serving groups currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines including Hispanics, first generation college students, and non-traditional students who often must balance studies with substantive family responsibilities. The project utilizes experienced, multidisciplinary personnel to help advise students and carryout the project plan. Particular areas of expertise include student selection, coordination, assessment and career placement. Furthermore, the identification and dissemination of the project's effective practices offers information useful to other institutions seeking to increase graduation rates and retention in STEM fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough this grant, the National Science Foundation supported 62 students majoring in engineering and computer science at Boise State U??niversity between fall 2014 and fall 2019.  Building on the success of previous S-STEM grants at Boise State, the goal of this grant was to increase the retention, and ultimately the 6-year graduation rate for students to 70%.  Prior S-STEM awards in engineering at Boise State reached an average 61% 6-year graduation rate.\n\n\n Scholarship awards were made to 62 students pursuing degrees in engineering and computer science. In addition to demonstrating financial need, qualifications included United States citizenship or permanent residency, and demonstrated academic talent with a minimum GPA of 3.0. Students were supported for between one and seven semesters, with the average award length of six semesters. Scholarship amounts ranged from $500 to $2500 per semester.\n\n \n\nA significant result of this program has been the projected 74% retention rate within computer science and engineering, as 46 of the 62 students are on track to complete their engineering or computer science degrees at Boise State.  Thirty-two students or approximately 52% of the scholarship students have graduated as of fall 2019, with the remaining 14 students on track to graduate in either spring of 2020 or fall of 2020.  Of the16 students that are no longer within their original major, eight of them remained at Boise State and have or are on track to complete degrees.  Two of these students completed STEM degrees outside of engineering and computer science, one in applied mathematics and one in biology.  These results translate to a 77% retention rate for STEM, and 87% retention rate for all majors.  \n\n \n\nIn addition to improved retention, this program has delivered very strong graduation results.  27 students are on track to complete their degree in 4 years, for an almost 44% 4-year graduation rate by spring of 2020.  These rates are a significant improvement over the College of Engineering 4-year graduation rate for engineering and computer science students of 16%, as well as the Boise State University 4-year graduation rate of 21% during the same time period.  The grant?s resulting 74% 6-year graduation rate is also significantly higher than the six-year graduation rate for engineering and computer science majors of 30% and the university-wide six-year graduation rate of 46% during the same time period.\n\n \n\nThe program goal was to connect students with university staff, faculty and resources while creating community.  In order to provide convenient and continuous support of students, a ?One Stop Shop\" approach was developed with a Scholarship Coordinator who is a licensed professional engineer providing students with a single point of contact.  Conveniently located in the College of Engineering Advising Office, she assisted students with academic, career and financial needs. In addition to dedicated advising and career support, semi-regular monthly events were held on and off campus at a variety of times to allow for class schedules, commuting, family and work commitments. Activities consisted of a combination of social events, career development workshops on resumes, internships, research, and career fair preparedness. A scholarship events calendar along with a Facebook group and regular email were used to communicate information and details on event programming. \n\n \n\nIn a post grant survey completed by more than 55% of the scholarship recipients, the majority of students reported their scholarship as being critical to their timely graduation. Students reported that the financial support was critical to their retention and graduation. A majority reported that the scholarship lowered their student loan and debts, while increasing opportunities to pursue undergraduate research or internships as well as allowing them to increase their credit load during a semester and complete their degree.  The survey also confirmed students? desire for a combination of informal social and network activities as well as career focused opportunities. Overall for those that participated in the various events, 64% reported events as being very beneficial, with 76% of the respondents reporting events providing some benefit. Regular semester advising meetings with the Scholarship Coordinator and the holiday and end of semester socials had the highest percentage of participation and satisfaction, followed by meetings with the faculty.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Don Plumlee"
