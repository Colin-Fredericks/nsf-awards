 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the discovery, by the PI and his collaborators, of surprising interconnections between seemingly disparate questions in mathematics. As always with such discoveries, this understanding facilitates dialogue between previously disconnected fields, with the consequence that well understood structures in one area may be profitably translated into another.  Such confluences also offer ideal training grounds for graduate students: there are many new, exciting, and unexplored questions on which to work; at the same time, the answers clarify old and established fields of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn particular the project centers around a conjecture (due to the PI and collaborators) equating certain algebrao-geometric invariants of plane curve singularities with topological invariants of knots determined by the singularities. Specifically, the former is the local contribution of the singular curve to motivic or categorified Donaldson-Thomas theory, and the latter are the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies. The research project aims at a proof by passing through two other subjects: the theory of Legendrian knots and the non-abelian Hodge correspondence. This intersection of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and low dimensional topology is the only place in mathematics where the quantum SU(n) invariants and their categorifications have ever been seen as coming from the geometry of a knot in space, as opposed to from its planar projections. In addition, the research touches meaningfully on many subjects of present mathematical interest: enumerative geometry as influenced by string theory, the Hitchin system, Khovanov-Rozansky homology, the Cherednik algebra and its representations, legendrian knots and symplectic field theory, and 3-manifold invariants. It may be expected to advance some of these separately by exploiting their connections. In particular the project aims to make progress on the \"P = W\" conjecture in nonabelian Hodge theory, and on the question in symplectic field theory of whether all representations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg dga come from geometry.\r\n\r\nThe award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main intellectual goal of the project \"Curves, Knots, Hilbert schemes, and the Hitchin system\" was to investigate certain mathematical structures appearing simultaneously in various branches of mathematics.  Specifically, the so-called quantum invariants of knots, which in mathematics arise from the representation theory of quantum groups, are known from string theory to also govern certain counts of curves ending on knots.  This served as the launching point for the present project, which sought to develop some mathematical structures related to the above connection. \n\nIn the course of these explorations, we found many new structures and explained some connections between certain well known ones.  Broadly speaking we understood the hidden geometry behind certain commonly studied algebraic structures; in the technical jargon, we showed that the so-called cluster varieties could be realized as moduli spaces of augmentations of algebras associated to certain Legendrian knots.  In practice this means that results which previously required pages of algebra to establish can now be rigorously demonstrated by drawing pictures.  \n\nRelated investigations led to the systematic use of sheaf-theoretic methods to resolve questions in symplectic geometry; while this approach has some previous and concurrent examples, we believe that some of the most compelling indications of its power appeared in our result that the conormal torus is a complete knot invariant.  \n\nMost likely the main lasting impact of this work will be the increasing dialogue between the symplectic geometry and sheaf theoretic communities.  This injection of new methods has the potential to spark many new developments in these subjects. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vivek Shende"
