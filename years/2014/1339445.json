 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Togiak Archaeological and Paleoecological Project (TAPP) is a long term study of paleoecology and Yup'ik Eskimo village history, demographics, subsistence, technology, and social change in northern Bristol Bay, Alaska. The project is centered on the Old Togiak archaeological site, where previous investigations in the early 1960s identified stratified house mounds of the Thule phase, dated to the last 1000 years. With excellent preservation of faunal remains, house features, and a wide variety of stone, bone, antler, ivory, and wooden tools, the site offers abundant potential to address research questions associated with village evolution, and subsistence strategies. In the long term, the project will test alternative hypotheses linking climate change and resource access to patterns of village occupation and foraging strategies.   The proposal is appropriate to the EAGER funding mechanism because the geophysical investigation will require significant exploration and analysis before a well constrained and defensible protocol can be established for a full research project. In addition, laboratory studies emphasizing extensive radiocarbon dating are needed to construction of an initial paleoecological model, and preliminary evaluation of subsistence behavior over time.  This preliminary data and analyses are critical for envisioning the direction of a full research effort.   \r\n\r\nThe project is important to other archaeological investigations because it will set out the protocols and create models of complex mound sites and as such provide an economical way for investigating these complex archaeological sites.  The research will also provide insights into issues of critical importance concerning the relationship between climate and shifting resource exploitation strategies and the evolution of social complexity.  Another issue critical for this project is that the Old Togiak Site, which is a uniquely large mound site in South Western Alaska, is at risk of being destroyed in the next few years by beach erosion, ice damage, and subsistence digging.   In addition, the project team will utilize the first year of the project to consult extensively with the Togiak community about the design of the second year's field research.  This process will provide a model for Alaska Native community consultation and inclusion in archaeological research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Togiak Archaeological and Paleoecological Project was designed as a study of Yup'ik Eskimo cultural history and adaptations during the past 1000 years.  Research was developed in a collaborative partnership with indigenous and descendent groups in the Bristol Bay area of southwest Alaska with a focus on the Old Togiak site.  Previous research in the early 1960s established baseline knowledge of the site as potentially containing evidence for long term history of ancestral Yup'ik culture.  However, as was typical of the time, the original excavator did not routinely collect data on smaller artifacts, faunal remains, or plant materials.  The site was not radiocarbon dated though artifacts indicated ocupation during the Thule period of post-1000 years ago. \nThis project sought to test hypotheses about human response to changing subsistence resource conditions during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age as well as to explore archaeological evidence for the ancient history of the Bristol Bay Yup'ik people. This was accomplished by developing a new site map, conducting an archaeological geophysical survey in the portion of the site with greatest density of cultural materials, drawing profile maps of exposed sections of site strata (associated with illicit artifact digger activity), collecting core samples from contexts across the site, and conducting a range of lab studies of materials acquired from the cores including radiocarbon dating.  Geophysical research was experimental in the sense that this approach to archaeological site mapping has not often been explored in arctic tundra contexts and was subject to a number of challenges. \nField and lab research were highly successful and resulted in a series of contributions to intellectual merit.  Profiles drawn on sections of the site subject to illicit digging revealed evidence for repeated establishment of living surfaces eventually forming mounds somewhat similar to the tells of the Near East. Magnetometry was used to image potential buried features and despite challenges of hummocky terrain and frequent metal artifacts (that interfere with magnetic readings) magnetic anomalies consistently indicated contexts containing cultural material.  Thirty cores were excavated in places indicated as potentially productive by geophysics and also on the largest of the site's four stratified house mounds.  The cores provided direct indications that finely buried cultural occupation components were present across the site with abundant artifacts, ecofacts, and cultural features.  Forty radiocarbon dates were run and results provided a first time dating of the Old Togiak site.  Accepted dates spanned approximately 1250-1900 CE, almost entirely within the Little Ice Age (LIA), a time of known high marine resource productivity in the eastern Bering Sea and North Pacific. \nLab studies of recovered items permitted a number of conclusions.  Pollen studies confirmed a grass and low-shrub dominated tundra pattern during the LIA, thus indicating relatively cold conditions.  Macrobotanical analysis (study of recovered seeds and other macroscopic plant items) confirmed the results of the pollen study and provided the first archaeological evidence in the southwestern Alaskan area for traditional exploitation of several species of berries and other plant foods. Analysis of 4303 animal bones revealed new insights regarding exploitation of fisheries along with mammalian and avian fauna.  A limited sample of small artifacts was also recovered that included stone flakes, fire-cracked rock (presumably from cooking activities), and ceramic sherds. \nTaken together along with results from the original research in the 1960s, this study supported the hypothesis that colder conditions of the LIA created favorable marine resource conditions for the establishment of permement human settlements on the southwestern Alaskan coast. While substantially more research is required to fully understand this process, it is clear that ancestral Yup'ik people established the Old Togiak (Temyik Tuyuryak) village at the beginning of the LIA and held it with only limited short breaks into the modern period.  During this time it is clear that several species of berries, salmon, herring, water birds, and seals were of particular importance. Future research will be necessary to fully develop our archaeological understanding of the evolution of many other Yup'ik traditions including aspects of their rich cememonial life.\nThe project has offered a number of broader impacts.  It contributed to education by offering internships to two Native Alaskan students from the University of Alaska and employing a number of students from the University of Montana.  The field and lab work at old Togiak was co-directed by a Native Alaskan post-doctoral scholar.The project has also built bridges between the archaeological community and indigenous groups in the Bristol Bay area.  A collaboration between the University of Montana and the Togiak community and Traditional Council continues with a focus on recording memories of elders who lived at the Old Togiak site.   Finally, this work contributes to our understanding of human decision-making with respect to the impacts of past climate change.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anna M Prentiss\nProject data and detailed report can be found via this link:\n\nhttp://hs.umt.edu/togiak\n\n \n\n \nLast Modified: 03/23/2017\nSubmitted by: Anna M Prentiss"
