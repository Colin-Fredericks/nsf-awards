This Workshop will bring together 22 recognized national experts from academe, industry, and government to develop a vision of how such a future nanotechnology infrastructure support program could be structured and what the key needs for the broad user communities are over the coming decade. The Workshop will be held on August 18-19, 2014 at the Westin Arlington Gateway Hotel in Arlington, VA, with portions of the proceedings made available to remote participants via web conferencing. Dr. Thomas Theis (IBM Research, on assignment to the Semiconductor Research Corporation) and Dr. Mark Tuominen (University of Massachusetts, Amherst) will serve as co-chairs.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop will seek to develop and articulate a vision for a future nanotechnology infrastructure support program that advances science, technology and education by enabling the research and technical development communities to bring key opportunities of nanotechnology to fruition. The primary objectives of the Workshop are to: (i) Identify the important goals of a nanotechnology infrastructure support program and recommend ways that these goals can best be achieved; (ii) Identify the key needs of the user communities and how these needs are expected to evolve over the next ten years; (iii) Develop recommendations for the organization and coordination of user facilities within the program, and recommend an appropriate selection process and selection criteria; and (iv) Consider the importance of integrating student education, training, and outreach into an infrastructure program, and in identifying ways that the program can address societal concerns. The Workshop will deliver a report outlining the vision, opportunities, and needs, which will be provided to NSF and be made publicly available through the NSF website.",
