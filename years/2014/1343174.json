 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE award brings together research areas traditionally supported in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering,Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Directorate for Engineering, and in the Division of Behavior and Cognitive Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. Cognition arises from the activity within complex brain circuits.  These brain circuits are laid out according to a species' genetic blueprint.  Past and current successes in uncovering the biological basis of cognition include the discovery of areas in the human brain supporting specific cognitive functions, the determination of the roles that specific cell types play in the behavior of animals like the mouse, and the increasingly detailed understanding of the impact specific genes and their alterations can have on cognitive functions in health and disease.  The goal of this interdisciplinary project, conducted at The Rockefeller University, is to directly determine the genetic specificity of brain circuit elements that are critically important for high-level cognitive function.  This project will be significant by 1) elucidating the complexity of biological organization from the level of genes, through cell types, brain areas, and neural circuits to behavior, 2) developing new technology that will allow researchers to dissect brain circuits underlying cognition with the precision and specificity of model organisms, and 3) improving the understanding of how genetic alterations impact cognition.  The interdisciplinary project at the interface of cognitive neuroscience, neural systems, and neurotechnology, is expected to have broader impacts on society by providing insights into some of the deepest questions about the human mind and by offering unique educational and outreach opportunities to improve public understanding of the organization and function of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the genetic specificity of a multi-node brain circuit that supports cognitive function.  The circuit will be localized with functional and structural magnetic brain imaging.  Genetic expression patterns of projection neurons within multiple circuit nodes will then be determined using cutting edge molecular techniques.  The functions of the projection neurons linking the nodes will then be determined through advanced and custom-designed optogenetic and electrophysiological techniques.  The same optogenetic approach will then be used for causal interrogation of projection neurons in cognitive and emotional behaviors.  Combining the gene expression and functional data, predictions for how specific polymorphisms in human genes may alter cognitive-emotional abilities will be generated. These predictions will be tested through functional brain imaging and behavioral testing of genotyped subjects.  Together, these investigations will provide deep insights into the brain circuits and genetic underpinnings that make possible the cognitive functions of the human mind.",
