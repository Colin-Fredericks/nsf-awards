Multiscale modeling of materials has emerged as a central theme to address the complexities in the prediction of material behavior. This conference will bring together a range of scientists from around the world and from different sub disciplines to exchange ideas on this topic. The development of multi scale materials for materials is of significance for the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative. \r\n\r\nThis award provides financial assistance for graduate students and post doctoral researchers to attend the conference by partially supporting their attendance cost. It is expected that about half of such attendees from US institutions will be supported. By providing such financial assistance this award contributes to the goal of broadening the participation in the discipline.",
