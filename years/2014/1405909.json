 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the study of a new kind of \"superfluid\" (a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate) which not only flows without resistance (one of the characteristics of superfluids) but also presents magnetic order (like a bar magnet).  This superfluid is made up of an atomic gas that is cooled to extremely low temperatures and confined by a so-called \"optical tweezer trap\" (created by laser light) within a vacuum chamber.  The researchers supported by this project will examine the magnetic characteristics of this gaseous material, and also clarify ways in which the magnetism and superfluidity of this material influence one another.  The broader goal of this work is to help understand materials better, in particular those materials where the theory of quantum mechanics plays a dominant role (such materials can be expected to be increasingly put to use, particularly when they involve short length scales such as in the microelectronics industry).  Toward this goal, the magnetic superfluid studied here is a useful test subject, one for which all of the basic physics underlying the material properties is believed to be known, and to which one can apply very precise and sensitive measurement techniques.  The project will take place at a public University, and will support the training of graduate students in that setting.\r\n\r\nThe project is focused on three specific aims.  The first is to characterize magnons in magnetically ordered superfluids.  These magnons are the elementary magnetic excitations of these materials.  A variety of approaches, many based on directly imaging the propagation of magnon waves, will be used to measure the magnon energy, damping, magnetic moment, and nonlinearities, and also to clarify the role of long-range magnetic dipole interactions.  The second aim of this project is to study the condensation of magnons within ferromagnetic superfluids, related to the phenomenon of magnon condensation in solid-state magnetic materials.  The third aim is to study the influence of spatially varying magnetization (spin textures) on mass currents and spin currents.  This work will study differences between the study of scalar superfluids and magnetically ordered superfluids, with the goal of identifying the basic processes in the hydrodynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (something one might call \"superfluid magnetohydrodynamics\").",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examined the magnetic excitations that permeate a novel form of matter, a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, in which two intriguing phenomena, superfluidity and magnetism, occur simultaneously.  As is true for other, better known materials, characterizing the magnetic excitations within spinor Bose-Einstein condensates allows us to describe the properties of the material in a more simple and intuitive picture, and, from this understanding, to develop new methods to manipulate and use the material in interesting ways.  In this work, the first quantitative characterization of such magnetic excitations (magnons) was performed, giving surprisingly precise values for the effective mass of the magnon and its energy gap, and thereby challenging our theoretical understanding of the material.  Once their properties were characterized, magnons were employed in a novel type of thermometer, with which the temperature of the coldest ultracold atomic gases was measured for the first time.  The project also identified a phase transition that occurs within spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, a \"second\" condensation of the magnons within the superfluid gas.  Magnon condensation occurs also in several other materials (solids, liquids and gases), but the phase transition occurring in the spinor Bose-Einstein gas has a more fundamental nature and is described by simple, first principles.  The project also supported the development of new experimental methods for future studies of ultracold atomic gases composed of more than one element from the periodic table, and also of ultracold gases composed of molecules.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan M Stamper-Kurn"
