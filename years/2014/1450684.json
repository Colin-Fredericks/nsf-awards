 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 1 in 6 people die from coronary artery disease (CAD). Over half of CAD patients require either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques. CABG has proven more effective than PCI in long term clinical studies, but is currently less utilized. This is in part because saphenous vein grafts (SVGs), the most commonly used conduit in these procedures, fail nearly half the time within 18 months. This failure is primarily due to narrowing of the vein graft in a process known as intimal hyperplasia. When failure occurs, re-do CABG operations are required at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality.  The proposed technology/product, VasculoStent, is designed to prevent, rather than prolong, intimal hyperplasia so that the initial CABG procedure is more successful and does not require re-do operations.\r\n\r\nVenoStent, is placed around the outside of SVGs during CABG procedures to improve adaptation of the vein to the high pressure, high flow environment of the arterial circulation. It is comprised of a porous mesh of shape memory polymers (SMPs) that offer several unique advantages including: custom-fitting to avoid flow-mediated thrombosis and hyperplasia; robust, facile surgical placement; mechanical compliance to withstand blood vessel pulsation similar to an artery; biocompatibility and slow biodegradability; ease of programming and manufacturing; and high porosity to promote microvascular growth to repair damaged vessel tissue. VenoStent may result in more prevalent clinical implementation and improvement in patient outcomes compared to other external stents currently in clinical trials.",
