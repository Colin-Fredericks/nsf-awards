 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the principal unsolved problems in modern astrophysics is the formation and evolution of galaxies. Astronomers wish to understand when galaxies first emerge, how star formation changes over the history of the universe, as well as the physical constituents of galaxies. This award will resolve long-standing questions about galaxy evolution by performing a massive survey of the neutral hydrogen gas of hundreds of galaxies over the past 4.6 billion years.\r\n\r\nThe survey, named CHILES (the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey), takes advantage of an enormous program with NSF's Very Large Array (VLA) of radio telescopes to observe a section of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. Over 1,000 hours of VLA observing time have been granted, and the CHILES survey will be the first to provide details on the neutral gas distribution and kinematics for individual galaxies over several billion years of cosmic evolution. The data and associated products will be made available to the public, providing a legacy dataset for the entire astronomical community.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative award will also provide funding for six graduate students across the United States, creating a new cohort of skilled radio astronomers. Finally, the research team will incorporate the results of the survey into their general astronomy classes and in their numerous public outreach presentations.",

To carry out this project our major activities focused on: preparing and carrying out 1000 hours of observations at the Jansky Very Large Array; designing a fully automated pipeline to calibrate and flag the data without user intervention; optimizing the imaging of the data; scientifically explore the first 180 hours of data, and; preparing for science to be done with the full 1000 hours of data.\n\nWe were originally allocated 1000 hours of observations over three consecutive B configurations of the VLA.

NRAO recently guaranteed the completion of all observations by Summer 2019.\n\nOur project is a true path finder for future surveys for redshifted HI. The large instantaneous bandwidth, the huge number of channels (31000) and the very strong Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) all posed significant challenges.\n\nTwo major challenges for surveys like CHILES are removing RFI without flagging too much data and, then, calibrating parts of the spectrum that are affected by extremely strong RFI.  A major outcome of our work is that we have developed innovative new techniques for dealing with both of these challenges and we are now ready again to operate a pipeline in fully automated mode.  These are hard-earned lessons that will benefit future deep radio surveys.  Although the testing of the pipeline was done by people at the University of Massachusetts, Virginia Tech, Columbia University and ASTRON in the Netherlands, the construction of the pipeline itself was done by Pisano at West Virginia University and it is available for general use via GitHub  https://github.com/djpisano3/chiles-pipeline.\n\nTo make accurate images of the sky our main challenge has been to remove signal from sources far from our targeted field center.  We designed, tested, and implemented computational approaches to correcting for the unwanted signal from the telescope and from sources outside of our main targeted field.  Because of the unprecedented size and complexity of this survey, we explored different computing environments to optimally process this unusually large data base, concluding that imaging is best done at a cloud computing platform (e.g. Amazon Web Services). This work was led by our collaborators at ICRAR in Australia.  The results are published in Astronomy and Computing (Dodson et al 2016) \n\nWe imaged HI in emission from a galaxy at at z=0.376 - the most distant galaxy ever imaged in HI emission.

The galaxy looks more similar to galaxies found at high redshift and forms an ideal laboratory for studying the so called clumpy disk galaxies often seen at higher redshifts.

To date, three students have earned their PhDs working on CHILES and there are at least six more to come.  Two of those students are Native Americans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Min Yun"
