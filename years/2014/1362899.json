 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a flexible technician education framework that draws on the experience of the National Network Manufacturing Institutes (NNMIs) to prepare the workforce for the advanced manufacturing technical occupations of the future. The framework is being developed and piloted for curricular materials focused on Additive Manufacturing (AM) in a manner that is broadly applicable to technician education programs in other technical areas to be determined under the NNMI program. In addition the framework and associated knowledge, skills and competencies are being built around broadly accepted national and international standards (e.g. ASTM, ISO) in order to ensure broad industry recognition and acceptance. A series of workshops centered on deploying 6 modules across a variety of existing courses in AM are being held, and these are serving as the baseline for evaluating the efficacy of the framework.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nEmerging advanced manufacturing educational efforts traditionally lag behind the required technician competencies in the industrial sector, which increases the shortage of qualified technicians and slows the adoption of new advanced manufacturing technologies. This project is establishing a system for the creation of educational support materials that can be accelerated into the educational marketplace. It is anticipated that this model can be replicated and utilized to seamlessly integrate and align technician education to new emerging technologies that mature out of the NNMI efforts. This project is providing a framework to structure the technical educational elements and streamline the delivery format for technical education while addressing the needs of an industry driven technically competent workforce.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThe materials utilize components of deeper learning to engage students from a broad variety of cultural and socio-economic demographics. Students solve complex engineering related issues through a process that fosters a sense of ownership as well as responsibility. Project personnel work closely with an Industry Advisory Council (IAC) comprised of industry stakeholders to identify appropriate content, and the IAC is providing ideas that capture the regional applications of advanced manufacturing. The flexible framework model is maximizing integration into existing curriculum materials by creating modules.",

When a module is brought into such an environment the increased hands on experience through lab exercises builds real world skill and reinforces the knowledge learned in the lecture based portion of the presentation material.  Presented information was refined from both education and industry feedback to bolster effectiveness in creating a more knowledgeable and skilled AM user base.\n \n With the AMPLiFI material and AM technologies, students have another tool with which to solve challenges.  AM is not an end all be all solution, however when properly applied it can allow for rapid development and advancement in problem solving at a pace far quicker than possible with traditional manufacturing.  Knowing when and how to use additive manufacturing allows students to quickly develop new ideas into new products, develop tools and aides in support of traditional manufacturing, and create custom tailored objects and devices where none were available or were prohibitively expensive or time consuming to do so before, be they custom tailored prosthetics and surgical guides or more efficient rocket nozzles.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc J Madou"
