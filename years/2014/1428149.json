 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Reseach Instrumentation (MRI) program, the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program, the University of Delaware will acquire an X-Ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). An XPS measures the binding energy of the electrons from the chemical elements in a sample. These data provide identification of the chemical composition of the material. Hence, XPS is a principal method for the study of surface chemistry, reactivity, and composition. It is a basic analytical method across a broad spectrum of science and engineering (STEM) disciplines. This acquisition will be a critical resource for the State of Delaware. It will serve other institutions in Delaware including Delaware State University, an HBCU. The instrument will be open access and remotely accessible broadening its availability. It will be used in undergraduate and graduate level courses to train the next generation of scientists in state-of-the-art analysis techniques.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as studying (a) fuel cell performance; (b) photovoltaic materials; (c) catalyst characterization; (d) geomicrobiology; (e) orthopaedic materials; (f) magnetic materials; (g) solid state ionics; (h) functional biomaterials; (i) atmospheric and analytical chemistry; and (j) membrane design.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\nTo support the research and educational mission of the University and within the State of Delaware, this project allowed the acquisition of a modern, highly automated XPS that was subsequently installed in the Surface Analysis Facility (SAF) in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Delaware. This instrument has become a key addition to the research infrastructure at the University of Delaware.  A total of 24 individual research groups across two institutions (University of Delaware and Temple University) currently make use of this instrument. Samples may be submitted for analysis by an experienced technician, or students and postdoctoral fellows within the research groups can be trained to operate the instrument on their own. Currently, there are 45 trained users of the instrument.  Typical usage is 195 hours per month, which corresponds to about 6.5 hr/day, 7 days/week based on a 30-day month.  Note that these numbers do not include sample pump down time, which consumes most of the remaining time per day/week/month.  The research enabled by this instrument has advanced the study of a wide range of scientific questions dealing with interfacial chemistry.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n \n\nApproximately 50 students and postdoctoral fellows were trained in the operation of this instrument during the time period of the grant.  Two additional students were trained to serve as technicians for this instrument, which required that they learn additional details of instrument design, operation, maintenance and use.  The experiences of all trained students and postdoctoral fellows has helped prepare them for future employment by enhancing their research productivity and providing them with new state-of-the-art research skills.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Murray V Johnston"
