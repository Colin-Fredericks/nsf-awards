The attendees participating in this conference will share ideas and visions of the future for a greener California and the nation. This annual conference, started in 2012, has enabled exchange of information and ideas among universities, industries, research and development laboratories and government agencies to propel renewable energy technology into the future. The one day conference typically consists of invited talks, paper and poster presentations, exhibits, workshops and tour of CSUN renewable energy facilities, thus providing a unique opportunity for communication and collaboration between academia, government and industry.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe California Renewable Energy and Storage Technology (CREST) Conference 2014, to be held at the campus of California State University, Northridge on August 15, 2014, is envisioned to bring together researchers, engineers, consultants and policy-makers in the field of Renewable Energy and Advanced Energy Storage Technology.  California, the third largest and the most populous state in the US, has significant energy needs that must be addressed adequately in order to minimize impact on air quality the potential for climate change. To meet California?s clean energy goals, renewable energy generation, distribution and storage systems need to be designed based on existing infrastructure that will be able to provide sustainable and reliable power to the consumers. These systems include solar photovoltaic, distributed wind, fuel cells, electric vehicles, etc. as well as design of green buildings, efficient home appliances, smart measurement devices, and sensors. Smart control of energy demand in an electric network is needed to enhance system reliability, security and efficiency of the overall electric network. The CREST Conference 2014 will include presentation and dissemination of advanced research activities in these critical areas of sustainable energy from leading experts in the industry, academia and national labs.  Although this is a regional conference, the state of California is a leader in renewable energy adoption, and so outcomes of this conference may have national impact.  The proposed conference will involve active participation of undergraduate and graduate students from CSUN, which is certified as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, as well as an Asian American Native American-Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI).   Invitations will be extended to science teachers and students from local community college as well, to maximize participation and outreach.",
