 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species represent the fundamental units of evolutionary and ecological studies, yet their nature and how best to circumscribe them remain controversial. The southeastern US Wild Gingers (Asarum subgenus Heterotropa) are a highly variable group of plants that have long been problematic in their species boundaries, as well as being poorly known with respect to reproductive biology.   This project develops a novel quantitative approach to delimiting species and characterizing reproductive biology by integrating data from sophisticated morphological analysis, climatic variables, geography, cutting-edge DNA analysis, and pollinator identity that can serve as a model for future work.\r\n\r\nThe appreciation, management, and conservation of biodiversity are greatly hindered by ill-defined species boundaries, and this project develops a powerful new tool for investigators of any biological system.  Collections made for the study will be publicly available to other investigators.  An online database will serve as an identification resource for ecologists, land managers, and amateur botanists who encounter SE US Wild Gingers. This project will support the research and training of a doctoral student, and the public at large will benefit through exhibits at the annual Ohio State University Museum of Biological Diversity Open House, public lectures, and a laboratory module to be designed for use in introductory biology courses.",
