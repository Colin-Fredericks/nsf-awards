 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. \r\n\r\nThe potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.",

In contrast, normal matter, meaning the everyday stuff of the Earth and planets, people, plants and animals, accounts for only about 5%.  Scientists are sure that dark matter exists based on how it affects planets and galaxies through the gravitational force.  However, dark matter does not interact with light &ndash; it does not absorb or emit light like normal matter &ndash; and this is why it is termed \"dark matter\".

The gravitational force is far too weak to detect one dark matter particle, so scientists try to use the so-called weak nuclear force, which is known to cause decay of some normal particles.  The hypothesis that most experiments start with is that the dark matter is made of massive particles that interact with normal matter through the weak force.  The name for this type of hypothetical dark matter particle is \"WIMP\" &ndash; Weakly Interacting Massive Particle.
