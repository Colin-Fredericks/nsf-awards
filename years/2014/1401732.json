  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the analysis of mathematical models (systems of equations) for describing the evolution of particles and the compressible fluid, such as a gas, in which these particles are dispersed.  This work's scientific merit lies in the areas of application for the these models.  These models arise in fields of application such as combustion analysis, sedimentation analysis, medicine, biotechnology, and waste-water recycling.  While the engineers, doctors, and scientists interested in the solutions to these models will want data from numerical studies approximating solutions, the models must be analyzed to determine their mathematical soundness.  This mathematical analysis is the focus of the work funded under this grant.\n\nOne aspect of a mathematical model that must be investigated is the existence of solutions to the model and what type of solutions exist.  This was investigated in the first aspect of the project, looking at the existence of so-called measure-valued solutions to model for which the particles are dispersed in a one-dimensionial, invicscid fluid under certain conditions.  The existence of these solutions is shown by considering solutions to analgous models for viscous fluids with smaller viscosities, and taking the limit as the viscosity converges to zero.  Taking this limit yields the measure-valued solutions.\n\nAnother aspect to be investigated is the uniqueness of solutions.  For this, the relatively recently development framework of convex integration was employed.  While it is well known that so-called strong solutions may not exist past a certain short time for models of inviscid fluid flow, we can consider so-called weak solutions.  The problem is that there are often multiple weak solutions to such models.  The work funded by this grant has established the calculations proving the existence of infinitely many weak solutions in a mathematically simpler case where the flux of the equations does not have explicit dependence on the spatial variable.  However, work continues on looking at possible conditions which will cover only one of the weak solutions.\n\nThe final main component of the research conducted under this grant involves the validity of the models on physical grounds.  The equations considered under this grant cover the macroscopic variables.  However, the main derivation for this model has been for mesoscopic variables.  Previous formal calculations have shown that solutions to the mesoscopic problem do converge to solutions to the macroscopic problem.  The work covered under this grant is to establish this result with mathematical rigor.  This work is currently being investigated in the case where there is no external forcing term.  Future work will investigate this question when there is an external force acting on the particles and the fluid.\n\nMost of the work in this grant in some way employs relative entropy methods for analyzing systems of partial differential equations that are either hyperbolic or mixed hyperbolic/parabolic in nature.  However, previous work on these methods focuses on the case where the flux of the equations depends only on the solution to the model.  In order to handle the full form of these fluid-particle interaction models, these methods must be adjusted to handle a flux that also depends upon the spatial variable.  In order to learn some techniques that could be applied, a photon-scattering equation was analyzed.  In this work, conditions were established that showed the formation of a type of Bose-Einstein condensate if the initial number density of the photons was in the correct range.  While this departs from the fluid-particle interaction under investigation, the photon-scattering model is mathematically similar to the fluid-particle interaction models.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Ballew"
