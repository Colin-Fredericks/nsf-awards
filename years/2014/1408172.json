 "awd_abstract_narration": "The remarkable advances in computing and communications technologies in recent decades have been based on conventional electronics whose fundamental limits are rapidly being approached.  In order to meet the demands for future low-power, high-performance memory and logic devices, new physical mechanisms and advanced materials that exploit them are urgently required.  A promising approach is to harness the electron spin degree of freedom in a paradigm widely known as spintronics.  The key to realizing spintronics technologies is the capability to efficiently manipulate the electron spin in nanoscale devices.  This research program seeks a fundamental understanding of exciting new phenomena that emerge at interfaces between magnetic and nonmagnetic materials, which offer powerful new mechanisms to manipulate electron spins.  The fundamental research will have broad technological impact by enabling new classes of spintronic devices for ultralow-power, high-performance computation and mass data storage, significantly impacting mobile computing and global energy efficiency.  The program will train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced nanotechnologies, and provide enrichment through international collaborations.  Research, education, and outreach are highly integrated by teaming graduate students with undergraduates, local high school teachers and underrepresented students.  Educational media including instructional laboratory modules and course materials will be developed and disseminated broadly using the MITx/EdX online educational platform. \r\n\r\nThis research program will provide a fundamental understanding of unconventional current-induced torques and chiral spin textures that arise in ultrathin ferromagnetic heterostructures with broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling.  The program aims to (1) quantitatively and systematically characterize spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers to identify their dependence on interface materials and structure, (2) provide a mechanistic understanding of magnetization switching and magnetic domain wall motion in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, and (3) establish the materials design principles necessary to optimize these phenomena for spintronic devices. Experiments focus on transition metals and alloys that order well above room temperature, interfaced with nonmagnetic heavy metals and oxide dielectrics that are amenable to integration with conventional semiconductor fabrication processes.  The intellectual merits of these fundamental studies include important new insights into surface and interface magnetism, the quantum-mechanical effects of broken symmetries in nanoscale systems, and coupling between the charge and spin degrees of freedom.    The fundamental studies will lead to revolutionary new spin-based memory and logic device capabilities, offering enhanced performance and durability with ultralow power consumption requirements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:\n\nThe remarkable advances in computing and communications technologies in recent decades have been based on conventional electronics whose fundamental limits are rapidly being approached.  In order to meet the demands for future low-power, high-performance memory and logic devices, new physical mechanisms and advanced materials that exploit them are urgently required.  This project has provided new fundamental insights on phenomena occurring at interfaces between thin magnetic films and nonmagnetic materials comprised of heavy elements, where magnetism and electron transport behave in very different ways than in most materials.  The project has focused on understanding current-induced switching and spin-orbit torques, and the role of the interface material and structure on the switching efficiency.  The switching modes have direct applicability to new magnetic memory and logic in which electrical switching of the magnetization can provide new high performance memories and logic devices.  Specific scientific outcomes include an understanding of the role that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays in spin-orbit torque switching in heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, insight into the scaling of the critical switching current with the strength of this interaction, and characterization of the switching in a novel class of ferrimagnets in which neighboring atom spins are aligned antiparallel to one another.  These results provide new insights into developing materials for ultralow power switching in practical device applications.\n\n \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: \n\n \n\nThe fundamental research will enable future efforts to engineer ultralow power, high performance devices for information-technology hardware such as high density data storage and nonvolatile magnetic logic.  Educational impacts include training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in advanced materials growth, nanofabrication, and characterization, as well as measurement techniques to characterize magnetic and electrical properties of materials, which are critical to ensuring a technologically-proficient high-tech workforce.  The students have also learned written and oral scientific presentation and communication skills by drafting published articles and presenting their results at major scientific conferences.  The project has resulted in eight published papers in peer-reviewed journals, and 22 oral presentations at major scientific conferences.  Two undergraduate students have been trained in the course of this research, both female and one from an underrepresented group.  Outreach activities have included an in-class set of interactive demos performed by the PI, two graduate students, and two undergraduate students, at a local elementary school to introduce the students and teacher to concepts in magnetic materials and nanotechnology.
