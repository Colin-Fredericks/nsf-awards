 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Computer Science at Kean University is implementing \"Project ASK: Applying Student Knowledge (ASK) for Success in Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT),\" which is aimed at increasing the number of academically talented, financially needy students graduating with undergraduate degrees in CS and IT.   Project ASK supports a total of 40 transfer students and rising juniors who each receive two-year scholarships.\r\n\r\nASK Scholars participate in weekly workshops, cohort experiences, and interact closely with faculty members who provide academic and professional support through advising and mentoring.  They gain leadership experience from participating in professional student organizations and local and regional programming contests. The individual and cohort experiences offered to ASK Scholars provide a basis for intellectual growth and promote increased student confidence, retention, and timely degree completion.   Upon graduation, ASK Scholars are prepared to enter the scientific workforce or graduate school as competent, highly trained individuals who are skilled in teamwork and research, serve as role models to members of their communities and contribute to increased diversity in the fields of CS and IT.",
