 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pathway for Adult-learners, Community college and non-Traditional Students (PACTS) Scholarship program, at The George Washington University, is supporting bachelor's degree completion in STEM fields for cohorts of talented non-traditional students, community college graduates and adult learners This is a demographic for which the impact of having a structured program with mentoring and role modeling has been proven to be effective and, in some cases, a game-changer for students. In addition to their core quantitative coursework, the students learn principles of ethics, civic engagement, entrepreneurship, business, and regulatory affairs. All this, combined with a strong emphasis on verbal and written communication, is creating a cadre of STEM professionals who will contribute to the local and national workforce as leaders for years to come.\r\n\r\nAn essential aspect of this project is keeping the students focused on rewarding careers in the STEM fields, and helping them explore their options after graduation. With strong ties to the local technology sector and through industry partnerships, the program is taking the students to the workplace and bringing representatives from industry to seminars and workshops. These exposures increase the students' interest in their STEM courses by placing what they learn in a real-world context. Students are provided with guidance that prepares them for continuing their education at a graduate level.\r\n\r\nThe project is broadening the participation of non-traditional students in the field of information technology by providing the PACTS scholars with an array of opportunities to finish their degree, enter the workforce or continue their studies at the graduate level. By enhancing the education, mentoring, and employment opportunities, the program creates a STEM workforce that is more diverse and inclusive. In addition, the project addresses the need to increase the number of STEM graduates among non-traditional students who are comprised mostly of underrepresented populations in STEM fields: first generation college goers and financially needy students.  A small cohort model at George Washington University has demonstrated that a greater than 90%, on-time graduation rate can be achieved for STEM majors with community college backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation plan for this project includes both formative and sumative components to ensure the success of individual students and the overall achievement of program goals. Students receive continuous support and feedback throughout the program. Data is being collected and analyzed on the progress of each student, the effectiveness of program activities, graduate school admission statistics and job placement/advancement trends for the PACTS scholars, as well as the overall program performance.",
