 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The award to Harris Stowe State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines, including STEM Teacher Education. The institution seeks to provide students with the academic preparation, as well as analytical and technical competencies they will need to succeed in graduate school or STEM careers. \r\n\r\nThe project has three specific objectives that tie in to the overarching goal: 1) to increase the recruitment and enrollment of first-year and transfer STEM majors; 2) to increase the retention and graduation of STEM majors; and 3) to increase student engagement through faculty development opportunities. A set of evidence-based strategies and interventions has been designed to achieve these objectives. Through the evaluation plan the project will address the question: \"To what extent can academic and social integration interventions impact student retention, student success, student engagement and graduation in STEM disciplines, particularly at a small Historically Black University?\"",
