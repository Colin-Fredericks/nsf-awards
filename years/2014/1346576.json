 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Build-a-Genome course at Johns Hopkins University is an example of an approach to infuse authentic, interdisciplinary research experiences into the curriculum. The PI team members of this RCN-UBE network all have experience with the Build-a-Genome course and now plan to launch an undergraduate Build-a-Genome course at their own institutions and help other faculty to do the same by joining this new network. Build-a-Genome is an intensive laboratory course in which undergraduates participate in the Synthetic Yeast Project, a large-scale effort to construct the world's first synthetic eukaryotic genome. Along the way, students gain a comprehensive introduction to synthetic biology, learn basic molecular biology techniques and make important contributions to a cutting-edge research project.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This RCN-UBE network plans to organize a national workshop at Loyola University in Maryland to introduce participants to the Build-a-Genome course, teach gene synthesis methods, and bring together individuals to develop plans for implementing similar courses at their home institutions.  The network leaders will then host a series of smaller regional Build-a-Genome/gene synthesis workshops at North Carolina A&T State University and Hartwick College, targeting faculty from regional colleges to promote synthetic biology, to make connections among local institutions, and to disseminate materials developed at the national workshop.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed network includes faculty from a range of institutional types (large research university, comprehensive university, and liberal arts college) and includes an HBCU and will expand to include a similar diversity of institutions.  Build-a-Genome provides a truly unique, hands-on learning experience for undergraduates. Students take ownership of their projects, make important contributions to an ongoing research effort,and learn gene synthesis and molecular biology techniques while being introduced to the interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action  http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/",
