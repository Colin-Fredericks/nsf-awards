 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex hydroponic and contained water systems such as fish aquariums, swimming pools, and spas must monitor water chemistry on a daily basis.  Currently there are more than 4,800 commercial hydroponic farms, 767,500 in-home hydroponic gardens, 12.6 million fish aquariums, 10 million swim pools, and 21,000 spas in the U.S.  The water condition monitoring market is currently projected to be around $200 million, with steady growth rate.  Demand for hydroponic farm products has been increasing as customers adopt more healthy eating patterns. In addition, bad weather conditions are shifting food growers from field crops to hydroponic farms.  On hydroponic farms, water monitoring systems are critical for ensuring plant growth and crop yield. The proposed technology will make hydroponics crop growing cheaper and potentially ameliorate food shortage issues.   As an extension, this technology can also be applied to metal-solution based water condition sensing technology for pollutant, nuclear waste, and toxin detection.\r\n\r\nRegular water monitoring is a cumbersome and costly process, but without it, deviations in water chemistry can result in damage to plants and fish as well as financial losses.  This team has developed a smart-phone based, low cost, water condition sensor.  This product will measure, record, notify and guide decision making for maintaining healthy water systems and optimize growth of hydroponic plants and crops.  The novelty of this technology lies in being able to measure the pH, electric conductivity (EC/nutrient concentration), temperature, and water level using only a single electrode.  Compared to today's more common multi-sensor water condition monitoring systems, using a single sensor will significantly reduce cost and complexity of operation.  This single sensor senses changes in the electro-chemical interaction (e.g. voltage and capacitance) between two different metals as a result of changes in characteristics of the water conditions.",
