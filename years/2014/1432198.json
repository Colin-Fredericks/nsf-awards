 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Siena Plan for Attracting and Retaining Computer Scientists (SPARCS) is addressing the goal of producing one million additional college graduates with STEM degrees over the next decade, established in the February 2012 report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).  SPARCS builds on the success of the NSF S-STEM Tech Valley Scholars program and focuses on recruiting and retaining computing majors in high school and the first two years of college.  The program includes a high school dual enrollment program that introduces computer science education to Capital District high schools that are currently not offering it.  The program improves computing recruitment by offering high school students an opportunity to gain exposure to computing so they might better assess their interest in computing as a college major.  The result is a larger and more qualified computing workforce in New York State's Capital Region.\r\n\r\nSPARCS recruits and nurtures new computing majors through graduation, with an emphasis on recruiting and retention in high school and the first two years of college. High school recruiting focuses on using partnerships to institute an introductory computing course at schools that do not have computing courses. College level recruiting focuses on undeclared students in each of Siena's three schools (Science, Business, and Liberal Arts). Recruitment also extends to students struggling in their current major who have demonstrated strong academic potential for computing and may not have been afforded the opportunity to explore computing. Retention efforts concentrate on expanding undergraduate internships, incorporating teaching assistantships, and engaging students in other activities designed to foster a sense of community.\r\n\r\nThe project is being assessed and evaluated by an external consultant who has identified the following outcomes as a measure of the effectiveness of the program:  the effectiveness of campaigns to recruit computing students into Siena, the impact of the SPARCS program on students staying in computing at Siena, the quality of student performance in courses and research projects, the number of students from underrepresented groups, and the number of students entering graduate school or the professional workforce after graduation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nSiena Plan for Attracting and Retaining Computer Scientists (SPARCS) was designed to recruit and nurture new CS majors through graduation, with emphasis on recruiting and retention in high school and the first two years of college.  The program consisted of four major initiatives:\n 1. High School Dual Enrollment Program to introduce computer science education to Capital District high schools currently not offering it.  This program includes working closely with these schools and cooperating math/technology teachers to start an introductory CS course at their school for which the students can earn Siena College CS credits.  \n\n \n\n\nSince the grant period began, we have had 460 high school students from 16 high schools take our Introduction to Computer Science course. Analysis of surveys found four items with statistically significant increases: 1) I am a sophisticated computer user, 2) I am able to solve basic problems through computer programming, 3) I can explain what computer science is to my friends, and 4) I have a basic understanding of the discipline of computer science.  These findings support our goal of exposing high school students to a discipline that has not been frequently offered in New York K-12 schools since there was no Computer Science teacher certification in New York State at the start of this program.  Additionally, this initiative created the foundation for a CSforAll grant (award #1923378), which has allowed us to extend this program to 13 additional high schools.   \n\n\n  \n\n2. One-week Summer CS Outreach Program for rising sophomores and new freshmen (targeting non-computer science majors) to introduce them to the nature of Computer Science, providing seminars on career/internship/research options in the computing field, and exposing students to CS curricular and research opportunities.  \n\n\n\nWe completed 5 years of the program, with 98 students participating and 100% completion rate for all years. About 82% of the participants took at least one additional CS course. Additionally, ~18% of the participants declared a major in CS and ~29% declared a minor in CS or IS after their participation in the program. Post-program surveys indicated the students had a very positive educational experience, they appreciated the breadth of topics offered, they liked the faculty, and they found the panels very worthwhile. About 36% of the participants, at the end of the program, ?agree? or ?strongly agree? that they were considering majoring in CS.  In addition, just over half (51%) were considering a minor.  Nearly all participants found the program interesting and would recommend it to others, thought it encouraged critical thinking, and increased their interest in CS.    \n \n\n\n \n3. Summer early college career internship experience program for rising sophomores who have completed the first year CS sequence. \n\n\n \n\n\nThis program has successfully recruited and retained CS majors.  Eleven of the 28 students who completed the internship were not CS majors when they participated in the program.  Nine of these eleven became CS majors afterwards.  While women make up only ~20% of our CS majors, ~36% of the interns have been female.  Focus group data analysis revealed that students' confidence increased when they completed a project and received positive feedback.  From the evaluator's assessment: \"Some of the internships required students to program in languages in which they had no experience.  They stated that this made their experience challenging, but that they appreciated the opportunity to build on their existing knowledge of programming languages.  Students also appreciated the fact that they got to experience what it feels like to have a job in the computer science field.\" \n\n\n \n\n4. Student assistantship experience offered sophomores who completed the first year CS sequence the opportunity to work as classroom/lab assistants as part of the high school Introduction to CS course, the Siena introduction to programming course, and/or Siena's introduction to CS course. \n\n\n \n\n\nSixty-four undergraduate students who completed the first year CS sequence were given the opportunity to work as classroom/lab assistants. These students provided assistance to fellow undergraduate students and/or high school students during lectures and labs. This afforded the assistants the opportunity to gain valuable teaching and mentoring skills. The students enrolled in these courses reported that they appreciated the guidance of the student assistants. While women make up only ~20% of our CS majors, ~45% of the classroom assistants have been female.  Focus group data analysis found that lab/classroom assistants:\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\nImproved their CS/Programming knowledge and confidence  \nIncreased interest in education careers \nValued the opportunity to get to know other students within the department \nIncreased their appreciation of CS \nFelt the experience helped them with their current courses \n \n\n\n  \n \n\n\nThe focus group data show that our objective to improve the skills and confidence of the students participating in the assistantship program was achieved.   The assistants also reported that they felt some students in the class were more comfortable asking them questions versus the professor, thus increasing class participation.  \n \n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meg Fryling"
