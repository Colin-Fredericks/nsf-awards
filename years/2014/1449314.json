 "awd_abstract_narration": "To have the best possible performance in a given application, nanoparticles must be manufactured with uniform size and precise shape, structure and composition.  This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) award supports an innovative approach to attaining such uniformity in the manufacturing of a new class of energy conversion phosphor nanoparticles. This approach, termed \"nanoprint by templated exfoliateable deposition\" (n-PrinTED), is fundamentally different from traditional chemical synthesis.  The new method uses a template and potentially enables the production of a broad range of nanoparticle types applicable to a wide range of fields and industries, including bio/chemical sensing, solid state lighting, displays, batteries, and fuel cells. The success of the research will benefit U.S. competitiveness and leadership in nanotechnology and aid U.S industry, leading to significant economic impact.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the key challenges in nanoparticle fabrication, this new method, n-PrinTED, fabricates nanoparticles (NPs) by using a template to restrict material deposition/reaction, which regulates the materials' (hence the final NP's) shape and location, rather than a \"free-form\" reaction; and n-PrinTED also opens up a broad range of new possibilities in deposition methods, materials choices, and processing/reaction conditions and sequences. Therefore, n-PrinTED offers many new ways to fabricate NPs with unique shapes, structures, and compositions (hence properties) that are unachievable by current methods.  n-PrinTED can thus be used for a broad range of new nanoparticles. The project will focus on the application of n-PrinTED in new NPs for efficient up/down conversion of energy and will take an approach that integrates a broad range of disciplines and knowledge.",
