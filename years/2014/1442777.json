 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ambient exposure to ground-level air pollution is linked to adverse health effects in many populated areas of the world. However, advances in relating air pollution exposure to sustainable communities are hindered by limited direct observations of exposure and the coarseness of regional and global air quality models used for decision making. As a result, existing models do not resolve the scales of variability in either pollutant concentrations or population distributions necessary to accurately assess exposure nor provide the type of probabilistic uncertainty bounds required for policy.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to assimilate comprehensive cyber information for use in air quality management. It advances the interdisciplinary field of cyber-environmental research through investigation into (1) cyber-scale data analysis to harness and distill valuable cyber information to support community-scale air pollution modeling; (2) micro-environment targeted sensing to augment community-scale studies with accurate, on-demand, and in situ sensing capabilities; and (3) scalable exposure modeling and analysis by solving a complex, spatiotemporally varying problem with high-dimensional data containing cyber, sensing, and model outputs.\r\n\r\nAdvances in cyber-environmental research have the potential to improve government policy making, regulations, and personal choices with regard to environmentally sustainable community development. Results of this project can apply across a wide spectrum of sectors including energy, transportation, and healthcare. This project broadens vertical research and education integration across information technologies and environmental science and engineering, to both graduate and undergraduate students. Through in-field trials, this project offers unique real-world education and research opportunities to attract students from underrepresented groups and industrial professionals.",

The project team has investigated several ideas to enable more accurate estimation and prediction of pollutant concentrations at finer spatial and temporal granularities than previously possible. The work has taken two main paths: developing new, fine-grained pollution sensing methods and developing methods to intelligently integrate data from disparate sources.<br /><br />The project has developed new methods of determining airborne pollution concentrations at high spatial resolution. The key idea is to use detailed physical models of the effects of pollutants on light scattering and absorption. Using normal photographs, it is possible to determine the types and concentrations of pollutants by observing their influence on visible haze. This makes it possible to produce spatially fine-grained pollution maps from single images, instead of producing a single pollution estimate per image as was the case for prior work. By accounting for wavelength-dependent scattering and absorption properties of specific pollutants (e.g., compared to black carbon particles, important ozone precursors preferentially scatter blue light), concentrations can be determined even when multiple pollutants are present, for the first time. Combined, these approaches also improve pollution estimation accuracy by 22% compared with the best prior work.<br /><br />The project team has also developed tools and techniques to collect, process, and analyze data from online resources and in-field studies, as well as fine-grained chemical transport model simulations. It studied correlations among surface ozone concentrations and other relevant features to develop a new prediction model. This model uses Long Short-Term Memory to train and predict dynamic traffic and meteorological features, which are combined with static local environmental features and fed through a Support Vector Machine based regression model to predict community-level ozone concentration in the next three days. The approach uses multi-source data, especially high-frequency grid-based weather data, to model air pollutant dynamics. Convolution operators on grid weather data capture the impacts of various weather parameters on air pollutant variations. Cross-domain features are automatically grouped based on their correlations. Finally, a multi-group Encoder-Decoder networks is used to fuse multiple feature groups, enabling 9%-16% improvement in pollution prediction accuracy relative to the best existing work.<br /><br />The project has broadened and advanced vertical research and education integration across information technologies and environmental science and engineering. Key research results have been published at relevant scientific venues and integrated into the courses taught by the PIs. Through the Air Quality Inquiry Program, students have been trained to use air quality sensors to answer questions of personal interest. The students then take the training and the sensors to rural schools in Colorado to work with environmental science high school classes.
