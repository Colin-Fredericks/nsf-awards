 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Montfort is studying the similarities and differences between how engineers and engineering students categorize what they know.  Existing research in the fields of conceptual change and personal epistemology show that learning and the application of what is learned both depend on the ways in which the new knowledge is organized.  This work utilizes the construct of domains as a means to investigate the organizations of participants' knowledge at a meaningful grain size.  In this investigation practicing engineers are asked to describe the domains of knowledge applied to real multi-disciplinary projects they have been engaged in.  Students are also interviewed about the domains of knowledge involved in these projects.  Thematic analysis based on an interactional approach to personal epistemology provides a means to compare the domains of knowing between the engineers and students.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has not been firmly established yet, existing research suggests that students' domains of knowing do more to interfere with the application of their knowledge than to facilitate it.  In other words, the way students organize what they know may be interfering with how able they are to apply it.  Where an experienced engineer might see a cohesive domain of knowledge -- such as \"process engineering\" for example  -- engineering students may instead see an arbitrary grouping of otherwise dissimilar skills and ideas.  Previous research emphasizes how students struggle to learn the concepts of engineering, and treats the application of that knowledge as a separate (if closely related) problem.  This work develops a potentially transformative new way of looking at it by focusing on the organization processes that control both how something is learned and how it is applied.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn an effort to improve the way we educate engineers, this project studied engineering knowledge itself. We studied how knowledge is a social process &ndash; something that happens between people, rather than something that just exists.  Drawing from a broad range of academic disciplines including philosophy, cognitive science, psychology and human development, we studied what we call \"knowledge in practice.\"  We observed engineers at work.  We focused our investigation on how engineers and students organized the boundaries of their knowledge.  Studying these boundaries is helpful because it can be a way to study different types of knowledge (like how it\u2019s easy to step between states once you locate the precise border).  We studied engineers working on complex interdisciplinary problems so that we would be sure to observe a lot of knowledge boundaries.  We also interviewed those engineers about their work on the project, and asked them to help us explain the boundaries of their knowledge.  For each participant, we tried to figure out how they understood their specific expertise, and how it related to the other engineers\u2019 areas.  The interviews were designed to work with the participants to produce data that we could analyze to answer our research questions about the participants\u2019 knowledge boundaries. We found that the engineers experience the boundaries of their knowledge in an interpersonal way, defining them in terms of interdisciplinary collaborations. We also designed these interviews so that we could reproduce portions of them with engineering students. In contrast with the engineers, students\u2019 viewed their knowledge boundaries as fixed and standardized disciplines (e.g. chemistry or biology).
