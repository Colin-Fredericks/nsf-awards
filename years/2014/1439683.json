 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Phase III renewal for the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) site to continue as a partner institution of I/UCRC for e-Design. UMass Amherst is one of the two founding institutions of the Center for e-Design. The mission and vision of the existing NSF Center for e-Design is to research and develop methods and tools that support the realization of a new design paradigm that can be used to design, develop, and manufacture new engineered products and systems. Research at the Center for e-Design is oriented to application areas where large scale, complex projects are being developed, often involving multiple collaborators at various locations. Application areas include transportation, manufacturing, information technology, and health and safety. Research is categorized into five thrust areas - New Design Paradigms and Processes, Visualization and Virtual Prototyping, Enabling Information Infrastructure, Design Optimization, and Design Education. Research projects address a diverse range of engineering challenges faced by high-tech companies and agencies competing in a global economy. UMass Amherst has a number of faculty and student researchers working in areas that directly support the research thrust areas of the center. The renewal will enable UMass Amherst to continue its research in the advancement of new methods and tools in conceptual design and product innovation, advanced engineering modeling and simulation, digital manufacturing, and medical devices design. UMass ongoing research projects involve projects dealing with integration and application of e-Design methods and tools into commercial design processes, as well as fundamental research projects on sustainability product design and engineering design innovation.\r\n\r\nThe Center renewal will enable UMass Amherst to contribute significantly to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students. Results from research effort will continue to be integrated into the educational curriculum to enrich the student learning experiences in conceptual design and product innovation, advanced engineering modeling and simulation, and digital manufacturing. Students associated with the Center will receive exceptional career development opportunities that include laboratory and field studies, participation at conferences and workshops, design colloquium series, and journal publications, as well as training in the ethical conduct of research. The PI and other UMass Amherst faculty will continue recruiting underrepresented students, including partnering with a number of university programs aimed at providing research opportunities for these students. Research and educational findings will be disseminated nationally and have significant broader impact through industrial collaboration and technology transfer. The industry partners will continue to benefit from first access to research, royalty-free use of the tools, and the opportunity to license and commercialize technologies. Research and educational findings will continue to be disseminated nationally and have a significant impact on U.S. industry as a whole.",

A project completed recently with FTL Labs introduced and published a new AI-based technique to detect and prevent product defects.\n\nAn earlier project related to additive manufacturing with Raytheon Company led to new and usable information about causal connections between controllable and factors and resulting properties of interest by means of an experiment conducted with Vero material on a Connex 350 machine.  Such information shared with the industry partner can help to inform design processes about additive manufacturing capabilities and limitations and provide the basis for further experimentation.  Research on ASTM standard test methods generated equipment specifications needed by an industry partner to search for equipment to test additional material properties of interest. A new decision support engineering design process and software tool was introduced and copyrighted to help designers decide correctly at early stages when additive manufacturing should be used. That method published in Journal of Engineering Design.\n\nAn earlier project with NIST provided predictive metamodeling methods to facilitate estimation of results in advance when producing metal parts by powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes.  Another earlier project with FTL Labs supported that industry partner?s development of new software.  The software alerts CAD operators to potential manufacturability problems with visual warnings in the virtual model in advance of production of the metal part by direct energy deposition additive manufacturing processes.  Another recently completed project with FTL Labs developed techniques to improve the fit of prosthetics to human tissue structures.\n\nA project done during this period with Artaic, a producer of custom mosaics, addressed situations of a mixed model of products that require innovative ways to manage inventory that optimize costs and do not impact product delivery times.

One such project addressed a need to develop novel prototype devices and systems that provide haptic feedback to a patient during rehabilitation exercises.  The haptic feedback introduced dynamic forces and motion that a patient can feel and sense for improved cognition rather than merely visual clues that are virtually rendered.  Such a development can be implemented broadly to a diversity of scenarios such as when stroke rehabilitation is necessary.  A recent project with Hill-Rom developed more accurate sensing devices for cases such as bed sores where a greater sensitivity than conventional is required.\n\nLeaders of the UMass Amherst site also established a successful track-record of active collaboration with industry partners and university researchers at sister sites to complement and further enable intellectual contributions in advancing the engineering design field with a particular attention to their broader impacts to industries and engineering discipline.
