 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will evaluate processes responsible for the non-steady-state growth of continental crust in Cordilleran-type magmatic arcs. These batholiths develop as a result of subduction of oceanic lithosphere at convergent margins, but the processes that control the tempo of magma production are unclear; even in arcs where subduction is continuous, magmatism is strongly episodic (e.g. Sierra Nevada batholith, Peninsular Ranges batholith, Central Andes). Short periods (10-15 million years) of intense magmatism or 'flare-ups' may generate as much as 90% of total batholithic volumes, with little magmatism occurring during intervening lulls. Geochemical and isotopic signatures indicate that magmas produced during flare-ups incorporate more upper plate material than magmas formed during lulls. This pattern raises the question of whether continental growth by magmatic addition is controlled primarily by the behavior of the subducting oceanic plate or by the tectonics of the continental lithosphere at the plate margin.  We are investigating this question through an integrated geologic, geochronological and geochemical study of the southern Coast Mountains Batholith in British Columbia. This project directly addresses a basic question in earth science: how do continents grow? In addition to the research goals of this project, this endeavor is enhancing the scientific education and training of students at four academic institutions recognized for the diversity of their student populations.  Engagement of students in fieldwork, laboratory analysis, data interpretation and presentation of results are providing them with insights into all aspects of the science process and career options, and increase retention in STEM fields.  Samples and datasets generated as a result of this project are being used to design problem sets and interpretive exercises for classes taught by the investigators.  Data generated during this the course of this project is being added to NSF-funded databases, such as NAVDAT, for access by the larger community.",

Instead, these igneous rocks form episodically during relatively brief periods of intense activity. These periods of high magma flux are recorded in aggregates of Mesozoic plutons or batholiths which formed above subduction zones.

This was necessary in order to determine if high temperature metamorphism resulted in partial melting of pre-existing continental rocks to directly produce the plutons or trigger melting in other rocks deep in the mountain belt. Metamorphic rocks were sampled on a roughly east-west transect across the batholith. The timing of metamorphism was determined from the Sm and Nd isotopic composition of garnet and adjacent minerals. These ages for metamorphism were then compared to U and Pb zircon ages for plutons determined by collaborators at the University of Arizona and California State University at Northridge. The pluton ages indicate that there were high magma flux events at approximately 161 to 148, 114 to 102, 85 to 70, and 61 to 48 million years before present (m.y.). Metamorphic pressures and temperatures were estimated from the mineral compositions and P-T phase diagram models. The research on metamorphism, completed by University of Alabama Ph.D. student Elizabeth Bollen, determined that the earliest metamorphism was (99 to 90 m.y.) after the second high magma flux event, was discontinuous, and that final metamorphism (82 to 64 m.y.) began during the third and ended prior to the last high magma flux event. Our estimates for pressure and temperature indicate mid-crustal metamorphism at temperatures below those required for partial melting.
