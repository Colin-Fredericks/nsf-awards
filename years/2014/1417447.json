 "awd_abstract_narration": "Karst aquifers are an important groundwater resource, but they are vulnerable to contamination because of fast and complex flow paths arising from subsurface caves and large fractures. The complexity of karst aquifers has for a long time imposed challenges for researchers to characterize the groundwater flow system. This project will develop a new classification method for karst springs that will guide monitoring and pollution prevention strategies.  Based on water chemistry variability in response to storms, this classification will identify different sources of water and improve water capture area delineation.  The new classification system will be tested by revisiting a well-known set of karst springs that show variations in flow paths. Educational opportunities for students and for the general public are incorporated into the project.  \r\n\r\nClassification will be based on the shape of hysteresis plots and changes in hysteresis plots from storm to storm.  Storm hysteresis, defined as the difference in chemical trends at the beginning versus the end of a storm, offers opportunities to identify changes over time in water movement and storage in karst networks. The project will test two hypotheses.  (1) During a storm, hysteresis occurs as the water flows through the matrix and conduits, and (2) from storm to storm, the hysteresis pattern changes as the water capture area and storage zones change.  For example, Mg:Ca ratios in spring water increase with diffusive recharge but  decrease with more focused recharge through conduits, and hysteresis plots can show the timing of each type of recharge.  Automatic samplers and data loggers will be used during storms to provide data for hysteresis plots.  In addition to Mg:Ca ratios, Sr:Ca ratios, rare earth elements, stable isotopes, and carbonate equilibria will be examined and potential flow paths will be evaluated using groundwater models.  The combination of multiple natural tracers, modeling, and capture area calculations will help quantify behavior of karst springs and karst aquifers.  Ultimately, the new classification system will improve understanding of contaminant transport in karst systems.",

Faced with the complexity of karst aquifers, it may be tempting to say nothing is predictable. This research offers new characterization techniques to help guide monitoring and pollution prevention strategies.  The approaches were tested by revisiting a well-known set of karst springs characterized by Shuster and White (1971).  The results of this project highlight variable flow paths and recharge patterns in these springs and are applicable to additional karst spring locations. \n\n Intellectual Merit: \n\nThis project developed new classification techniques for karst aquifers using stormwater response to show how the timing of different source waters impacts flow paths.  The monitoring techniques included automatic stormwater samplers, dye tracing, and data loggers that can monitor water quality continuously.  Analytical techniques measured chemical parameters such as major ions, CO2, Mg/Ca ratios, and stable water isotopes, along with Ca/Zr ratios and rare earth elements (REEs) which have had limited testing in karst systems.  High resolution temperature data showed variations in storm responses (not observed with historic data) among springs. Variations in CO2 concentrations and Mg/Ca ratios provided indicators of fast and slow recharge and changes in flow paths.
