 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, the emerging new field of metagenomics facilitated by the advent of next-generation sequencing technology enables genome sequencing of unculturable and often unknown microbes in natural environments, offering researchers an unprecedented opportunity to delineate bio-diversity of any microbial organism. Mining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from metagenomic sequencing data offers an unique opportunity to rapidly and accurately detect known or novel strains related to multiple biothreat agents. While the sequencing technologies are evolving at unprecedented speed, researchers engaged in this enterprise are facing major computational, algorithmic and statistical challenges in the analysis of the massive metagenomic data. It is clear that both current analytical and computational methods are inadequate for this challenge. In this project, the investigator and his colleagues develop a family of statistically sound and computationally efficient algorithms to detect SNPs from metagenomic data to characterize microbial diversity in natural environments. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project provides the national security and biodefense agencies new tools for rapid and accurate detection of biothreat agents. It also provides researchers in microbiology with new tools for producing abundant, high throughput SNPs for detailed analysis of the genetic basis of microbial diversity and evolution. Since this informatics tool can be used to study a wide variety of microbial communities, it helps accelerating scientific advancements of our knowledge in microbiology and evolution. The multidisciplinary nature of the project will promote collaboration between biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The multidisciplinary nature of the project will also provide postdoctoral fellows and graduate students training in statistics, genomics and scientific computing through hands-on experience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the microbial ecosystems play a crucial role in human health. We proposed a reference-free metagenomic binning method, MetaGen, which not only identifies bacteria species but also quantifies their distributions. With the growing number of the metagenomic samples being sequenced, we believe that our effort can benefit both the computational biologist and the experimental biologist in studying the changes of the microbial ecosystems, detecting pathogens and reducing the diagnostic error in microbial-related human diseases.\n\n2. Similar to identifying homologous regions in metagenomic sequence data, our work reveals that (i) the non-translational mp29 and translatable p29RNAs are recalcitrant to be processed into siRNAs by VIGS; (ii) the mp29 (p29) RNA can enhance replication and accumulation of recombinant viral RNA in VIGS-active plants where the increased levels of viral RNA are subsequently targeted by VIGS, resulting in an increased number of vsiRNAs; (iii) the mp29 (p29) RNA is able to act in cis and in trans to protect viral GFP714 and transgene GFP792 mRNA from being processed into siRNA by VIGS; and (iv) the predominant biogenesis of 21 and 22nt vsiRNAs as well as results from the VIGS in DCL4 or DCL2 RNAi lines are consistent with the well-established role of DCL4 andDCL2 in antiviral silencing1.2; and (v) the non-translational mp29 or translatable p29 RNA may interfere with DCL4 to facilitate viral survival of VIGS. An RNA element-directed enhancement of viral RNA replication may represent a passive but useful counter-defence strategy by out-competing antiviral VIGS. Our finding also implies the existence of a novel RNA-mediated mechanism to facilitate cellular mRNA and pathogenic RNA escaping from degradation by RNA silencing.\n\n3. Inspired by the metagenomic sequence data, our extensive simulation studies statistically demonstrate the numerical advantages of penalized function-on-function regression method over the existing ones. Our method has the following distinguishing features: (i) it makes no structural dependence assumptions of &beta;(t,s) over the predictor and response processes; (ii) the Representer Theorem guarantees an exact solution instead of an approximation to the optimization of the penalized score; (iii) benefited from the Representer Theorem, we develop a numerically reliable algorithm that has sound performance in simulations; (iv) we show theoretically the estimator achieves the optimal minimax convergence rate in mean prediction.\n\n4. An extension of our major work, we presented an efficient online sampling method, the sequential leveraging sampling, for streaming time series data. The sequential leveraging sampling takes one block of consecutive time points as a subsample/snapshot of the streaming data, which maintains the dependence structure of the subsampled data. The sampling algorithm consists of choices of starting time and stopping time. The starting time of the subsample is decided according to leverage scores of the streaming data, which can capture the influential time points of the data stream. The stopping time is chosen according to the sequential sampling rule, which provides the theoretical guarantee of estimate properties of the time series model base on the sequential leveraging sample.

The leverage-based method also has the potential to be incorporated into the analysis of complex data including nonparametric regression or matrix approximation problems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ping Ma"
