 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of data centers, large spaces filled with interconnected computers, have allowed for the rapid, flexible and efficient provisioning of the Internet services on which society depends.   However, data centers are power hungry.   Collaborative experimental research at the intersection of sophisticated computing infrastructure and data-intensive applications shows promise in increasing the flexibility and power efficiency of data centers.  The rapid emergence of new technologies such as Software Defined Networks are enablers of new strategies for placement of computing tasks within a cluster, taking into account factors such as load and power efficency.  \r\n\r\nThis computing research infrastructure project provisions computer and software-defined networking (SDN) equipment, metered rack power distribution units, software, and toolkits to establish a programmable, multi-purpose, network and power-aware cluster systems test bed at Clemson University.  The infrastructure fills a gap of resources, and supports fundamental and applied research on experimental networking and scalable data-intensive computing system in areas of programmable networks to support data-intensive computing, application and data placement strategies for data-intensive applications, evaluation of software infrastructures to support data-intensive applications, and performance and power measurement, modeling, and analysis. The project provides advanced infrastructure to at least 300 graduate and undergraduate students at Clemson University.  The system provides an environment for supporting projects in the highly successful Clemson Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site program in Data-Intensive Computing, which has recruited students from more than 20 states including Puerto Rico. The system also supports collaboration with industrial partners and is an enabling factor in a collaborative relationship between Clemson University and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.",
