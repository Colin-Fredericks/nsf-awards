 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of faculty and administrators at St. Edwards University is increasing the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn baccalaureate degrees in the bioinformatics, environmental and forensic chemistry, computer science, and mathematics. The Rewarding Achievement in Mathematics and Science (RAMS) project is providing 14 scholarships to students who are being retained as STEM majors through participating in a close-knit community of learners. This student cohort is developing academically and socially through an array of support mechanisms, including: (a) a first year seminar, (b) supplemental instruction and peer-led team learning, (c) a science living and learning community, (d) the Science Speakers Series, (e) summer research, and (f) internships with local industrial partners. The PI team is recruiting from a diverse pool of students in which 35% of their STEM majors are Hispanic.\r\n\r\nThis project is generating a broad impact in two ways.  First, data generated through assessment and evaluation is supporting the rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields can be achieved through a comprehensive program of student development that emphasizes community-building. Formative and summative evaluation is focusing on assessment of the project's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate students. Secondly, dissemination of the project results is providing a model for retaining students in the STEM fields by integrating them into a close-knit community of learners.  The project team is presenting their work throughout their many regional and national consortia including the New American Colleges and Universities, the Texas Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and the Catholic Colleges and Universities of Texas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe S-STEM grant awarded (#1356496) to St. Edward's University in 2014 plus the supplement grant approved in 2015 has allowed us to award scholarships to 42 students between Fall 2014 and Spring 2021, several more than the 14 scholarships originally planned.  All but seven of these 42 students have completed a STEM degree including one student who transferred and completed a STEM degree elsewhere.  Two other students lack only transfer course credit to complete their STEM degrees.  At least 18 of the STEM graduates have continued on for further study or are professionally employed. This figure does not include the 12 recipients who just completed their degrees for whom follow-up data is not yet available.\n\nOf these 42 scholars, 26 were women, 20 of whom have completed a STEM degree.  Two others lack only course transfer credit.  Twenty of the scholars described themselves as Hispanic or Latino.  Fifteen of them completed their STEM degree.  Two others will complete their degree when course transfer credit is awarded.\n\nThe S-STEM grant worked in conjunction with a prior STEP award (#969153) and a concurrent IUSE award (#1525490) to facilitate increased STEM enrollments (995 in Fall 2020 vs 980 in Fall 2014, peaking at 1205 in Fall 2017), STEM retention (over 60% first year to second year), and STEM graduates (from 168 in academic year 2014-15 to 276 in academic year 2019-20).\n\nProgramming constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic required major changes in instructional delivery, student programming, and cohort development strategies.  However, due to grant support, the impact on STEM goals were noticeably mitigated, reflected in the second highest first-to-second year STEM retention of 67.3% - the second best retention percentage over the 2014-2020 span and continued student participation in summer research in Summer 2020 and 2021, despite the use of remote research projects in summer 2020 and social distancing constraints imposed in summer 2021 research.\n\nResidual funds were used to provide 11 one-time awards to seniors in the final grant year to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  All of these students had substantial unmet need, which were partially mitigated by these one-time awards.  All but one of these 11 students have completed their STEM degree.
