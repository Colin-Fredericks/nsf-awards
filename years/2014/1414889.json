 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tissues containing cellular tubes are vital components of the human body, found in our airways and blood vessels. Proper response of these tissues to stretch is essential to health, and diseases like asthma result from unregulated contraction. Tissues can respond to stretch and regulate contraction by altering calcium levels inside cells. The spermatheca of the microscopic worm C. elegans provides an excellent model for cellular response to stretch, calcium signaling, and regulation of contraction in a tubular tissue. Many genes acting in the spermatheca are similar to the ones in human cellular tubes, and fluorescent sensors allow study of the tissue in a living, intact animal. This project will advance our understanding of how cellular tubes respond to stretch by examining the role of a recently discovered protein, SPV-1, in the regulation of calcium signaling and cellular contraction. This work will be conducted at the National University of Singapore in collaboration with Dr. Ronen Zaidel-Bar, an expert in cell response to mechanical stimuli and co-discoverer of SPV-1.\r\n    \r\nSPV-1 contains an F-BAR domain that senses membrane curvature, a RhoGAP domain that regulates a GTPase known to affect actomyosin contractility in the tissue, and a domain which binds DAG, a lipid signaling molecule generated by a phospholipase required for proper tissue function. These domains suggest SPV-1 can sense tissue stretch and interact with cellular regulatory and contractile networks, and preliminary evidence supports this. This work will image the calcium sensor GCaMP and fluorescently labeled SPV-1 to investigate how SPV-1 localization affects calcium signaling. Understanding SPV-1's role in this tissue will advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of cellular stretch response, and could open new avenues for therapeutic drug targets and tissue engineering. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nI spent most of my lab time in Singapore on a microscope recording events in tiny worms that you can just barely see with the naked eye.  I had previously genetically engineered these C. elegans worms to contain a green fluorescent protein that gets brighter when it binds calcium.  Using a camera attached to a fluorescent microscope, I recorded the activity of this calcium sensor in the cells of a single tissue in the worm, and I applied image processing tools to the movies to generate data on how the calcium levels change during events.  I used these methodologies to study how a newly found protein alters calcium signaling in a particular tissue of the worm.    \n\n \n\nSo why should you care, why was this work worthy of being funded by the American taxpayer via the National Science Foundation?  Because tissues containing cells arranged in tubes are vital components of the human body, found in such places as our airways, blood vessels, kidneys, and digestive tract.  Proper response of these tubes to stretch and the ability to contract with the right timing and intensity is essential to health.  Diseases such as asthma are connected to improper regulation of contraction in these tissues.  Calcium signaling plays an important role in the cellular response to stretch and the regulation of cellular contraction.  The tissue that we study in the C. elegans reproductive system, the spermatheca, provides an excellent model for studying cellular response to stretch, calcium signaling, and the regulation of contraction in a tubular tissue.  Many of the genes, proteins, and molecules that act in the spermatheca are similar or identical to the ones that act in our cellular tubes, and we can study processes in this tissue in ways that would be impossible in humans.  This NSF EAPSI project advanced our understanding of how cells in tubes respond to stretch by studying the role of a recently discovered protein, SPV-1, in the regulation of calcium signaling and cellular contraction.  A deeper understanding of SPV-1\u00c6s activity will contribute to our understanding of the regulation of the spermatheca.  Continuing work in this model tissue will advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of cellular response to stretch, and could open new avenues for therapeutic drug targets and contribute to the advance of tissue engineering.\n\n \n\nResults from the project include data showing that calcium signaling occurs faster in the spermatheca of worms that don\u00c6t have SPV-1.  To further our understanding of what SPV-1 is doing, I examined calcium signaling when SPV-1 was lost in combination with other proteins already known to alter calcium signaling.  In one case the loss of SPV-1 further altered calcium signaling, and in one case it did not.  Our lab here at home continues to collaborate with the lab I worked at in Singapore, and both groups are currently generating more data on aspects of SPV-1\u00c6s role in calcium signaling and cellular contraction in the spermatheca.  The findings from this project and the continuing work on it will be featured in my Ph. D. thesis work.    \n\n \n\nThis project advanced my technical skills by giving me training and experience on a type of microscope that I had never used before.  I grew as a researcher through managing the project and making sure I used my limited time effectively to generate as much data as I could, sometimes in the face of setbacks and difficulties.  I further grew as a scientist by attending seminars at the Mechanobiology Institute, and interacting with scientists and researchers from different cultures.  Finally, traveling halfway around the world and living and working there for two months was quite an experience for a young man whose only previous foreign excursions had consisted of driving a few hours into Canada.    \n\n \n\nIt was a great honor to be sent to the other side of the world to contribute to the advancement of the scientific and technological progress of my country.  Thank You. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLa..."
