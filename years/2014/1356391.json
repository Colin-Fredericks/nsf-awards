 "awd_abstract_narration": "The S-STEM Program at Albright College supports students to overcome challenges that typically cause undergraduates to leave the STEM fields.  The S-STEM support is used to increase recruitment and retention of talented students who may otherwise not be able to afford college.  Special attention is made to promote high-quality STEM education opportunities to talented, low-income and minority students.  To accomplish this, early interventions for students include increased tutoring availability, cohort-focused academic activities, and optional research internship programs. Encouragement of diversity in the STEM workforce is facilitated through professional development opportunities for STEM students.\r\n\r\nThe technical features of this project centers on the appreciation of the multiple contributions STEM fields make towards the study of the environment.  This S-STEM Program is capitalizing on prior progress made in environmentally-oriented science curriculum at Albright College.  In this S-STEM Program, environmental science is the primary method used to increase the visibility of the STEM fields. Across campus at Albright College, students are recruited into the program from varied educational backgrounds.  Students are involved with projects that benefit the campus and greater community through various class projects and learning experiences. Notable project implementation components include improved student support services that lead to student success in the classroom and their future career paths.",
