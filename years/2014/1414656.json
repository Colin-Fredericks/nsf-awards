 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate-induced changes in oceanic temperature and pH are occurring rapidly around the world, and are primarily attributed to increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). As atmospheric CO2 levels rise, it is predicted that surface seawater temperatures will increase while pH will decrease. A number of recent studies have suggested that in these near-future ocean conditions, marine organisms will become more vulnerable to infectious diseases. However, no studies to date have examined the effects of both warming and acidification on the immune response of sea urchins, which are both ecologically and economically important. The intertidal sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma is commonly found in eastern Australian waters, a region that is experiencing rapid climate-induced environmental impacts. This project will investigate the prospective effects of warming and acidification on various immune system parameters of Heliocidaris erythrogramma. This research will be conducted at the University of Sydney, Australia in collaboration with Dr. Maria Byrne, an internationally-known expert on the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on marine invertebrates. \r\n\r\nSea urchins will be exposed to treatments at current and near-future seawater temperature and pH and following three different exposure periods (1 day, 2 weeks and 4 weeks), a variety of immune parameters will be measured. These parameters will include coelomocyte (cells associated with sea urchin innate immunity) number, spreading, and adhesion, as well as the ability of coelomocytes to phagocytosis and respond to a common marine pathogen.  Collectively, these measures will provide an evaluation of the ability of Heliocidaris erythrogramma to respond to immune challenges in a rapidly warming and acidifying marine environment. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",

These near-future ocean conditions will result in stress that renders marine organisms more vulnerable to infectious dieases. This study investigated the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma, a species commonly found in coastal waters around Australia, a region that is experiencing particularly rapid warming. Sea urchins were exposed to four combinations of both current and near-future seawater temperature and pH over a period of 30 days, and a variety of immune parameters were measured to provide an indication of the ability of this economically and ecologically important sea urchin to survive in warming and acidifying ocean conditions.\n\n     After 30 days, sea urchins exposed to elevated seawater temperatures and/or reduced pH had significantly fewer coelomocytes (cells associated with innate immunity). Additionally, at days 1 and 15, the coelomocytes from sea urchins exposed to near-future conditions exhibited significantly reduced phagocytic capacity (the ability to engulf and neutralize foreign particles).

Finally, at all three timepoints (days 1, 15, and 30) sea urchins exposed to elevated seawater temperatures and reduced pH were significantly less effective at dealing with infections from the common marine pathogen Vibrio anguillarum.\n\n     These results indicate that the immune response of the common sea urchin H. erythrogramma  will be challenged under near-future warming and acidifying ocean conditions.
