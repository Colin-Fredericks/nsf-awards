 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consumers around the globe are becoming more aware of the risks of contamination in water, whether it be freestanding or plumbed. As a result, there is growing consumer demand for systems to treat water nearer the point-of-use. This push for point-of-use water filtration is yielding a growing demand for systems that are small, economical, and capable of supporting real-time demand at fairly low volumes. Small scale point of use systems are marketed today to backpackers/hikers, emergency response personnel, and humanitarian workers, and to the general public as countertop filtration units. Increased filter performance and the resultant reductions in size and cost would be significant for many of these markets. Perhaps even more significant would be resistance to clogging (filter fouling) or self-cleaning point-of-use systems which would significantly lower the maintenance barrier to use. To improve on flow and filter lifetime in water filtration, the team proposes a precision fabricated membrane for backwash pre-filters.\r\n\r\nThe proposed carbon nanotube template microfabricated (CNT-M) membranes will have a much higher pore density and increased self-cleaning performance than commercially available membrane filters allowing for reduced system size and cost and reduced maintenance requirements. The CNT-M process results in a membrane with a planar top surface and vertical uniform pore profiles.  These pores facilitate high flow rates and should have significantly improved backwash efficiency. Industrial implementation of the carbon nanotube templated microfabrication (CNT-M) process will pave the way for its implementation in other promising applications areas including: high performance inertial microsensors, x-ray beam technology, medical microdevices, and chromatographic separations media.",

Through the process of conducting interviews with potential customers and documenting our findings in an objective format known as the Business Model Canvas, our understanding of the value to potential customers changed drastically. The process of conducting interviews and adapting research efforts to align with real customer needs has completely changed our perspective.  \n\nDuring the training period it became apparent that our technology was not exactly what customers were looking for and we adapted our approach to make plastic filters with more ideal geometries and a lower cost of manufacturing.  We found a very specific need in the oil &amp; gas production market where the unique properties of our filters could result in a significant cost reduction.  We decided to move forward with starting a company, Precision Membranes, and licensing the technology from the university.  While evaluating our stage 2 technology for this industrial application, we were contacted by companies developing medical diagnostics in need of a material identical to the stage 2 technology.   This was the biggest shift in our overall direction yet. \n\nThe first company was attempting to develop an early stage cancer diagnostic by detecting very rare tumor cells found in the blood of cancer patients.  The technical challenge they face is sorting between approximately 1 billion healthy blood cells and as few as 1-10 tumor cells of interest.  Our stage 2 technology enables us to make filters with extremely uniform pores, such that all healthy cells pass unrestrained, while the slightly larger tumor cells are retained on the filter.  We have since scaled up the production of these filters in partnership with a contract manufacturer and are supplying the filters to this customer for use in an ongoing clinical trial.  Their early signs of success are promising and there is hope that one of the most lethal cancers could be detected at a stage early enough to treat.  \n\nThis preliminary work enabled us to obtain further grants for the commercial development of this product.  Precision Membranes continues to develop filters for medical applications with the hope that previously unobtainable medical opportunities will be realized.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert C Davis"
