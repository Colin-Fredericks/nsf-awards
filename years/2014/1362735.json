 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Bergbreiter of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University is exploring new ways to more efficiently carry out homogeneously catalyzed reactions.  Strategies that combine the solubility of polymer-bound precious metal catalysts and ligands and that use recyclable polymeric solvents will be developed leading to more practical and sustainable ways to carry out common synthetic reactions widely used in industry.  This work--where undergraduate and graduate students in Professor Bergbreiter's group develop greener solvents and new ways to make reactions faster, more selective and more sustainable--will train students in catalysis and green chemistry, afford students the opportunity to collaborate with other groups in industry or at institutions here and outside the U.S., and potentially lead to more environmentally benign ways to carry out important catalytic reactions.  \r\n \r\nThis project focuses on designing new ways to use polymers to facilitate catalytic processes.  First, polymers will be designed to serve as solubility control elements for transition metal and organocatalysts to minimize side reactions or to simplify catalyst/product separations and catalyst/ligand recycling.  Second, polymer phase handles will be used to alter catalyst solubility to enable reactions to occur faster or to enhance catalyst reactivity in alternative solvents. Third, low molecular weight non-viscous functional polymers will be used in place of toxic volatile organic solvents to afford recyclable greener solvent alternatives.  Finally, functional oligomers will be used as antileaching agents along with soluble polymer bound catalysts to minimize catalyst losses typically seen in physical separations of catalysts from products at the end of a reaction.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of our NSF-funded research was to develop simpler, greener, and more sustainable ways to carry our synthesis and catalysis.  We accomplished this goal by first developing new versions of catalysts and reagents that were coupled to hydrocarbon oligomers to make them recyclable and separable from products.  Second, we expanded on this work by developing safer and more recyclable solvents that could enhance the utility and separability of these oligomer-bound catalysts and reagents.    Our work also led us to discover new, efficient, and simple ways to use these solvents systems we developed for catalysis and synthesis as tools to remove toxic trace organic substances from water.\n\nThe success we achieved in these studies was the result of our ability to transform hydrocarbon oligomers and polymers that are inexpensive and prepared on a large scale commercially for use as adhesives, lubricants, and even as chewing gum into solubility tags and solvents that are useful in even the most sophisticated chemical processes that are used in industry.  In this work, we used the separability of hydrocarbons from polar solvents to design new sorts of reagents or catalysts that could be more efficiently separated from products, minimizing or in some cases completely eliminating the volatile organics, the liquid waste, and the solid waste that is most often an environmentally challenging byproduct of these chemical reactions.  Such catalysts or reagents were designed such that they contained a hydrocarbon oligomer that served as an inert handle, facilitating recovery and separation of a reagent or catalyst from a product.  We further expanded on these concepts by developing safer solvents for these recyclable catalysts and reagents.  Conventional organic solvents are typically volatile and sometimes toxic.  While solvents can sometimes be recycled, that often involves energy intensive processes like distillation.  We were able to show that a class of hydrocarbon oligomers called polyalphaolefins (PAOs) that industry already fractionates into low viscosity synthetic base oils can replace low molecular weight alkane solvents.  These PAOs are nontoxic and have low flammability in contrast to conventional hydrocarbons like hexane, or heptane that are highly flammable or that have significant toxicity.  Since PAOs are separable from most polar solvents, they are also readily recycled just like hydrocarbon oligomer bound catalysts and reagents by a gravity separation.  We demonstrated the utility of these new solvents and new reagents using a sampling of well-known chemistry ranging from chemistry like nucleophilic substitutions, cross coupling reactions, metathesis reactions, and polymerization chemistry.  The results demonstrate that the strategies we developed are general and broadly applicable for a wide variety of reactions and that the use of these oligomer bound catalysts and oligomeric hydrocarbon solvents is a useful green chemistry approach to catalysis and synthesis.  \n\nIn addition to the intellectual merit of our basic research, our project also had broader impacts.  The main broader impact was the training of undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students in the research laboratory.  The training these students received and their successes afforded them the opportunity to publish their results in peer-reviewed journals.   They all had the opportunity to attend local, regional, national and international meetings where they presented their work orally or as posters.  These activities had educational value for these specific students.  They also served as a way to disseminate our results so that researchers around the world could further build on our discoveries.  Two provisional patents were also filed and the public domain solvents we developed are now being marketed by a company in Houston.  The training students received also facilitated their further careers.  Undergraduates who received this training mostly went on to Ph.D., M.D., or pharmacy programs.  A few directly entered industry.  Graduate or post-graduate students mostly were recruited by industry.  Several also chose an academic job.  Finally, this basic research also impacted the community more broadly through presentations in open houses, a Ted-x-Talk, and in my classroom teaching where I was able to use our discoveries as examples to help explain concepts like enthalpy and entropy to sophomore chemistry students. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David E Bergbreiter"
