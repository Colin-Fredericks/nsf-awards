 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, who have difficulty communicating with others, use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. While these devices can be found in the United States in abundance, they are more difficult to find in Japan. The goal of this research project is to work with community members involved in the support and care of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Japan to design and test an AAC device that is tailored to their needs. This work will be conducted at Hiroshima University in Japan under the sponsorship of Dr. Norimune Kawai, a speech language pathologist who works with Japanese children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\r\n \r\nAAC systems aid individuals to communicate via approaches such as paper-based tools, mobile applications, and stand-alone devices. This project will design a culturally appropriate AAC system for use by Japanese children through participatory design workshops with stakeholders (e.g., parents, therapists, graduate students, and the children). Participatory design workshops are a method used to engage the community in the creation of useful, accessible tools. Through workshops and one-on-one interviews, prototypes of AAC systems will be created, which will lead to a final design of an AAC system for Japanese children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. A working version of the system based on the final prototype will be created and it will be tested by Japanese children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This project will highlight the process of designing assistive technology as it occurs between local stakeholders in Japan and American researchers, enhancing our understanding of this cross-cultural process. In doing so, it will help develop frameworks that can facilitate assistive technology design work across cultures. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",
