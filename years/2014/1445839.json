 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to support the participation of young investigators in the annual meeting of the Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology held in Sun Valley, Idaho, August 3-6, 2014. The Workshops have a 40 year tradition, and emphasize active interaction of junior faculty and students.  The Workshops promote interdisciplinary communication, and are unusual in that discussion time equals or exceeds time allotted for formal presentation. The goals of the Workshop are to (1) work toward a multidisciplinary basic and clinical synthesis of molecular, tissue and biomechanical processes related to the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of bone and joint diseases; (2) provide training workshops for young investigators that help bridge the gaps between disciplines; (3) provide a forum for student training and the opportunity for junior investigators to talk with more senior scientists in a small group setting. This 2014 Workshop will address the theme of The Interaction of Bone with Other Organ Systems through sessions focused on the Regulation of Skeletal Processes by Neuropeptides, the Association Between Bone Fragility and Vascular Calcification, the Association between Skeletal Muscle and Bone Biological and Biomechanical Properties, the Interaction of Bone and the Immune System, and the Regulation of Bone Health by the Gut Microbiome. This Workshop is relevant to public health concerns because it brings a multi-disciplinary group of senior and junior scientists together to discuss the interaction of bone with other organ systems.  It provides vertically-oriented integration, from basic science to clinical pathology, to practitioners and scientists who are not completely familiar with all aspects of these diseases of societal concern.\r\n\r\nOpportunities are provided for junior investigators to interact with more senior investigators. A Career Development Workshop geared toward young investigators will include sections on \"How do I put together a curriculum vitae?\" and a panel discussion on \"The Interview Process\". As an additional aspect of mentorship, pre-workshop young investigator mentors have been assigned to work with young investigators who will be giving talks. An internationally-recognized scholar, Dr. Steven Goldring, has been invited to provide a Plenary Lecture.  The summarized results of the workshop are disseminated widely through BoneKEy, the online journal of the International Bone and Mineral Society: http://www.bonekey-ibms.org/misc/Meetingsupplements.dtl. The abstracts can be accessed prior to the Workshop as well: www.ibmsonline.org/Meetings.",

The number one reason I go is for the opportunity to have substantitve interactions with my coleagues and the discussion.  Another major highlight is meeting and seeing the work of the new investigators.  This energizes the meeting and helps promote these up and coming individuals.\n\n--I am the first time attendee, and I really enjoyed the workshop.  I like the small informal group setting as it gave the chance to get to know the attendees.  This workshop is an excellent venue especially for the young investigators.  I would totally recommend it.\n\n-- I really enjoyed the meeting especially listening to the discussion.  It is a good opportunity to know and interact with people.\n\n-- Awesome meeting!\n\n--This meeting was an excellent example of the free-flowing discussion that the SVW has become famour for.
