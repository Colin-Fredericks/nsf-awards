 "awd_abstract_narration": "1438197 (Xu). The completion of this project will provide an integrated tool to evaluate water scarcity risks for industries with global supply chains. The results will help businesses develop strategies \r\nto mitigate water scarcity risk and contribute to global water conservation. Although the results are specific for water scarcity risk, the modeling framework will be generally applicable for studying risks posed by other environmental challenges such as biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. An interactive web-based visualization tool will be developed to broadly disseminate the research results to raise awareness of water scarcity risk for the global trade network. The results of this research are targeted to help decision-making in trade and environmental policies to mitigate water scarcity risk for industries with significantly globalized supply chains.\r\n\r\nThe objective of evaluating risks for the global trade network will be achieved by developing and applying a probabilistic network analysis framework. Based on multi-regional input-output models, the world economy will be studied as a trade network in which nodes are industries in each country and links represent exchanges of goods and services between industries. Relative risks of economic losses in those industries due to local water scarcity at either the country level or river basin level will be used to weight the global trade network. The weighted global trade network will be analyzed using complex network analysis metrics and methods to identify \"hotspots\" vulnerable to water scarcity risks. The probabilistic network analysis framework will be generalized for broader applications to risks posed by other environmental challenges in addition to water scarcity. The project will also develop an interactive web-based visualization tool to present research results and facilitate effective teaching and learning.",

We quantify the water scarcity risk transmitted through international trade, namely, virtual water scarcity risk (VWSR) for nations, sectors and river basins, both in the past and under future climate change.</p>\n<p>Our integrated method reveals significant geographical separation between direct water scarcity risk for water-using sectors and potential production losses in the global trade system. VWSR originates in a relatively small number of nations (Figure 1A) which are subject to high levels of water stress, such as China, Spain, India, France, and Turkey. However, the indirect risks incurred through global supply chains are more widespread in the global economy (Figure 2B). As such, the interconnectedness of nations via trade can enable local water scarcities to exert global impacts. In particular, economies of United States, Germany, China, France, and Japan are the top ones subject to water scarcity risks physically occurring broad.</p>\n<p>The heatmaps in Figure 2 visualize the sector-to-sector VWSR transmission in the global trade system, illustrating general patterns of VWSR distribution in the global trade system and highlighting hotspots. Generally, the distributions of VWSR appear to spread over a variety of sectors in the global economy, both in terms of total risk transmission (Figure 2A) and vulnerability of the importing sectors (Figure 2B). This underscores the underpinning role of water resources in the modern economy, and stands in contrast to the relatively narrow focus on water-food or water-energy nexus featured in previous bottom-up analyses. Figure 3 shows transmission paths from Spain and China&rsquo;s Electricity, Gas and Water Supply sectors to a few other manufacturing sectors. For example, the VWSR is transmitted from Spain&rsquo;s Electricity, Gas and Water Supply sector to Germany&rsquo;s Transport Equipment sector through several intermediate sectors. Thus, the water-energy nexus in Spain, through water scarcity, may result in production losses in its multiple industrial sectors, which can in turn affect Germany&rsquo;s automobile production that relies on key inputs from Spain. Crucially, this type of risk cannot simply be mitigated by markets due to the specificity of intermediate inputs involved in the risk transmission paths.</p>\n<p>Network analysis reveals critical intermediate sectors in the global supply network for the mitigation of water scarcity risk (Figure 4). These are not necessarily direct water-using sectors, or the most critical intermediate sectors in the purely economic sense (Figure 4). Nonetheless, by producing intermediate goods for a variety other downstream sectors and sourcing inputs from water-scarce upstream sectors, they may impose substantial risks to the global trade system, due to their key positions in the supply network. For example, our results show that the Electrical and Optical Equipment sector in China and Fabricated Metal sectors in Japan are key intermediate sectors. To improve the resilience of the global trade network against water scarcity risk, supply chain management should pay more attention to these critical sectors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Coupling our model with water resources data with Geographical Information System (GIS) tools, we are able to identify the most important river basins that impose water scarcity risk to global trade (Figure 5), such as Mississippi River Basin, Danube Basin, Thames Basin, Rhine Basin, and Tigris &amp; Euphrates Basin. Water management in these river basins are crucial for preventing higher-order losses in the global trade system.</p>\n<p>When our method is combined with water resources predictions under climate change scenarios, novel patterns of water scarcity risk emerge. Because of projected drying in the mid-latitudes, Mediterranean, Middle East, North America, Southern Africa have direct water scarcity risks to their economic production (Figure 6, left panel). However, if adaptions are inadequate, water scarcity risk from climate change can be much more widespread due to globalized supply chains (Figure 6, right panel). With the methodologies developed in this project, it is possible for the indirectly affected nations and sectors to understand such risks and adapt in advance. These downstream players in the global supply network may choose to source inputs from a broader variety of suppliers, and/or to cooperate with nations and basins lying at the upstream supply chains
