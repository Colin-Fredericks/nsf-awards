 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will extend the basic science of linear interference delay effect filters, enabling ultra-wideband tunable RF filters for all types of RF receivers and instrumentation. It will also extend the engineering science of implementing such filters as integrated circuits. And, its distortion filtering aspect will enable enable signal agnostic,adaptive cancellation of wideband, and in-band, interference, for anti-jamming applications as well as to enhance signal quality for the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential is that it will help achieve the national goal of expanding access to RF spectrum by maximizing\r\nspectral efficiency with its continuous tuning. Second, it reduces filter cost and space requirements while increasing reliability by eliminating increasingly complex filter banks. This will result in smaller, cheaper and more dependable phones for consumers, which will help drive industry growth. Third, the results of this project will deliver Smartphone GPS accuracy rivaling commercial units, as well as enabling protection of GPS-dependent infrastructure against inadvertent or intentional disruption. Fourth, it will enable precise, jamming resistant GPS navigation by aerial drones used by first responders, homeland security and the military, helping prevent crashes that place people at risk.",

In addition to a number of technical breakthroughs, this project reflects a broad economic and social impact.  \n\nCombining tunable filtters and cancellers addresses a fundamental Challenge for mobile phones, isolating the downlink signals from a cell tower to the phone from the very powerful interference of the phones powerful uplink signals transmitted back to the cell tower at the same time.  A fundamental benefit of tunable interference cancellation is greater carrying capacity of the wireless spectrum, beyond its isolation benefit for the individual phone user.   \n\nBy reducing cost and space requirements the technology created under this grant will make phones more affordable and therefore make it possible for more people to have access to advanced mobile phone technology.\n\nIn addition to improving access to afffordable mobile phones, the close collaboration with the university permitted the company to expose graduate students to new technology, thereby helping train next generation leaders in wireless engineering.  \n\nThe proejct resulted in four publications at technical meetings and the grant of one patent to date, with others pending.  As reported in these publications, the technology will be valuable in other areas of engineering such as better research instrumentation and by reducing size and cost of antenna electronics on cell towers.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frederick Vosburgh"
