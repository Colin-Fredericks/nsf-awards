 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader aim of synthetic biology is to design and build organisms specialized to perform pre-designated functions ranging from production of commercially desirable fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals to remediating contaminating soil and water. The work proposed here is to develop and validate computational tools to increase the role of automation in designing synthetic biological systems. These tools are aimed at creating a streamlined methodology that integrates biochemical, regulatory, and phylogenetic information into a single platform to expedite the design and creation of function-based organisms. These tools will significantly shorten the time taken to re-engineer organisms and will enable wider usage of synthetic organisms.  Students will be engaged in this research through novel course material, hands-on experimentation through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineering Machines) competition, and relevant research projects with the principle investigators.  Recruiting efforts will be put forward to attract women and underrepresented minority undergraduate students to participate in this research.  \r\n \r\n\r\nWe address in this proposal two cellular engineering problems that enable maximizing cellular yield. The first problem consists of identifying and ranking non-native synthesis pathways that yield desirable biomolecules such as biofuels or therapeutics. In the second problem, we identify reactions whose fluxes must be modified to increase cellular yield. While these two problems have been addressed within the metabolic engineering community, a holistic approach for engineering biological systems requires extending these approaches to consider underlying gene interactions and limitations. While the synthetic biology community has embraced a bottom-up approach for creating design methodologies and tools to enable creating genetic circuitry, the metabolic engineering community has relied on pathway-based design approaches.  Our proposed approach lies at the intersection of these two differing approaches.  In this proposal, traditional pathway-based approaches are extended to exploit knowledge and limitations of the underlying genetic networks.  To rank synthesis pathways, gene similarity and transcript secondary structure are utilized. To identify gene modifications, fold changes in gene expressions as design variables are used, while accounting for uncertainties that arise with engineering interventions.  To validate the outcomes of the proposed computational tools, we build synthesis pathways to produce isoprenoids and implement identified gene modifications, using Escherichia coli as a host organism.",

The benefits of these tools are to shorten the time taken to re-engineer organisms and to enable wider usage of synthetic organisms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;On the computational front, we explored methods for enhancing the engineering of non-native synthesis pathways in microbial hosts. We developed computational tools to identify viable synthesis pathways and their gene implementation.&nbsp; Our workflow (<strong>Figure 1</strong>), termed Probabilistic Pathway Assembly with Solubility Scores (<em><strong>ProPASS</strong>)</em>, first identifies reaction steps required to construct non-native synthesis pathways for a desired product metabolite, and then evaluates the solubility of each possible enzyme from each available organism.&nbsp;To accomplish this, we created a database, termed Protein Solubility Database (<strong><em>ProSol DB)</em></strong>, with available protein sequences and their solubility scores. We validated the workflow using several test cases.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We also created a workflow to predict metabolic disruption due to enzymes along heterologous pathways. While enzymes are generally known to be highly selective catalysts, growing evidence strongly suggests that enzymes are often promiscuous (i.e., can perform side reactions). We hypothesize that such promiscuity leads to formation of unintended and undesirable byproducts that are not only disruptive to the host metabolism but also to the intended end-objective of high productivity and yield. We developed a method for detecting such undocumented activities when adding a heterologous pathway to an organism, and evaluated the method using several case studies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Further, our enzyme promiscuity prediction tool, <strong>PROXIMAL</strong>, was used to develop a workflow for the discovery of undocumented promiscuous enzymatic reactions in metabolic models. Metabolic models are indispensable in guiding cellular engineering and in advancing our understanding of systems biology. However, as not all enzymatic activities are fully known and/or annotated, metabolic models remain incomplete, resulting in suboptimal computational analysis and leading to unexpected experimental results. Our workflow predicted hundreds of reactions and metabolites that can potentially augment iML1515, the most recent genome-scale metabolic model for <em>Escherichia coli</em>. These products may exist in <em>E. coli</em> but have not been documented in any databases. Among those (<strong>Figure 2)</strong>, we found 6 novel metabolites that were not documented before and that were experimentally verified to exist in <em>E. coli. </em>The corresponding reactions can be used to augment existing <em>E. coli</em> metabolic models.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;To further demonstrate undocumented enzymatic activities and their experimental validation, we used our workflow to predict unexpected metabolic products for two biological samples for the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and murine cecal microbiota. Metabolomics data was collected using untargeted LC-MS data.&nbsp; Predicted products matched, on average, to 23.92% of measured masses, providing a &gt; 7-fold increase in the candidate set size when compared to a reference metabolic model. Importantly, many predicted products are not catalogued in current databases. Using our method, we experimentally verified the presence of a CHO cell metabolite that has not been previously identified as part of CHO cell metabolism (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;On the experimental front, we hypothesized that engineering a global regulatory system (regulon) could provide a new paradigm in engineering biological systems and complement current tools available for metabolic engineering. Natural systems often use such genome-scale regulatory infrastructures, called regulons, to coordinate nutrient catabolism with other cellular functions. Such systems include sensors to detect a specific nutrient (input), signal transduction and integration (computation), and global genetic regulation (output). One of the best studied native regulons is the galactose (GAL) system in the yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, where Gal3p-mediated sugar detection initiates a genome-wide response effected by Gal4p and Gal4p-responsive transcription factors (TFs). To guide the development of computational tools, we experimentally investigated the GAL regulon. We assessed the role of the GAL regulon in enabling efficient galactose utilization for cell growth by decoupling its regulatory responses from sugar catabolism. We provided evidence that regulon-controlled galactose assimilation is better than constitutive expression of the catabolic genes in supporting fast growth rates to higher cell densities (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). We also determined that such a regulon could enable more complete and efficient utilization of substrates that are non-native to this yeast -- pentoses xylose and arabinose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Graduate and undergraduate students engaged in this research through research activities, novel course material, hands-on experimentation through the iGEM (international Genetically Engineering Machines) competition, high school outreach, and relevant research projects with the principle investigators.
