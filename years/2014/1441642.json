Hurricane Katrina; the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the Mianus River Bridge collapse in Connecticut; and the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant serve as recent notable examples. Due to the status of South Korea as an emerging international leader in advanced technology and manufacturing, an international workshop will be held in Changwon with a follow on visit to the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. International researchers from Germany, India, South Korea, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, and the United States of America will exchange ideas for improved approaches related to the management of aging and high risk complex systems. Improved management of such systems will benefit the U.S. economy and society. A bound volume will summarize the workshop and provide recommendations for the future.  \r\n\r\nIn the post-Fukushima era, engineers are faced with increasing responsibility to come up with new and more effective tools for test data collection and mining, microstructural imaging, damage diagnostics, life-to-failure modeling, and cost-benefit risk-balanced analysis for time-critical decision-making to ensure the safety of the public. This workshop will address the knowledge gaps in the physics based prediction of service life and the benefits to be offered by rapidly evolving nondestructive evaluation and structural monitoring systems. A focus of the workshop is on fatigue behavior and estimation of time or cycles to failure, including a new generation of fatigue resistant materials. Contributions will be on a fundamental level with high priority assigned to revolutionary experimental and simulation approaches to support the materials genome initiative.",
