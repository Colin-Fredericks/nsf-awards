 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support construction, operation, and data management/distribution for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a camera upgrade and renovation for the 48-inch Oschin Schmidt telescope on Mt Palomar. The telescope will conduct wide-area sky surveys with a goal of identifying new types of rare, rapidly varying astronomical sources at locations ranging from inside our own Solar System to significant fractions of the distance \"across\" the universe. Broader impacts of the work include hands-on training of students and early career scientists developing instrumentation for large area sky surveys.  Expertise will be developed in STEM fields and will lead to skills important for NSF's major new project, the LSST.   The ZTF will conduct an annual time-domain summer school open to students throughout the US, and will share the excitement of the Dynamic Sky with the public via an outreach program at the Palomar Observatory Visitors' Center.  \r\n\r\nThe facility will conduct a synoptic survey for high-cadence time-domain astronomy with the goal of identifying rare, fast-varying sources. These sources will include supernovae, exotic explosive transients, unusual stellar variables, compact binaries, active galactic nuclei, and asteroids.  The ZTF survey will cover the entire Northern Sky, revisiting fields on timescales of a few hours and providing hundreds of visits per field each year.  This shallow-wide-fast cadence is well suited to detecting fast transients and probing rapid variability. The single-visit depth of 20.4mag is well-matched to current spectrographs on 4-m class telescopes, while the final co-added images will provide wide sky coverage that is about two magnitudes deeper than that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The new camera will have a 47 square degree field of view, larger than the original Palomar Sky Survey which was recorded on glass plates using this same telescope almost 60 years ago.   The proposing team has substantial experience in this field, having run the similar but less powerful Palomar Transient Factory for a number of years previous to this.  The project is leveraged by contributions from a number of partner institutions, including Caltech (lead), the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC), Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel), the Oskar Klein Centre (Sweden), DESY (High Energy Astronomy, Germany), Los Alamos National Laboratory, TANGO (Taiwan), the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Intra-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (India), and Pomona College.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a powerful optical sky survey designed for fast, wide area coverage to identify rare, fast-varying astronomical sources. It employs a state-of-the-art camera with a 47 square degree field-of-view (the full Moon is 0.2 square degrees) mounted on the Samuel Oschin 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory in Southern California. Over almost three years, ZTF has covered the entire Northern Sky doing so once every three nights and the Galactic Plane nightly in red and green filters, observing billions of astronomical objects several hundred times. Detections of changes in brightness or position of any of these objects are sent out in real time to the community, amounting to several hundred thousand alerts per night. The resulting \"light curves\" of variable and explosive objects have been a major source of such data for not only the US but global astronomical community.</p>\n<p><br />ZTF has discovered almost 5000 supernovae (SNe), including over 3000 \"Type Ia\", originating in stellar binary systems with at least one white dwarf companion, and over 1000 \"Type II\", produced by the collapse of massive stars, as well as numerous examples of other types. This vast trove explains in part the impact ZTF has had in the field of cosmic explosions. Additionally, ZTF's fast coverage means that many SNe are discovered early, before they have peaked in brightness, and this is changing our understanding of the nature of supernova progenitor systems and the physics of their explosions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />When a star gets too close to a massive black hole in the center of a galaxy, it is pulled apart by tidal forces and energy is released as material falls into the black hole. These tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare events but ZTF has detected thirty, increasing the number of optical TDEs known by a factor of three. This has provided important clues about the physical properties and parameters of such interactions. ZTF is also showing that the environment of a supermassive black hole is generally far more dynamic than previously thought with the discovery of several active galactic nuclei in the process of \"turning on\" indicating changes in the rate of material accreting onto the central black hole.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />The nightly Galactic Plane survey and related surveys by ZTF have proven to be a treasure chest for stellar astronomy with the identification of many new examples of rare stellar types, along with violent stellar outbursts from flaring stars and cataclysmic variables. In particular, nineteen eclipsing pairs of white dwarfs - so-called double degenerate systems - have been found, four with periods less than fifteen minutes. These systems can be the cause of various astrophysical phenomena, including \"Type Ia\" supernova, and are important laboratories for studying late phases of stellar evolution. They will also be guaranteed sources for future spacae-based gravitational wave detectors, such as Europe's flagship LISA project.</p>\n<p><br />ZTF is a powerful instrument for studies of the Solar System, and specifically for comets and asteroids. Tens of thousands of new Main Belt asteroids have been discovered as well as 180 Near Earth Objects, including the closest Earth flyby to that time. ZTF has been particularly productive for asteroids within the orbit of Earth and has even discovered the first asteroid within the orbit of Venus. It has also captured almost twenty comets in outburst which is important in understanding their composition and evolution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />With its wide field-of-view, ZTF is also an ideal multi-messenger follow-up instrument with which to search for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves and neutrinos. ZTF reported the first candidate optical flare from an extreme binary black hole merger. ZTF has also reported a tidal disruption event coincident with a high energy neutrino. ZTF promptly searched thirteen mergers of neutron star mergers and provided new limits on the expected rates and detectability of such mergers. ZTF has also discovered the shortest duration collapsar, a massive star explosion typically associated only with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.</p>\n<p><br />Finally, ZTF has been vital to the education of the astronomical community about real-time transient astronomy and the development of community infrastructure to prepare for the alerts to come from the Rubin Observatory. A number of community alert brokers are now in regular operation, having partnered with ZTF and the almost 100 million public alerts it has produced over the course of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shrinivas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kulkarni</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1440341/1440341_10333232_1609202269770_ztf_andromeda--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1440341/1440341_10333232_1609202269770_ztf_andromeda--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Andromeda\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1440341/1440341_10333232_1609202269770_ztf_andromeda--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Andromeda\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The ZTF field of view showing the Moon and Andromeda for comparison.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Danny Goldstein</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shrinivas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kulkarni</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Andromeda</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1440341/1440341_10333232_1609201746639_19wey_cartoom--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1440341/1440341_10333232_1609201746639_19wey_cartoom--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019wey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1440341/1440341_10333232_1609201746639_19wey_cartoom--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019wey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multi-wavelength observations of the Galactic low-mass X-ray binary AT2019wey over 14 months.
