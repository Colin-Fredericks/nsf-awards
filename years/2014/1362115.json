  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award provided support for the 21st International Conference on High Magnetic Fields in Semiconductor Physics (HMF) held on August 3- 8, 2014 in Panama City Beach, Florida, USA. This HMF conference was the 21st edition of the biennial series initiated in 1972. It is now established as one of the major forums for the interdisciplinary discussions of the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of semiconductor- and carbon-based structures and materials, both theoretical and experimental. Much of the subject matter of HMF conferences involves novel electronic structures and devices, linking basic and applied physics. For example, these include low-dimensional quantum structures for electronics and optoelectronics, spintronics and magnetic semiconductors, novel atomically-thin 2D systems holding great promise to transistor or sensor applications.\n\nParticipation in professional meetings is critical for students and junior researchers who need to be exposed to state-of-the-art research topics in a stimulating, collaborative  atmosphere. The HMF-21 conference organizers used this NSF grant to provide partial support to selected graduate and undergraduate students to attend the conference. After careful consideration, the Organizing Committee distributed 11 awards, 8 to cover registration fees and 3 for registration fees and lodging. All together, the HMF-21 conference  featured active participation of students and postdocs reporting strong and original science. For example, graduate students contributed 2 invited presentations and 12 talks. Not only was this an invaluable opportunity for students to grow academically and professionally, the conference as a whole benefitted from these students\u00c6 fresh research. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dmitry Smirnov"
