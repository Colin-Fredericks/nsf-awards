 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award will enable the installation of a large acceptance, high-resolution magnetic spectrograph at the John D. Fox Accelerator Laboratory of Florida State University (FSU) and the development of a suite of state-of-the-art auxiliary detectors around it. This instrument will allow precision measurements of certain nuclear properties, which determine the energy release and time scale of stellar explosions and studies of the physics of unbound atomic nuclei in general. This instrument reclaims the capability to perform such precision measurements in the USA. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative MRI award will fund the installation of a large-acceptance, high-resolution Enge split-pole spectrograph (SPS) at the accelerator laboratory at FSU with the purpose of studying the physics of resonant nuclear states that impact nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure.  The SPS became available upon the cessation of operations at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University.   This project will install the 32-tonne instrument at FSU and augment its research capabilities by upgrading its focal plane detectors and developing a new Silicon detector array, in parallel at Louisiana State University (LSU), for efficient spectroscopy of unbound resonances.\r\n\r\nThe properties of un-bound nuclear states, or resonances, have become a focal point of present day nuclear science as they present the doorway through which stars and stellar explosions build up the elements and release energy.  The LSU/FSU collaboration previously developed the Array for Nuclear Astrophysics and Structure with Exotic Beams (ANASEN) for high-efficiency studies of such reactions using beams of radioactive nuclei.  A new opportunity for advancing our understanding of nuclear reactions with astrophysical importance stems from the unique combination of high-precision spectroscopy performed with the SPS with the existing program of high-sensitivity studies with radioactive beams currently being performed with ANASEN.\r\n\t\r\nThe proposed SPS system also creates an important discovery potential for the physics of exotic nuclear states, studied through a systematic investigation of particle orbitals beyond the binding limit.  The interaction of nuclear orbits across shell closures is of importance to the physics of exotic nuclei at the limits of binding.  The modification of nuclear properties through the presence of extended wavefunctions will be studied through a detailed spectroscopy of un-bound resonances, studying the presence of the Super-radiance mechanism in the presence of competing particle-decay channels.  Again, the research at the SPS is not only complementary, but important to current and future studies with radioactive beams at FSU and the future Facility for Rare isotope Beams (FRIB).\r\n\t\r\nThe proposed program around the SPS is a complementary effort and aims to address a lack of experimental opportunities with stable nuclear beams within the U.S. scientific program.  Operated by a collaboration of two vibrant research groups, the SPS has the potential to become a national resource in the education of the next generation of scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUpon the cessation of operations of the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University, the capabilities to perform high-precision charged-particle spectroscopy of interest to nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics became unavailable in the United States.  The Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SPS) that was formerly housed at the WNSL was transported to the accelerator laboratory where it was successfully installed in the experimental hall at the John D. Fox Accelerator Laboratory at Florida State University.  The main detector for the SPS was refurbished at the laboratories of Louisiana State University and a new Silicon detector array - the SIlicon Array for Branching Ratio Experiments (SABRE) - was developed, outfitted with state-of-the-art digital electronics.  With this new completed experimental setup, the capability to study transfer and charge-exchange reactions via high-resolution particle spectroscopy with the largest acceptance Enge SPS available has been reestablished.  Specifically, with this setup light ion beams (e.g. beams of isotopes of hydrogen and helium) are acclerated by the FSU Tandem acclerator and incident on heavy isotopic targets in order to study reactions of interest to nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics.  Light reaction products are bent by the magnetic field of the SPS and detected at the focal plane of the SPS.  Excited states of the residual nuclei that remain in the target then decay via charged particles, and those decays are detected by SABRE, which is located in the SPS target chamber.  By measuring these reactions products nuclear structure information, such as the energies of excited states in the nuclei produced, the spins of those states and the decay properties of those states can be measured.  This yields fundamental information about how protons and neutrons make up various nuclides.  The nuclear structure properties of isotopes also informs our understanding of reaction rates that occur in various stellar environments such as classical novae and Type I X-ray Bursts, furthering our understanding of explosive nucleosynthesis.  The location of this spectrograph at FSU also allows the participation of a variety of graduate and undergraduate students from multiple institutions, resulting in their exposure to cutting-edge equipment and research.  With the successful completion of this project, the nuclear physics research groups at Florida State University, Louisiana State University, and other institutions have begun a robust research program studying nuclear reactions, which will continue well into to the future, resulting in our improved understanding of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Catherine Deibel"
