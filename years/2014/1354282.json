 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years, it has been known that ion channels control muscle contraction and nerve function.  Dr. Bates' group recently showed that ion channels are also important for cells to determine what type of cells they should become. It is completely unknown how an ion channel communicates with other known developmental signaling pathways to participate in cell-fate decisions. The Bates lab uses genetics and light-controlled channels to figure out exactly how ion channels communicate with the proteins that have long been known to specify cell fate decisions. These experiments will determine how different ion flow controls animal development on a molecular level.  Dr. Bates has mentored several high school students, over twenty undergraduate students, and graduate students in laboratory research. Funds from this NSF grant enable her to continue inquiry-based teaching and mentoring. In addition, she encourages under-represented groups in science by teaching summer programs for under-represented groups in science.",
