 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the generation of North African and Mediterranean climate anomalies by El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and Eurasian snow cover fluctuations. Two causal mechanisms are examined, one involving tropospheric teleconnections produced by Rossby wave generation and propagation (a \"horizontal\" mechanism), and the other involving stratosphere-troposphere interactions (a \"vertical\" mechanism).  The horizontal mechanism is hypothesized to consist of 1) a canonical northeastward propagating wave train that emanates from the eastern equatorial Pacific, and 2) an ultra-low frequency Rossby wave that is excited over the Pacific, trapped within the North African-Asian (NAA) jet and propagates upstream to the Mediterranean region. The vertical mechanism begins with an expansion of Eurasian snow cover, which leads to colder surface conditions and lowering of mid-tropospheric geopotential height. This in turn amplifies the wave-1 stationary wave pattern, which propagates into the stratosphere and reduces the strength of the polar vortex, resulting in a negative anomaly of the Arctic or North Atlantic Oscillation, which shifts the jet stream and storm track southward. The southward shift of the jet and storm track allows colder temperatures to invade the middle latitudes, including the Mediterranean region.  These influences will be examined through statistical analysis combined with a suite of models including a Rossby wave ray tracing calculation, a linearized barotropic model, a state-of-the-art global atmospheric model (CAM), and an atmospheric model with a well-resolved stratosphere (WACCM).  In addition, an empirical prediction scheme will be developed and tested using Eurasian snow cover and ENSO as predictors for seasonal Mediterranean precipitation and surface temperature.\r\n\r\nThe work has societal broader impacts due to the agricultural and other consequences of climate variability in the Mediterranean region.  More specifically, the empirical prediction scheme will be provided to operational centers including the International Research Institute at Columbia University.  In addition, a website will be developed to provide public information regarding the role of atmospheric teleconnections in producing climate anomalies.  The project will also support and train a graduate student, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this research area.",

Along its shores and within the broader Mediterranean basin civilization has flourished for over 10,000 years.  At present 21 countries with a combined population of around five hundred million people border this body of water.  Populations in some of these coastal countries have increased substantially over the last 50 years (e.g., Egypt), and this demographic growth has greatly intensified pressures on available arable lands and fisheries in the region.  And has the past several years have demonstrated, strains in this region can influence and even destabilize countries outside of this region as refugees leave the region looking for new homes.\n\nThese strains are often compounded by climate variability on interannual and longer time scales.  The Mediterranean climate is hot and arid; anomalously high seasonal temperatures or low precipitation can decimate agricultural yields and increase the burden on surface water resources.  The collective management of water resources, agriculture, and fisheries around the Mediterranean basin, as well as industry, tourism, and even human health, could be better effected if the interannual variability of the climate in this region were better constrained and could be predicted.  Such constraint requires a further understanding of the mechanisms that produce interannual climate variability in the Mediterranean region. This variability and its impact on crops and other resources underscore the need for skillful seasonal prediction of temperature and precipitation.
