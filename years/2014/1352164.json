 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexander Radosevich of The Pennsylvania State University is investigating inexpensive nonmetal compounds for hydrogen transfer catalysis. Geometrically distorted tricoordinate phosphorus compounds are prepared and evaluated for transfer hydrogenation catalysis via pentacoordinate dihydridophosphorane intermediates. The research involves an investigation of the mechanistic factors that permit hydrogen transfer reactivity with phosphorus-based catalysts and an assessment of the molecular and electronic design principles required to develop efficient nonmetal catalysts for valuable synthetic transformations. In conjunction with local partners, outreach efforts to promote active participation in science by K-12 students are being pursued including a summer research curriculum for high school students from underserved populations, and a chemistry-focused, interactive children's museum exhibit for young learners. The broader impacts of this work include potential benefits from the discovery of catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant elements as well as the introduction of students to active learning in science through non-classroom activities. \r\n\r\nCatalysts enable the preparation of medicines, materials and fuels in a scalable, economical, and environmentally responsible manner. This project focuses on the discovery of a new class of catalysts based on lightweight, inexpensive, and abundant nonmetal elements. The potential broader societal benefits include the production of chemicals and materials free of residual metals and in a sustainable manner.",
