The scientific program will cover a large number of topics, including the following: classical complex analysis and potential theory; iteration theory of real, rational, and entire functions; real algebraic geometry. There will be three plenary speakers: Mario Bonk, Misha Sodin, and Alexander Volberg. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
