 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop improved simulation tools for computations that will help us understand the formation of the first galaxies and quasars.  A number of upcoming observatories will provide data addressing a crucial epoch in cosmic history: the Epoch of Reionization (EOR), when the first galaxies and quasars lit up the dark ages and reionized the neutral hydrogen gas. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students.  Dr. Li will create a new program, Research Experience in Astronomy and Computation for High-school teachers (REACH), for a week-long Penn State In-Service Workshop in Astronomy. REACH will provide high-school educators interdisciplinary education and training in astronomy and computer science\r\n\r\nDr. Li will undertake a comprehensive approach to bridging theory and observations of the EOR by combining multi-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. Three main goals are pursued in this project: First, she will perform simulations on both galactic and cosmological scales to follow the formation and evolution of early galaxies and quasars. Second, she will perform post-processing radiative transfer calculations to derive multi-wavelength properties of galaxies and map the reionization history. Third, she will confront models with observations to understand the physical processes, and make predictions for future surveys.",
