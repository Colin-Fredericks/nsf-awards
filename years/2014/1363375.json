 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Annaliese Franz in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Davis is developing new sustainable silicon-based catalysts for the synthesis of organic materials and polymers.  The development of silicon-based catalysts is important because metal-free catalysts tend to be non-toxic, stable, and minimize the use of reagents and organic solvents. Outreach activities developed by Professor Franz are allowing girls in elementary and middle school the opportunity to participate in hands-on activities and learn about catalysts, energy, and polymers. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of new catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant materials and biodegradable polymers from natural feedstocks as well as student training and outreach activities to promote science for girls and young women.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the synthesis of new silicon-based catalysts with silanol activating groups and the application of these catalysts to organic transformations, including polymerization reactions for biodegradable materials.  The structure, binding interactions and mechanism of various catalysts are being studied using computational methods, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry.  This information will be used to enhance mechanistic studies for organic silanol activation, as well as other classes of metal-free catalysts. The research is improving the fundamental understanding of hydrogen-bonding and anion-binding and enhancing the application of these catalysts.",
