 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract\r\n\r\nDiscontinuous Shear Thickening fluids such as cornstarch and water exhibit an amazing and useful response to impact. They become solid-like in response to impact and can, for example, stop an impacting object, or support a person running on the surface of the fluid, but remain fluid-like before and after impact.  This project involves controlled laboratory experiments to study this impact response and aims to develop a better understanding of how jammed materials behave.  The applications of this work include the design of materials for impact protection, as well as improved  suspension flow processing.  This research program includes the training and participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the scientific process.  Outreach to local public school students includes lecture-demonstrations focusing on science and engineering education for women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\n The goal of this project is to understand the dynamic behavior of Discontinuous Shear Thickening fluids (including impact response and the ability to run on the surface).  It has recently been found that a transiently jammed region of material can develop and propagate in front of an impacting object.  The research team carries out experiments with a combination of force measurements and images of the jammed region at the surface  to determine if and how the stress response correlates with the jammed fronts reaching the boundaries.  The experiments investigate the physical mechanism behind the strong stress response by testing if the stress response scales with the stiffness of the boundary or particles as in other jammed systems.  The research team also carries out experiments to determine the critical shear rate at the shear thickening transition under impact.  This is tested with impact experiments for different impact velocities and fluid viscosities.  A constitutive relation describing the dynamic behavior of Discontinuous Shear Thickening fluids can be developed from these experiments.  The experiments are complimented by low-dimensional modeling to connect and explain the various dynamic behaviors of Discontinuous Shear Thickening fluids. This low-dimensional model requires as input a stiffness and relaxation times, obtained from measurements of the model system of impact experiments.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nShear thickening suspensions get thicker (i.e. more viscous) when they are sheared faster or harder.   Shear thickening suspension are known for their ability to protect against impacts, but why they are good at that has not been understood.  We carried out experiments to impact suspensions of cornstarch and water.  When impacted, the suspension near the point of impact becomes solid-like, and this solid-like region propagates ahead of the impactor as it moves further into the suspension.  We measured how the force on the impacting object varied with penetration depth and impact velocity to  obtain equations that can predict the impact response in different situations.  The equations can be described by a stiffness of the solid-like region and a propagation speed for the front of the solid-like region.  These equations can also predict how the force on an impacting object varies over time, or how far it would penetrate into a material.   For example, we showed that these equations can describe the ability of a person to walk or run on the surface of cornstarch and water.  These equations could be used to better design materials for protective gear for athletes. \n\nWe also measured how long it takes for stress to relax in a shear thickening system.  We found that at low packing fractions, the suspensions relaxed in a manner similar to other fluids. However, for larger packing fractions where the shear thickening is very strong, we find a different, slower relaxation behavior, with a relaxation time on the order of 1 second (as opposed to 1/10000 of a second expected based on traditional fluid models).  This is slow enough, for example, that the foot of a person running on the surface of cornstarch and water can be held up for about 1 second while they take the next step, without sinking into the fluid.  \n\nTo resolve how the relaxation times vary with packing fraction, we had to come up with a new technique to analyze data near a critical point.  The critical point here is the maximum packing fraction where shear thickening is found, and the strength of shear thickening increases rapidly near the critical point.  This means the properties of the suspension are very sensitive to the packing fraction near this critical point.  Since all measurements have some error associated with them (in this case largely due to changes in temperature and humidity), it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve data near the critical point, where the most interesting behavior happens.  Thus, rather than characterize data by its packing fraction, we characterized it by the measured minimum shear rate where shear thickening is observed, since the strength of shear thickening is less sensitive to this than it is to packing fraction.  This technique allows better resolution of measurement near the critical point, and allows us to better compare data taken in different labs or in different seasons with different temperature and humidity.\n\nMaking suspensions flow more easily is an important problem in industrial processing.  In that case, the solid-like behavior of shear thickening suspensions is usually undesirable.  To better understand this flow we investigated what leads to this solid-like behavior.  When sheared, the particles in dense granular materials have a hard time getting around each other, so the packing expands (dilates) to make room for the particles to rearrange.  We showed this happens in suspensions in the same packing fraction and stress range as shear thickening, and happens at the same time that stresses increase rapidly in the material, indicating dilation is connected to shear thickening.  Dilated suspensions push against the boundaries of the system, which can push back and transmit force between particles in the suspension along frictional contacts.  An important consequence of dilation is that the magnitude of stresses in the system is determined mainly by the stiffness of the boundary, rather than an intrinsic material property.  It suggests, for example, that flow of a shear thickening suspension in an open channel with room to dilate is much more efficient and less likely to jam than flow through a pipe with hard walls.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Brown"
