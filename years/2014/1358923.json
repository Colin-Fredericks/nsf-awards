 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Alabama State University, located in Montgomery, AL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014 - 2016. The focus of this program is to provide research experiences in the multidisciplinary fields of nanotechnology and biotechnology. Faculty from biological sciences, chemistry, physical sciences and other related disciplines will be serving as mentors for the program. All research projects will be based on novel concepts of design and development of new nanomaterials for biological applications. Students will participate in a full-time closely mentored lab research project along with seminars and various professional development workshops, such as the responsible conduct of research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in academia and industry, and the graduate school application process. Students will present their findings at both a poster session and research symposium during the final weeks of the program. Students will also take field trips to encourage interactions with the faculty and students at Alabama State University. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances will be provided. Students will be selected based on their interest in research, academic record, and phone interviews with potential faculty mentors. \r\n\r\nThe REU program is intended to encourage students to pursue a career in STEM fields. Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Members of underrepresented minority groups and from colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nProgram evaluation will use both internal evaluations and the BIO REU common assessment tool. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.alasu.edu/REU , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Komal Vig at komalvig@alasu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Shree R. Singh at ssingh@alasu.edu).",

Our REU program was a success in our recruitment efforts both in terms of applicant numbers and student diversity.</p>\n<p>Each year the REU program started with a 4 day workshop on Nanotechnology for incoming interns to teach various instrumentation and techniques on nanotechnology.&nbsp; Each student was individually mentored by a faculty member and a graduate student or post doc. As many of the projects were multidisciplinary the students at times were mentored by 2 faculties. Besides hands on research, the program also provided structured professional developments workshops to prepare students for graduate school and career in STEM. Talks and workshops on responsible conduct in research and bioethics were conducted to get awareness of ethical choices in research. &nbsp;Instructions on biosafety were also provided to make students aware of safe laboratory practices. &nbsp;Furthermore, the program comprised critical thinking exercises, scientific writing and oral/poster presentations guidance. Field trips to bioethics museums and research/industry centers were organized to create STEM career awareness.</p>\n<p>A parameter to evaluate student success in research is by the presentations they make at national and international scientific meetings. Our program resulted in 70 presentations in last 3 years by REU students from their summer research in a variety of scientific meetings including Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) and Emerging Researches National Conference in STEM (ERN). They also published 2 conference proceeding papers. Another factor by which student research can be judged is by the awards they get at the scientific meetings. From our REU program, 17&nbsp; interns received travel awards from ABRCMS and ERN to present their research and many won awards for their research presentations at these meetings.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of the REU was to encourage participants to pursue graduate education or a career in STEM fields. Of the 31 interns supported by our REU program 19 graduated and 12 of them are pursuing graduate school. &nbsp;One intern is pursuing post-bac program and four have joined workforce in STEM related fields.</p>\n<p>Throughout the three years of the REU program, program was assessed and evaluation results were used to improve the program and successfully implement the program objectives. Overall the student&rsquo;s responses in regard to our program were positive. Our interns assessed the overall research experience, including working relationships with the research mentors and research group as excellent. The interns felt the program helped in understanding the theory and concepts of research projects. The interns also believed they became confident and got the ability to work independently possibly due to our emphasis on early intense mentoring followed by relative freedom. The students felt they were engaged in real-world scientific research and felt like a scientist which plays an important role in retention in a scientific career for students. Students agreed that their resume has been enhanced by research experience and prepared them for advanced coursework, thesis work, graduate school, and a job. Most of the students felt they could work in science lab and likely to pursue a Ph.D.&nbsp; When asked to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of the research program, pleasantly, very high satisfaction levels were reported by the REU interns for: the application process, ease in locating a research mentor, ease in securing lab or field equipment, support and guidance from program staff, research mentor, other group members, research group meetings, and financial support. Most indicated that the workshops on science writing and presentation, safety training, and the ethics seminars helped immensely. The evaluations also showed that the interns learned more about nanotechnology, biotechnology and the research experience significantly influenced their long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Our program outcomes clearly demonstrate that the REU program does in fact provide meaningful mentoring and extensive research experiences along with professional development training and a series of educational components that aided in career development for undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>http://www.alasu.edu/academics/research--centers/reu-program/index.aspx</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
