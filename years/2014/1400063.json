Within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.\r\n\r\nThe proposal centers on the theory of automorphic forms. The main goal of the proposal is to establish a quantitative refinement of the Gross-Prasad conjecture, in the special case of Whittaker functionals. The conjecture can be viewed as a far-reaching local to global principle for period integrals. The PI will also extend the  techniques developed to study the general case of Gross-Prasad conjecture.",
