 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals use myriad strategies to avoid predation -- camouflage, spines, and toxins are among a few.  Animals that are toxic, inedible, or otherwise noxious often advertise this by a warning signal, for example the yellow and black stripes of a yellowjacket or the rattle of a snake.  Bioluminescent millipedes, known only from California, are defended with cyanide and their green-blue glow is hypothesized to be a nocturnal warning signal.  In this project, the evolutionary relationships of millipedes will be analyzed, using molecular phylogenetic methods, to pinpoint the origin of bioluminescence, and the ecological circumstances under which bioluminescence evolved will be investigated. \r\n\r\nThe phylogeny will also establish a framework for a stable classification system for millipede biodiversity. The collections component of this project will provide species information posted publicly on the Tree of Life Web Project.  Educational websites will also be produced, including detailed information on decomposers as important members of the global ecosystem, as they provide functions that are essential to healthy ecosystems.",

They're a unique part of our nation's biodiversity. It's spectacular to see hundreds of them glowing in the dark in their natural habitat, and crawling beneath giant sequoia trees in Sequoia National Park. Millipedes are beneficial to us. By feeding on decaying wood, leaves, and other detritus, millipedes help break down dead vegetation thereby unlocking essential nutrients which would otherwise be tied up in organic material. When I first learned of <em>Motyxia</em>, I wondered why do they glow, and how&nbsp; did this bizarre characteristic originate? At the time, I had never seen them, so I jumped at the first opportunity to travel to their home in California. Familiar with <em>Motyxia</em>'s relatives in Appalachia that produce cyanide as a defense against predators and are brightly colored (in yellows, reds and oranges), I hypothesized that <em>Motyxia</em>'s glow deters predation (a.k.a. the \"Glow Means No!\" hypothesis). To test this hypothesis and to comprehend how bioluminescence originated, I inferred <em>Motyxia</em>'s evolution using a scientific method called molecular phylogenetics. To answer these questions, I was grateful to receive support from the NSF. These resources allowed me to pay my salary for 2 years (since my current research position was coming to an end) and hire two graduate students and a hard-working undergraduate to collaborate with me on the project. By reconstructing <em>Motyxia</em>'s evolutionary tree and it's relationship to other millipedes in its family, I established a context to track the origins of bioluminescence through millions of years of evolution, and simultaneously created an evolutionary framework to discover and name new species. The suggestion that <em>Motyxia</em>'s glow wards off marauding nocturnal predators is supported by the fact that <em>Motyxia</em> are blind, so their visual signaling can only be seen by members of other species, such as predators. My research team and I ran an experiment to test whether <em>Motyxia</em>'s coloration warns predators to stay away. Our experiment involved positioning 150 glowing clay millipede models and 150 clay non-glowing millipede models in <em>Motyxia</em>'s natural nighttime habitat in California. The results: Predators attacked a significantly lower percentage of the glowing vs. non-glowing models (18 percent vs. 49 percent.) The relatively greater ability of the glowing millipede models to repel predators supports the \"Glow Means No!\" idea. How did bioluminescence evolve? This question was the second focus of our research on <em>Motyxia</em>. By estimating the evolutionary tree, we found that there was a single evolutionary origin of bioluminescence in the ancient common ancestor of <em>Motyxia</em>. When we mapped bioluminescent intensity onto the tree, we found that glowing intensity evolved gradually from faint luminescence of low-elevation species near the California coast to the brightest luminescence of high-elevation species atop mountains in the Sierra Nevada. Associated with higher elevation habitats in California, there are more mice and rodents that are known predators of <em>Motyxia</em>, and those millipedes with brighter luminescence we found possessed more voluminous cyanide glands. Therefore, millipedes that advertise a brighter glow possess the chemical defenses to back it up, which are needed in these dangerous high-elevation habitats. So bioluminescence evolved to protect these creatures from predators in particularly vulnerable areas, and thereby enable these millipedes to expand their range to these favorable locations.
