 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population movement and social transformation are the tangible expressions of societal response to systemic stress.  Whether studying these processes at the local or global level, today or in the past, these are issues that are relevant to gaining a deeper understanding of the human condition. Just as groups with different backgrounds and histories come together today in response to particular developments or crises to form new collective social identities, so, too, did groups in the past. This project is a case study that investigates how one kind of society, small-scale farming groups, created a new collective social identity and restructured external relationships in response to cultural and environmental stress.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project directed by a research team consisting of Drs. David Pollack, Gwynn Henderson and Heather Worne, is to understand the processes by which new social identities are created.  Archaeology is particularly well positioned to address this issue, as its forte is the study of change over long periods of time. Contemporary social theoretical approaches structure the researchers' investigation into how collective social identity and external relationships change. The results of this project will provide a better understanding into how communities and regional populations reacted and responded to changing cultural and environmental conditions.  In so doing, this project will expand understanding of one of the most fundamental of all historical processes - how societies respond to change.\r\n\r\nThe late fourteenth to early fifteenth century was a period of change for Ohio Valley farmers. Downstream, Mississippian polity collapse led to widespread population dispersal. In the Valleys middle reaches, the response was much different. Here, ca. A.D. 1400, Fort Ancient farming groups chose to aggregate within large villages.  Exploring one Fort Ancient community's response to this process contributes to understanding of the factors at play in this region as a whole. In this manner, researchers can begin to understand human  perseverance during a period of change and why, throughout history, Fort Ancient people maintained a separate and distinct identity from their neighbors. \r\n\r\nEducating and training undergraduate/graduate students and avocational archaeologists is an important element of this research project. It will provide an opportunity for students to participate in all aspects of the research: field and laboratory work, analysis, report preparation, and presenting research results (to the public and to professionals). Through a field school and paid project internships or enrollment in independent study courses, University of Kentucky undergraduate/graduate students will gain vital hands-on educational experiences and training in a real research context. This is especially important for University of Kentucky undergraduate students, a population that includes individuals from rural Kentucky areas who are economically underprivileged; their participation in this research project will expose them to aspects of scientific research. The laboratory at UK's Archaeology Facility will be open for students and the interested public to participate in washing, cataloguing, and analyzing the materials recovered. Dissemination of research results to professionals will occur at conferences and through journal publications; and to the public through public-oriented publications. Professionals and the public alike will be able to follow project discoveries through the project webpage, where brief reports and short video clips will be posted.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research team used the funds for this project to better understand how indigenous Fort Ancient farming communities living in the middle Ohio Valley reacted to the changing social environment of the A.D. 1300s to 1400s.  This is one of the most fundamental of all historical processes &ndash; how societies respond to change.  This study applied concepts drawn from contemporary social theory on group identity, social transformation, and entanglement, to gain a better understanding of the social transformation and the processes of identity formation that took place within one community, which in turn, provided insights into how changes in social identity were manifest throughout the region and beyond. \n\nTo explore this period of Fort Ancient identity-making, our research team conducted four seasons of field work at Fox Farm, a large village site located in northern Kentucky.  Because of this project, Fox Farm is the best dated Fort Ancient site in the region.  What we can infer from the 39 absolute dates is that beginning around A.D. 1300, this village was occupied continuously for more than 300 years. \n\nAs a result of the analysis of the artifacts recovered from the site, in tandem with the radiocarbon dates and the association of both with the remains of houses and trash disposal areas, we now have a much better picture of village organization and how it changed through time.  We have discovered that changes in house size and village configuration occurred prior to the changes in material culture that signaled the establishment of a new social identity throughout the middle Ohio Valley.\n\nThe curation in perpetuity of the materials recovered from the site and the associated records means that a host of future researchers will have an opportunity to pursue additional research questions about Fox Farm and the village farming people who lived in the middle Ohio Valley.\n\nBeyond improving our ways of understanding of the past and revealing more details about Fox Farm?s occupational history, this project contributed to larger goals. One of those was training students in archaeological research. Fieldwork was conducted by students enrolled in the University of Kentucky?s (UK) Summer Undergraduate Field School in Archaeology.
