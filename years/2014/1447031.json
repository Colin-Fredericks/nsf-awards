Better systems engineering will improve these products and allow them to be developed faster and for less money.  To improve systems engineering, it needs to be built onto a scientific foundation.  This project will conduct a workshop bringing together the leading minds in systems engineering theory from academics and from government and plan future research that can put a scientific foundation under systems engineering.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together approximately 35 researchers from universities around the US and beyond to assess where the next steps will lie in developing theoretical underpinnings for the practice of systems engineering.  The workshop will address four areas:  System Architecting and Conceptual Design; Guidance; Models; and Measurements.  Current practice in systems engineering will be discussed, existing theoretical foundations will be noted, and the group of participants will assess needs and opportunities for deeper understanding and more rigorous practice.  Results of the workshop will be disseminated through a web site, conference presentation, and archival publication.",
