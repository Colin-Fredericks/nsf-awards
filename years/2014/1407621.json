 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the critical information needed to piece together the puzzles of modern astronomy research is carried by wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, such as the long wavelength radio waves and the very short wavelength ultraviolet.  Building instrumentation to see what the human eye cannot is essential to science.  This project aims to develop instruments sensitive to the submillimeter range of the light spectrum, shorter in wavelength than radio waves, but longer than the optical light to which the human eye is sensitive.  The investigators indeed set themselves the very ambitious goal of building a complete spectrograph, or detector system, capable of quantitatively measuring wavelength components of submillimeter radiation, on a single chip made by techniques similar to those used to make microscopic electronic integrated circuits.\r\n\r\nThe detectors used in this effort are classic, low-temperature superconductors, configured as bolometric sensors.  In particular, this investigation will make use of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) made of titanium nitride (TiN), a relatively mature material system and detector design that calls for relatively relaxed line rules.  When devices are ready, they will be deployed on an instrument taken to a telescope.  Demonstration observations will target distant dusty galaxies.  Longer term, the technology to be pioneered here will enable Integral Field Unit instrumentation featuring 2D arrays of spectrometers, a powerful tool in a broad range of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThese observations should have substantial broader impacts as a technology pathfinder in an exciting new direction in submillimeter instrumentation. The planned training of younger scientists, and the public outreach activities of the senior personnel, will help to communicate this excitement to the profession and the general public.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.",

What is a millimeter-wave spectrometer-on-a-chip? Millimeter-waves are a type of light with a wavelength of approximately one millimeter. Different wavelengths of light correspond to different colors &ndash; in the optical where our eyes are sensitive, we see light with a wavelength of 0.4 microns as blue and light with a wavelength of 0.65 microns as red. Longer wavelengths of 1 micron are not visible to the human eye and are called infrared = beyond red. Millimeter-waves are beyond infrared but not quite at the radio wavelengths of centimeters or larger.&nbsp; A spectrometer is an instrument that separates light into different colors. A prism is an example of a spectrometer that separates white light at the input into a rainbow at the output. The number of detectable shades of color or spectral bands that you can divide an input beam of white light into with a spectrometer is related to the wavelength of light times the number of colors.</p>\n<p>To study the spectral features of objects such as galaxies, we want to divide the incoming light into 100-1000 channels. For millimeter-wave light, this means that a standard spectrometer has to be between 10 cm and 1 meter in size. Also because the light from these galaxies is so faint and the energy of the millimeter-wave photons is low, we need to cool millimeter-wave instruments to very low temperatures of a few degrees above absolute zero in order to avoid being dominated by thermal emission from the instrument. Cooling a large 1 meter long metal spectrometer is difficult and expensive. Because the instrument and detectors are so cold, however, we can use superconducting electronics on a chip to make a spectrometer that is 1 or 2 centimeters on a side with several hundred channels. We have designed and built several of these chips and tested tham in laboratories at Caltech, Colorado, Chicago and ASU. The next step is to bring an instrument with several chips inside to a telescope and make measurements of the spectra of distant galaxies.</p>\n<p>Galaxies like our milky way emit light at a wide range of wavelengths. In the optical the light from galaxies is dominated by light from stars. At millimeter-wavelengths, galaxies are dominated by light from material in between the stars&nbsp; which consists of gas (mostly hydrogen with some carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) and interstellar dust which are hydrocarbons (e.g. smoke) given off by hot stars and supernovae. The dust emits light that has a smooth spectrum that depends on the temperature and total mass of dust along the line of sight. The gas emits light in narrow lines and is transparent in between these lines like our own atmosphere. With the Superspec millimeter-wave spectrometer, we can measure the smooth spectrum of the dust in distant galaxies and we can also see the narrow line emission from carbon monoxide (CO) gas in the galaxy which happens to have its line emission in the millimeter-wave band. There is not too much CO in our own atmosphere so we can see this emission from telescopes on the ground.</p>\n<p>The light from galaxies is shifted in frequency and wavelength as it travels through the universe by the expansion of space so more distant galaxies appear to have their light more &ldquo;redshifted&rdquo; to longer wavelengths. By measuring the line emission of gas in distant galaxies, we can determine their redshift and therefore their distance. This is very important for understanding the properties of galaxies at different distances which corresponds to galaxies at different epochs in their lifetimes. Ultimately, the measurements with Superspec and other spectrometers at all wavelengths is helping us to understand the evolution and distribution of galaxies in the universe.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/12/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;D&nbsp;Mauskopf</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407621/1407621_10333534_1528839550633_chip_image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407621/1407621_10333534_1528839550633_chip_image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image of superspec chip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407621/1407621_10333534_1528839550633_chip_image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image of superspec chip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is a photograph of a superspec spectrometer-on-chip fabricated at NASA JPL.
