 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering.  The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future.  This fellowship to Sharri Zamore supports research to understand neural control of aerodynamic stability in flying snakes.  The host institution is Virginia Tech, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jake Socha.  In addition to a new understanding of a unique form of animal flight, this research promises to contribute to other fields beyond biology, such as bio-inspired robotics.  The fellowship includes a teaching plan for creating a new course in neural control and dynamics and focuses on outreach, particularly via social media. This research offers an opportunity for working with students of all ages and backgrounds and has great potential far-reaching impact through new developments of educational material.  Research training objectives include mastering techniques of computational modeling, development and implementation of wireless sensors, and reconstruction and analysis of 3-D trajectories.\r\n\r\nFlying snakes (Chrysopelea sp.\u00ac) are capable of gliding despite having a cylindrical shape and no specialized appendages (such as flaps or wings), and therefore offer a unique window into understanding the mechanics of gliding flight. During glides, these snakes undulate in a complex three-dimensional pattern, which suggests that gliding stability may require integration of sensory input (such as vision and balance) and muscular output for control. This research examines responses to unexpected disturbances in vision and displacement using air gusts. How these disturbances affect glide performance enables the prediction of how stability of a gliding cylindrical body can be achieved. This research provides the first insights into the sensorimotor control mechanisms that enable stable gliding by flying snakes.",
