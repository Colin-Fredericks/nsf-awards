 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations from mobile and fixed sites of the Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) project will be used in conjunction with analytical and numerical modeling approaches to investigate the principal physical mechanisms affecting the formation, evolution, and structure of Nocturnal Low Level Jets (NLLJs) in relation to night-time convection. Data from the PECAN Integrated Sounding Arrays (PISA), each measuring kinematic and thermodynamic profiles with a suite of instruments (including radiosondes, lidars, radiometers, and radars) will be complemented by turbulence measurements conducted using coordinated scanning strategies with two mobile platforms. These integrated datasets will provide a novel, holistic picture of the spatial and temporal evolution of the NLLJ as it interacts with the developing nocturnal stable boundary layer (SBL) and mesoscale disturbances. The effects of terrain slope, thermal SBL structure, environmental stratification, and synoptic-scale forcing on the evolution of NLLJs over gently sloping terrain characteristic of the Great Plains will be investigated in detail, as well as the role of interactions between NLLJs and mesoscale atmospheric disturbances (gust fronts, gravity waves, bores, solitons) in the initiation and development of night-time convection.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ) is an atmospheric boundary-layer phenomenon that is commonly observed over the Great Plains of the United States and in many other locations worldwide. The NLLJ typically begins to develop around sunset under dry cloud-free conditions conducive to strong radiative cooling at the surface. It reaches peak intensity late in the night, and then decays with the onset of daytime convective mixing. Despite many theoretical, numerical, and observational analyses conducted to date, which make a strong case for the NLLJ arising from a force imbalance induced by the sudden release of the frictional constraint near sunset, many aspects of NLLJs structure and evolution are still not well understood. A claim perpetuated in the literature regarding a close association between the height of the NLLJ and the top of the SBL does not hold up to scrutiny: the depth of the SBL generally increases throughout the night while many observations indicate that wind maxima often descend, remain steady, or rise during the night. It is also not clear how the terrain slope angle influences the relationship between the SBL and NLLJ structures. A number of recent studies suggest that the nature of turbulence within the developing SBL as it interacts with an NLLJ should be further investigated. Open questions also remain concerning the impacts of wind-profile curvature associated with NLLJs on bore propagation, interactions of NLLJs with mesoscale disturbances, and the mechanisms by which NLLJ/bore interactions may lead to convective initiation. Our study aims at providing new knowledge about the interactions between the NLLJ, developing nocturnal SBL, propagating mesoscale disturbances, and convective initiation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nNLLJs exert significant and wide-ranging impacts on regional weather and climate by providing dynamic and thermodynamic support for the development of deep convective storms and heavy precipitation events over the Great Plains. They are efficient conveyors of moisture and lower-tropospheric air pollutants, such as ozone and fine particulates, as well as agricultural pests including fungi, spores, and insects. NLLJs also have major impact on the wind-energy industry since the enhanced winds provide a dependable source of energy, but the associated wind shear and turbulence can damage wind-turbine rotors. The downward transport of NLLJ momentum in the morning by convective turbulent mixing may produce strong and gusty surface winds that can intensify wildfires and generate dust storms. The integrated analysis of high-resolution observations and numerical model output in the proposed project will allow improving of SBL parameterizations currently employed in atmospheric models and lead to better predictions of the NLLJ and its role in the initiation of nocturnal convection. The use of state-of-the-art observational systems and advanced numerical simulations techniques will provide a superb opportunity for student training. Both graduate and undergraduate students will play important roles during field operations, in model studies, in data processing, and in scientific analyses.",
