 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent droughts in Texas, the Midwest and California have brought the increasing competition for water between agriculture, energy production, industry, human use and the environment into focus as a critical economic and sustainability issue for America. This project will assess the sustainability of water in America in the face of changing climate, new energy choices and technologies, economic and agricultural trends. It will explore how water dependent sectors affect and interact with the rest of the economy, and provide a conceptual framework to inform public and private decision making on water allocation, infrastructure development and regional investments in water intensive economic activities. Mathematical and statistical models will be developed that highlight water risks across the country, provide information on the trends of past and future water withdrawals and availability, and help identify where particular cropping patterns, energy development, and water infrastructure may result under a specific climate, economic and water allocation scenario, and how this configuration may perform during sustained periods of droughts and floods.\r\n\r\nThe project will first assess the state of water use and how the variations in climate, energy development and economics over the last century have influenced changes in water use and its valuation across the continental USA. This assessment will look at changes in climate statistics, surface water availability and quality, pricing structure, water rights and compacts, supply augmentation and storage development, access to groundwater, energy costs, economic factors, conservation initiatives, and environmental concerns in the context of changes in water use patterns. The assessment will also measure of water risk as it relates to the geographic distribution of water use and supply, and the driving economic factors. The project will then develop an interactive modeling environment for envisioning the future evolution of water use and supply. This will consider the capacity expansion of water and energy infrastructure, potential re-allocation of cropping patterns, relative to climate, energy and economic scenarios, and prescribed water rights and allocation mechanisms and ecological needs over a 50 year or longer horizon. The project will evaluate possible market and policy-driven adaptation strategies for water sustainability at a national scale to climate, economic, and energy scenarios, while considering needs for investment in new infrastructure, conservation, and potential shifts in crops and energy use that may be induced by regional water supply constraints.",

An assessment of the current status of relevant water data for such evaluations and decision making was central to the development of national scale resource allocation models that could be used to explore policy options for improving national water security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main outcomes of the project are summarized below:</p>\n<p>1) The risk of water demand exceeding renewable supply was quantified at the county level for the USA using estimate demand and supply., and risk maps were disemminated through a publication and cited in public media.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(2) New methods were developed to reconstruct 555 years of&nbsp; paleo-streamflow across the entire country for the USGS HCDN gaging network from tree rings. Extreme rainfall links in the Western United States to tree rings were also established. Eight distinct space-time patterns of drought and wet spells were identified from the 555 year record of&nbsp; the Living Blended Drought Atlas. These regional patterns are shown to persist with preferred transitions among patterns, and provide a basis for multi-year simulation to aid long lead national water planning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3) Aging infrastructure was identified as a significant water risk, that could be compounded by climate extremes. Aging dams and levees, as well as aging urban water and wastewater systems were identified as concerns. The aging urban water systems translate into increasing drinking water violations, and defensive behavior through rapid increases in bottled water sales. Financial analyses of US urban water utilities revealed that most of them had significant debt issues, leading to inability to finance improvements and higher rates that impact water affordability. Decentralized water and wastewater systems with reuse were identified as a possible economically viable strategy to renew the urban water infrastructure. A national analysis at the county level demonstrated that even with a modest amount of reuse, rooftop rainwater harvesting could be a viable primary or secondary residential and commercial water source.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(4) AWASH (<a href=\"http://awashmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/overview-1.pdf\">http://awashmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/overview-1.pdf</a>), a simulation-optimization model that can help analyze and identify superior solutions for water, energy and food allocation for the USA was developed. The national water model is set up to represent the full US river network, complete with dams, canals and other diversions, and a two layer (shallow and deep) aquifer system over the entire USA. Water, energy and food demands can be modeled at the county scale, with each county connected to the river network and to the aquifers. Each county can consider a crop mix, with limits on the area allocated to crops and to irrigation. A statistical crop model was developed to map historical USDA observed yields to climate variables. Climate scenarios from the past or the future are mapped to the streamflow network using the hydrologic model VIC, and then regional or national water supply demand strategies, with and without provision of additional surface water storage, and changes in groundwater extraction can be simulated or optimized given a criteria. The model was applied nationally to understand the value of surface storage, groundwater use, and transfers through canals, given a climate scenario.&nbsp; The model is open source and is available for others to use. A critical issue or constraint we ran into was the adequacy of data to provide a robust national scale definition of the factors that influence water risk, especially water use, and the definition of the groundwater system. A comprehensive collection of data relevant to Americas water was assembled and is available (&nbsp;<a href=\"http://awashmodel.org/2018/01/16/introducing-new-tool-for-standardizing-county-level-data/\">http://awashmodel.org/2018/01/16/introducing-new-tool-for-standardizing-county-level-data/</a>), including tools that make standardized access feasible.</p>\n<p>(5) An analysis of US groundwater response to agriculture water demand, precipitation was performed considering the depth to groundwater, to identify the sensitivity of groundwater across the USA to changes in these parameters. The statistical models developed provide a way to understand the sensitivity to climate, as well as to agricultural water use and can be used for year to two year ahead simulations, as well as scenario analyses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(6) STEM education programs on America's Water were conducted with the Bridge &amp; Golf Foundation working with under-represented minorities in New York City. A K-12 teachers summer training program was conducted with America's Water as the focus. Circle of Blue and Qlik worked with us to develop informational materials and dashboards that were circulated broadly through the media, and engaged several interns. Annual America's Water events engaged the technology and finance industry as well as utilities, sustainability and environmental organizations and policy makers.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Upmanu&nbsp;Lall</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360446/1360446_10327362_1578339703552_grl52753-fig-0002-m--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360446/1360446_10327362_1578339703552_grl52753-fig-0002-m--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"America's Water risk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360446/1360446_10327362_1578339703552_grl52753-fig-0002-m--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"America's Water risk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Magnitude of water stress considering 1949\ufffd2009 daily precipitation and 2010 water demand data across the continental USA for (a) within&#8208;year NDImax (the worst annual deficit in 61&#8201;years) and (b) multiyear cumulative deficit NDC.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL063487</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Upmanu&nbsp;Lall</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">America's Water risk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360446/1360446_10327362_1578340706999_jcli-d-18-0182.1-f2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360446/1360446_10327362_1578340706999_jcli-d-18-0182.1-f2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Space and time patterns of wet and dry spells identified from the 555 year Living Blended drought atlas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360446/1360446_10327362_1578340706999_jcli-d-18-0182.1-f2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Space and time patterns of wet and dry spells identified from the 555 year Living Blended drought atlas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mean LBDA value in each hidden state.
