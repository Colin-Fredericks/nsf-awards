 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned I/UCRC for the Sustainable Use of Greenhouse Gases intends to undertake research aimed at advancing current theory and technology, and to become a scientific focal point within the renewables and sustainability fields. Work will include (a) novel scalable plant and algae based systems and synthetic biomimicry approaches to capture and convert CO2 and CH4 into methanol, sugars, fatty acids, and oils, (b) scalable fermentation and biohybrid catalytic approaches to up-convert these into high demand, high value industrial chemicals and fuels, (c) application of these approaches to capture and convert greenhouse gases from distributed systems (e.g., the atmosphere) and concentrated systems (e.g., flu streams from coal and gas powered generators). \r\n\r\nThrough the planned center?fs addressing of industrial needs through efficient capture and up-conversion of greenhouse gases to valuable chemicals and fuels, the major threats and potential impacts of climate change may be in part ameliorated on both a sustainable and profitable basis. The planned center will develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific community on the sustainable use of greenhouse gases, including short courses, cross?]departmental and cross?]university graduate course offerings, and internships with member organizations. The Center will recruit and train underrepresented groups (minorities, women, and students with disabilities) through various existing programs on campus as well as new programs. \r\n",
