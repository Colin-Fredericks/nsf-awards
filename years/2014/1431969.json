As well, because of the diversity of the communities involved, the consortium will allow students to make connections beyond their own disciplines.  Both faculty and students are diverse on several dimensions, notably research topics, methodological approaches, and cultural background.  As a result, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future inter-disciplinary research.   This event has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding OCIS researchers, in the past.  It provides feedback to students in order to develop higher quality and more relevant research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.",
