 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stars many times more massive than our Sun are rare, but they are responsible for producing nearly all of the heavier elements found in nature.  Through dramatic supernova explosions, they produce and shed this material throughout the galaxy, mixing it with material out of which the next generation of stars, and planets, are formed.  One interesting class of stars, known as Be stars, rotate so rapidly that they somehow shed material that then forms in a disk around their equators.  In order to better understand how these disks are formed and why they occasionally seem to disappear, researchers at the University of Oklahoma, Lowell Observatory, and the University of Toledo have formed a team to carry out an intensive study of these systems.  They will use an array of ground-based telescopes to observe these events, and they are developing sophisticated computer codes to aid the interpretation of these observations.  This program will support graduate students at the University of Oklahoma and at the University of Toledo, as well as undergraduate students at all three institutions.  They will develop research-based planetarium shows that satisfy state education standards. Undergraduates will be trained to develop content and conduct outreach and to take these shows on the road to K-12 students using a portable planetarium and a digital projector.  These shows will be freely released for use in other settings.\r\n\r\nThis program will determine the timescales, relative prevalence, and physical mechanisms of disk-loss and disk rebuilding episodes of classical Be stars. These goals will be accomplished by carrying out a statistical assessment of the prevalence of disk-loss/renewal episodes of populations of Be stars in open clusters, as well as intensive multi wavelength studies of individual Be stars actively experiencing disk-loss/renewal episodes. Predictions of state-of-the-art radiation transfer and hydrodynamical modeling codes will be compared against the data obtained in this program, to test a range of scenarios that have been proposed to explain how circumstellar disks may be created and destroyed during the lifetime of the host star.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLarge amounts of dust and gas in a flattened structure around a newly-formed star are known as circumstellar disks.  These disks are common when stars are young, and provide the material and location for planets to form.  Planet formation and other processes deplete these disks quickly, though, so stars spend most of their lives without a circumstellar disk.  \nCircumstellar disks can return later in a star's life, however, and can play an important role in a star's eventual death.  For stars in binary systems, material from an expanding, dying companion often collects into a circumstellar disk around the less-evolved star.  Accretion from such a disk can then cause the non-expanding member to become unstable, causing a supernova.\nAstronomers have a weaker understanding of the processes that allow a single star to generate a new circumstellar disk at a mature evolutionary stage.  Astronomers have identified stars that regenerated their circumstellar disks later in life, sometimes multiple times.  Known as Classical Be stars, these stars are much more massive than our Sun, and rotate very rapidly.  Centrifugal forces from this rotation likely play a key role in the disk regeneration process, allowing winds to more easily blow material out of the star's outer layers, and then settle into a circumstellar disk.\nThe goal of this research was to conduct a multi-year observing program targeting Classical Be stars in nearby open clusters.  In addition to measuring the broadband colors of these stars, the investigators obtained polarization measurements, which capture the signature of the last interaction between the light and charged particles, known as free electrons, in the disk.  Combining these measurements provides useful diagnostics of the geometry and density distributions of each disk; monitoring these observables repeatedly then provides insights into the evolution of the disks over time, and the processes by which they regenerate and slowly deplete once again. \nThe observing team, led by observers from Lowell Observatory, conducted 17 week-long observing runs, spanning a total of 119 nights between January 2015 and November 2018.  Observations were conducted with the PRISM imaging polarimeter on the Perkins 1.8m telescope at Lowell Observatory's Anderson Mesa Site, and analyzed by graduate students from the University of Oklahoma and an undergraduate student from Western Washington University.  \nResults from the project include a dedicated data analysis pipeline, which allows the alignment and calibration of imaging polarization data from the PRISM instrument; improved constraints on the interstellar polarization along the line of sight to each target open cluster; and time-resolved disk geometry and density parameters for the Be star disks.
