 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PI team is working on two complementary fronts to increase the adoption of a new randomization-based curricula for introductory statistics that emphasizes: i) the core logic of inference using randomization-based methods alongside an intuitive, cyclical, active-learning pedagogy, and ii) the overall process of statistical investigations, from asking questions and collecting data through making inferences and drawing conclusions. The first front involves: a) conducting a series of twelve 1-4 day professional development workshops, and b) developing and supporting an online learning community to provide on-going support beyond the workshops. An important aspect of the intellectual merit of the project lies in the second front which involves the evaluation of widespread transferability of the model curriculum and research to deepen understanding of students' attitudes, conceptual understanding, and learning trajectories within the curriculum. Together with the workshop participants, developers, and other faculty, the team is gathering a large and diverse set of attitudinal and conceptual assessment data from over 3000 students at a variety of institutions. In-depth qualitative and quantitative assessments of students' developmental learning trajectories on key concepts are being carried out. The project is exercising broader impacts not only through its planned workshops, but also through coordination of its efforts through the Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE), which serves as the primary hub of activity for transformational efforts in statistics education.",

There is evidence that these changes are directly leading to positive changes in students learning of statistics and inferential thinking.\n\nAn external evaluator on the project had the following conclusions. \"This project has far exceeded accomplishing what was stated in the original proposal.  The project team has\n\ndelivered more workshops to more instructors, \ncollected more student-level data, \nincluded more undergraduates in researching the effectiveness of the curriculum, \ngiven more presentations and submitted more peer-reviewed papers about the project and its research results, \ndelivered more tangible outcomes for their research-based curriculum including two textbooks and 300 learning objective videos along with videos to help teachers know how to teach the material, and recorded webinars of some of their presentations\n\n\nTheir research has provided important information about student learning in introductory statistics and their workshops have enabled teachers to have a strong foundation on which to make a change in instructional practice.  As is seen by the follow-up survey, introductory statistics instructors are changing the way they teach to an instructional approach which has been shown in this project?s research to provide slightly higher average student achievement gains across all concept inventory topics and is also effective at improving students? conceptual understanding of statistical ideas regardless of student?s prior preparation.  Furthermore, since the change is in the teacher?s instructional method, the results of this project are going to continue to make more of an impact as the teachers become even more familiar with the instructional method and the simulation-based inference content.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan Tintle"
