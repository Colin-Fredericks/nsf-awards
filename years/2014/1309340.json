The research is divided into the following main parts: (1) Finding new examples of CAT[0] spaces, related to isometric actions on Euclidean space, (2) Collapsing and convergence of Riemannian manifolds, and (3) Pure Alexandrov geometry.\r\n\r\nAlexandrov geometry studies metric spaces from an axiomatic point of view, which is similar to the approach given in Euclid's Elements. This theory has applications in many branches of modern geometry. In addition to to the pure research, the principal investigator proposes to continue his work with co-authors on a book which is intended to be a comprehensive text and reference in this area of geometry; he also has two other smaller projects oriented to geometric education.",
