 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southeast Indian ridge is a mid-ocean spreading center that lies between Australia and Antarctica.  Due to its location, it is one of the least sampled and studied parts of the ocean floor.  It is also where French oceanographic cruises have recently sampled a large number of closely-spaced mid-ocean ridge spreading center lavas in an effort to examine geochemical heterogeneity of the mantle on a fine scale.  This research teams US scientists from San Diego State University and Oregon State University with scientists from two major French academic oceanographic institutions to carry out a comprehensive geochemical study of these lavas to help understand the crust below the Indian Ocean and how it is affected by the transfer of mantle material.  Research goals are to examine the validity of a risky, new hypothesis, based on statistical analysis and theory, which proposes that mantle heterogeneity is bimodal in character and represented by streak-like chemical differences that can help us understand mantle convection and the chemical differentiation of the Earth.  The US component of the work involves the analysis of radiogenic isotopes (Pb, Nd, Sr, and Hf) and trace element geochemical analyses of Southeast Indian Ridge basalt glasses.  These data will be used to determine whether the streak-like Pb and Hf isotopes beneath the Southeast Indian Ridge propagate across the area, (2) investigate whether mid-ocen ridge basalt lava isotopic heterogeneity is different in the vicinity of active hotspot areas compared with those that are far from hotspots, and (3) investigate how isotopic heterogeneity relates to changes in mantle source lithology and partial melting conditions. Broader impacts of the proposal are good and involve strong international collaboration with scientists at two major French oceanographic academic institutions.  The project will also help support an NSF-funded, open, isotope facility at San Diego State University and will develop, in conjunction with French colleagues, improved volcanic glass dissolution procedures, thereby building infrastructure for science. Additional impacts include undergraduate training and incorporation of research results into college student coursework.",

In earlier work using lead and hafnium isotopes from lavas erupted along the ridge farther to the west (88&deg;-111&deg;E longitude), it was discovered that the underlying mantle has a streak-like character that relates either to ancient geochemical differentiation of the Earth or to tectonic recycling of crustal and lithospheric materials. A major goal was to determine if the streaks persist further west into the ASP Plateau region. The question of the streaks persistence and their relationship to the mantle melting process are key to understanding whether they are derived from continental material incorporated into the mantle during tectonic breakup of the proto-Indian Ocean, or to recent upwelling and dispersion of the ASP mantle plume.</p>\n<p>The work at OSU involved measuring the trace element compositions for the same lavas being analyzed at SDSU for hafnium and lead isotopes. Trace elements were analyzed by laser ablation ICP-MS in 99 different lava types from the region, within a suite of 126 different lavas that can be distinguished using major element analyses carried out by electron probe microanalysis at OSU. Funding supported the development of effective ICP-MS trace element procedures to analyze subsets of key trace elements (alkalis and alkaline earths, high-field strength elements, rare earths, nickel and chromium).</p>\n<p>The crystallization of olivine &plusmn; plagioclase &plusmn; clinopyroxene at varying pressure as melts ascend through the mantle explains much of the variation in trace elements in this region. Lavas atop the ASP plateau have experienced more crystal fractionation than those more distant from the plateau, and as a consequence they are also more enriched in highly incompatible trace elements that are not accomodated into crystallizing minerals. These incompatible elements, such as K, Ti, Rb, Nb and La are also strongly affected by mixing between the enriched mantle plume and the ambient upper mantle in this region.</p>\n<p>The ambient mantle appears to contain both chemically depleted and enriched components, possibly due to the presence of enriched streaks that are present as minor amounts of pyroxenite embedded within depleted peridotite. Notably, a large degree of incompatible element enrichment occurs northwest of the ASP plateau, along segment H (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). This enrichment occurs in lavas that are relatively primitive and have not experienced significant amounts of crystallization. This enrichment is caused by lateral flow of material derived from the ASP mantle plume, for ~100 km, into the subridge mantle beneath segment H. Both the extent and depth of melting vary along the ridge segments of the study region, as revealed by the Tb/Yb ratio (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>) and by variations in the rare-earth element (REE) contents of the lavas (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). The steeper middle-to-heavy REE slopes for lavas atop the plateau (segments I1-I2 and J1-J2) are due to deeper melting and the influence of residual garnet in the mantle beneath those segments. This increased depth and extent of melting is ultimately caused by elevated mantle temperature beneath the plateau compared to the surrounding area. Segment H shows the largest diversity of REE patterns of all the segments studied, consistent with a large variability in its mantle source composition caused by mixing of plume and ambeint mantle; further evidence of this mixing comes from the spatial variability of helium isotopes meaured previously (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).</p>\n<p>A major goal in Marine Geology is to understand the connection between tectonic history/geodynamics and geochemical variability during the development of ocean basins. This requires characterizing the length scales of chemical heterogeneity in basalts erupted along spreading ocean ridges, in order to understand the variations in melting in the underlying mantle. To date, only a few studies have attempted to quantify the relationship between mantle heterogeneity and partial melting at the sampling density used in this project. The data obtained in this study are fundamental to understanding the production of young ocean crust along spreading ridges.</p>\n<p>The project supported the principal investigator, David Graham, to refine the analytical capabilities of the laser ablation ICP-MS system at OSU for routine analysis of basalt glasses that have low trace element concentrations. Analytical results from this project have become part of a graduate level class at OSU on Igneous and Tectonic Processes in the Ocean Basins. In this class the students gain hands-on experience with seafloor maps of the Amsterdam-St. Paul ridge segments, and they plot geochemical data that they interpret in a spatial context as well as using element-element co-variation diagrams.
