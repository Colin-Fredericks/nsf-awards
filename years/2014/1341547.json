 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of study is to understand how climate-related changes in snow and ice affect predator populations in the Antarctic, using the Ad\u00e9lie penguin as a focal species due to its long history as a Southern Ocean 'sentinel' species and the number of long-term research programs monitoring its abundance, distribution, and breeding biology.  Understanding the environmental factors that control predator population dynamics is critically important for projecting the state of populations under future climate change scenarios, and for designing better conservation strategies for the Antarctic ecosystem. For the first time, datasets from a network of observational sites for the Ad\u00e9lie penguin across the entire Antarctic will be combined and analyzed, with a focus on linkages among the ice environment, primary production, and the population responses of Ad\u00e9lie penguins. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. The results of this project can be used to illustrate intuitively to the general public the complex interactions between ice, ocean, pelagic food web and top predators. This project also offers an excellent platform to demonstrate the process of climate-change science - how scientists simulate climate change scenarios and interpret model results. This project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of polar oceanography, plankton and seabird ecology, coupled physical-biological modeling and mathematical ecology. The results will be broadly disseminated to the general oceanographic research community through scientific workshops, conferences and peer-reviewed journal articles, and to undergraduate and graduate education communities, K-12 schools and organizations, and the interested public through web-based servers using existing infrastructure at the investigators' institutions. \r\n\r\nThe key question to be addressed in this project is how climate impacts the timing of periodic biological events (phenology) and how interannual variation in this periodic forcing influences the abundance of penguins in the Antarctic. The focus will be on the timing of ice algae and phytoplankton blooms because the high seasonality of sea ice and associated pulsed primary productivity are major drivers of the Antarctic food web. This study will also examine the responses of Ad\u00e9lie penguins to changes in sea ice dynamics and ice algae-phytoplankton phenology. Ad\u00e9lie penguins, like many other Antarctic seabirds, are long-lived, upper trophic-level predators that integrate the effects of sea ice on the food web at regional scales, and thus serve as a reliable biological indicator of environmental changes. The proposed approach is designed to accommodate the limits of measuring and modeling the intermediate trophic levels between phytoplankton and penguins (e.g., zooplankton and fish) at the pan-Antarctic scale, which are important but latent variables in the Southern Ocean food web.  Through the use of remotely sensed and in situ data, along with state of the art statistical approaches (e.g. wavelet analysis) and numerical modeling, this highly interdisciplinary study will advance our understanding of polar ecosystems and improve the projection of future climate change scenarios.",

In particular, impacts of sea ice changes and phytoplankton blooms on the phenology, reproductive performance and population abundance of the Adelie penguin, the emperor penguin, the southern fulmar, the cape petrel, the snow petrel and the south polar skua were investigated. these species showed some consistencies in their breeding success, growth rate and/or breeding phenology, though differences were also observed that may reflect importance of other factors such as prey availability or seasonality of environmental conditions. We produced a new data set that classifies the Antarctic sea ice into marginal ice zone, pack ice and polynyas, as each bird has different foraging characteristics, for which the sea ice plays an important role. This data set will be useful to others outside the ecological community as well. Overall, sea ice changes were found to account for 1/3rd of the total variability in bird population. However, the lack of a stronger relationship highlights the complexity of ecosystems, and the difficulties in finding effective proxies of ecological dynamics, particularly in the face of global climate change. Interestingly, populations of several of the bird species are increasing, the exceptions being the cape petrel, the southern fulmar and the snow petrel. At the same time, breeding success is decreasing overall for all bird species evaluated, though the decline is not statistically significant. This suggests that population increases may be closely tied to factors occurring during winter, or are not strongly related to summer enviromental conditions and breeding success.
