 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, 66 million years ago, marks the last great extinction event in Earth's  history.  Among the most notable casualties were the ammonites, shelled cephalopods related to squids and octopus. Having worked on this group for more than 30 years, Dr. Landman will synthesize data on cephalopod diversity and abundance at the end of the Cretaceous just prior to their extinction. He will compare these data to similar data on nautilids, a closely related group of externally shelled cephalopods that survived the extinction event and live in today?s oceans. This research will develop a global picture of the \"health\" of the ammonites and nautilids at a critical time in Earth history and investigate hypotheses on why the ammonites went extinct while the nautilids did not. \r\n\r\nThe processes of evolution, including extinction, have led to the diverse biosphere we see today. Investigating why some lineages go extinct while others survive will help us prepare for the threats to modern-day biodiversity.  Extinction is a concept that captures the interest of the public. The American Museum of Natural History, which receives over five million visitors a year, including 500,000 children on field trips, is well positioned to educate the public. The principal investigator will collaborate with educational professionals to feature the results of this synthesis through the Museum's award-winning Science Bulletin program. He will introduce high school teachers to the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and the associated extinctions, and the teachers will, in turn, include this topic in their Earth History classes.",

However, not all organisms became extinct and it is instructive to examine the differential fates of closely related groups of organisms, one which survived and one which became extinct. Drawing on over 35 years of research, we examined two closely related groups of externally shelled cephalopods, the nautilids, which survived the impact, and are still present on the planet, and the ammonites, which became extinct. At the time, an observer would have predicted the opposite outcome. The ammonites were morphologically more complex with a higher taxonomic diversity whereas the nautilids were morphologically simpler with a lower diversity. We explored a number of factors that may have produced this outcome, including the geographic ranges of the component genera. Surprisingly, both nautilid and ammonite genera exhibited an equally broad distribution at the time. Rather, the deciding factor seems to have been related to differences in the early life history of the two groups. Ammonites hatched at a very small size&mdash;the shell was approximately 1 mm in diameter&mdash;and spent some time in the plankton. Nautilids, on the other hand, hatched at a much larger size&mdash;the shell was approximately 15 mm in diameter&mdash;and immediately assumed a mode of life near the bottom. One hypothesis is that following the asteroid impact, the oceans experienced an ephemeral episode of surface water acidification. If this is true, the ammonites may have shared the same fate as many other calcareous plankton, including many planktic foraminifera, whereas the nautilids may have escaped this outcome because they hatched and lived closer to the bottom. It seems at times of large environmental disturbances such as the asteroid impact at the K/Pg, winners and losers are not always easy to predict.
