 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specialization for life underground has evolved multiple times in mammals as a strategy for foraging, avoiding predators, storing food and nesting; however, researchers know very little about burrowing behaviors because it is difficult to visualize animals as they move through soil. This project focuses on burrowing behavior in Eastern moles because they are specialized diggers that have evolved extreme morphological specializations for powerful burrowing and exhibit two different burrowing behaviors in response to the type of soil they encounter. This study will investigate how and why Eastern moles change their burrowing behavior in response to soils of different compactness. This work will connect morphological specializations for burrowing to burrowing performance, and set the stage for broader investigations of the convergent evolution of burrowing in other species of moles and other mammals. In addition, this research will promote education by providing animations of burrowing useful in teaching evolution and comparative anatomy at all academic levels, benefit the general public by providing crucial kinematic data for improving the design of mole-inspired robots that are used in urban search and rescue,  engage the public by recruiting local community members to help identify mole habitats, and lastly, will support the researchers continued participation in the Science Cafe program, which hosts accessible scientific talks for the public that spotlight local scientists. \r\n\r\nIn this study, the researchers intend to extend upon preliminary data by asking how burrowing behavior changes in response to soils that differ in compactness and how changes in behavior balance the trade-off between force, speed and the trajectory of force used to displace soils. The researchers hypothesize that lateral stroke and scraping movements involve different joints and are used with different frequencies and that lateral strokes are more efficient in displacing loose soil while scraping movements are most efficient in displacing compact soil. Bi-planar x-ray video and force plates will be used to visualize and quantify how Eastern moles change the movements of their limbs in order to meet the challenges of moving through soft and compact substrates. Force and video data will be made available to the public through Dryad.org and the XMA portal (http://xmaportal.org/webportal/), respectively.",

Differences in performance between the two species may be associated with differences in the structure and extent of their burrow systems or the morphology of their forelimbs.

These findings highlight the importance of behavioral flexibility on measures of long-term burrowing performance, and the potential mechanisms underlying resource partitioning between these two fossorial species that live in the same areas.</p>\n<p>To answer question 2, we used XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) to investigate how Eastern moles, the most specialized burrower among North American moles, move their forelimbs while burrowing in loose and compact substrates.</p>\n<p>We found that moles move substrate upward using elevating strokes in loose substrates and to the side using scratching strokes in compact substrates. They do not move the substrate behind them like most mammalian forelimb diggers. Both elevating and scratching strokes are characterized by similar movements of the humerus but the movements of the elbow and wrist differ. Eastern moles extend the elbow and flex the wrist during elevating strokes to compress soil into the tunnel wall. During scratching strokes they bring the elbow and wrist toward the body and turn their palms downward to sweep soil to the side before transporting it to the surface. Our results demonstrate that the combination of stereotypic movements of the shoulder joint, where the largest digging muscles are located, and flexibility in elbow and wrist joints makes moles extremely effective diggers in both loose and compact substrates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To investigate question 3, we tested two hypotheses about walking: 1) moles move their shoulders by rotating the upper arm along its long axis, and 2) moles move their shoulders by moving the upper arm forward and backward in the horizontal plane, similar to sprawling reptiles.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, our results reject both hypotheses and indicate that the way moles walk is different from that of all tetrapods that have been studied. Like sprawling reptiles and most terrestrial mammals, the mole shoulder joint flexes and extends during walking, but it happens above rather than in or below the horizontal plane. They also appear to use a sesamoid bone on the thumb-side of the palm (also known as the sixth digit or false thumb) to support their body weight when the palm contacts the ground. When moles walk, the sixth digit and thumb are always in front of the shoulder and elbow joints. This form of gait appears to be unique among tetrapods, in which the hoof, pad or palm is far behind the shoulder when it is lifted off the ground. This study increases our understanding of the breadth of tetrapod limb posture and locomotion, highlights the need to examine the influences of joint morphologies on joint mobility, and demonstrates the importance of advanced x-ray techniques in revealing movements that are hidden by soft tissues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In sum, this project reveals that moles are able to burrow effectively in both loose and compact soil by changing their burrowing behaviors and kinematics. The forelimb morphological specializations for burrowing and walking render them among the most accomplished fossorial tetrapods. The results of this project opens new horizons in the study of morphological, physiological, behavioral and ecological evolution of fossoriality, and may provide new ideas for the design of bio-inspired robots used for urban search and rescue.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;Dumont</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1407171/1407171_10325930_1509031938186_coverimage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1407171/1407171_10325930_1509031938186_coverimage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eastern and Hairy-tailed moles\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1407171/1407171_10325930_1509031938186_coverimage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eastern and Hairy-tailed moles\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two sympatric moles that are easily found in New England area.
