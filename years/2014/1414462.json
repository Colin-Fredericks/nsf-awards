 "awd_abstract_narration": "A quantum system can feature unusual phenomena such as quantum entanglement. This exotic aspect of quantum mechanics can be exploited to solve or model computational problems that are impractical or impossible to solve with standard, classical computers.   This work will investigate the quantum behaviors of an otherwise classical mechanical oscillator, such as a diamond cantilever or a diamond nanobeam.  The motion of the mechanical oscillator will be controlled through its interactions with an electron in diamond.  These types of nano-mechanical systems have the potential to realize the exotic behavior of quantum entanglement and become a building block in a diamond-chip based quantum computer.  This project will also make contributions to education and human resource by providing excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the coupling between an electron spin in diamond and the mechanical motion of a diamond nanomechanical oscillator.  The spin-phonon coupling will be mediated through off-resonant Raman transitions to the excited states of a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond.  Experimental efforts will focus on the fabrication of diamond nanomechanical oscillators, the generation of spin-driven coherent mechanical motion, and the cooling of the nanomechanical oscillator through its coupling to a single electron spin.  The successful implementation of these efforts should enable us to pursue mechanically-mediated quantum entanglement between electron spins.  The Sorensen-Molmer entanglement scheme, which is relatively robust against thermal mechanical motion, will be explored for the generation of a maximally-entangled spin state.  The longer term goal is to realize a solid-state analog of the trapped ion system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA quantum system can feature unusual phenomena such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement.  This exotic aspect of quantum mechanics can be exploited to solve computational problems that are impractical or impossible to solve with conventional, classical computers.  The elementary units for quantum information processing are two-level quantum systems, which serve as quantum bits or simply qubits.  Electron spins of color centers, such as nitrogen vacancy centers, in diamond have recently emerged as promising qubits.  These spin qubits are of special interest because of their robustness against environmental noise and also because of the ease with which these qubits can be measured and controlled.  An important next step in exploiting these qubits for quantum computing is to demonstrate experimental approaches that can precisely control the interactions between individual spin qubits. \n\nThe experimental program at the University of Oregon develops the basic physical principle and technology for using vibrations or acoustic waves in a mechanical resonator to mediate interactions between two spin qubits in diamond.  Compared with electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves propagate with a speed, which is five orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light.  Furthermore, acoustic waves cannot propagate in vacuum.  As such, these waves can be conveniently confined and guided in a solid-state medium.  Mechanics-based platforms can thus feature distinct advantages over photonics-based platforms in on-chip interactions or communications between qubits.    \n\nRobust spin qubits necessarily mean weak coupling between ground (lower energy) spin states and acoustic waves since the coupling can lead to spin decoherence, i.e. degradation of the spin qubits. On the other hand, excited (higher energy) states of nitrogen vacancy centers can couple strongly to acoustic waves via the strain induced by the mechanical vibrations. These excited states, however, decay quickly to the lower energy states and therefore are not suitable for use as qubits.\n\nThis research program has developed an experimental approach that successfully overcomes this dilemma.   A key aspect of this approach is to couple mechanical vibrations to a nitrogen vacancy spin qubit through higher-energy excited states, but without populating these states, thus avoiding the decay of the excited states.  This is achieved by trapping the electrons in the ground spin states through effects of quantum interference.  These studies indicate that we can take advantage of the strong excited-state electron-phonon interaction to mediate and control the coupling between spin and mechanical degrees of freedom. \n\nDiamond nanomechanical resonators, which are thin rectangular plates featuring compressional mechanical vibrations around 1 GHz, have also been designed and fabricated in this program.  These resonators are embedded in a two-dimensional square lattice, which isolates and protects the mechanical resonators from their surrounding environment, effectively eliminating the clamping loss of the resonators.  These highly-isolated mechanical resonators provide a new experimental platform for the pursuit of well-controlled and mechanically-mediated interactions between spin qubits.\n\nThis research program has also made important contributions to education and human resource by providing training for graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance. Two graduate students supported by this program have obtained their physics PhD degrees.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hailin Wang"
