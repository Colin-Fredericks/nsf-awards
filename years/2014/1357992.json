It is hard to overstate the importance of electric power generation and distribution to modern societies, and it is clear that growing power demands must be met within the constraints of limited resources and with reduced environmental impact. Water is a key national resource, and the water used in thermal-electric power plants represents 40% of the total annual draw from fresh-water supplies in the United States.  Almost all of this water is used for cooling steam after it passes through the steam-turbine generators in the power plant-this approach usually uses a cooling tower. An approach that cools the steam without using water in a cooling tower exists; it relies on so-called \"Air-Cooled Condensers.\"  Unfortunately, this technology increases the cost of the power plant by up to five times, compared to a cooling-tower system. The cost of electricity would rise sharply, were power plants required to use current technology to save the cooling water. A new approach is needed to save water and hold down the price of electricity, and this project is aimed at providing the needed breakthrough. \r\n\r\nThe main idea is to use small wing-like structures (called vortex generators) on a heat exchanger where steam is cooled by air. The vortex generators create a strong swirling flow in the air used to cool the steam. Through this project the potential of vortex generators to enhance the performance of air-cooled condensers will be evaluated, and the fundamental knowledge needed to use them effectively will be acquired. This new knowledge will lead to a new technology, an electric power generation system which provides reliable, inexpensive electricity and eliminates the need for drawing precious fresh water from our limited supplies to do so.",
