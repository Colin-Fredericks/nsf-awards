 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the ways in which individuals and communities come to understand illness and how their explanations impact their health behavior and health care choices.  It contributes to current sociological research which explores how laypeople get involved in and change the course of scientific research and policy.  There is growing statistical evidence that Somali refugee populations have higher prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder than all other ethnic/racial groups. This project examines the ways that groups of Somali parents of children with autism in two national contexts (Minneapolis, MN and Toronto, Canada) have forged movements to understand and address their health experiences.  Groups in each location have developed divergent approaches to treatment and vaccine uptake.  This is the first study to examine the ways in which minority groups make sense of their experiences with autism.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the investigator develops the concept of \"epistemic communities\" through a cross-national comparison, which has both theoretical and practical implications.  This project has four specific aims: 1) to describe and explain the causal theories parents have about the development of autism; 2) to describe the health experiences of parents of children with autism (from the discovery of the disorder, through securing diagnosis, accessing benefits and resources, and seeking treatment) in Toronto and Minneapolis; 3) to explain when/if parents get involved in or forge a health social movement; and 4) to examine the causal links between these three previous dynamics.  The PI will accomplish these aims through two years of qualitative research of Somali families in Minneapolis and Toronto.  This research into the formation of epistemic communities on autism has profound implications for understanding health behavior and the interaction of laypeople with scientific expertise.  Such information could lead to better and more accurate policy initiatives on health care and support for those with autism, not to mention better information on vaccine skepticism and refusal. Further, racial minorities have been underrepresented in the research on autism, and this project seeks to address this bias.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere is some statistical evidence indicating that Somali refugees and immigrants in Western countries have high rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Somalis in North America call autism the \"Western disease\" because there is no word for autism in the Somali language and because many believe it does not exist in Somalia.  For Somalis, autism is a new, mysterious illness to which they are uniquely vulnerable, especially in its more severe manifestations.  Drawing on three years of ethnographic and qualitative research in Minneapolis and Toronto (the sites of the highest concentration of Somali immigrants in the US and Canada), this project examines how Somalis make sense of the risks associated with autism, how their illness narratives impact their health ideologies and behavior, and how Somalis navigate barriers to resources for their children. I found that most Somalis explain their vulnerability to autism via environmental factors associated with living in North America, as opposed to diagnostic expansion, better reporting, or genetic factors (which are the most common scientific explanations for the expansion of autism diagnoses since the 1990s). Somalis are forging \"epistemic communities,\" united around coherent theories of the etiology of autism, its defining features, and the most promising therapies.  These epistemic communities are the basis for forging health social movements that directly challenge mainstream scientific definitions of autism.   \n\nCertain features of the Somali autism experience hold constant across the two national contexts of the US and Canada, based on Somalis? shared experiences of immigration and racial marginalization.  Somalis in both locations share beliefs about the causes of autism and approaches to treatment; their children experience more severe forms of autism due to lack of access to resources; they both face isolation and discrimination; they have formed support groups and political organizations; and they have teamed up with researchers to forge lay-expert collaborations. Yet, due to the divergent structural features of the health systems, racial formations, refugee policies, public health communities, and histories of autism mobilization, the epistemic communities in Toronto and Minneapolis differ in scope, content and impact.  The existing literature focusing on health social movements fails to take into account how peoples? \"politicized collective illness identities\" may be informed by divergent structural dynamics that impinge upon their success and trajectory. \n\nThis project centers the experiences of Somali immigrants, as a site to interrogate autism advocacy, research and politics.  This is the first project about autism in North America to explore the racial, class and national implications of autism etiology and politics.  Just as feminists and race scholars have challenged sociological epistemology, suggesting that the silencing of particular marginalized standpoints has delimited the discipline?s scope and viability, postcolonial scholarship suggests that centering sociological analysis within the global periphery and diaspora forces a reconsideration of core disciplinary epistemologies and methodologies.  This project offers a postcolonial reading of autism by centering diasporic experiences of illness as sites of knowledge production. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Claire Decoteau"
