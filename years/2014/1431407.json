 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of current efforts to improve life science education is to provide opportunities for students to engage in original research and to strengthen the analytical habits of mind that come with developing scientific questions and seeking evidence to resolve them.  The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) was founded to engage undergraduates in a genomics research project. While the technology is new, the basic concept is students learn by doing, and student excitement is generated when learners make novel contributions to the knowledge base. During the past 8 years over 100 faculty have partnered with members of the Biology Department, Computer Science Department, and The Genome Institute at Washington University (WU) to bring a bioinformatics research experience into the curriculum at their schools.  This project capitalizes on the diversity of partners and curricular approaches in the GEP and will identify best practices for bioinformatics-based Classroom Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). The project will also develop, test and disseminate a curriculum aimed toward the recruitment and retention of beginning students.\r\n\r\nThe GEP provides undergraduates with an opportunity to participate in a large-scale genomics research project, currently on the structure and function of the dot chromosome of Drosophila. Students engage in sequence improvement and annotation of the dot chromosomes from different species, characterizing the genes and deciphering the evolution of the chromosome. The goals of this project are to (1) identify and test strategies to maximize the effectiveness of a bioinformatics-based CURE, in the process generating a better understanding of how research experiences impact student learning and self-identification as a scientist, and (2) develop a modified version of the CURE curriculum and engagement strategy to make bioinformatics-based genome research more accessible to beginning college/university students. Results will be assessed using a mix of student quizzes, surveys, interviews, focus groups, and measures of persistence coupled with analysis of faculty journals, surveys, interviews, and focused discussions. Lessons learned should contribute to foundational knowledge on how to help our students to acquire the intellectual habits and self-confidence that lead to success in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) is a group with more than 100 college/university faculty working together to provide their students with a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in genomics. Collectively, we are using comparative genomics to study the evolution of the Muller F element of Drosophila, a generally heterochromatic domain containing ~80 genes.  Students are engaged in the analysis of multiple Drosophila species that are at the ideal evolutionary distances for addressing a particular question, currently motif hunting. Their efforts include improving underlying DNA sequence, creating supported gene models, and identifying the putative Transcription Start Sites for F element genes.  This is a challenging problem, requiring students to analyze several lines of evidence to construct the gene model that is best supported by the available data.  Student results are pooled and used in a meta-analysis to determine the common characteristics of the F element genes, and follow their evolution in this unusual (heterochromatic) environment.  In addition to generating publishable work, at the end of the semester the students demonstrate increased understanding of eukaryotic genes and genomes (shown by pre/post quizzes), and report increased understanding of how scientific work is done [responses to the Survey of Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE)].\n\nIntellectual merit: We sought to determine the most effective way to implement this CURE by correlating student outcomes with the teaching materials and strategies used by the individual faculty members. Ninety-eight faculty members reported on their CURE implementation, including the amount of class time devoted to the GEP project; most provided weekly log entries noting the active learning strategies used each week. Of ~3,300 students eligible, 2,037 participated in at least one assessment, and ~700 students provided full data sets (i.e. pre/post quizzes and pre/post surveys).  We find that the more time the faculty devote to the GEP project, the greater the student gains, both in knowledge of genes/genomes and in understanding of how science is done.  Combinations of active learning strategies were related to successful learning outcomes; however, no particular active learning strategies stood out as independently effective.  Repeated reminders that the class was engaged in research had a small positive effect, but again no single strategy for conveying that message stands out.  We see significant increases in quiz scores for all groups ? men, women, all ethnic groups (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian), Pell-eligible students, first-generation students.  Students with a positive attitude toward science (expressed on the surveys) showed modestly higher gains.  We infer that all groups of students can benefit from the active learning inherent in a research experience, and that faculty should feel free to choose among active learning strategies, as no single strategy stood out. A larger sample size appears to be needed to further parse the results.\n\nAnalyzing student comments (from the post-course survey and from focus groups), the GEP  faculty noted that students often described experiencing failure and frustration, but ultimate success in constructing gene models, leading to an increased appreciation of genome organization and/or of the scientific process.  Faculty reported (in an anonymous survey) that they observed that setbacks, particularly cases where the gene models have atypical characteristics (e.g., non-canonical splice sites), contributed to the learning process, especially if a good resolution could ultimately be achieved.  However, it was clear from the focus group discussions that a supportive atmosphere was essential for this to occur (i.e. having opportunities for discussion with classmates, TA?s and faculty to work through the problem was a key consideration).  In genomics data analyses, redoing an experiment (e.g., repeating an analysis with different parameters), is relatively inexpensive in both time and money since the students are doing their investigation using a computer. Faculty reported that they were more likely to let a student fail initially in their computational genomics lab then they would in a wet lab course, where they might (for example) build in safeguards to prevent losing a precious sample.  In contrast, our CURE often enables students to experience the frustration, iteration, and resolution of an intellectual problem, much as one experiences this in any successful research project.\n\nBroader impacts:  A bioinformatics lab also has low infrastructure costs, requiring only access to computers and an internet connection. There are no safety issues (such as one might encounter in a chemistry lab), allowing faculty to make good use of peer instruction, an important multiplier that allows the course to engage more students.  These facts, coupled with the results above, lead us to conclude that bioinformatics (genomics in the case of the GEP) provides significant advantages for a CURE. Wide-spread utilization of similar approaches for simultaneously bringing more genomics/bioinformatics into the undergraduate curriculum and providing research experiences for the students thus appears to be a good strategy as we strive to provide research experiences for all life science undergraduates.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah C Elgin"
