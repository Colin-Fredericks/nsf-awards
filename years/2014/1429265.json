 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical: This research contract centers on the acquisition of a new high-resolution electron probe microanalysis system with an integrated electron backscatter diffraction detector.  This instrument will be the only one in the US and only one of three in the world with the capability of performing simultaneous crystallographic and chemical mapping at the sub-micron scale, and will permit trace elemental analysis with superb accuracy in a user-friendly environment. The instrument will have regional and international accessibility making it a multi-use, multi-institutional piece of state-of the-art equipment.  This research program brings together a unique set of 15 researchers from 7 Florida state universities (University of Florida, University of North Florida, Florida State University, Florida A&M University, University of Central Florida, Florida International University and University of South Florida) that have one commonality: the need to understand the connection between chemistry and structure at the sub-micron scale. The central theme of this instrumentation program with regards to teaching, education and outreach is lowering institutional barriers. A multi-pronged approach has been developed to execute this objective: 1) a remote access system, 2) K-12 education modules developed for teachers to help them integrate microscopy into their classroom curricula, 3) partnerships with the on-campus NSF REU program to expose talented undergraduates to advanced microscopy techniques, where selection will be based on talent and focused on increasing diversity of women and underrepresented groups, 4) continuing education programs, and 5) strategic partnerships with 2 minority serving institutions and 5 emerging Hispanic serving institutions provide fertile ground and access to underrepresented groups to increase the impact of the proposed education and outreach initiatives. \r\n\r\nTechnical: This electron probe microanalysis system produces a small spot size with high spatial resolution on the nanometer scale. The uniqueness of the instrument can be highlighted in its use in transforming research in 4 critical areas.  These areas include: 1) revealing the fundamental connections between microstructure, chemistry and microtexture in light element structural alloys, 2) understanding chemical diffusion in metallic and oxide systems to develop a unified theory for thermal diffusion while gaining deeper insight into the relationship between chemistry and structure in functional oxides, and 3) mapping phase boundaries in nanoprecipitation dispersion strengthened systems, and 4) robust and accurate measurement of minor and trace element with high spectral resolution needed for geological materials. The key features of this instrument that create maximal impact are the ability to perform: 1) trace elemental analysis with superb accuracy in a user-friendly environment, 2) quantitative mapping of light elements to show their true concentration distribution and advanced spectral resolution to avoid peak overlaps that are common with light elements, 3) fine-scale microstructural, chemical and crystallographic analysis, and 4) research and teaching by logging in online to remotely view and control the instrument.",
