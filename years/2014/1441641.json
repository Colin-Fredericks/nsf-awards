 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cincinnati Symposium on Probability Theory and Applications 2014 will take place  September 19 to 21, 2014 at the University of Cincinnati with a focus on current research in limit theorems for dependent structures. Dependent structures are ubiquitous in physical applications, yet present many mathematical  challenges. Several important breakthroughs have been made in recent years by combining  ideas from two or more of the Symposium focus areas. The Symposium will provide a platform  to showcase recent developments and stimulate new cross-disciplinary investigations and  collaborations. In order to stimulate new ideas and assist with the professional development of young  probabilists, the Symposium will emphasize the participation of graduate students and recent PhD recipients. Besides invited talks by senior researchers, there will be ample opportunities  for young investigators to present their research in shorter talks and at a poster forum. By  providing travel support, especially to junior probabilists, this award will facilitate interactions  and potential collaborations between junior and more established researchers, and encourage the infusion of new ideas across probability and related fields. \r\n\r\nRecently, significant progress has been made in understanding how classical limit theorems persist or break down when the assumption of weak dependence is not valid. At the same time, models with complex dependence structures, notably  arising from random matrix theory and mathematical physics, present new challenges to probabilists. The Symposium will bring together experts and junior researchers working on \r\n1) almost sure limit theorems via martingale approximations, \r\n2) long-range dependence phenomena and  infinite ergodic theory, and \r\n3) spectra of large-dimensional random matrices. \r\n\r\n\r\nSymposium website: http://math.uc.edu/probability",
