 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to investigate how conceptual misunderstandings of students in different engineering disciplines have common features.  By understanding patterns of misunderstandings, the project will attempt to develop a theory of engineering misconceptions that is trans-disciplinary.  The PIs represent three different universities and multiple engineering disciplines.  The large amount of data collected and archived by this project can serve to provide new insights on misconceptions.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to inform new ways of teaching engineering that better address students' conceptual understanding.  Such knowledge is vital for practicing engineers, lays a foundation for lifelong learning, and provides a necessary framework for developing disciplinary expertise.  Additionally a sound grasp of concepts may be important for developing innovative engineers, able to see deep connections between engineering fields.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe primary objective of this collaborative multi-institutional project was to understand patterns of misconceptions in multiple engineering disciplines and how similarities across disciplines might help us understand conceptual learning more broadly. This larger understanding of engineering learning can inform instructional changes that transcend engineering disciplines. Misconceptions are student errors in conceptual understanding that can interfere with developing overall correct understandings of engineering concepts.  To accomplish this objective, we had four goals: 1) conduct analysis of student data from interviews about conceptual understanding to determine the structure of knowledge across disciplines, 2) evaluate the applicability and validity of existing conceptual change theories to existing data sets, 3) investigate motivational factors that influence conceptual change, 4) create deliverables that inform both educators and researchers.\n\n \n\n \nTo meet these goals we have: \n\n\nestablished a substantial and unique database of interview data based on about 295 student interviews, covering three major content areas.\n\n\ndeveloped and reported on a new analysis method, paired expert-novice analysis protocol that allows a content expert to work with a non-content expert to provide better insights to student misconceptions.\n\n\ndeveloped a set of proto-theories that focus on different aspects of students\u00c6 difficulties; and\n\nevaluated these theories with the goal of developing a synthesis of proto-theories to create a more holistic explanation of student learning across disciplines.\n\n\n \n\n \nOur study yielded important findings with regard to how students engage with conceptual learning and develop conceptual understanding across engineering disciplines:\n\n\nEngineering concepts do not exist independently of the learning setting, the social rules, and students beliefs about learning and knowledge.  These concepts have individualized meanings for students that are influenced by who they are and the context in which they learned the concepts. \n\n\nStudents primarily reference prior problems or experiences in class rather than overarching conceptual ideas to navigate interviews with researchers to investigate student understanding. \n\n\nStudents struggle to discern what domain they are in when solving problems and frequently use information that is irrelevant (at least according to experts) to the problem situation. \n\n\nStudents prematurely accept answers that do not satisfy all of their own constraints or with simple appeals to authority. The process seems to change as students move through undergrad to graduate classes, and as they move into engineering careers.  Practicing engineers\u00c6 responses to similar questions are significantly different in this aspect; they were largely unwilling to discuss answers that they were not able to fully vet beforehand. \n\n\nStudents struggle to make appropriate distinctions between the technical use of terms and the colloquial use of these same terms. The development of conceptual knowledge is dependent on the development of useful distinctions between words that are associated with these concepts (i.e. stress, if-then) and the different uses of the same word in other contexts.\n\n\nStudents often inappropriately group dissimilar phenomena, processes or features. Essentially, students are combining things that need to be defined separately in order to fully understand the course content.\n\n\nStudents reason using simplified causal relationships. Across our datasets, we found that students seek to find the causes of phenomena under study, and seem to prefer simplistic, one-to-one causal relationships.  These tendencies persist even in the face of directly contradictory instruction.  \n\n\nBased on our student interviews on fluid mechanics aspects of students understanding are fairly consistent across very different interview contexts, while others shifted dramatically across slightly different interview questions..."
