 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research of Dr. Bradford Wayland of Temple University, who pursues new classes of catalysts for the selective reduction and conversion of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into useful organic materials.   These chemical transformations can be used to solve major contemporary issues in energy research.   The research includes the pursuit of catalysts based on earth-abundant, first transition series metal complexes. Realization of the objectives of the research will advance areas of chemical technology important for long term stability in the production of economical, liquid fuels and chemical feed stocks.  The students involved in this research receive excellent training in chemical synthesis and characterization, and chemical catalysis.\r\n\r\nThe core objective of the research is to utilize bimetallic complexes containing metal-centered radicals to accomplish thermodynamically challenging transformations of carbon monoxide and dioxide.  The selection of the metal complexes is guided by thermochemical criteria and DFT computations. The ability to attain productive intermediates for catalysis in mild conditions is tuned by the ligands, which are designed to support bimetallic complexes with minimal metal-metal bonding.  Schiff base macrocyclic ligands are being developed as easily prepared, low-cost substitutes for porphyrins.  Non-macrocyclic tetradentate ligands provide pathways for migratory insertions that are inhibited in complexes with macrocyclic ligands.  A series of anionic tridentate pincer type ligands with pyrrole and imine donors are designed to form metal-centered radicals in which the metal has a d7 or d9 electron configuration. The Pd(I) and Pt(I) derivatives afford the best opportunities to expand the current  limits of carbon dioxide  activation reactions. The complexes of Ni(I) and Fe(I) are leading candidates to accomplish catalytic conversion of carbon oxides using earth abundant first transition metals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n       Multiple goals for this program are encompassed and unified in the objective to develop new transition metal catalyst systems   that utilize multi-site  interactions to aid in accomplishing thermodynamiacally and kinetically  challenging substrate transformations .   Multi-metal catalyst systems provide complementary reaction pathways that enhance opportunities to complete catalytic cycles .  Inhibition of metal-metal bonding and the tethering of metal complexes to give multiple metal sites are two of the stategies  applied in attaining the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for small molecule reactions of bimetalloradical and  heterobimetallic systems .   Encorporation of Lewis acid and base sites  in positions to function in concert with metal centers  is explored as a strategy to activate X-H units in H2,H2O, NH3 and CH4 through intramolecular bond heterolysis. The primary initial focus  of this program provided examples for  the bench mark processes of reduction, coupling and  hydrogenation of CO and CO2, and also encompassed other demanding reactions including C-H and O-H bond cleavage reactions of CH4 and H2O. Several of these target substrate transformations are among the most challenging and economically significant which places these objectives among the most prominent goals enumerated in the Grand Challenges of Catalysis Science.                                                               A series of new tridentate monoanionic (N31-) pincer type ligands based on a 1,5 diimine pyrrole  unit have been  developed as facile sources of open coordination sites through tridentate to bidentate interconversion and simultaneous metal and ligand centered reactions.   Example transition metal complexes  have been identified where  the diimine pyrrole ligands  accomplish the objective of coordination versatility by  functioning as both tridentate and bidentate ligands.  These new (N31-) pincer type ligands thus have the capability to reversibly dissociate  an appended  nitogen  donor which provides a facile pathway for an X-H substrates like H2 to react at both a metal and a ligand site. These ligands are iso-pi electronic with neutral  pyridine diimine ligands that are observed to manifest redox non-innocent behavior in many metal complexes.                                                                             A substantial  advance in the area  bimetal complex materials was made through the design and preparation  of the first examples of tethered di-tmtaa ligands  that have either one or two  tethering  groups . Dibenzotetramethylaza[14]annulene  (tmtaa) ligand and structurally modified derivatives were developed as economical and easily prepared four nitrogen dianionic macrocyclic substitutes for porphyrin and phthalocyanine macrocycles .  These new di-macrocycle ligands provide variable capability to preorganize selective substrate reactions .  The tethered di-tmtaa macrocycle ligands  have been strucurally characterized   and  procedures for preparing  d-transition series  metal derivatives  continue to develop .  Reactions of [(tmtaa)Rh]2  with  H2 and CO that produce  reduced CO units in metallo-formyl  ( Rh-CHO ) and  metallo-ketone  (Rh-C(O)-Rh ) species  remain to be  exploited in the tethered bi-metal di-tmtaa complexes to obtain CO  and CO2 reduction processes .   \n\n         Results from this program  impact areas of  energy  and materials that have practical implications.   Successful realization of catalytic hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide transformations would constitute substantial advances in catalysis capabilities that have substantial impact on liquid fuel production and provide a stable source of valuable feed stocks for chemical manufacturing.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradford B Wayland"
