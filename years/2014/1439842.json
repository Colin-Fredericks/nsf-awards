 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with South Carolina's Coalition for Mathematics and Science, the University of South Carolina-Columbia seeks to establish professional development mechanisms for 20 Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs).   Four challenges faced by rural teachers and their school districts have been identified; (a) relative isolation from other teachers, (b) high attrition, (c) lack of leadership, and (d) weak opportunities for continuing teacher education.  The project will initiate strategies to address these challenges and evaluate their implementation. The work will be carried out in partnership with Fairfield County, Lexington County, Lexington, Orangeburg Consolidated, and Sumter school districts.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on research that addresses effective STEM professional development for rural teachers.  The project team will employ proven strategies to create a network of teacher-leaders with strong content knowledge through on-site and virtual mentor/coach, content-knowledge, and new math and science standards training.  In years one through three of the project, teachers will participate in intensive summer workshops or Instructional Leadership Academies which they will begin to co-lead by year four.  Data generated through assessment and evaluation will underpin investigations of how the project components enhance the preparation and commitment of the MTFs and the circumstances governing success.  Formative and summative evaluation will focus on determining whether or not the conceptual basis of the interventions (addressing the four challenges) is sound.  Assessment will include both qualitative and quantitative data collected through tracking MTF participation in project activities, perceptions of all aspects of the project (online surveys), performance in coursework, and classroom observations.  The results of this work will be presented at annual regional and national meetings and submitted for publication in a variety of teaching journals such as The Journal of Science Teacher Education, Journal for Mathematics Teacher Education, and Journal for Research in Rural Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nThe Developing Master Teachers through the South Carolina Science and Mathematics Teacher Leaders (SC-SMTL) program partnered the lead institution, the University of South Carolina (USC) with 13 schools in 11 rural districts to develop secondary mathematics and science teacher leaders. The project was based on research documenting effective STEM professional development for teachers that addresses the needs of rural school districts and provides a model for the development of science and mathematics teacher leaders in rural school districts. The project framework linked four areas of need for rural teachers (reduce isolation, increase retention, improve instruction, and create instructional leaders) with research-based strategies in secondary school science and mathematics teaching addressing each need as well as evaluation methods assessing the effectiveness of each strategy.  The SC-SMTL project focused on developing 20 Master Teaching Fellows (Fellows) across the partnership school districts to empower these teachers as instructional leaders, particularly for rural districts that lack often content specialists.  Further, the program enhanced the leadership preparation of these Fellows by involving them as mentors to preservice science and mathematics teachers who were Noyce Scholars.  As a result of this work, the project contributed to STEM teacher leadership development as well as to the recruitment and retention of teachers in rural school districts.\n\nAccomplishments included 9 Fellows earning National Board Certification, at least 14 STEAM Community Nights implemented in the partnership districts, over 80 teachers attended a Fellow-planned professional development conference, 16 Leadership Projects for School Improvement implemented in partner districts, 25 state and national presentations by the Fellows, and 47 research products including journal articles, a book chapter, a blog post, presentations, and dissertations. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nUSC\u2019s capacity to prepare high-quality science and mathematics teachers was enhanced by becoming more knowledgeable about and effective in addressing the needs of rural school districts. The project team employed proven strategies from its recognized M.Ed. program, from Cognitive Coaching, and from National Board teacher certification to prepare Fellows to serve as local curriculum leaders as well as mentors for fellow teachers. A significant and transformative innovation was the simultaneous development of leaders for rural school districts that lack science and mathematics specialists in conjunction with improving their own instruction and the mentorship of fellow teachers and preservice teachers. A well-qualified team of science and mathematics education researchers experienced in the Noyce Scholarship program partnered with experts in rural education and used research-based strategies derived from STEM professional development literature as well as rural education research to connect university-based preservice and inservice teacher education to the development of teacher leaders in rural South Carolina school districts. Examples of project research findings included an increased understanding of the impact of place-based project-based learning on student rural aspirations. Additionally, research helped better understand the impact of STEM teacher leader programs on teacher\u2019s practice, their understanding themselves as leaders, and how to better support their colleagues in teaching and learning.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nA model that addresses the professional development of rural science and mathematics teacher leaders addressed two critical problems: 1) the need for high-quality STEM teachers and 2) the need for effective teacher professional development in locales that lack access to required expertise.  This approach can be replicated in other parts of the U.S. where isolated and resource-poor school districts struggle to find and develop high quality STEM professional development.  Furthermore, innovative uses of technology allowed for the building of professional learning communities among preservice and inservice teachers facing similar problems. Rural school districts in South Carolina serve populations of up to 90% Black students so improving the quality of instruction in schools participating in this project had a significant impact on learning for underrepresented groups.  Empirical evidence validated through the project evaluation resulted in improved teacher education and retention for secondary school STEM teachers from diverse populations.  The leadership team and partners disseminated results, including our mentor development and training models, as part of USC\u2019s participation in the Association of Public Land-grant Universities imperative and its Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership as well as through publications and conferences of professional organizations such as the associations of mathematics and of science teacher educators.  Additionally, the success of this project prompted an invitation to join a collaborative research project examining STEM teacher leader projects across the U.S. Through this collaboration, project findings were able to be compared and included in larger research communities with an even wider audience and impact.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jan Yow"
