 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to advance the research skills of undergraduate majors in STEM. This will be accomplished through the inclusion of hands-on research activities, the expansion of computer simulations, and most importantly, the use of peer mentors to facilitate these activities in the introductory 200-level courses in Chemistry, Earth Science, Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. The development of a well-trained cadre of peer mentors is critical to the success of the program. A new 300-level interdisciplinary lab-based course, \"Research Workshop in Physical and Computational Sciences,\" will be designed to provide this preparation. The course will be structured around a series of modules that exposes students to topics drawn from different STEM disciplines through hands-on, open-ended laboratory exercises. These students will, in turn, serve as peer mentors in the introductory 200-level courses, into which similar research components have been embedded. The combination of curricular changes through experiential research will strengthen the STEM programs at the university and will improve retention of these students. The expected long-term outcomes of this project include strengthening the curriculum, improving student learning and retention, increasing student satisfaction in STEM, developing and strengthening a culture of research for undergraduate students, and increasing the overall number of STEM students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The recruitment and retention of students in STEM is an important issue in our society, since jobs in STEM fields are projected to grow faster than those in other fields. The project will also provide a transferable model for growing our future STEM workforce at universities nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe project will build on the undergraduate research activities initiated at the university in 2009-2011 by a Title III grant from the U.S. Department of Education. That project resulted in the formation of a Student Center for Science Engagement to provide academic support for STEM majors, as well as a structured undergraduate summer research program in the sciences, which has been institutionalized since 2012 and impacts approximately 50 STEM majors each summer. The new project will expand the results through a \"scale up, scale down\" approach, engaging a larger group of students in laboratory-based guided research activities in a classroom setting through mini-research projects incorporated into the curriculum. The goals of this project are to introduce inquiry-based elements and computational tools in the introductory and intermediate-level courses in the sciences and mathematics; to develop new discipline-specific and interdisciplinary courses that are in line with NSF's STEM workforce development objectives; and to provide students with research opportunities within the classroom setting. Examples of projects that will be incorporated into the new curriculum are computational dynamical mechanics, mathematical modeling of disease, geological modeling of hazards, and surface chemistry.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing the program, the investigators will examine questions of effectiveness such as the following: (1) Does participation in the reformed courses lead to measurable change in students' interest, aspirations, and preparation to persist in their discipline? (2) Does participation in the reformed courses lead to measurable change in students' learning, especially mastery of course content and understanding of the research process? (3) Do the reformed courses contribute to increased persistence in the major? (4) Does participation in the reformed courses lead to increased retention rates for women and minorities?",

The project modified the STEM core curriculum in these programs to include a strong inquiry-based research component in the core curriculum with the goal of increasing the level of engagement of students in the participating STEM disciplines. Below are the major outcomes of the project.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Improve the retention and recruitment of students in the STEM disciplines</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Between fall 2015 and fall 2018 the total number of majors in the participating departments remained basically unchanged with a decline of 8.4% in the last year. These numbers are significant as the overall undergraduate enrollment at NEIU experienced a decline of 29.5%. The percentage of the students in the participating programs relative to the total undergraduate enrollment experienced a steady increase from 7.8% to 10.1%. More remarkable was the increase of underrepresented minorities. In fall 2015 41.5% of the STEM majors where white, this number reduced to 24.7% in fall 2019. In the same period the Hispanic percentage grew from 26% to 32.7%. The percentage of Asians increased from 13.5% to 20.2%. The African American population reduced from 8.3 to 5.3%. The remaining underrepresented groups, Native Americas, multiracial and undetermined races, increased from 10.8% to 17.1%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Increase student engagement in STEM disciplines</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;The engagement of students in the PEERS courses was significantly larger than in the non-PEERS as observed by the external evaluator. In the first site visit the external evaluator reported that in 92% of the observed time in PEERS courses, students had a very high level of engagement, while in the second visit the number dropped to 64% but a continued high level of engagement, There was no observation of low student engagement (i.e., less than 25% of students engaged).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Develop and strengthen a culture of research for undergraduate students</strong></p>\n<p>The PEERS project developed a culture of research among the students in the PEERS courses. The external evaluation student survey focused on the student's understanding of research. At the end of the semester, students were more likely to note that research involves the discovery of novel information or theories, or reaching a new understanding of a phenomena. These types of comments often mentioned the open-ended, exploratory and investigative aspects of the research process. There were disciplinary differences, while physical scientists were more likely to mention that research is a process of discovery, computer scientists were more likely to mention that research is a process of design and development. Students in the modified classes also showed a comfort in collaboration with a slight improvement at the end of the term, while non-PEERS students showed a slight decline in collaboration. Students in the PEERS courses showed a larger increase in their writing skills as compared with non-PEERS students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Enhance student awareness of the connections between the different STEM disciplines.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The inclusion of peer leaders and research modules in PEERS courses promoted in-depth inquiry of course content which fostered critical reflection and deeper understanding of disciplinary and interdisciplinary content. This interdisciplinary content was reflected in the research topics of the mini-research projects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Development of Peer Leaders Skills</strong></p>\n<p>Peer leaders noted many benefits from the experience, including increased interest in the course topics, increased knowledge of the content area, improved communication and teaching skills, and increased confidence in their ability to teach as evedences by external evaluator survey.&nbsp; In addition, many of the peer leaders in the program were admitted to graduate schools, a benefit that was observed in the Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>Curriculum Development</strong></p>\n<p>One of the major outcomes of the project was the opportunity to revise not only the modified courses, but the STEM curriculum in general. These changes were necessary as NEIU is a nontraditional institution and a large fraction of its students are more comfortable with a more passive mode of learning and need additional training to tackle open ended activities. The inclusion of the mini-research projects induced&nbsp; revising courses to the point of having to drop a few topics to open the time for the projects. In addition to the modification predicted in the original proposal, the STEM departments are making changes and creating new courses. Some of the changes are to build more skills earlier in the curriculum and get students ready for inquiry based activities and group work. While other changes are geared towards modernizing the curriculum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/26/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paulo&nbsp;H&nbsp;Acioli</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431839/1431839_10334491_1577403807303_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431839/1431839_10334491_1577403807303_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NEIU Undergraduate Enrollment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431839/1431839_10334491_1577403807303_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NEIU Undergraduate Enrollment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate enrollment at Northeastern Illinois University.
