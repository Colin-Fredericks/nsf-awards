It is expected to provide scholarships to 16 U.S. based graduate student participants. The award results will be announced at the ICDM 2014 conference website. A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the Conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 500, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. This grant will partially support the travel costs for the U.S. based graduate student participants. Participation in international meetings is a key to effective scientific career development for graduate students.",
