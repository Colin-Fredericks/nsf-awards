 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses modeling and control aspects of human-robot interaction by considering constraints imposed by an individual's physiology. The project is motivated by increasing demand for automation in unstructured environments that require high-level cognitive processing and complex decision-making which cannot yet be fully automated. By taking human-centric approach, data-driven musculoskeletal models are incorporated into the robot interaction model to account for differences of individuals. \r\n\r\nEach cooperative activity is divided into action primitives requiring different control strategies while estimating human intent from various sensors. The framework is based on theory of hybrid systems that provides provable safety and stability criteria. The outcome of this research will facilitate methodology for safer and more reliable human-robot interaction and advance state-of-the-art in human movement analysis and control theory. The broader impacts of this research will be realized through new insights into understanding of human intent and haptic cooperation applicable to general human-machine interaction. With increasing interest in service robotics safe and reliable interaction will be the key to successful introduction of robots in human-occupied environments. The potential economic impact of robots engaged in services and manufacturing alongside humans are significant due to increased productivity and reduced costs. Another emerging area is rehabilitation and assistive robotics. The developed data-driven musculoskeletal models will also be applicable to quantification of physical impairments and estimation of muscular stress in healthcare and ergonomics. This interdisciplinary research provides excellent opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to be engaged in analytical challenges, laboratory demonstrations of theoretical results, and experimental evaluations.",

In contrast, model-based approaches provide detailed priors about what human actions are possible for a given human pose. In addition, model-features generalize across a wide variety of humans body structures, poses, and performed motor tasks. Our project focused on developing such detailed human models, and on using them to inform collaborative manipulation between robots and humans.</p>\n<p>To realize model-based human-robot collaboration, we developed a family of detailed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging based dynamic human musculoskeletal models. We developed algorithms that used the models to reconstruct as well as predict human motion for complex manipulation tasks. In particular, to obtain information that could help optimize robot control strategies related to gain adjustment, trajectory generation, and error reduction. We also developed computationally efficient parametric model-variation algorithms to efficiently capture variations in physiology across humans. This included differences in kinematics, such as range of motion and reachability, as well as dynamics and muscle distribution and contribution to tasks. We tuned our models using data collected from motion capture, Microsoft Kinect, force plate, electromyography (EMG), acoustic myography (AMG), and robot joint motion.</p>\n<p>Moving from human models to robots, we divided our robotics initiatives into three goal areas. First, we developed action primitives for robots, which allow autonomous operation for grasping, handoff, and object placement. Next, we developed human intent estimation methods that use dynamically consistent algorithms and probabilistic methods to determine potential future actions. We also developed methods to combine this with visual, tactile, and spoken communication channels between robots and humans to simplify interaction. Finally, we studied how human ergonomics and posture influenced human force generation ability and muscular effort, which can inform how robots should behave during collaborative behavior.</p>\n<p>Finally, we conducted several human subject experiments interacting with the Baxter robot, the Kuka LWR robot, the Kinova Jaco robot, and the Kuka IIWA robot.
