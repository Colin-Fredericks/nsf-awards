 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nPowders and grains are used by the thousands of tons in the processing of polymers, catalysts, pharmaceuticals and building materials.  Unfortunately, these materials exhibit unpredictable transitions between flow and jamming.  On the large scale, these transitions manifest themselves in catastrophic slip events, causing the deaths of between 25 and 50 people annually in landslides in the US alone.  On the small scale, slip events are intimately associated with material irregularities, which are far and away the dominant cause of rejections of manufactured ceramics.  Recent work has demonstrated for the first time that electrical signals can be measured consistently and reproducibly as much as several seconds before any outward sign of a slip event in a powder bed.  In this project, the research team will investigate the cause of these electrical precursors, establish what material properties the precursors depend on, and establish the groundwork to determine whether and when advance predictions of slip events can be made.  This will certainly lead to improved understanding of an entirely new phenomenon in material science, and may conceivably have implications for earthquake and landslide prediction as well as for improved quality control for tightly regulated materials such as ceramics and pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe mechanism underlying electrical voltage production in powder beds is not understood.  The goal of this research is therefore to analyze this mechanism in carefully targeted experiments.  In particular, questions that these experiments seek to answer are (1) what, mechanistically, occurs at the granular level to cause a transfer of charge leading to voltage production; (2) how do the electrical signals vary in space and in time; and (3) what material properties do the voltage signals depend on?  The work that will be performed will be first to construct an experiment in which local charge and stress distributions can be mapped in space and in time, and second, to quantitatively evaluate how the voltage signals depend on material properties such as hardness, size and cohesivity.  Measurements will be performed using electrostatic voltmeters arranged in a spatial array, complemented by visualization techniques.  These measurement methods rely on existing and proven technologies, performed in unique ways designed to focus on the mechanism of interest.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPowders and grains &ndash; used in thousands of tons to process polymers, catalysts, pharmaceuticals and building materials &ndash; stick to surfaces and collect into rigid aggregates.  These sticking and aggregating processes lead to profound practical problems.  For example, in pharmaceutical manufacture, active ingredients tend to separate by preferentially sticking to walls of processing equipment (see figure attached).  This can leads to significant variations in concentration of drug formulations.  Likewise, the manufacture of common polymers such as polyethylene is performed in \"fluidized beds\" consisting of aerated grains.  During manufacture, polymers stick to surfaces, causing expensive and time consuming shut-downs of processing operations.\n\nIn prior work, we have shown that this sticking can be produced by electrical charging of powders and grains, and in this project we investigated root causes of this charging.  We found the following.\n\n1) Charging can grow exponentially rapidly in time. \n\n2) This charge growth is dominated by electrical polarization, meaning that opposite sides of a particle contain opposite (positive and negative) charges.\n\n3) Because this growth can occur in different areas of a granular bed, sometimes growing from a tiny negative charge and sometimes from a tiny positive one, competing domains of charge and polarization typically arise. \n\n4) These domains obey complex but well characterized dynamics that can be described by well understood mathematical models.\n\n5) In granular beds containing grains differing in material properties, grains can segregate, again in ways that can be mathematically described.\n\n6) We showed that contacting particles transport charge large distances from points of contact.\n\n7) We have found that similar charging, and particle segregation, effects seen in manufacturing operations also occur on asteroids.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Troy Shinbrot"
