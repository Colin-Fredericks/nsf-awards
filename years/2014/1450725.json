 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study on a new type of optical switch. If the proposed\r\ntechnique is successful this EAGER project will impact a key component in optical communication, and data centers \r\nin particular. By harnessing a radically different switching mechanism, the electric field induced dynamic waveguiding\r\neffect in nanodisordered potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals, the PI hopes to obtain optical switching performance\r\nthat cannot be achieved through current technologies.\r\n\r\nTraditional optical switches designed for data center and optical communication, and based on changing the phase in the\r\ntravelling path, produce an interference that switches from constructive to destructive as the phase is varied. Such a \r\nswitch is limited in that it operates at a specific wavelength of light. In the proposed research the on-off switching\r\ncould be efficiently achieved with very low switching power, and for a broad range of wavelengths. The project will check\r\nthe feasibility of such a concept by fabricating and characterizing a 1x2 switch. Since data centers (in particular) require\r\na growing number of switches, and are faced with growing power consumption limitations there is a critical need for such \r\na technology. With the selection of nanocrystal potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) the proposed work has the potential to \r\nproduce ultra-fast switching with low power consumption, in a broadband transmission, while maintaining low cross talk,\r\nhigh extinction ratio and small footprint.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this NSF EAGER project, we conducted all necessary feasibility study on the super-broadband ultrafast waveguide switch by harnessing the new physical switching mechanism, field induced dynamic waveguiding effect.  The key parameters of waveguide switch, including (1) insertion loss, (2) switching speed, (3) operational bandwidth, and (4) cross-talk were quantitatively studied.  The theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed super-broadband ultrafast waveguide switch was feasible, as summarized below:\n\nLow insertion loss.  As long as the operation temperature was several degree higher than the Curie, temperature, the insertion loss of nanodisordered KTN crystal was very low (less than 0.1 dB/cm) at IR communication wavelength (1.3 &ndash; 1.5 microns) because the dimension of polar nano region (PNR) on the order of tens of nanometers was much smaller than that of IR communication wavelength.\nNo noticeable photorefractive (PR) effect.  There were no noticeable PR effect at the IR communication wavelength (1.3 &ndash; 1.5 microns) for the pure undoped KTN crystal.\nLow switching voltage/power.  By harnessing a unique electrode architecture, a low switching voltage/power (10 V) could be used to achieve the switching effect.\nHigh switching speed (on the order of ns).\nBroadband operation.  The effective electro-optic coefficient, , was almost flat in the IR communication wavelength (1.3 &ndash; 1.6 micron) spectral range, which enables broadband operation capability.\nEliminate absorption loss from metal electrode.  By employing a lower dielectric constant KTN overlay layer (~1 micron) such as by sol-gel, sputtering, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), liquid phase epitaxy (LPE), the absorption loss from metal electrode could be eliminated.\n\n\n \n\nThe successful conducting this NSF EAGER project lay down a solid foundation to develop  a low cost, broadband, high speed optical packet and/or short burst switch, which can have significant impacts on high speed optical networks, in particular reducing the power consumption of data centers (currently consuming 1.5 percent of the world\u00c6s total electricity production, corresponding to near $44.5 billion in energy costs) and latency of the networks.  Since there can be over tens of thousands of servers within the data center, the performance of the data center is largely impacted by the network within the data center.  By replacing the current electronic packet switch with high speed optical packet and/or short burst switch, there can be a great (10 + fold) reduction in switching power consumption.
