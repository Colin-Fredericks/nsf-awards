 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation. Professors Keith T. Kuwata of Macalester College and Professor Stacey A. Stoffregen of the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and their undergraduate research students are developing more accurate and detailed theoretical models of chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The most significant broader impact of the project is the training that Macalester and River Falls undergraduates receive to conduct significant research in atmospheric chemistry, which in turn equips them to pursue advanced study in STEM fields. This research also contributes to the intellectual vitality of the Midwest Undergraduate Computational Chemistry Consortium (MU3C), to which both Professor Kuwata and Professor Stoffregen belong. Their students will make presentations on their research projects at the in-person MU3C conference every summer and the on-line MU3C conference every winter. MU3C membership gives the PIs and their students opportunities to interact with fellow computational chemistry faculty and students at nine other primarily undergraduate institutions at conferences twice a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on clarifying the impacts that intermediates in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions have on free radical and carboxylic acid concentrations. One intermediate of interest is the vinyl hydroperoxide (VHP) formed in atmospheric alkene ozonolysis. Current experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the tendency of the VHP to undergo homolysis to form OH varies with both the size and structure of the original alkene and with atmospheric conditions. Understanding these variations requires more creativity about possible VHP chemical reactions and the application of quantum chemical methodology that can accurately model molecules with substantial static electron correlation.  Such models provide new mechanistic insights about atmospheric processes by making predictions about transient species that cannot be directly characterized experimentally. At the same time, these models are also used to predict experimentally known quantities such as the concentrations of stable atmospheric species. Comparisons between theory and experiment both validate theoretical predictions and drive the development and application of new theoretical methods.",

Stoffregen applied computational chemistry to reactions of organic compounds in the lower atmosphere.  These faculty conducted all of this research with undergraduates at Macalester College, the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, and Bethel University, and both faculty and students participated extensively in the activities of the Midwest Undergraduate Computational Chemistry Consortium.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nApproximately 12% of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmospheric boundary layer of urban air are unsaturated hydrocarbons. Alkenes have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (minutes to hours) due to their reactivity via ozonolysis reactions and reaction with OH radicals. Ozonolysis reactions produce form a carbonyl and a carbonyl oxide species, which is also referred to as a Criegee intermediate (CI).  The CI may then follow a number of degradation pathways, including the formation of vinyl hydroperoxides (VHPs), dioxiranes, and carboxylic acids, all eventual sources of HO radical. Additionally, the CI may react with water to form hydroxyalkyl hydroperoxides (HAHPs) and with sulfur dioxide (SO2) to form heteroozonides (HOZ).  The grant supported the publication of two papers in the Journal of Physical Chemistry A that explored the mechanisms of these reactions.\n\nIn our 2015 paper, we successfully predicted how quickly the CI CH2OO reacts with SO2 (Figure 1).  The speed of this reaction depends in part on the existence of a number of loosely associated structures (1a, 1b, TS-2a,and TS-2b).  We also found that subtle differences in the three-dimensional arrangement of these structures have a substantial impact on reaction rate.  The endo form (in blue) reacts three times slower than the exo form (in green).  This is due to greater repulsions between the oxygen atoms in the endo form.\n\nIn our 2018 paper, we chararacterized the step-by-step transformation of the CI to the VHP to either free radicals (OH + vinoxy) or hydroxycarbonyl, a molecule that will not release OH under atmospheric conditions.  Figure 2 shows that at ambient temperature and reduced pressure, free radical production dominates.  Figure 3 shows that at lowered temperature and ambient pressure, hydroxycarbonyl formation dominates, and there is a substantial temporary accumulation of the VHP.  These simulation predictions can be tested against experimental measurements.\n\nThe fate of HAHPs was the focus of another research project. The HAHPs shown in Figure 4 were chosen for study because they arise from prominent alkene pollutants including, but not limited to, ethene, propene, butene, myrcene, and isoprene, with estimated biogenic emissions in 2000 of 26.9Tg yr-1, 15.8Tg yr-1, 8.0Tg yr-1, 8.7Tg yr-1, and 535Tg yr-1 respectively.\n\nThe photochemistry of each HAHP has been modeled in the gas-phase using a variety of computational chemistry techniques to determine the reasonable degradation pathways.

The aforementioned pathways all exhibit lower energy barriers than decomposition pathways available via electronic excitation to a singlet excited state.  Modeling of the decomposition pathways for the larger HAHPs (i.e. HMPHP and HBHP) has begun.  \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nDuring the grant lifetime, Kuwata and Stoffregen mentored 20 undergraduate research students working on these atmospheric chemistry projects.  Almost all of these students presented their results at one or more conferences sponsored by the Midwest Undergraduate Computational Chemistry Consortium (MU3C) and several students also presented at American Chemical Society national meetings.  The PI and co-PI also contributed to the vitality of MU3C by co-authoring NSF proposals for instrumentation and research experiences for undergraduates.  These efforts benefit a diverse consortium of 23 computational chemists at 17 colleges and universities.  Finally, the PI and co-PI developed computational exercises for organic chemistry and advanced elective courses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Keith T Kuwata"
