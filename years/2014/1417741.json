 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ethnic and racial demography of the U.S. population has changed tremendously. The U.S. Census reports that a majority of children in the United States are now racial/ethnic minorities.  By 2043, the general American population is projected to include an ethnic minority-majority.  Accordingly, research on ethnic/racial identity has taken on critical significance.  Ethnic/racial identity is a central aspect of the development of ethnic minority youth, especially during adolescence and young adulthood, and promotes positive outcomes among youth who have been exposed to racial discrimination and other stressors.  In some cases, a strong ethnic/racial identity can buffer youth from negative life events.  One important issue for consideration is the unique experiences of each ethnic/racial group versus commonalities across groups.  There has also been limited research on how biological, family, school, neighborhood and societal contexts shape the development and content of ethnic/racial identity over time.  For example, how does ethnic/racial identity develop differently for a Hispanic adolescent in the Southwest compared to the Midwest or the Northeast?  \r\nThe workshop will address the following three goals: (a) to examine and discuss research on how contexts influence ethnic/racial identity over time, (b) to identify how biological, family, school, neighborhood and societal contexts influence the development and content of ethnic/racial identity, and (c) to identity ways that prevailing theories of ethnic/racial identity fail to account for the effects of context on ethnic/racial identity. The workshop participants are an interdisciplinary group including Psychology, Sociology, Education, Political Science, Public Health and Genomics scholars. The workgroup represents diversity in developmental period studied (i.e., childhood, adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood), racial/ethnic population studied (i.e., African American, Latino, Asian American and Native American), and methodological approach.  The workgroup members are also ethnically diverse themselves. The workshop will result in new collaborations and significant new insights into understanding minority youth development. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere have been tremendous changes in the demography of the U.S. population.  Already a majority of children in the United States are non-Hispanic White, racial/ethnic minorities.  In the near future, the population of Americans is projected to include a racial/ethnic minority-majority.  As the country becomes increasingly diverse, it has become imperative that we understand the dynamic changes in how Americans think about themselves in terms of race/ethnicity: \"Who am I?\" and \"How do I feel about my group?\"  These questions, and their answers are often referred to as \"ethnic/racial identity\". \n\nThis project supported a working group of interdisciplinary scholars to examine what factors influence ethnic/racial identity and its development among minority group members. Several products were developed out of this working group.  The first product is a special section in the journal of Child Development examining peer, family and national influences on ethnic/racial identity.  The primary conclusion of these papers is that where and with whom ethnic/racial identity develops is important.  For example, where someone lives influences ethnic/racial identity.  In addition, societal influences such as policies that encourage ethnic/racial communities to integrate also influence ethnic/racial identity.  Finally, peers and friendships with people from different ethnic/racial groups, affects how youth think about their ethnic/racial identity. The second set of products supported by this project includes three papers authored by members of the working group examining: 1) how ethnic/racial identity is performed by minority group members, 2) the relation between ethnic/racial identities and internalized negative racial stereotypes, and 3) how ethnic/racial identity protects minority group members from the effects of racism. \n\nFinally, the project also supported opportunities for new areas of research.  One of these areas is the relation between ethnic/racial identity and pubertal development.  Ethnic identity and puberty are both key, and concurrent, developmental milestones for all American adolescents.  However, the relationship between these developmental changes is unclear.  For example, the meaning and significance of pubertal changes may depend on how and young child feels about their racial/ethnic group.  Developing out of this project, the working group will continue to pursue research in this new area through collecting new data, the development of papers, and grant proposals. \n\nThis project aimed to understand influences on how minority group members feel about their race/ethnicity.  The results suggest that the answer is complex and multi-faceted.  There are many influences on ethnic/racial identity among minority group members and science is just beginning to scratch the surface on this question.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tiffany Yip"
