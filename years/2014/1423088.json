This research program provides a comprehensive framework for learning and tracking covariance structures of large-scale data streams, which has implications for a broad range of applications in network analysis, active sensing, traffic monitoring, particularly in systems where communication bandwidth, battery life, and physical limits constrain the practicality of high sample rates.\r\n \r\nBy leveraging low-dimensional covariance structures such as sparsity and low-rankness, the research introduces a novel framework for reconstructing and tracking covariance structures of high-dimensional noisy data streams in time-sensitive and resource-constrained environments via low-complexity sketching schemes, showing that a single sketch per sample suffices for accurately reconstructing the covariance matrix rather than the original data stream with minimal storage requirement. The research program develops efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees as well as investigates the fundamental limits for inferring covariance structures from a limited number of measurements, offering a new combination of insights and techniques from information theory, signal processing and high-dimensional statistics.",
