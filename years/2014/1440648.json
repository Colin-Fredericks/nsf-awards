 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wabash College has a strong history of educating undergraduates in STEM disciplines, and for decades the college has been highly ranked among baccalaureate institutions in originating PhD recipients in the physical sciences.  In order to provide the highest-quality research and scholarship opportunities for the next generation of scientists, high-performance data networks are essential to support transfer of large data sets, as well as high-speed access to remote instruments and collaborators.  \r\n\r\nThis project improves the campus cyberinfrastructure at Wabash College in three areas to support increased demand by researchers, both across campus and beyond: 1) it increases Wabash's connection to Internet2 and other national research networks from 1Gbps to 10Gbps via Indiana's regional network provider, I-Light; 2) it increases the connection speed from the network core to the campus science buildings to 10Gbps and provides redundant network paths to those buildings; and 3) the new 10Gbps-capable Science DMZ ensures unimpeded high-performance data transfer for researchers across the regional and national research networks.\r\n\r\nThese infrastructure improvements significantly increase data transfer rates and network reliability for Wabash's science research network, benefitting all researchers and students in STEM disciplines at the College.  They address immediate research needs for projects in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and mathematics, including work at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), and with the Midwest Undergraduate Computational Chemistry Consortium (MU3C).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project upgraded Wabash College?s campus network to provide increased network capacity and bandwidth to support scientific research, both across campus and beyond.\n\nThe project funded a direct fiber build between Wabash College and I-Light, a high-speed fiber optic network that connects Indiana members to state, national, and international research and education communities.  Through the direct fiber build, Wabash?s bandwidth to I-Light increased from a 1Gbps connection to 10Gbps, with capacity for additional bandwidth as research needs continue to grow.\n\nOn campus, the project supported upgrades to Wabash?s network core, a new fiber build and 10Gbps connectivity between the network core and both of Wabash?s science buildings, and a direct 10Gbps fiber connection between the two science buildings.  New network switches installed in the science buildings provide 10Gbps data connections to specific locations, providing a 10Gbps path for high performance computing clusters and data transfer devices.\n\nThe project also established a ScienceDMZ to provide a network path for large data transfer that is optimized for high-performance scientific applications.  The Science DMZ is achieved through two direct 10GBps links between the network core and the border router.  Network devices on specific virtual circuits can reach Internet2 and other research networks directly through the ScienceDMZ and bypass the campus firewall and other packet control devices, resulting in significant performance gains.\n\nWith the completion of the cyberinfrastructure improvements, we have seen a significant immediate impact on research projects in chemistry and physics, specifically NSF-support cellular membrane research using computer simulations (450-core cluster)? NSF-supported analysis of largescale chemical sequence and structure data? and NSF-supported research at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State.  For data transfer from the NSCL, we have measured transfer rates at more than 25 times our previous capability, reducing the time to transfer a typical 1TB data set from more than a day to just over an hour. This degree of network improvement is transformative for all types of research, and allows work with larger data sets, more frequent experimental runs, and faster access to data.\n\nOur cyberinfrastructure improvements offer a more reliable, high performance network experience for our students, as well as researchers.
