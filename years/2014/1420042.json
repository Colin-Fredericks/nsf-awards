 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both the United States and Europe are preparing for a larger population of older people in the near future. In the United States, the population of adults 65 and older will increase to 88.5 million in 2050, which is more than double the current number. It is expected that by 2050, 35% of Europeans will be over 60 years old, and 11% will be over 80 years old. This is a dramatic increase from current levels of 20% and 4%, respectively. In order for older adults to maintain their independence and function well in an increasingly technological society, it is important for them to be able to retain and develop motor skills. This project comprises a transnational team of investigators from the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States with extensive expertise in the study of motor skill acquisition across the lifespan. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to delineate age differences in the brain and behavioral mechanisms of motor skill learning. The researchers will collect motor performance and neuroimaging data to identify brain regions contributing to skill learning for young and older adults. In addition, they will assess participants on a range of characteristics such as fitness level, cognitive capacity, health status, and other variables to identify factors contributing to individual differences in successful learning for older adults. They will also evaluate if and how exercise, transcranial brain stimulation, and observing others learn facilitate motor skill acquisition for older adults. Identifying age differences in the mechanisms of skill acquisition, and critically evaluating interventions for their potential effectiveness at improving skill learning abilities, will help to maintain work productivity, health, and daily function for older adults.",
