 "awd_abstract_narration": "How and why organisms allocate resources to different functions such as growth, maintenance and reproduction is a fundamental aspect of their biology. Understanding patterns of allocation addresses fundamental questions about the evolution of a wide variety of plants and animals. The way that organisms mate with each other (their mating system) is often related to the way they allocate resources. For example, in species where a single male mates with multiple females, males may express particular traits that increase their chance of successfully obtaining a mate. In some species, such as freshwater snails, individuals are male and female at the same time, and therefore have the option to self-fertilize if no mates are available. Previous research has resulted in a predictive theory that relates the way organisms mate (with/without a partner) to how they grow and when they become mature. In this three-year interdisciplinary research project, this theory with be extended and tested using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental tests using snails.  The project will also promote cross-disciplinary education of diverse undergraduate students and high school teachers.  \r\n\r\nThere is a close relationship between the expression and evolution of the mating system and other life-history traits. Individuals of many species may be able to alter their allocation of resources based on the availability of mating partners, and the pattern of mating itself can affect when individuals initiate reproduction and how much they allocate to gamete production and mate attraction. A particular example of this is revealed by simultaneous hermaphrodites that can reproduce by self-fertilization or outcrossing: Individuals that prefer to outcross may delay the initiation of reproduction if mates are not available. In this project, the researchers will develop a series of mathematical models to explore the role that a variety of realistic yet complicated environmental factors play in determining life-history expression and evolution. They will explore the consequences of (1) demographic stochasticity, (2) inducible defenses, and (3) spatial structure on the expression and evolution of optimal life-history strategies. Each model will be paired with an empirical test using a well-developed experimental system (freshwater snails) that will allow a test of the model results. Collectively, the project will improve the predictive and explanatory power of how individual life-history strategies and the mating system interact.",

Our approach has two-pronged: We are interested in building and analyzing these models (using a simplified set of variables), and then testing the predictions of the models via an empirical system of freshwater snails.  The snails provide an easy-to-manipulate model system that allows us to assess a variety of aspects of an organism?s life history.  To date, we have developed two models, one is published, the other is still in development.  We have published two additional papers during this time frame where analyses were aided by this NSF award, and we are currently working to produce a third empirical paper.  Over the span of this award, we have supervised 10 undergraduate students (in biology and math) and one graduate student (in math), several of which have been authors on papers.  Several of these students have graduated since the project started, and most of them have gone on to pursue graduate education in biology or math.  As an RUI grant, this award was critically important in exposing these students to an interdisciplinary, hypothesis-driven approach to understanding the evolution of life-history traits. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Auld"
