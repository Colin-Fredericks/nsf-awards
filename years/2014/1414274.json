 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the novel design and fabrication of a polymer-based composite for bone fixation applications.  The project will result in a prototype of a composite bone fixation device. This composite device has the following unique features: matching elastic modulus to bone, excellent toughness, and it is biocompatible and bioresorable. These devices would eliminate the problems associated with the commonly used metallic bone fixation devices in the market, such as stress shielding, release of metal ions and bone re-fracture after healing.  This project addresses the use of novel materials design and fabrication techniques to enhance the mechanical properties of the composite.  \r\n\r\nTo this end, a multi-disciplinary team has been formed with expertise in biomaterials, polymer and composite processing and characterization, technology transfer and commercialization. The project engages investigators from University to industry in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.\r\n\r\nThe new composite material will greatly benefit patients who suffer from bone fractures and are in need of orthopedic surgeries. This is because the novel bone fixation devices, based on the new composite material, will directly address the poor mechanical properties of existing apatite/polymer composites and the stress-shielding and bone re-fracture problems of metallic bone-fixation devices, the current market solutions. In addition, the work will present a new processing approach for fabrication of bone-fixation materials and thus contribute to U.S. competitiveness in the bone fixation device market.",
