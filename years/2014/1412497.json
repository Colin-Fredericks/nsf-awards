 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optogenetics is rapidly altering how scientists reveal the basic operation of the brain circuits that are central to sensation, action, and  cognition. The vast majority of optogenetic studies to date have primarily capitalized on the genetic side of optogenetics taking advantage of the specificity of gene expression to\r\ncontrol and image unique cell types and connections in the brain. However, precise spatial\r\ncontrol of the illuminating light affords an additional dimension of specificity that has been underutilized, partly owing to the challenges posed by the scattering properties of brain tissue. Recent and future work in multi-photon imaging and structured illumination, combined  with alternative approaches such as micron scale, implantable illumination devices promise to open up whole new avenues of research to understand the elementary basis of neural computation, sensory coding, and neural defects in brain diseases such as autism, schizophrenia, and  epilepsy. There will a focus at this  meeting:on  advances in structured illumination, ultrafast imaging  and local implantable illumination devices, to control neural activity at brain depths beyond the limits of multi-photon microscopy. Invitees will present their recent advances, and also discuss the major outstanding challenges in this field and how to surmount these\r\nchallenges to develop the necessary technologies that will unlock fundamental aspects of brain function and disease.",
