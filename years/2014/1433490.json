Over the past six decades, the advent of semiconductors in particular, has dramatically changed the ways in which we compute, communicate and learn.  Still, we long for opto- and electronics that are even more energy-efficient, compact, flexible and convenient.  New materials drive novel applications, and innovative devices demand creative materials research.  This bidirectional thinking is epitomized in this EFRI 2-DARE project.

The leadership embodied in the research, teaching, mentoring, service, outreach activities in this project in turn better prepares the next generation of the STEM work force.\r\n\r\nTechnical:  The rapid and recent advances in graphene, a single sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb crystal, have raised tantalizing questions for other examples of 2D materials that might have distinct and useful properties. \"The rich variety of properties that 2D layer materials offer can potentially be engineered on demand, and they create exciting prospects for applications such as in electronics, sensing, photonics, flexible electronics, energy harvesting and storage, thermal management, mechanical structures, catalysis, and bio-engineering in the future,\" (NSF EFRI-2014 program solicitation). In this proposal, the aim is to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers to address the grand challenges in energy, where an interdisciplinary team with complimentary expertise will use an integrated approach for research and outreach. Based on the rapid progress made by the PIs in the 2D layered materials and heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy, this EFRI team proposes transformative approaches to control electronic doping and heterostructure formation with monolayer precision. Based on the resulting materials, the team will also explore theoretically and experimentally the following three device themes. 1) Beyond CMOS switches: searching for correlated effects. This represents a fundamental departure from the conventional electronic switch mechanism.  If successful, not only will the basic science in correlated electron systems be advanced, but this will also lead to more energy efficient switches, which addresses an urgent national need and grand challenge. 2) Gated RF oscillators: exploring charge density waves.  This also represents a fundamental departure from the conventional RF sources. Gated charge density waves promises a tunable RF source over an extremely wide bandwidth in the terahertz frequency region, which is a critical element in closing the THz technology gap. 3) Gated thermoelectric batteries: investigating thermoelectric properties of 2D crystals. The TMD materials have a unique combination of low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity. Their 2D nature also provides an ideal platform to investigate 2D thermoelectric effects.",

The leadership embodied in the research, teaching, mentoring, service, outreach activities in this project in turn better prepares the next generation of the STEM work force.\n\nIn this project, we embarked on the following aspects on 2D materials: epitaxy, properties and applications.  For epitaxy, we chose to use molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which uses the purest starting materials to synthesize the materials thus allowing us to identify and study defects that do not rise from impurities, instead, from intrinsic defects.  Sheets of atoms in 2D materials bond via van der Waals force.  This poses an interesting question - how does the atomic arrangement in a substrate influence the atomic arrangement in the 2D material deposited on top?  We discovered that there is a strong registry between the 2D material and the substrate albeit the interaction between them is supposed to be weak. We reported the first epitaxial growth of thin 2D heterostructures - prior to our work, the 2D heterostructures are fabricated by mechanically stacking the layers on top of each other.  We reported the first magnetic element doped 2D semiconductors by epitaxy and discovered it remains to be weakly ferromagnetic even at room temperature - prior to our work, the magnetic semiconductor can only remain ferromagnetic at cryogenic temperatures below 200 Kelvin. We discovered that WSe2 tends to oxidize at the defective sites, for example, edges of a WSe2 grain, whereas the atomic planes of WSe2 is resistant to oxidation where there is no defect.  We also successfully grew hexagonal BN using one of the few hottest MBE systems in the world: at 1800 C. For properties, we systematically studied their thermal conductivity and thermoelectric power.  It is discovered that a material tends to possess a much higher thermal conductivity if the bonds within the material are saturated.  A theoretical framework is also developed to calculate based on atomic structures their potential to generate electricity when placed in a thermal gradient.  The effects of isotopes are revisited in transition-metal dichalcogenides.  Given the significant number of isotopes are available for transition metals with significant population, it is found that treating the isotopes as perturbation can introduce large errors in calculating thermal conductivity.  Experimentally, we also measured in-plane thermal conductivity of several 2D materials including the first report on measuring and modeling the thermal conductivity of suspended monolayer MoS2.  How carriers transfer between layered materials are also very intriguing. It is found that defect and surface optical phonon scattering play animportant role, and that a 10x higher excition diffusivity is measured in exfoliated WS2 than CVD grown WS2.  It was also found in graphene-WS2 heterostructures interlayertransitions could promote electrons directly from graphene to WS2. Using atomically precise manipulation, synthetic benzene molecules were fabricated by placing 25 CO molecules on copper(111) surface using scanning probes.  Evidence for electronic transport through the synthetic benzene is observed.  We studied tunneling across planes of 2D materials, demonstrated the first Esaki tunneling diode using 2D materials; furthermore, we fabricated RF oscillators with record performance among various nanoscale materials.  \n\nDuring this project, about 8 PhD students, 4 Master students and 4 Undergraduate students were trained; our team published 22+ journal papers; our team members gave 35+ invited talks and tutorials at various conferences and delivered another 35+ presentations at conferences, research institutions and outreach activities; also the state-of-the-art research outcomes have been continuously incorporated into our education curriculum.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Huili (Grace) G Xing"
