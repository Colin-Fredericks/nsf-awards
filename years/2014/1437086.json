 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexible active composite materials combine the light weight and durability of polymers and the actuation and sensing capabilities of piezoelectric ceramics. One example of achieving active flexible composites is by embedding ferroelectric ceramic fibers in a homogeneous polymeric matrix. Active composite materials find use in many engineering applications that require controllable reconfiguration of complex 3D shapes, such as artificial skins, implantable and energy harvesting devices, or flexible robots for use in hazardous environments to name a few. Similarly, the coupled behavior makes them attractive candidates for sensors for structural health monitoring applications, i.e. damage detection in civil infrastructures such as bridges. However, despite their great potential, many of the active composite materials in use today experience suboptimal performance as well as property degradation over time. This grant addresses existing knowledge gaps by focusing on the fundamental research needed to accelerate the development of flexible active composite materials with improved long-term performance. In addition, the PIs will focus on outreach and education goals that will improve the depth, rate, and retention of learning in the training of future engineers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM-related fields and improve the scientific literacy of the public. \r\n\r\nDespite the long history of the use of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fiber-based composites, important engineering challenges still remain in understanding and predicting their behavior. These challenges are primarily related to the different frequency (rate) dependent hysteretic responses of the polymers and PZT constituents and the gradual changes in their properties under continuous cyclic loadings. This research will address this important gap in knowledge using an integrated experimental and numerical approach that is expected to have positive consequences on the reliability and widespread use of flexible active composite materials in critical applications.  Models will be built to integrate the time-dependent and electro-mechanical coupled responses of the different constituents to the overall deformations in flexible active composite materials.  Additionally, these models will be enhanced to incorporate the gradual changes in the nonlinear properties of the active composites and their constituents under various electro-mechanical loading conditions. Based on the models, prototype composites with targeted improved performance behaviors will be processed and characterized. Understanding the relationships between processing and life performance of flexible active composite materials will inform manufacturing and enable wide-spread utilization of such systems for engineering applications.",

The use of active composites offers great potential for the development of adaptive foldable (flexible) structures that allows for controllable reconfiguration into various three-dimensional (3D) shapes and has many engineering applications, e.g. implantable and energy harvesting devices, flexible robots, etc. One example of achieving active flexible composites is by embedding ferroelectric ceramic, of fibers and/or particles, in homogeneous polymeric matrix, termed as electro-active composites. The existence of soft polymers contribute to the flexibility of the composites and the ferroelectric ceramics allows for inducing shape changes by prescribing electric field. In many applications, the active composites are subjected to continuous and simultaneous cycles of mechanical and electric field inputs, leading to nonlinear hysteretic behaviors and strong coupling between various physical properties in the composites. These nonlinear hysteretic behaviors could have detrimental impact on continuous operation of the electro-active composites. Polymers exhibit viscoelastic behavior, show rate-dependent hysteretic behaviors and dissipate energy under cyclic mechanical loading and electric field input. Likewise when the ferroelectric ceramics, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>), are subjected to cyclic electric field, they undergo rate-dependent hysteretic electro-mechanical response. The dissipation of energy causes temperature increases and these temperature changes alter the properties of the materials. In order to better predict life performance of active composites and design these composites with desired performances, it is imperative to understand the load transfer mechanisms between the active and inactive constituents and their time-dependent hysteretic responses under coupled multi-field inputs.</p>\n<p>This study aims at understanding the effects of time, loading rates, and electro-mechanical coupling behaviors on the hysteretic performance of active composites and to predict performance of compliant (flexible) structures stimulated by electric field inputs at multiple time scales. Elucidating the physical mechanisms responsible for the time-dependent response and the cyclic loading-induced property degradation in active composites is key to implementing materials-based and processing-based solutions. This understanding will enhance the reliability of using active composites in engineering applications.</p>\n<p>Highlights of research findings are summarized below:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimental tests on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fibers under both cyclic mechanical and electric fields indicated significant nonlinear and hysteretic responses. The hysteretic responses were associated with microstructural changes (movements of the dipole moments) of the PZT fibers. A constitutive model was formulated in order to capture the hysteretic electro-mechanical responses while incorporating the effect of microstructural changes. The model showed good comparisons with experimental data (<strong>Image 1</strong>).</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hysteretic electro-mechanical responses of the PZT and active fiber composites (AFC) comprising of PZT fiber and polymer matrix showed time-dependent behaviors. Cyclic loadings accumulated heat generation from the energy dissipation, increasing the temperature in the materials. Higher frequency leads to more heat generation (<strong>Image 2</strong>).</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The studied AFC was used as an actuator in thin and flexible members, i.e., beams and plates made of viscoelastic materials. By prescribing electric field input through the AFC, various shape reconfigurations can be achieved. The time-dependent characteristics in both AFC and viscoelastic members leads to delayed responses (<strong>Image 3</strong>).</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Micromechanical models with idealized microstructures were formulated in order to predict the overall time-dependent electro-mechanical responses in active composites. The micromechanics models were used to predict lateral displacements of functionally graded active beams under electric field inputs and hysteretic responses of hybrid composites at different electric field amplitude. At high electric field input, saturation polarization is achieved (<strong>Image 4</strong>).</p>\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barium titanate silver active composites were also studied for their mechanical responses under uniaxial compression. The hysteretic responses during loading-unloading cycles were associated with dipolar switching. A material model was formulated in order to capture the cyclic response. Micromechanics models with actual and idealized inclusions were used to study the effective elastic and shear moduli (<strong>Image 5</strong>).</p>\n<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thermal and electrical properties of barium titanate silver active composites were predicted using micromechanics models with both actual and idealized microstructures. Pores slightly decreases the effective dielectric constants since pores in the ceramic serve as electric flux barriers. Non-uniform electric field distribution is expected, and since silver particles serve as internal electrodes, electric fields flow along those conductive particles. A micromechanical model was also used to understand variations in the field variables, i.e. temperature and heat flux, in the hot disk experiment for composite materials, and its implication in determining the overall thermal properties of composites, i.e., thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and heat capacity (<strong>Image 6</strong>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anastasia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Muliana</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1437086/1437086_10319529_1549038661029_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1437086/1437086_10319529_1549038661029_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1437086/1437086_10319529_1549038661029_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hysteretic Responses of Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) Ceramics Fibers</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">A.
