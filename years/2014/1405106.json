 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyhedral surfaces are produced at an alarming rate ranging from 3-D scanning to medical imaging in the digital world these days. Almost all surfaces appeared in any computer screen are polyhedral surfaces. An urgent task is to produce a coarse categorization and classification of these surfaces. A mile stone result in mathematics dealing with surfaces is the classical uniformization theorem of Poincare-Koebe.  It is an extremely powerful tool to classify smooth surfaces in the 3-space up to angle preserving diffeomorphisms (i.e., conformality). However, to algorithmically implement the classical uniformization theorem is very difficult. The PI and his collaborators introduced a discrete counterpart of conformality and proved a discrete version of uniformization theorem for polyhedral surfaces recently. This proposal investigates theoretically whether the discrete conformal geometry converges to the smooth conformal geometry as triangulation meshes become finer and finer.  The numerical evidences for the convergence are very strong.  The successful resolution of the convergence issue will have impacts on the applications of the discrete uniformization theorem in many fields.\r\n\r\nThe classical uniformization theorem of Poincare and Koebe is the most powerful tool to classify smooth surfaces with Riemannian metrics according to conformal diffeomorphisms.  This theorem is one of the pillars of the 20th century mathematics and has a wide range of applications within and outside mathematics. However, it is very difficult to use it algorithmically for categorizing polyhedral surfaces. Luo and his collaborators introduced a notion of discrete conformality for polyhedral surfaces and proved a discrete uniformization theorem recently. Two main features of the discrete conformality are the following. First, the discrete conformality is algorithmic and second, there exists a finite dimensional (convex) variational principle to find the discrete uniformization metric. The goal of the proposal is to investigate several major remaining issues in the discrete conformal geometry of polyhedral surfaces. For instance, there are strong numerical evidences suggesting that the discrete conformality converges to smooth (classical) conformality when the triangulations are suitably chosen. However, a theoretical proof of it is still lacking. This is the main problem to be resolved in the proposal. Luo plans to use the finite dimensional variational principles that he developed in the past 10 years to approach the convergence problem.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigates geometry of surfaces and its real-world applications.  Classical geometry of surfaces initiated by Gauss investigates the notions of distances and curvatures.  On the other hand, conformal geometry of surfaces introduced by Riemann, which is the main subject of this project, focuses on the notion of angles on surfaces.  A fundamental theorem in conformal geometry was established by Poincare and Koebe in 1908. It shows that any simply connected surfaces in the 3-space can be mapped,  in the one-to-one and onto manner, to the round 2-sphere, or the plane, or the unit disk so that the mapping preserves the notation of angles.  This is the famous uniformization theorem and an angle preserving one-to-one mapping is called a conformal diffeomorphism.  A consequence of this theorem is that any region in the plane encircled by a non-self intersecting loop can be conformally mapped to the unit disk.  This fundamental theorem has many real-world applications including medical imaging, computer graphics and video games.  However, the proofs of the uniformization theorem do not provide any algorithms on how to compute the conformal maps.  The outcomes of this project produce a practical algorithm to compute the conformal maps and theoretically verify the convergence of the algorithm.\n\n \n\nMathematically, the project investigates polyhedral surfaces which are made of Euclidean triangles and the associated discrete conformal geometry.  Polyhedral surfaces are ubiquitous due to digitization and can be coded by a computer algorithm easily. All surfaces we see and deal with using computers are polyhedral. Classical smooth surfaces are the limits of and can be approximated by polyhedral surfaces.  The main goal of the project seeks a counterpart of the uniformization theorem for polyhedral surfaces. This requires an understanding of conformality in the setting of polyhedral surfaces.  The outcome of the project introduces a notion of discrete conformality among polyhedral surfaces.  The second goal of the project is to establish a discrete uniformization theorem with respect to the discrete conformality.   This is also solved in the project for all compact polyhedral surfaces.  The last goal of the project is to show that discrete conformal maps approximate the conformal maps produced by the classical uniformization theorem when the polyhedral surfaces converge to the smooth surface.  The outcome of the project solves the convergence problem for simply connected surfaces and theoretically guarantees that algorithm is sound.\n\n \n\nConformality is a very useful principle to organize surfaces.  Classical Teichmueller theory investigates the set of all surfaces of a given topological type so that two of these surfaces are considered to be the same if they are conformally diffeomorphic. This theory is one of the most useful and powerful tools for investigating smooth surfaces.  The outcome of the project provides a new and efficient algorithm to organize polyhedral surfaces of the same topological type with the same set of vertices according to discrete conformality.   It will be useful for categorize and classify polyhedral surfaces.  Mathematicians and computer scientists who are working with digital surfaces and 2-dimensional data sets will benefit from this research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Feng Luo"
