 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spanish is the second most-spoken language in the U.S., after English, and 17% of the country's population self-identify as Hispanic or Latino/a. A significant percentage of U.S.-Latinos are bilingual to different degrees. Most U.S.-born Latinos have Spanish as their heritage language, but are dominant in English. Given the demographic importance of this population and an increased awareness in the research community of the benefits of bilingualism, determining the linguistic competence of these heritage speakers of Spanish in their two languages is a socially-relevant topic of research.\r\n\r\nAlthough heritage language acquisition is recently gaining more attention, research in this area is still very scarce. This dissertation will contribute to a better understanding of heritage speakers' linguistic system by examining their phonology, more specifically, the use of word- and sentence-level stress cues in the perception and production of Spanish by US Spanish heritage speakers. Although word stress is contrastive in both Spanish and English, it is realized differently in the two languages. Unlike English in which segmental cues (i.e., individual sounds like consonants and vowels) play a critical role in the distinction between stressed and unstressed syllables, in Spanish the distinction occurs more on the suprasegmental level (i.e., pitch, amplitude, and duration). Therefore, studies have shown that English listeners experience great difficulty in perceiving stress in Spanish. Using a set of psycholinguistic experiments, this dissertation examines whether Spanish heritage speakers successfully attend to suprasegmental cues when they perceive Spanish stress. Moreover, Spanish heritage speakers' production will be acoustically analyzed to investigate whether they effectively use suprasegmental cues when they produce Spanish stress. Results between their perception and production will be compared to see whether different patterns are found in these two domains. Since it has been reported that heritage speakers grow up hearing the heritage language more frequently than speaking it, asymmetrical acquisition of perception and production is likely to occur. Spanish heritage speakers' performance will be compared to that of Spanish monolinguals and English second language learners of Spanish, in order to see whether Spanish heritage speakers differ from these two groups, and, if so, in which aspects and to what extent. Analyzing the ways in which heritage speakers may differ from monolingual speakers and second language learners will help determine the best methodologies to achieve balanced competence in two languages.",

Although lexical stress and nuclear stress exist in both Spanish and English, due to cross-linguistic differences between the two languages, second language (L2) learners of Spanish with English as their first language (L1) are found to have great difficulties acquiring them in Spanish. The overarching goal of this study was to examine whether transfer from English is also observed in Spanish heritage speakers. Spanish heritage speakers are linguistically a unique population, because, while their early and immersed exposure to Spanish (i.e., the home language; usually their L1) puts them in an advantageous position with regard to their linguistic knowledge of the language, compared to those who learned it as adults, lack of intergenerational transmission is evident in this population, as demonstrated in shift to English (i.e., the majority language of the society; usually their L2).</p>\n<p>Twenty-four Spanish heritage speakers who are English-dominant participated in four experimental studies &mdash; two tasks for the perception of lexical stress and nuclear stress and two tasks for the production of lexical stress and nuclear stress &mdash; and their behaviors were compared to those of 24 Spanish monolingual native speakers and 20 English L2 learners of Spanish. Results showed that, while the heritage speakers performed similarly to the monolingual speakers in the perception of lexical stress and nuclear stress, they showed deviant patterns in their production, mainly in the alignment of the pitch (f0) peak. That is, in the production of lexical stress, heritage speakers&rsquo; f0 peak aligned earlier in oxytones (e.g., <em>Can<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">t&oacute;</span></strong></em>) than in paroxytones (e.g., <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Can</span></em></strong><em>to</em>) and in the production of nuclear stress, their f0 peak aligned earlier when the target word was focused (e.g., <em>Eduardo</em> in <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Edgardo</span></em></strong><em> lo mir&oacute;.</em>) than when it was not (e.g., <em>Eduardo</em> in <em>Eduardo lo <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">mir&oacute;</span></strong></em>) (see Figures 1 and 2). Such patterns were not found in the production of monolingual speakers. With regard to L2 learners, their behaviors showed divergent patterns from the monolingual speakers not only in their production, but also in their perception of lexical stress and nuclear stress.</p>\n<p>The findings suggest that, despite being English-dominant, thanks to early and immersed exposure to the heritage language, heritage speakers have a clear advantage over L2 learners in their perception of heritage language speech sounds. However, such an advantage is not always guaranteed in their production. Discrepancy between heritage speakers&rsquo; perception and production is likely to be due to asymmetry in their use of Spanish. That is, heritage speakers tend to speak the heritage language much less frequently than they hear it. As bilinguals who can easily move between two languages and cultures are valuable assets to society, maintaining the heritage language will provide numerous benefits to heritage speakers in the U.S. (e.g., open-mindedness to different perspectives, more job opportunities, enhancement of professional success). The findings of this dissertation support that, without continued use of heritage language, not only in the perception, but also in the production, early and immersed exposure to the language alone may not automatically lead to successful heritage language maintenance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ji-Young&nbsp;Kim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1424329/1424329_10324646_1470095027454_lexicalstress--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1424329/1424329_10324646_1470095027454_lexicalstress--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lexical stress\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1424329/1424329_10324646_1470095027454_lexicalstress--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lexical stress\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
