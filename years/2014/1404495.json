 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of cosmic ray sources and the mechanisms that accelerate cosmic rays to ultrahigh energies are among the most important questions in astrophysics.  Answering these questions involves measurements of the energy spectrum and composition of cosmic rays as well as searches for anisotropy in their arrival directions as a direct way of identifying sources.  The University of Utah Cosmic Ray Physics Group has primary responsibility for the Telescope Array (TA), which is the largest detector for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in the northern hemisphere. With this award the University of Utah Cosmic Ray Group will continue to collect and analyze the data from TA and the TA Low Energy Extension (TALE) with the goal of addressing these astrophysics questions.  Their main education and outreach activity is the ASPIRE Project, which creates and maintains interactive science lessons and labs on the web.  ASPIRE also provides direct outreach to area teachers, runs summer workshops for students, and makes visits to rural schools. The Lon and Mary Watson Cosmic Ray Center in Delta, Utah, is the center of TA outreach work, and of field operations. The building includes a visitor's center, with TA exhibits, including a real-time detector display.\r\n\r\nThe University of Utah Cosmic Ray Physics Group has a long history of studying the spectrum, composition, and sources of the highest energy particles in the universe.  The coming three-year award period should see important developments with increased statistics, access to lower energy data, and improved analysis and coordination.  The Utah group is studying the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum in detail to the low energies available through TALE, pursuing possible correlations with the large scale structure to refine TA composition measurements, and studying evidence of anisotropy to search for the sources of cosmic rays.  In addition, the group is working with the Pierre Auger collaboration to understand differences in composition measurements between the two experiments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Telescope Array (TA) Experiment is an international collaboration involving research groups from the U.S., Japan, Belgium, Russia and South Korea.   The University of Utah Cosmic Ray group plays the role of host for the TA experiment, and also operates and maintains all facilities for the TA observatories. \n\nThe primary scientific goal of the TA experiment is to discover the origin and the acceleration mechanism for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECR).  These are the highest energy particles known to humanity, coming from outer-space with energies beyond 1020 electron volts (eV).  An electron-volt is a unit originally used by chemists at the start of the 20th Century, convenient for describing energies exchanged in chemical processes involving a single atom or molecule.  By comparison, the particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are only about 1013 eV.  The origin of UHECR remains an enigma.  The physics issues (what is the nature of the sources? and how do they accelerate particles to such high energies?) are among the most important questions in physics for the 21st Century, as identified by the Turner Panel [1]. \n\nTA currently operates 52 fluorescence telescopes (eight more under construction) distributed over three sites.  These overlook an array of 618 surface detectors, 3m2 in area, sprinkled across over 700 km2 of Utah desert.   Together, these facilities approach the scale of a small national laboratory.\n\nBy the end of 2018, TA will have been in operation for 10 years.  Among the important contributions by TA are the observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz?min (GZK) cutoff in the cosmic ray spectrum (interaction between the cosmic rays and the microwave background remnant of the big bang), and improvements in the composition measurement at the highest energies from the previous generation of detectors.  The interpretation of cosmic ray origins from the knee to the middle of the 1018 eV decade has been determined from TA and TALE (TA Low Energy Extension) data; we measured the composition of cosmic rays up to 1019 eV in the northern sky; and anisotropy signals have been found, and finally first measurements of extra-galactic magnetic fields are being made.\n\nThe TA reported an indication of an excess in the arrival directions of UHE cosmic rays just off the Super-Galactic Plane in the vicinity of Ursa Major.  A total of 19 of the 72 TA events above 5.7x1019 eV was found within a 20&deg;-radius circle, corresponding to a 5.1&sigma; excess.  In other words, just over one quarter of the highest energy events seen lie within just ~6% of its field-of-view in the northern sky.  The chance probability that an isotropic distribution of sources can produce such a hotspot is estimated to be  ~3.4&sigma;.\n\nThe cut-off energy for the hot spot analysis, 5.7x1019 eV, is very close to the GZK threshold for photo-pion (&Delta;+ resonance) production from cosmic-ray protons propagating though the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. Hence, most of the events  likely originated from within 50 megaparsecs of the Earth.  The magnetic deflection of protons over this distance in the intergalactic magnetic field should be small and particles retain some memory of their origin.  The TA hotspot may represent a local source of UHE cosmic rays. A confirmation of this discovery with additional data would represent a transformative advance in UHE cosmic ray physics. \n\nTo this end, the TA collaboration has begun an expansion project called TAx4. With 500 additional detectors distributed over two lobes, the array will quadruple the area of the existing array. The improved statistics will allow us to study the hotspot in greater detail.  As of 8/2018, four northern TA&times;4 telescopes have been completed and are being commissioned. The southern TAx4 site is under construction.   \n\nTALE extends the energy coverage of the TA observatory to over 5 orders-of-magnitude: from 3&times;1015 eV to &gt;1020 eV.  TALE provides crucial coverage in the range of energies between 1015-1018 eV, where the flux of cosmic rays is thought to transition from galactic origin to extra-galactic.  Theoretically this would mean a transition from light elements at the low end of this range to heavier nuclei, up to iron, before giving away to light elements of extra-galactic origin again at the high end of this range.  TALE was specifically designed to observe this predicted transition.\n\nThe project employs numerous post-docs, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even high school students.   Students receive a training in physics, optics, lasers, electronics, computer programming and hardware, data collection, analysis, modeling, etc.\n\nOur ASPIRE outreach project has provided both online and in-person science outreach efforts.  Efforts are both formal or provided in a role to bring classroom content and support for K-12 teachers and students, and informal where science topics and presentations are provided outside of the classroom.\n\nWe also collaborate with a number of associated experiments who come to the site to test equipment and take data. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John N Matthews"
