 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twelve undergraduate students are competitively selected to spend 3 summer months at the Space Physics Research Laboratory in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences, University of Michigan, where each works with one of the over 40 faculty members (of which up to 15-20 regularly participate) doing research in Airglow and Atmospheric Science, Space Plasma Physics, Earth and Planetary Ionospheres and Magnetospheres, Air Pollution Transport, and Planetary Atmospheres. The students have opportunities to interact with their mentors, other undergraduate students in the program, graduate students at the university and other faculty members and research staff. They are able to have hands on experience working with instrumentation, which has flown or will fly in space, making in situ and remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, and fabricating and calibrating components of these state-of-the-art systems. They are also able to choose to construct and work with software packages, which solve analytical expressions, analyze space flight data in image forms, and manipulate large databases. A portion of their experience involves attending weekly seminars given by the faculty/staff, writing up their work in a report for their mentor (which may be publishable), and presenting their report orally to the students and staff.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposed program is contained in the actual accomplishment of research work that is produced. Some of the projects have or will directly result in journal publications or presentations at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nBeyond this the broader impact is inherent in the fundamental purpose of the REU program, which is to engender interest and research experience in the atmospheric and space sciences in students who might pursue these areas as a career. In this regard we have made special efforts and have been reasonably successful in attracting both women and underrepresented minorities to these fields of physical science. Furthermore in recent years nearly one summer REU student per year has returned a year or two later as an incoming graduate student in our own M.S., M.Eng., or Ph.D. programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF grant and its predecessors have supported a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan for over 25 years.  Under the current one-year grant 12 undergraduate students from around the country spent 12 weeks of the summer of 2014 at the University of Michigan working on research projects with various faculty mentors all of whom are recognized experts in their respective areas of research.  While research is generally in the areas of atmospheric and space sciences, individual projects ranged from studying the effects of aerosols on tropical cyclones, the effects of aerosols on the Great Plains, aspects of solar wind including coronal mass ejections, the magnetosphere of the planet Mercury, glacial ice, and to the upper atmospheres of the planet Venus and Saturn's large moon Titan.\n\n \n\nIn addition to spending most of their activities participating in new original research projects the students participated in several general programs to broaden their total experience.  All students took a tutorial on Research Practice Foundations and Authorships from the University's Office of Research and Sponsored Projects.  Since most of the students are graduate school bound, they were offered and took an 8-week Graduate Record Exam preparation course at no cost to them from the Princeton Review.  All of the students attended our special weekly series of faculty seminars that are especially geared toward the broad range of students' backgrounds participating in our program. All students that participated in research projects that involved laboratory or experimental work took the OSHE lab safety class.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the summer all the students wrote an extended term-paper style final written report and made a formal half-hour presentation of their project results at our annual end of the summer student seminar and luncheon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael R Combi"
