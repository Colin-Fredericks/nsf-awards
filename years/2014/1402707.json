 "awd_abstract_narration": "1402707\r\nSick, Volker\r\nTitle:  Volumetrically resolved single-shot single-access-point imaging of translucent objects\r\n\r\nThis program uses light-field camera technology to develop a new diagnostic tool that measures instantaneous three-dimensional (3D) structures of translucent objects such as illuminated sprays or flame fronts in combustion systems. This information will enable breakthrough discoveries in combustion research by enhancing the development of predictive capability for practical engine design.  Combining the expertise of faculty from mechanical and electrical engineering enables this project. The research work is integrated into a range of innovative learning experiences that contribute broadly to recruiting and educating the scientific and engineering work force. Efforts include demonstrated strategies for diversity and inclusion and entrepreneurial activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, measurements of the instantaneous 3D structure of combustion processes are only possible with very high experimental effort and for conditions that are optimized for optical access. Plenoptic or light-field imaging creates new opportunities in this context. A single optical port is sufficient to capture images that can be processed to form a 3D reconstruction of the observed scene. This capability is critical for improved understanding of how 3D structure affects anything from mixing of fuel and air to combustion initiation and flame propagation. This in turn is critical to develop improved combustion processes for cleaner and more efficient energy production. 3D reconstruction methods for plenoptic images of scenes with solid boundaries at surfaces have been developed and are available. The efforts here will focus on image formation methods for translucent objects, such as illuminated fuel sprays or the flame front structure of a turbulent flame. Luminosity-enhancing additives such as alkali compounds can help to increase the signal intensity. 3D imaging concepts envisioned here have high potential for commercial viability and applications outside of combustion research with a broader scientific and economic impact. This can be promoted via MConneX, a new web-based platform at the University of Michigan to share new research and education efforts with students, faculty, and alums.",
