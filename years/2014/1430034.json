 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and The Joint Research Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI). The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. This group developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\n\r\nWorking together the Belmont Forum and JPI-FACCE have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to food security and land use change.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  \r\n\r\nThis project will involve researchers from the UK, USA, India, Brazil, South Africa and Australia who will work together to develop an international network to understand the environmental and social benefits and trade-offs that arise through the continued global expansion of sugarcane production, and its broader consequences for land use and food security. The project will focus on the agricultural economies especially those that under pressure to improve resource efficiency and increase resilience.  The group will identify and assess the factors contributing to increased sugar cane production; how this increased production is affecting land-use, water resources and ecosystems and the broad-range of socio-economic impacts, benefits and tradeoffs related to how the land is being used.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSugarcane cultivation has expanded rapidly around the world, but the impacts of that expansion on water resources and society have not been well documented.  Sugarcane is a unique agro-industrial crop where the growers and processing industries are mutually dependent, resulting in a different kind of relationship between industry and the agricultural sector.  Sugarcane has the potential to increase farmer incomes, but in some cases has resulted in displacement of traditional crops and smallholders.  Sugarcane also uses more water than other crops, and so has the potential to negatively impact water resources downstream. \n\nThe objective of this project was to develop an international network of researchers and industry representatives with expertise in water resources, social science, and industrial activities.  Participants included academics from the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, India, and Brazil, and industry representatives from the United Kingdom and South Africa.  The main project activity was to hold a workshop for participates in South Africa in February, 2015, which included interviews with growers, industry representatives, and other stakeholders.  The outcome of the workshop was a review paper on the hydrosocial impacts of sugarcane, which was published in the leading journal Global Environmental Change. That paper and a second paper on the impact of sugarcane on water scarcity in southern India were presented at an international conference of the Global Land Project in Beijing, China, in 2016.  The funding also provided partial support to a project that developed techniques for mapping crop water use using satellite imagery, which was described in a journal article in Water Resources Research.  The technique will be useful in a wide range of applications, and is currently being used to map sugarcane water use in Zambia.\n\nThe intellctual merit of the project was to develop interdiscplinary understanding of the water and social impacts of sugarcane expansion, and undertaking that requires participation of a wide range of scientists from multiple continents where sugarcane expansion is occurring.  The broader impact of the project was the development of a network of researchers who are performing research together on the sustainability of sugarcane production, and dissemination of the results to both the academic community and industry, with the aim of improving sustainable practices that maximize benefits and minimize negative impacts of sugarcane on the environment and society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Trent Biggs"
