 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop new statistical models to facilitate the analysis of human performance data.  The improved techniques will reduce the need for ad hoc data processing and increase the amount of data available for analysis.  The factors that influence human performance usually extend beyond those identified as important by a researcher's restricted theoretical framework.  A person's level of education, for example, may well influence performance of a simple task for which a theory of perception concerns only levels of illumination and spatial location.  As a result, it often is difficult to determine why particular people fail to perform tasks as expected.  Researchers rely on ad hoc strategies to identify and remove from a data set people who perform poorly or who seem unmotivated.  Such strategies generally have little theoretical justification and thus have the potential to degrade the information available in the data and to introduce bias in the conclusions drawn from the data.  The models developed in this research will help ensure the accuracy of conclusions drawn from experiments on human performance.  These models will be of interest to researchers across a range of disciplines that care about human performance data and also may be applied to other types of data in medicine, engineering, and finance.  New software will be developed and made available to other researchers.  The project will contribute to the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in Psychology and Statistics and help further connections between those disciplines.\r\n\r\nLearning about the processes that determine how well people perform tasks in different circumstances requires at least two things: first, a theoretical framework consisting of models that can predict how the human cognitive system responds to and interacts with the environment, and, second, accurate and robust statistical techniques that can be used to analyze data within the context of these models.  The investigators will develop hierarchical Bayesian models that incorporate stimulus-independent response strategies to minimize the need for data pre-processing.  The models will separate task appropriate (stimulus-dependent) from task inappropriate ( stimulus-independent) responding in such a way that (i) no data need to be removed, and (ii) task performance changes over time can be examined within a coherent theoretical framework.  The researchers will collect new data from experiments that will provoke people to move from task-appropriate to task-inappropriate performance strategies over time.  This will enable the investigators to evaluate their theories of human performance and the techniques they will develop to analyze the data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPsychologists want to understand how the mind works.  However, different people do things in different ways, and people often change how they do something in the middle of performing a task.  Human cognition is complicated, and the only way to learn about it and test theories about it is to design mathematical models of what might be happening in the brain.  These models provide a structure for how information is moved around, and what kinds of information are responsible for decisions and thebehavior that results from those decisions.  Because the processes involved in cognition are very complex, it is hard to build models that accurately reflect everything that might be going on.  Many important and useful models of cognition are in fact very simple and ignore all the possible complexities involved in explaining people and their performance.  While simplifying what might be happening in the brain greatly simplifies the work involved in designing experiments and analyzing data, andwhile psychological science has made great progress in understanding how the brain works on the basis of these kinds of models, future progress will require that we address the individual differences that people bring to the solution of a problem.\n\nThis project was devoted to designing models that were more realistic, in that they included multiple components that allowed people to change over time, and that allowed people to be different from each other in simple ways.  Because these ``mixture'' models are significantly more complex than standard models of cognition, they require considerably more sophisticated statistical techniques to fit them to data and evaluate their effectiveness.  Accomplishing the goals of the project thereforerequired a collaboration between psychologists and statisticians.\n\nOne of the most important outcomes of this work was to show that the use of mixture models leads to a better understanding not only of how people perform simple tasks, but also how they fail.  While people who are successful are usually successful for all the same reasons (they pay attention, they remember appropriate information, and they use it effectively), people who fail fail for sometimes very different reasons (they don't pay attention, or they pay attention but are unable to rememberinformation, etc.).  Our models are the first to be able to identify individual differences in failure.  This finding has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses and learning disabilities: we can better design interventions to improve the cognitive function of people with impairments if we know why they are having difficulties.\n\nHuman performance data is collected routinely in a range of scientific disciplines.  Outside of psychology, this includes education, where testing and mental measurement is key, and engineering, where machine interfaces are evaluated by measuring the speed and accuracy with which people can interact with them.  In all these disciplines, more realistic models such as the mixture models we have developed can lead to a better understanding of how people succeed and fail and how best to assist them.  In addition, the statistical procedures that we developed to analyze data with these models can be used to solve similar problems in a range of other disciplines, including economics, climatology, and geology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Trisha Van Zandt"
