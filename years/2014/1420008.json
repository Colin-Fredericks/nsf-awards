The project will use behavioral and brain imaging methods to examine when problems are solved using symbols versus images.  The results will be used to develop a computational model of mathematical reasoning, and to inform practices for teaching math.  This project will advance the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in studying the cognitive and neural basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning.\r\n\r\nThe project will use fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to study brain activity, focusing on brain regions including the RLPFC (rostrolateral prefrontal cortex) and AG (angular gyrus).  The computational modeling will take place using the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) model.  The main theoretical focus will be how symbolic and visuospatial processes are used and integrated during math learning and problem-solving.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research was focused on understanding the cognitive processes underlying STEM learning and education, taking advantage of new methods in brain imaging.   We were specifically interested in how spatial reasoning and symbolic manipulation are used to solve mathematical problems.  We developed novel classes of problems that could either be answered by spatial reasoning or by symbolic information.   It was easier for students to learn the spatial strategies for solution and these strategies were better retained over extended periods.   These strategies required imagining spatial transformations of problems and worked well with relatively simple problems.   However, as the amount of information needed to solve the problems increased, students found it hard to imagine all the required spatial information and symbolic manipulation strategies became more effective.   The difficulty of spatial solution strategies for complex problems did decrease with practice but spatial reasoning never was as effective as symbolic manipulation.\n\nTo more deeply understand how students were solving these problems we have developed methods for using brain imaging data to track what students are doing while they are solving these problems.    These methods were able to identify for each problem when students were coming up with a representation of how to solve the problem, when they were working out the answer, and when they were preparing to report their answers.  When solving the problems with a spatial strategy, the first, problem-formulation stage had the strongest engagement of brain regions associated with spatial processing.  Later stages involved areas associated with arithmetic operations.   When these students could not solve these problems they tended to be stuck in the first problem formulation stage.   In contrast, students applying a symbol manipulation strategy engaged verbal processing regions during problem formulation.   Given the algorithmic nature of the symbol manipulation strategy, they did not get stuck in problem formulation.\n\nPart of the project involved the development of the HSMM-MVPA method for processing data from neural imaging, which can be applied to functional magnetic imagery, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography.  This involves using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for recognizing high-dimensional patterns in brain imaging that signal cognitive processes and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM) to recognize when these patterns occur in time.  This was used to parse mathematical problem solving into the three stages discussed above.\n\nThe research suggests complementary roles for spatial reasoning and symbol manipulation in instruction of mathematical problem solving.   A focus on spatial representations is particularly useful for learning and maintaining knowledge.   While purely spatial problem solving can be useful for solving simple problems, students need to learn how to use symbolic methods for more complex problems.  Students should be taught when to rely on spatial reasoning and when to rely on symbolic manipulation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John R Anderson"
