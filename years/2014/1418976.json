Consider observing a collection of discrete events within a network that reflect how network nodes influence one another. Such data are common in spike trains recorded from biological neural networks, interactions within a social network, and a variety of other settings.

We developed methods for estimating self-excitation parameters and inferring the underlying functional network structure from self-exciting point process data. We also developed new methods for denoising and reconstructing images corrupted by Poisson noise. Poisson noise arises in the context of counting the emission or scattering of photons. In various application domains, such as astronomy and medical imaging, photons counts are low resulting in very low signal-to-noise ratio images.
