 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project leverages prior work on virtual mobile network technology at NICT and the MobilityFirst future Internet architecture at WINLAB, Rutgers University, to develop a comprehensive services and networking solution for high-performance cyber physical systems that scales to the \"trillion object\" level targeted by the JUNO program.  The aim is to develop a virtual mobile cloud network (vMCN) which provides seamless and low latency services to real-time mobile users and applications.\r\n  \r\nMajor research themes addressed by this project include the design of a new virtual networking framework using NICT's BYON mobile cloud technology integrated with MobilityFirst's globally unique identifier (GUID) based protocol stack; design of virtual  network services for efficient support of cloud services; exploiting locality to speed up global name resolution; and dynamic migration of cloud services across networks.   The project will adopt a top-down application driven methodology to validate and benchmark the performance of the proposed virtual mobile cloud network for a specific advanced CPS application.  A proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed vMCN system will be developed using JGN-X and GENI testbeds in Japan and US respectively.\r\n\r\nTechnologies resulting from this project are expected to enable a wide range of commercial and government applications involving real-time cloud services for mobile devices.  The project will also provide guidance for the development of future virtual network technologies of increasing interest to the networking and computer industries.  The proposed collaboration will also help to strengthen research ties between US and Japan specifically in the field of future Internet architecture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis was a joint US-Japan research project involving a collaboration between WINLAB, Rutgers University and NICT (National Institute of Information and Communications Technology), Japan.  The project was aimed at design and prototype validation of a new concept (virtual mobile cloud network) for providing low latency network service to real-time cyberphysical (CPS) applications.\n\nThe project resulted in design, evaluation and validation of the proposed vMCN (virtual mobile cloud network) architecture for delivery of low-latency edge cloud services in future mobile networks.  The architecture integrated key design concepts of MobilityFirst identifier-based routing previously developed by the Rutgers PI?s with the bring your own network (BYON) concept from the NICT, Japan group.  The integrated design of the vMCN system was implemented in two prototypes, one at WINLAB, Rutgers University and the other at NICT.  The prototype was used to carry out several experiments aimed at evaluating the benefits of vVMCN for latency sensitive applications.  In a series of joint experiments conducted on the ORBIT testbed at WINLAB, we were able to demonstrate significant reductions in latency, both in terms of averages and percentiles, confirming the value of the proposed vMCN system for low latency cloud CPS applications. \n\nThese results motivated us to pursue further system studies of edge cloud services aimed at an improved understanding of design trade-offs associated with low latency applications.  The first study (called SEGUE) evaluated algorithms for placement and migration of computing tasks in a centralized SDN-based edge cloud network, showing how gains in latency performance can be achieved via dynamic migration and load balancing.  The second study examined multiplayer games (MMOGs) in context of edge cloud and showed how hybrid partitioning of the game between the core cloud and edge cloud can provide latency gains over conventional centralized cloud implementations.  Finally, we have also developed an application level demo system for the vMCN architecture for an augmented reality scenario in which a user moves from one painting to another in a museum and receives real-time annotation information about the paintings on Google glass or similar display device.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dipankar Raychaudhuri"
