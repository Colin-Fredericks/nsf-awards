 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by the complementary abilities of humans and humanoids, the objective of this proposal is to develop the science and technology necessary for realizing human-robot cooperative object manipulation and transportation. The key concepts that this research seeks to promote are adaptability to human activity under minimal communication, and robustness to variability and uncertainty in the environment, achieved through a layered representation and deliberate processing of the available information. Moreover, this project aims to make maximum use of a minimal set of sensors to plan and control the actions of the robot, while ensuring safe and efficient cooperative transportation.  The embodiment of this research is a humanoid co-worker that bears most of the load, when helping a person to carry an object, without requiring excessive communication, or prior training on the part of the human.\r\n\r\nBy introducing concrete methods for human-robot physical collaboration in semi-structured environments, this project enables a unique synergy between robots and humans that has the potential to increase productivity, and reduce accidents and injuries. In doing so, it also promotes the advancement of new practical applications of robots in construction, manufacturing, logistics, and home services. By developing open-source, portable algorithms for humanoid robots and mobile manipulators, this effort results in cost and time savings for researchers, developers, educators, and end-users in robotics. Finally, through an aggressive educational and community outreach plan, and by actively engaging K-12 students in an exciting RoboTech Fellows program, this project seeks to increase diversity and attract underrepresented groups to STEM.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMaterial-handling is the loading, unloading, stacking, pulling, pushing and lift-and-carry of objects.  Such tasks are common in a wide-range of settings such as factories, distribution centers, farms, and construction sites.  Using robots for general-purpose and autonomous material-handling, especially in unstructured environments, remains an open challenge.  The key is loco-manipulation, where whole-body motion planning must coordinate with dexterous manipulation and agile locomotion.  A conceptual example is transporting water jugs in New York City buildings; elevators in the 2003 black out were inoperable, forcing residents to climb multi-floor stairways with heavy water jugs.  Loco-manipulation demands one to coordinate their walking gait with their arm motions and hand grasp to prevent sloshing and losing balance while stair-climbing.  This lift-and-carry task is tiring and difficult for people, let alone for a biped humanoid robot.  The intellectual merit of this NRI-Large was to apply the following approach: determine the state of the robot and its environment; devise suitable grasping and manipulation algorithms; and design locomotion algorithms; introduce motion planning to move in human-centric environments.  Broader impacts academically, include increased understanding of loco-manipulation; socially, include augmenting worker performance and reducing workplace injury; and for outreach, which include partnerships with public libraries to host weekend workshops for middle and high school students.\n\nThe photos below highlight success of in applying techniques (like capture point) for lift-and-carry material-handling.  Loco-manipulating jerry cans filled with gasoline, stacking package boxes, pushing wheelbarrows, carrying ladders, and manipulating furniture hand trucks were all successfully demonstrated.\n\nOther significant outcomes include successes at the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge for disaster response (using DRC-Hubo) and partnerships with Tesla for material-handling robots in construction sites.  Much of these outcomes leveraged the research, design, testing-and-evaluation and verification-and-validation executed during this NRI-Large.  Over seven papers in flagship conferences like the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) and IEEE/RJS International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) were published and presented by the UNLV team members of this multi-university NRI-Large project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Y Oh"
