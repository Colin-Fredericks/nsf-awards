 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last decade, analysis of high-dimensional independent data has gained substantial attention. The project involves a variety of estimation and statistical inference problems for high-dimensional multiple time series, a universal type of data seen in a broad spectrum of real applications in spatio-temporal statistics, biomedical engineering, environmental science, finance, and signal processing. As an important research problem, one should extract information from a large number of time series, where the second order structure plays a fundamental role in those applications.\r\n\r\nResults developed from this project will provide the theoretical foundation for estimating and inference of the space-time covariance and precision matrix, their related functionals, and time-varying graphs of high-dimensional time series. All of the problems are linked together to characterize the second order properties of the high-dimensional time series with the non-linear and non-stationary time dependent features. We will also study enhanced methods that account for the temporal and spatial dependence structures. Results from this research are useful for understanding the dynamic features of high-dimensional dependent data. In particular, the techniques are applicable to biomedical engineering problems such as modeling brain connectivity networks by using fMRI data.",
