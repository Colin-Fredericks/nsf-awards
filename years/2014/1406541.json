 "awd_abstract_narration": "Winston-Salem State University's (WSSU) Research Initiation Award entitled - Optimization of Heavy Metal Ions Remediation from Kaolinite Soil Using Molecular Micelles Chelator - is a student-faculty collaborative research project to develop a new analytical strategy for environmental heavy metal ion (HMI) remediation of contaminated soil. Specifically, the study will investigate the potential utility of molecular micelles (MMs) as chelators for HMI remediation of kaolinite soil. In addition, the HMI remediation efficiency capability of MMs will be compared with the remediation abilities of sodium dodecyl sulfate, a monomeric surfactant, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a conventional chelating agent. Furthermore, D-optimum experimental design will be employed to simultaneously investigate the influence of experimental conditions to evaluate the best conditions for HMI remediation. Compared with the current available HMI remediation methods, the proposed study is more environmentally friendly, capable of HMI remediation of diverse environmental sample matrixes and requires few experiments, potentially reducing both the time and cost of analysis.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is the development of a better analytical strategy for environmental HMI remediation and production of well prepared scientists through active student-faculty collaborative research. Emphasis on research engagement of students is not only the basis for gaining admission into graduate and professional schools, but it will also significantly strengthen WSSU's newly American Chemical Society accredited chemistry programs. The project aims to increase the number of minority students trained in research at a Historically Black College and University, ultimately improving students' learning and problem solving skills.",

Training innovative scientists rather than qualified technicians is critically significant for industrial growth and breakthroughs in research. However, the current conventional teaching and \"cook book\" laboratory experiment instruction, where students simply follow laboratory manuals is outdated, very boring, uninteresting, less motivating, and less hands-on. The goals of the NSF-RIA-Supplement project are to redesign, incorporate, and implement hands-on pedagogy and the use of Guided Inquiry Laboratory Experiments (GILEs) in chemistry curriculum at HBCUs to promote\nunderrepresented minority students\u00c6 learning and success in STEM majors.\nThe outcome of this study showed that the majority of the students were\nexcited, motivated, and preferred the GILE to traditional \"cook book\" laboratory experiments. The GILE and hands-on instruction also promoted the spirit of team-work and challenged the students\u00c6 critical thinking and problem solving skills. The GILE also provided..."
