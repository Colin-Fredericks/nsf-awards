Lignin is also unique among biopolymers in having significant aromatic character, which makes it potentially attractive for a wide range of uses, including coatings and carbon fibers. Unfortunately, the commercial-grade lignins available today are severely limited in their applications because of their high metals (primarily sodium) and ash content. Thus, less than 0.2% of these 50 million tons/yr of available lignin is being recovered. Clearly, cost-effective separations processes must be devised to dramatically improve the purities of today's commercial lignins, if lignin is to achieve its potential as a biopolymer. Such an ultrapure lignin would be of great interest for the production of high-value products, such as carbon fibers for automobile applications (for large reductions in fuel consumption). \r\n\r\nClemson researchers have discovered a powerful, versatile, yet renewable hot solvent system that can be \"tuned\" to reduce the sodium content of lignin derived from the Kraft pulping process 100-fold down to <150 ppm in a single step. Furthermore, preliminary evidence indicates that by incorporating compressed CO2 into the solvent system, the ultrapure lignin can be fractionated into cuts of well-defined molecular weight and chemical composition. A fundamental investigation of these phenomena, in order to lay the groundwork for future commercial application, is the overarching objective of this work. The research plan is as follows: (1) Measure elevated-temperature, liquid-liquid equilibrium phase behavior for the solvent system with lignin. Phase boundaries for the lignin-rich and solvent-rich phases, solvent compositions in each phase, and the effect of temperature will be the focus of these measurements. (2) Determine the distribution of metal salts between the lignin present in the above two phases. (3) Investigate the addition of CO2 to the lignin-solvent system for fractionating ultrapure lignin by molecular weight. (4) Characterize the lignin constituents in each phase in terms of phenolic and carboxylic acid content. (5) Evaluate ultrapure lignins as replacements for petroleum-derived polymers in coatings applications. The industrial partner will use the lignin for different polymer coating applications.",

Furthermore, it is the only abundant biopolymer with aromaticity.  Thus, it is attracting increased interest for materials applications, such as polyurethane foams, epoxy resins, and carbon fibers.  Like any polymer, the separation of lignin into fractions of controlled molecular weight can be an important part of its development for specific applications.  Furthermore, most polymers need to be devoid of metals contamination, which can poison processing catalysts or have a deleterious effect on materials properties.  Thus, the Aqueous Lignin Purification with Hot Acids (ALPHA) process was developed in order to address both of these issues in a sustainable manner.  In brief, the ALPHA process consists of contacting bulk Kraft lignins with hot, one-phase acetic acid&ndash;water mixtures such that two liquid phases are created, one solvent-rich and one polymeric and lignin-rich.  The solvent phase has a high selectivity for the metals, with an order-of-magnitude reduction in metals content being obtained for each equilibrium stage employed.  Furthermore, the lignin partitions between the two phases according to molecular weight (MW), with the solvent-rich phase containing the lower MW and the lignin-rich phase the higher MW portion of the lignin.  Thus, purification and fractionation of the lignin take place simultaneously.\n\n One unique advantage of fractionating bulk lignins via ALPHA is that one lignin fraction is cleaned of metals simply by separating the two liquid phases created above; only a drying step and no washing is required.  Furthermore, selectivities to extract the metals away from the lignin-rich liquid phase are 15-50, on the high side of those used in commercial extraction processes.  With the above encouraging results for a single-stage extraction, we added a 2nd stage to see just how low we could drive the metals content of the recovered lignin fractions.  A 50/50 acetic acid/water (AcOH/H2O) solvent system at 95 &deg;C was used for the 1st stage of extraction, followed by a 70/30 AcOH/H2O solvent mixture at the same temperature.
