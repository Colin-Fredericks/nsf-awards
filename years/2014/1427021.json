 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do the characteristics of specific industries shape the way international trade flows across national borders?  Are changes in global trade dynamics at least partly the result of how industry productivity evolves over time in specific industries? Data show that across the globe, any country's success in international trade at any moment in time is concentrated in just a few products.  However, those export products change over time; the top export goods this year will most likely not be the top export goods in the future.  Are these two persistent features of country export success due to the same process?  This project uses data from five decades of exports and imports between a large group of countries to test hypotheses about how industry characteristics determine global trade patterns.  The research will help us understand the forces responsible for the rapid growth of emerging economies, and will help us to predict future trade flows.\r\n\r\nThe research team develops an empirical framework to characterize the dynamics of country export performance, and will apply the framework to five decades of disaggregate data on consistently defined trade flows that include all merchandise sectors and a large set of countries conducting the bulk of global trade.  The diffusion they specify and estimate with a novel procedure combines stochastic growth in comparative advantage (capturing random product innovations or discoveries of new capabilities) with the dissipation of existing advantages (capturing diminishing returns or resource depletion).  The team will develop micro-foundations via a model of innovation and resource discovery, develop a multivariate stochastic process that allows for cross-country and cross-industry linkages in export growth (eg, linkages due to global productions networks), and explore the connection between export growth and changes in country characteristics.",

On the one side, we observe a strong export concentration in few industries with stable frequencies over time. On the other side, there is rapid and perpetual turnover of any country's successful export industries. Figure 1 shows, for 133 time-consistent industries (\"products\") in 90 countries (\"exporters\") from 1962-2007, the share of exports that the exporter countries' top products command: The typical export share of the single top export good is 25 percent in 1972, and in later periods about 21 percent. The top three products command around 44 percent of a country's exports form 1982-2007. Figure 1 illustrates, and our research documents in additional detail, that a handful of industries dominate exports. <br /><br />Any country's dominant export industries, however, change substantively over time. Figure 2 documents the fraction of top products in a given year and where those products used to rank two decades earlier. (The top products are classified by their \"absolute advantage\", a measure akin to Adam Smith's idea of the division of labor due to a country-industry's productivity.) The fraction of top-five products that were also top-five products two decades earlier ranges from a high of 43 percent in 2002 to a low of 37 percent in 1997. On average, three out of five products (60 percent of products) in a given year were not among the top five two decades before; 31 percent of current top products come from the 85th to 95th percentiles two decades before, 16 percent come from the 60th to 85th percentiles, and 12 percent come from the bottom six deciles. This substantive product turnover in top export goods suggests that current export advantage dissipates, while new advantages build up in lower ranked industries. <br /><br />Our research reconciles the evidence from Figures 1 and 2 within a comprehensive stochastic framework: a strong export concentration in few industries at any moment in time but a substantive and perpetual turnover in the identity of the top export industries. Our framework delivers the robust frequencies of export capability build-ups and decays. We document that the underlying statistical process has remained stable for the past four to five decades, even though other features of globalization may appear to differ over time. While the evolution of export capabilities is associated with country characteristics such as capital deepening in important ways, and firms as the main agents of change in exports may strategically shift between products, the industry-level export performance is well explained by a parsimonious stochastic model, which in turn is consistent with recent advances in trade theory.<br /><br />The speed of export innovations and the concentration of export success in few industries imply for society that relative declines in some industries are readily made up for by the rise of other, sometimes unexpectedly successful, industries. Extensions of the baseline framework show that general country-wide characteristics, such as capital deepening (the accumulation of capital per worker), and the lasting dominance of leading firms that strategically shift between products, hold predictive power for comparative advantage. Simulations of the framework imply that industrial policy has only a limited and at best fleeting impact given the rapid export innovations or decays at the industry level and firms' strategic switches between activities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marc&nbsp;A&nbsp;Muendler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1427021/1427021_10330702_1513668919156_fig1a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1427021/1427021_10330702_1513668919156_fig1a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Concentration of Exports\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1427021/1427021_10330702_1513668919156_fig1a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Concentration of Exports\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Source: World Trade Flow data (updated through 2008) for 133 time-consistent industries in 90 countries (?exporters?) from 1962-2007.
