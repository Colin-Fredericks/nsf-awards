 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research at UTA site of CICI will focus upon soil-structure interaction with an emphasis on minimizing scour issues using composites and fiber reinforcements to enhance the tensile strengths of the soils to mitigate shrinkage cracking. The site will investigate geocomposites in reinforced wall systems in expansive soil environment. Both mechanical and long term durability issues related to composite materials will also be explored. Special emphasis will be given to life-cycle cost analysis and sustainability studies for better understanding of the benefits of using novel composites, as applied to civil infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\nThe site at UTA will make effort to involve underrepresented students of various ethnicity and backgrounds. They will develop trained workforce in areas related to geosynthetics and geocomposites, thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of US industry. Research will be disseminated to the academia, research community and industry through publications and presentations. The site will develop strategies for evaluating sustainability and reduction of carbon emissions in air due to the usage of specific composite materials. Short courses on the applications of composites and sustainable practices will be offered to educate and train practicing engineers, construction engineers and agencies. K-12 students will be involved in the program through summer camps.",
