 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Queensborough Community College will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. The site focuses on providing research opportunities to students from community colleges who have had no prior research experience.  The site has a strong plan to recruit students from groups underrepresented in physics. The project is guided by an evaluation that will assess how well the goals of the project are being met. This site can be a model for other community colleges. It is anticipated that the activities related to the REU site will encourage community college faculty to maintain their involvement in or become involved in research and to include their students in that research.\r\n\r\nThe REU site at Queensborough Community College provides opportunities to eight undergraduate students each summer for ten weeks of research on topics in physics education and physics, along with interdisciplinary projects in astronomy, biology and the geosciences. Additionally, four students will be selected to conduct research during the academic year. One of the goals of the REU site is to prepare the students to be competitive for transfer to a four-year college in a STEM discipline. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the students will engage in activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will present the results of their work in a seminar talk.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project is to expand community college student participation in research with the goals of increasing retention, graduation rates, transfer to four-year programs and majors in STEM fields.  \n\nThe QCC program supported students from community colleges for 4 summers and academic years.  Due to the pandemic, one summer the number of students who participated was reduced as all had to do their projects remotely.  Until the pandemic the PIs visited community colleges in the tri-state region and gave presentations about the program.  This resulted in applicants from a substantial number of community colleges (19) and individual applications from community college students annually.  The demographics of the applicants quite diverse with a majority from underrepresented groups.  The selection process included meeting the project's guidelines for selecting participants, which were 50% or more to be students who completed no more than one year of college and that there be no more than two students from the same community college.  This yielded groups of participants where the majority were from underrepresented groups and typically more than 50% non-male, similar to the diversity of the applicant pool.\n\nThe project has been successful in meeting its goals.  Most fo the students participating had never been involved in research before and the opportunity led to profound changes in numerous cases.  This project provides more evidence that research is a high impact educational practice.  All students are either currently enrolled in as a STEM major, transferred to a 4-year institution as a STEM major, graduated with a STEM degree or are in a graduate program.  This is direct evidence that participation in research increases retention, transfer and graduation rates for STEM majors at community colleges.  The individual participating students benefited in other ways.  Approximately 50% of the participants participated in summer research programs (REU and others) the summer following participation in the QCC REU program.  some had the opportunity to present at conferences or contribute to a journal publication. Participant reflections indicated that the students found the program to be extraordinarily worthwhile, spurring them on to do research and pursue STEM careers and in some cases change their majors to physics and their plans to include going to graduate school.\n\nThe pandemic allowed for an unintended experiment.  It allowed for the determination of the impact of in-person recruitment visits in comparison with sending information to faculty for dissemination or virtual visits.  The results clearly indicate that the best way to recruit community college students is with in-person visits.  Applications from community colleges students fell by more than 50% (even after adjusting for the drop in total applicants during the pandemic) when in-person visits were replaced with zoom meetings and having faculty post materials.\n\nThe project has had a broader impact.  It is a model for other community colleges to implement research programs in their areas evidenced by the requests from other institutions for assistance in doing so.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David H Lieberman"
