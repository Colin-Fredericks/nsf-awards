The physical property of the conservation energy is then reported mathematically as the property that the value of the Hamiltonian function H does not change as the system evolves, but H determines that evolution through a system of differential equations that is equivalent to Newton's law that F = ma.  The Poisson geometry of this proposal's title is a version of the geometry underlying Hamiltonian mechanics that is well-adapted to the needs of quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nProjects supported by this award are focused on deformation and rigidity properties of Poisson structures.  A rigidity result established by the principal investigator in earlier work is one of the ingredients for new work; another ingredient is an explicit construction of local groupoids which can be applied to prove results such as a local normal form around Poisson transversals.",
