 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding in the power electronics industry and has the potential to improve performance, electrical efficiency, and provide space and cost savings.  This control-based solution will provide a new option for the power electronics community at a time when electronic devices are increasing in complexity and experiencing greater performance demands. There are numerous applications for this technology, including consumer electronics, smartphones, portable computers, telecommunications equipment, servers and data centers, electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and defense applications.  The technology is power level agnostic, and can be applied to chip (semiconductor) devices as well as high voltage grid power systems. For these sectors, energy consumption, cost and the physical size of the power circuitry are of paramount concern.  Even the smallest reduction in these areas is highly sought after.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve efficiency, save space, and lower the overall cost of power circuitry by eliminating power architectures composed of multiple converters and replacing them with high performance multiple-output converters, converters that can do the job of 2-4 individual converters.  Currently, power architectures in electronic equipment use multiple individual converters, sometimes as many as 60-100 depending on the application.  Other attempts at multiple-output converters have been extremely complicated designs with low performance.  This approach focuses on the mathematical fundamentals of power conversion by creating a new power control methodology that simultaneously controls each voltage output, while also providing high stability and performance. This research is expected to produce a 3 output digitally controlled buck converter that uses a single inductor and has better electrical efficiency, requires less space, and costs less than 3 separate converters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPower converters are devices that make up the power supply and power infrastructure of electronic devices.  Their function is to take an input voltage and change that voltage either to a higher or lower amount.  More complex and sophisticated electronic devices, like mobile phones and data center servers, require multiple and different voltage levels to provide the appropriate power to all the various components and parts (such as processors, memory, etc).  Anytime a different voltage level is needed, a power converter must be used to provide that voltage.  Converters come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes depending on the amount of voltage and power they have to provide. They can be as small as a tiny semiconductor chip for low power applications in phones and laptops, or a power module placed on a large server or telecom switch board, or even larger systems used to power ships and buildings.  As electronics add more and more features and capabilities, the number of power converters they require is also increasing. \n\nThe purpose of this project was to create a new type of power converter, one that could conceivably do the work of and replace three separate individual converters.  The key to making this possible is using only one inductor.  An inductor is a key part of a power converter, it is a component that stores energy in a magnetic field and provides that stored energy as the converter\u00c6s output. Inductors are typically the largest and often the most expensive component in a power converter. Existing power converter designs require an inductor for every output.  There have been some recent attempts to create multiple output power converters, but each of those outputs still require their own inductor, so not much space or cost savings are realized.  Our approach was to use only one inductor to provide the energy needed for three separate, different output voltages, and the solution to this was to create a new control method and circuit design that could take advantage of this unique approach.  The project was successful and we have demonstrated a proof-of-concept power converter that uses one inductor to power three separate outputs, and those outputs can be changed and programmed via a digital signal processor that is used to control the converter.  Only off-the-shelf common parts were needed, which will help in keeping the costs low in future products - the real difference is in the control method.\n\nThis new approach will enable the development of low power converter chips and higher power converter modules that can be used in servers and telecom switches.  This new type of power converter will be most useful in environments and applications where large numbers of converters are used, but also where physical space is constrained and at a premium.  While a single inductor multiple output converter would have to be larger than a regular single inductor single output converter, it will still be smaller than three such devices and will require fewer overall components.  This can provide cost savings but most importantly will free up more physical space for additional components and features that manufacturers want to have in their products. The space savings, for example, could enable a server board manufacturer to be able to add additional memory and processors, or a smartphone could be made smaller (or new components added).  Freeing up physical space is a highly desired capability in these types of electronic devices, where every square centimeter counts.  There are very few solutions available to the power electronics community that can \"free up\" space in an electronic device, and this new type of converter can have a significant and highly beneficial impact for the power systems and supplies used in consumer electronics, data centers, telecommunications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Taylor"
