 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability.  \r\n\r\nThis fellowship project examines the dynamics of social and ecological resilience.  Scientists have long sought to understand how human societies and ecosystems respond to and recover from disruptive events such as natural disasters, economic collapse, war, and changing physical climate. As research in both the natural and social sciences has progressed, it has become clear that human societies and ecosystems are inextricably connected or coupled. Likewise, our examination of the processes and components that influence a system's resilience in the face of disruption must incorporate data from both the social and ecological components of the system.  Despite this recognition of the complexity of resilience, it is difficult to find sufficiently comprehensive, multi-year data that includes unpredictable disruptive events.  Mazvihwa, Zimbabwe is uniquely situated to provide such data because an ongoing community-based research project has been collecting data about the area's social and ecological conditions since 1980.  Mazvihwa has also undergone several significant system shocks (including dramatic change in public health and land access and economic booms/busts) in the last 30 years making it an ideal site for studying resilience.  Understanding the dynamics of resilience in coupled social and ecological systems may help communities, cities, and nations better plan for and manage unexpected and disruptive change so that negative consequences are minimized.\r\n\r\nThis research draws on Mazvihwa's remarkably robust dataset that tracks human demography, health, nutrition, agricultural practices, rainfall, land use choices, woodland dynamics, household assets, and land tenure in the area over the last 30 years.  The quantitative data are modelled using multiple techniques (including a state-and-transition model, a hierarchical statistical state-space model, and an agent-based model using cellular automata) to allow for a robust exploration of resilience measurements. The researcher will also gather qualitative data that captures community members' experiences with change and resilience and experiment with a variety of techniques for incorporating these qualitative data into the quantitative models.  The combination of qualitative and quantitative data provide an even richer understanding of the resilience dynamics at work in this system.  Finally, the researcher will use the models to develop a decision support tool that will help community members understand tradeoffs between land use choices and better plan for their future.",

Sustainability involves maintaining both human and environmental wellbeing in the long term, and therefore justice is an important component of a sustainable system.  At the Science &amp; Justice Research Center, I was able to extend my existing quantitative training in statistics and ecological science with further study of how scientific knowledge is generated.  I learned how injustice plays out in research by minimizing some people's knowledge more than others, and investigated how community and citizen science research could be made more trustworthy, democratic, and effective by involving community researchers in all stages of the work.  During my critical social science training, I collected the advice of colleagues from anthropology, feminist studies, geography, sociology, and science and technology studies, and put together a \"Modeler's Manifesto\" outlining the important lessons I had learned about how to make models more relevant, robust, and just.  These recommendations can be useful in data science ethics curricula, as well as for individual modelers seeking to do more just work.  I also mentored graduate students in doing community-based research, and led an international group of authors in writing a paper on the importance of terminology choices in citizen science.  Based on the principles outlined in the Manifesto, I crafted my own community-based modeling process that combined sophisticated quantitative and qualitative analysis with consistent community input, and assessed long-term benefit. I then applied this process to studying the resilience of the coupled human-natural system in Mazvihwa Communal Area, Zimbabwe.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">In Mazvihwa, I worked with a community of farmer-researchers from non-governmental organization The Muonde Trust who have been gathering data on their agro-pastoral system for more than 35 years.  With rich information on agricultural practices, livestock management, land use change, and human wellbeing, we explored a variety of modeling representations that could capture the system's dynamics and serve as a tool for the community's resilience in the face of climate change and other disruptions.  The representation that proved most helpful was an Agent-Based Model which addressed community questions around land-use planning, demonstrating that increasing the area cultivated for crops at the expense of the woodland area used for grazing would ultimately lead to the system's collapse, even with clever management of community resources.  This sensitivity only became greater when we simulated increased variation in rainfall (one of the potential effects of climate change in their area).  This result matched the community's observations of massive cattle die-offs during historical droughts.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">The Muonde Trust research team then held workshops with local leaders demonstrating the model, and in response, the leaders agreed to allow a land-use policy in which new homesteads and crop fields could be established on uncultivated fields rather than building them in the grazing area, thereby preserving woodland including <em>rambotemwa</em> (sacred forests).  In the years following these initial modeling workshops, the Muonde team continued to show the model to young farmers, who then asked for homesteads in the fallow field areas, and during 2015-2019, 41 of these new households were established.  In one village, Mudhomori, this amounts to avoiding the deforestation of approximately 6.8 hectares, or 3.5% of their grazing area.  The new land-use policy and its resulting reduced deforestation is internally motivated by the community and local government (unlike external programs imposed by outside governmental agencies) and has the potential to spread further throughout Zimbabwe; this outcome results directly from the consistently high level of community engagement before, during, and after the modeling process.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">The specific products of the project include the model itself (available on CoMSES.net), as well as papers that describe how it was constructed, validated, and analyzed.  The modeled system displayed many of the behaviors of complex systems, including sensitivity to the removal of internal feedbacks that maintain its function and also sensitivity to increases in the magnitude of outside drivers (in our case, increased rainfall variability due to climate change).  The definitions of sustainability we used changed the land-use prescriptions, so the community's involvement in creating those definitions was essential.  In addition, we analyzed the modeling process itself and found that the success in on-the-ground land-use change came from involving the community in key stages of the modeling process: defining the questions, collecting the underlying data, validating the model, and sharing the results with key groups.  We published papers describing these findings and related findings on the community's use of digital mapping tools.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">The research products of this project contribute to the state of the art in citizen science, improving our understanding of what makes this work effective and why.  Community-based work is a key mechanism for both understanding and managing coupled human-natural systems, building and maintaining socio-ecological resilience, and improving the sustainability of these systems into the future.</p>\n<!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115% } --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Melissa&nbsp;V&nbsp;Eitzel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1415130/1415130_10314496_1609211726896_5ModelingWorkshop_CSTnP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1415130/1415130_10314496_1609211726896_5ModelingWorkshop_CSTnP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Community based modeling in Mazvihwa Communal Area\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1415130/1415130_10314496_1609211726896_5ModelingWorkshop_CSTnP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Community based modeling in Mazvihwa Communal Area\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The community-based research team of the Muonde Trust conducted workshops in small groups to run the collaboratively-created Zimbabwe Agro-Pastoral Management Model and discuss how its dynamics reflected what they knew about the real system in Mazvihwa Communal Area and how to manage it.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.V.
