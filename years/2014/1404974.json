 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together an international team of U.S. and Mexican researchers to investigate the prevalence of local adaption of maize to high elevations.   Collaborators have expertise in evolutionary genetics, theoretical population genetics, quantitative trait mapping, and Mexican agro-ecosystems.  U.S. students and researchers will travel to Mexico to join an international collaborative team and gain experience in phenotypic data collection and analysis as well as seed genetic mapping.  The expected outcomes of the project include both mapping seed populations and analytical software.    \r\n  \r\nMaize (Zea mays ssp. mays) was domesticated approximately 9000 BP in the lowlands of southwest Mexico from a wild grass known as teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis).  Subsequent to domestication maize was brought to multiple, independent highland regions.  These migration events required adaptation to drastically different environmental conditions.  In the long-term, collaborators will assess the genomic basis of adaptation to these separate highland regions through population genetic and quantitative trait mapping approaches.  These data will provide insight regarding the process of repeated evolution and will potentially identify loci relevant to the tolerance of temperature extremes, an important consideration in the face of climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project established an international collaboration between researchers in the United States and Mexico to investigate the potential for local, specifically high-elevation, adaptation in maize.  Project participants from the United States traveled to the National Institute of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico to discuss the feasibility of long-term, collaborative studies on maize adaptation across elevation gradients in Mexico.  Project participants from the United States presented their research on this topic to a general audience at the Institute and held meetings with potential collaborators and administrators at the Institute to discuss plans for project development.  The primary goals for a five-year project on high elevation adaptation were determined and a proposal was then submitted to the Plant Genome Research Program at the National Science Foundation.  This project has now been funded with a project period extending from 2017-2021.\n\nAdditional activities conducted as part of this project included a maize collection trip, identification of field sites in Mexico, and implementation of a phenotyping workshop in Mexico. Samples of wild and domesticated maize were collected across an elevation gradient that will serve as useful resources for ongoing work on high-elevation adaptation research.  Project participants made collections at over twenty unique sites. Field sites were established at low-, mid-, and high-elevation locations in Mexico for ongoing assessment of adaptation.  Pilot experiments were conducted at these sites to assess feasibility of their use.  Finally, faculty and graduate students from the United States and Mexico participated in phenotyping workshop at the low-elevation field site during which a US project participant taught training modules on methods for high-throughput phenotyping.  This broader impacts component was well attended and will be a continued activity as part of our funded follow-up project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew B Hufford"
