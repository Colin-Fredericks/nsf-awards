 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project shall prototype a wearable Raman optical system to monitor trending blood glucose levels noninvasively, continuously, and in real-time.  A solution that is unobtrusive, long-running, and provides absolute glucose readings with minimal calibration is considered a \"holy grail\" for patients with diabetes mellitus.  In the vast divide between this aspiration and the default regimen of multiple daily fingerstick measurements for single-shot glucose readings lie incredible opportunities for improvement in self-regulation and patient-specific care.  Our goal is to miniaturize a Raman system into less than 10 cubic centimeters to enable transcutaneous glucose detection.  Sufficient accuracy is sought so that analysis of collected data allows clinicians to provide better individualized care than is possible with either isolated fingerstick data or two-month-averaged glucose levels inferred from glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) readings.  Using a novel optical configuration developed in Phase I, further miniaturization in Phase II will reduce our laboratory bench-top system to a handheld platform that is an order of magnitude smaller and maintains the necessary throughput and sensitivity to detect glucose ex vivo.\r\n\r\nThis Phase II effort will also investigate the core problem of repeatability plaguing almost all optical approaches for noninvasive glucose detection.  Specifically, it will be addressed for the Raman-based spectroscopic configuration explored in Phase I.  Optical as well as mechanical techniques will be employed to introduce stability into the system to mitigate contributions from ambient mechanical and physiological perturbations and disturbances that cause errant readings, throw off calibrations, and frustrate end users.  Testing and validation of these techniques will be performed ex vivo, using disposed skin, tissue and blood samples to create model analogues in place of animal or human transcutaneous testing.  This minimizes initial regulatory overhead while providing essential test data to ascertain detection limits, capacities for overcoming repeatability, and practicalities for usage in real-world scenarios.  The end Phase II milestone is to deliver a prototype for demonstration that is capable of sufficient sensitivity, and stabilized detection and quantification of physiological levels of blood glucose that can be readied for wearable and ambulatory settings.  Overcoming this key hurdle is a necessary step to advance all such optical technologies for transcutaneous detection, and one which will engage potential customers and investors for continued support toward commercialization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  Normal 0   \nIntellectual Merit:\nThe mission for this medical device company is to develop Raman spectroscopy for continuous, minimally-invasive point-of-care (POC) glucose monitoring for in-hospital use, and specifically for newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICU?s).  Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy is a non-contact, nondestructive and label-free technique commonly used for chemical identification.  Through this Phase II, the ability to measure physiological levels of glucose in biological samples on the lab bench was demonstrated.  Critical to this success was the development of leading-edge data analytics to verify and to cement this capability with performances matching and verified at the lab bench.  Demonstrating this capability and showing a mockup of the anticipated system build both to clinical partners and at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was a major objective of Phase II and will be instrumental in securing venture financing to further this program?s development.\nBroader Impacts:\nOf the 3.9 million babies born in 2015 in the US, about 20% need glycemic testing due to familial diabetic history, gestational diabetes, very low birth weight, large gestational age or late preterm birth.  Because neonatal hypoglycemia presents a severe risk of permanent brain damage and neurological disorder, multiple heel-pricked blood samples are drawn within the first hours to days after birth to monitor glucose.  When there is a risk of hypoglycemia, protocols require glucose levels to be measured every 30 to 60 minutes until stabilization.  The standard of care &ndash; repetitive heel pricks &ndash; is painful for newborns, and traumatic for the parents and caregivers.  This has led to inadequate monitoring.  One notable example is a 2012 lawsuit against the National Health Services in the UK where inadequate monitoring led to severe brain damage and other complications in 60 newborns leading to a $350M settlement.  A continuous and, ideally, non-invasive method for glucose monitoring could avert such tragedies and costs.\nEventually, once such a monitor is developed for point-of-care (POC) it could be adapted to a much broader need in diabetes.  Type II diabetes is growing and nearing epidemic proportions.  By 2050, the CDC estimates 1 in 3 people will be diabetic.  Such a monitor would be extremely helpful in better glycemic control and minimizing the inconveniences of fingerstick to draw blood for measuring glucose.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Raj K Gupta"
