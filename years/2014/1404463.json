The goals of this conference are to expose the generic problem of Non-Equilibrium Turbulent Processes to a wide scientific community, to promote the development of new ideas in tackling the fundamental aspects of the problem, to assist in application of novel approaches in a broad range of phenomena, where these processes occur, and to have an impact on technology. The meeting will consist of invited lectures by international experts on a broad range of phenomena, where non-equilibrium turbulent processes occur, tutorials by leading experts on hydrodynamic instabilities in fluids and plasmas, contributed talks and poster presentations by participants, round tables and open discussions.",

Turbulent mixing is a non-equilibrium process that occurs in a broad variety of natural phenomena and technological applications, ranging from astrophysical to atomistic scales and from high- to low- energy-density regimes. Examples include inertial confinement fusion, light&ndash;matter interaction, strong shock waves, explosions, supernovae and accretion discs, convection in stellar and planetary interiors, premixed and non-premixed combustion, hypersonic and supersonic flows&mdash;both wall-bounded and boundary-free&mdash;as well as the atmosphere and the ocean.
