There is also a plan to validate this method with numerical simulations. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher.  With a collaborative team including computer science and graphics students at Carnegie Mellon, a computer game for public outreach will be developed based on cosmological structure formation.\r\n\r\nAnalytic theory and large scale realistic cosmological simulations will be employed to make predictions for gravitational redshifts of galaxies in various environments. Optimal statistical estimators will be formulated to best constrain the large-scale gravitational potential. These estimators will be applied to the simulated data to carry out tests and to make predictions, which will be applied to existing galaxy catalogs.",

The Universe is accelerating in its expansion, (research awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize). However, a simple accounting of its contents leads to the expectation that it should be decelerating. There are two leading possibilities to explain this. Either a previously unknown substance with negative pressure (``Dark Energy'') causes it to accelerate, or that our theory of gravity, GR, somehow breaks down when we approach cosmological scales. In order to tell these possibilities apart we therefore need to extend our tests of gravity to these scales. Measuring gravitational redshifts of entire galaxies offers a new way to do this.
