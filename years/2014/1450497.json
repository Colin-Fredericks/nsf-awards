 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the foundation for innovative uses of the emerging consumer technology Google Glass in scientific fieldwork applied to polar regions. The new and disruptive Google Glass wearable computing device presents a unique opportunity for researchers to engage in the early development stages of a device poised to heavily impact the course of technological innovation. Glass? hands free operation gives the device particularly strong potential as a research tool in remote, harsh regions, such as the North Slope of Alaska. As proof of concept, this project will produce several\r\nsmall Glass specific software applications that align with research projects currently in progress. It will also lay framework the development of supporting cyberinfrastructure activities, such as innovative network approaches for remote fieldwork, cost effective\r\nsensor integration, new methods of communication for remote classroom programs, and smarter data collection methodologies through technology. The project directly addresses the development of a polar cyberinfrastructure. \r\n",
