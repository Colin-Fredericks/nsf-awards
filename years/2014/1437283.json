This workshop is to take place in New York City in May 2014 immediately before the 46th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2014), in coordination with New York University and Princeton University. The intended audience of the workshop is graduate students in the field of theoretical computer science (TCS).  Motivated by the low overall number of female faculty members, researchers, and students in TCS world wide, the workshop has two goals.  The first is to deliver an invigorating educational program to the student participants by inviting leading female researchers to present tutorials of their research topics. The second is to provide an outstanding opportunity to bring together women students from different institutions across the country and internationally, so as to foster a sense of kinship and camaraderie, and to provide access to role models in this area by having senior and junior faculty members and industrial researchers present.  The format of this workshop consists of more than ten technical tutorials, one non-technical talk, a student rump session, and a panel discussion.\r\n\r\nThe first three Women-in-Theory workshops were greeted with great enthusiasm both from the participants and from the TCS research community at large. Response has been strong for this year's workshop from female students at universities across the United States.  Since the first workshop in 2008, the PIs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback and many participants have matured to be successful researchers. These serve as testimonials that the workshop is accomplishing its primary goal of helping women become more successful in TCS.",

Many told us the workshop re-energized them, and encouraged them about their research and career prospects. We did not do a complete tabulation of the anonymous evaluation forms, but overall participants rated the workshop 3.64 out of 4. \n\nFifteen of the students (out of 48) indicated that the will attend STOC and would not have been able to do so if they had not come to WIT. This increased the percent of female attendees at STOC in relation to prior years.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Moses Charikar"
