Fortunately, recent\r\nadvances in sensor technology have allowed observation of these\r\nphenomena at an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, the volume and\r\ncomplexity of available data present many challenges to extracting\r\nmeaningful information about these systems. Low-dimensional models\r\nserve as a useful structure for understanding the information in\r\nhigh-dimensional signals and systems. However, this information\r\noften changes over time, and so these models can further be\r\nimproved by exploiting temporal dynamics. This project is concerned\r\nwith developing new methods for tracking changing low-dimensional\r\nstructure in data streams and dynamical systems, particularly in\r\nsettings where the observations may be missing, incomplete,\r\ncorrupted, or compressed.\r\n\r\nThe first research aim in this project is to develop new and\r\nsubstantially improve existing techniques for tracking\r\nlow-dimensional structure and, in particular, to extend tracking\r\ncapabilities far beyond conventional signals to much more general\r\ndata sets with intrinsic low-dimensional structure. A second\r\nresearch aim is to develop new tools for tracking low-dimensional\r\nstructure in systems jointly with estimating the content of\r\ntime-varying signals and data sets. A third research aim is\r\nconcerned with higher-dimensional and more complex dynamical\r\nsystems, and the goal is to develop improved methods that exploit\r\nlow-dimensional structure to perform quantitative and qualitative\r\nanalysis in systems that are too complex and high-dimensional for\r\nsystem identification. In a fourth, educational aim, accessible\r\nK-12 outreach materials are being developed for dissemination\r\nthrough an online digital library.",
