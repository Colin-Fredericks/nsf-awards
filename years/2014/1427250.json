 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robust, soft, lightweight, dexterous hands will be a crucial component of the next generation of robots that physically interact with human co-workers.  To date, under-actuated robot hands (where one motor moves multiple joints) that grasp objects reliably have been created largely by designer ingenuity using \"tricks of the trade\" without fully capitalizing on the wealth of mathematical grasping and manipulation theory.  Moreover, anatomical studies of the human hand and robotic hands that do useful work have largely evolved separately, leading to similar conclusions expressed in a different way.  This collaborative effort between engineering and medical faculty will help bridge these gaps.  Engineering graduate students and medical residents will interact regularly; this will serve to translate knowledge and experience across the boundaries of these two disciplines, thereby fostering the ability to solve complex, multi-faceted bioengineering problems.  A key contribution of this project will be a theoretical description of an elastic drive train that maps individual actuator motions to key movements in tasks of daily living.  The robotic hand produced as another outcome of this work will serve as a robust platform for future experimentation (for example, in studies on gesturing, communication for the hearing impaired, and tactile exploration), and it will also be useful for evaluating and visualizing the effect of potential surgical interventions ex vivo.  An important educational and research tool in the PI's institution, this hand will be used to educate and interest university and K-12 students in robotics.  The PI team will coordinate with student groups and Native American community organizations, to recruit qualified underrepresented minorities to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nMoving from single- to multi-actuator multi-fingered dexterous robot hand design is not straightforward and has frustrated researchers for several years; it will require a principled formal treatment.  In single-actuator hands, adding a spring to the drive train improves the hand; the exact spring characteristics are not critical.  In the general case of multi-actuator compliant hands simply adding a spring is not enough; a multidimensional spring of specific characteristic is needed.  Concepts from multiport circuit theory, mechanics of materials, linear algebra and elements of general multi-fingered grasping theory will be used to understand the behavior of such a multi-dimensional spring.  The PI's approach is to break this problem into sub-problems, greatly simplifying the analysis.  There is also the matter of which actions an under-actuated hand should be able to perform; the PI argues that complete finger individuation is not necessary, rather coupled finger movements should correspond to those used by humans to perform tasks.  Anatomical analysis of both normal humans and those that have undergone surgical intervention will be used to prioritize basic human motion primitives.  Combined with the novel compliant grasping theory, under-actuated hand synthesis will be formulated as a parameter fitting problem.  Detailed evaluation of the effects of surgical intervention on the human hand, the study of human anatomy, multi-port circuit models, and consideration of compliant mechanisms and the fundamental subspaces of linear algebra will all be blended.  Taken together, this will result in a method to synthesize an elastic drive train that maps actuator contributions to useful, coordinated motions of the fingers.  Implications of the compliant actuation theory will be examined in the mechanism synthesis and grasp stability contexts, and these will be evaluated experimentally.  The investigators will pursue this line of reasoning all the way to implementation in a functioning anthropomorphic hand capable of performing the most common tasks of everyday life.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The goal of this NRI grant was to investigate the manner in which the motions of the fingers of the human hand and the individual joints of the fingers move, and to use these as a guiding principle for how simple hands with only a few motors can perform many functions. Those who have had injuries, bone fusions, or tendon transfer surgeries have even less function, but still manage most of the tasks they need to perform. This indicates that a robot hand with only a few motors could be very effective if the way in which the joints move together is like the way they move in the human hand.<br />During this grant, we discovered how each and every motor could effect the motion of each and every joint. Instead of the motors directly pulling on the joints of the fingers, each motor instead pulled on a network of springs. Other parts of the spring network pulled the finger tendons. So the motor pulls the spring and the spring pulls the tendons. This has several benefits: First, the user can't get the motor commands \"wrong\". Every motor command is compatible because the spring can stretch to accommodate the differences. Second, the operator does not need to know the shape of the object, because the spring stretch can accommodate fingers variations. Third, the hand is easy to operate, because the operator only has to specify a few channels and the fingers move together in an intuitive way. Once the fingers are in contact with the object, the motors will stretch the springs further, tending to grip the object more tightly. Since the motors are connected to the spring network at different places, they stretch the springs in different ways, each causing some fingers to grip tighter than others. We developed a mathematical method to distinguish \"good\" spring networks from \"pathological\" ones. In addition, we discovered that if something bumps the object, the spring-like nature of the hand tends to bring object back to its original position and orientation within the hand rather than knocking it out of the hand.<br />Through conversations with hand surgeons, hand therapists, and medical residents, we discovered another way to reduce the number of motors required; deleting joints or tendons that are commonly removed surgically. When we fused the the metacarpal to the proximal phalanx of the thumb at the angles considered best practice in surgery (Stieger Arthrodesis), the motion lost was only the portion against the palm. We developed a 3D rolling thumb joint based on a classical 2D mechanism, rolling ellipsoidal magnets, and living hinges. We also observed that the joints within the fingers are coordinated by a complex network of tendons (the extensor mechanism). This allows certain hand muscles to do \"double duty\", spreading the fingers, opening them, and stretching out the finger while bending where it joins the hand (the MCP), as if to grasp a book. Our finger design and kinematic model that preserves the main elements of the biological mechanism, but is much simpler and operates much more reliably. In a botched surgery, the \"boutonniere\", \"mallet finger\" or \"swan neck\" deformaties occur. While the tendons cut out or simplified causes these surgical deformities to occur, we found ways to minimize its effects.<br />We built a durable, functional robotic hand. It can both pinch small, flat objects and \"power grasp\" pipes and bottles using only two motors. The method we used to connect the motor to the finger tendons is called \"ties and skips\". We \"tie\" a tendon to a particular coil of an ordinary spring (this includes both finger tendons and tendons that are pulled by the motor as they are wound around a pulley). We then \"skip\" a few coils before \"tying\" the next tendon. By varying where the tendons are tied and how many coils are skipped, we set how the fingers respond when the motors move. Using our hand, we competed in the \"Grasping and Manipulation Challenge\", where the robot hand had to grasp and manipulate a number of household objects, and the \"Fan Challenge\", where the robotic hand had to open a Spanish fan.<br />This project involved the training of 4 graduate students, 4 undergraduate researchers, and a medical resident, blending medical and engineering perspectives. The hand was used at outreach presentations to undergraduates, high school and middle school students, community college students, and international visitors. The hand was used in a presentation to our Provost (a non-scientist) to underscore the importance of NSF-sponsored research. Three peer-reviewed conference papers were written as a result of this grant, one of which won a second place award. Another conference submission is currently under review. One journal article is currently been published, with another in revision, and yet another being revised for initial submission.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joshua&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schultz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1427250/1427250_10321636_1572642879818_pinchgrasp--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1427250/1427250_10321636_1572642879818_pinchgrasp--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pinch Grasp\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1427250/1427250_10321636_1572642879818_pinchgrasp--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pinch Grasp\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The TU Hand demonstrating a pinch grasp</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dipayan Das</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joshua&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schultz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pinch Grasp</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1427250/1427250_10321636_1572642817730_powergrasp--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1427250/1427250_10321636_1572642817730_powergrasp--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Power Grasp\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1427250/1427250_10321636_1572642817730_powergrasp--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Power Grasp\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The TU hand demonstrating a power grasp</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dipayan Das</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joshua&nbsp;A&nbsp;Schultz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Power Grasp</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
