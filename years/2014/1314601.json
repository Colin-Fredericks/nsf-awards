Specifically the Automatic ship Identification System, radar antenna, satellite compass and VHF radio.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the award arise from the fact that the equipment would increase the vessels capability to support science and educational programs, historically funded by NOAA, Wisconsin Sea Grant Program, NSF, EPA, and private sector users (e.g. local utilities).  Additionally, the safety of operations will be improved.  The newer generation radar equipment offers significant improvements in safety through incorporation of computer calculated collision avoidance information via Automated Radar Plotting Aid (ARPA).",
