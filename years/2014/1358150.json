 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical description \r\nThis International Research Experience for Students (IRES): Research Opportunities in Continental Rift Initiation for U.S. Undergraduate Geoscience Students in Malawi will allow students from Oklahoma State University (OSU) to investigate the geodynamic processes involved in the initial rifting of the continental lithosphere. There is a knowledge gap for   understanding the mechanisms involved at the earliest stages of continental rifting that is   ascribed to the paucity of data from nascent rift environments. Our understanding is incomplete as to where and why continental rifts initiate and to the relative role of pre-existing structures in rift initiation and strain localization. The Malawi rift is one of the world?s best places to study the interplay between neo-tectonic rift structures and Precambrian basement structures during the initiation and propagation of continental rift. It is also a natural example of how major structures in the crust try to find the most efficient pathway through a complex array of inherited structures.   \r\n\r\nOver the next three years, 12 undergraduates from OSU will work with mentors and peers from the University of Malawi and the Geological Survey Department to conduct field-based, multi-disciplinary research on the geodynamic processes at play during rift initiation. This research expects to answer the questions: what is the role of pre-existing structures in the localization of strain during the early stages of continental extension, how is strain partitioned and accommodated throughout the upper crust during the early stages of continental extension, and how are fault dip, slip, and displacement/length ratios modulated by pre-existing structures. The research sites in Malawi afford IRES students the opportunity to do original research. Student projects will focus on detailed investigations of the rift border faults, transfer zones, and the nature of the upper crust using broadband magnetotellurics, gravity, magnetic, structural, and remote sensing surveys and analyses. \r\n\r\nBroader description \r\nA major goal of this IRES is to attract underrepresented students to the geosciences and inspire them to develop the critical thinking skills needed to succeed in research careers as geoscientists. The geosciences are considered the least ethnically diverse of all scientific disciplines. As an international research experience, this project could have significant impact on the development of future international research collaborations. These could be seeded as a result of interactions with African peers, from the enriching cultural experience, and the acquisition of personal contacts that could contribute to building relationships upon which future international research collaborations could be initiated. Results of this research will reach a broad audience as student participants are required to present their individual research findings at regional, national, and international scientific meetings, and potentially publish results in peer-reviewed journals. \r\n\r\nOther broader impacts include the enrichment of the geophysical and structural databases for Africa, since IRES students will acquire geophysical and structural data that will have the potential to transform current geodynamic understanding of continental rifting. Lastly, since continental rifts are prolific hydrocarbon producers as are active tectonic sites, the results of the student projects could provide scientific input into sustainable resource management for natural resources and environmental hazard mitigation efforts in Malawi.",

Structures in rocks have been recognized to affect the formation of continental rifts. However, it is still unclear how the orientation of these structures influence earthquake activity in continental rifts. To study this problem, we analyzed satellite, magnetic, and electrical images, in conjunction with geological data from the Malawi Rift. At the regional scale, we found that the rift can be divided into large and small fault segments controlled by the older geological structures. The 2009 Karonga earthquakes in northern Malawi occurred along a 35 km-long magnetic lineament of a pre-existing structure in the subsurface and aligns with a zone of deformation imaged with electrical methods. In central Malawi, the old geological structures control the orientation of the &gt; 100-km-long geological faults. Our results of geological and geophysical mapping suggest that within the Malawi Rift, movement along geological faults can be accommodated differently based on the nature and orientation of older geological structures. These results improve our knowledge of the formation of geological faults within continental rifts in that the orientation of preexisting structures contribute to the growth of geological faults and the generation of earthquakes in new continental rifting.</p>\n<p>This investigation was carried out by 13 students from Oklahoma State University and the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, under the supervision of the PIs and collaborators from the Geological Survey of Malawi Department and the Malawi University of Science and Technology. Out of 13 students, 6 were women, and 5 were from underrepresented groups in the geosciences. The students traveled to Malawi and conducted fieldwork for a month during the 3-year life of the project. The students were trained in the use of geophysical equipment and in the collection of structural geology data.</p>\n<p>IRES participants have been successful in their geoscience studies and careers. All of the students graduated from B.S. or M.S. geology degrees. Three students obtained geoscience-related jobs, while 5 of the undergraduate students went on to begin an M.S. degree after graduation. Two additional students that did not travel to Malawi, participated in the IRES research and graduated to seek P.D. and job opportunities. The students participated in the production of 4 published research papers and at least 2 additional papers to be submitted. In addition, the students presented their work 19 times at the national geoscience meetings, which served as opportunities to network and meet other scientists from around the world.</p>\n<p>As part of this project, we also conducted educational research on the international experience of the students. Overall, the students indicated a genuine change in perspective upon returning from Malawi. Even though the students had perceptions of what a different culture would be like, the day-to-day immersion for an extended period of time had an impact on their lives. They all reported it was an experience they will never forget and would highly encourage others to pursue some type of fieldwork that places them in a contrasting environment.&nbsp; They all agreed that the outcomes of the trip were two-fold: growth in their content area and growth as human beings. Moreover, students reported that this research experience allowed them to become better researchers.&nbsp; They gained skills that will allow them to independently collect, interpret, and report data for research.&nbsp; This unique experience immersed them in both the research culture of fieldwork as well as the culture of Malawi.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/17/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;Lao-Davila</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1358150/1358150_10342300_1544825294661_IMG_0380--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1358150/1358150_10342300_1544825294661_IMG_0380--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students and Co-PI conducting geophysical survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1358150/1358150_10342300_1544825294661_IMG_0380--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students and Co-PI conducting geophysical survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2015 IRES students, Brian Clappe and Tiara Johnson, with Co-PI Dr. Estella Atekwana conduct an electrical resistivity survey watched by local residents in northern Malawi.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel A.
