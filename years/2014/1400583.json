 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for engineering technicians in the United States is expected to continue to grow for the next decade.  Skilled engineering technicians are a critical part of the nation's high-tech workforce. Engineering technician positions frequently require Associates Degrees in areas such as mechanical, electrical, electronics, or civil engineering. In this project, the Community College of Baltimore County will conduct a pilot in cooperation with Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) that will improve the ability of high school students to enter careers as engineering technicians.  Supplemental materials will be added to a series of existing high school technology education courses that, when taken in combination, will allow a high school student to receive articulated credit for the college-level \"Introduction to Engineering Technology\" course offered at the Community College of Baltimore County.  In this way, by pursuing a series of high school advanced technology education courses, high school students will start earning credit towards an Associates Degree in an engineering technology field.  This program will also offer training for high school teachers, training for elementary, middle and high school counselors, and outreach to high school students. The project will help to broaden participation in engineering technology careers by creating a more seamless and efficient pathway from high school into technician jobs requiring an Associates Degree.\r\n\r\nThe project will utilize the existing Engineering by Design (EbD) curriculum developed by the International Technology and Engineering Education Association (ITEEA). This curriculum is used by many secondary schools throughout the United States and meets relevant STEM standards in many states. In Maryland, the EbD Foundations of Technology course is required for all ninth grade students.  After taking Foundations of Technology, high school students may elect to continue the EdD curriculum and enroll in the advanced technology education courses called Advanced Design Applications (ADA) and Engineering Design (ED). The ADA and ED courses are already taught in many schools.  This project will enable other community colleges and school districts to develop a set of supplemental materials for the existing ADA and ED courses that will enable high school student taking the required Foundations of Technology course and the two elective advanced technology education courses to receive credit for the first college course in the Associates Degree in Engineering Technology at the community college.  Since the ITEEA Engineering by Design curriculum is widely used throughout the state of Maryland and across the country, the potential exists to expand this approach statewide and across the nation.  The project team will begin to develop collaborations outside of Maryland to propagate this model to other states.\r\n\r\nThe project also includes other activities integral to achieving the goal of broadening participation in engineering technology careers. A training program for school counselors is being developed to better able them to encourage students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to enroll in this series of technology courses with the goal of continuing education beyond high school.  A professional development program will be developed for high school teachers concerning effective use of the supplementary materials.  An outreach program, involving engineering technology students from the community colleges called Student Ambassadors, will be implemented.  \r\n\r\nThe evaluation of this project will yield data concerning the potential of using a high school technology curriculum aligned with a college-level engineering technology program to increase the number and diversity of high school students pursuing two or four-year degrees in engineering technology.  Evaluation will provide a baseline assessment of skills and content needs for high school teachers who will teach the new articulated technology classes.  Measurements will be made of teacher learning, satisfaction, and confidence related to teacher professional development activities. The annual number of teachers participating in professional development activities will be monitored along with demographic data. Annual benchmarks will track implementation of the new curriculum in participating schools: number of courses offered, number of students enrolled, as well as teacher self-reported developments.  Evaluation will consider assessments of high school student knowledge, interest, and attitudes toward engineering technology studies and careers in participating schools.  Measurements will be taken at baseline, during, and after the project.  Measurement of impacts will include the number of two-year/four-year articulations and transfer pathways at baseline, during, and after the project. The goal of increasing the number of students in engineering technology programs will be assessed through measurements of the number of college students enrolled in the engineering technology programs at the participating 2-year institutions who utilized the articulated credit at baseline, during, and after the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Generating Excitement and Training for Engineering Technology (GET ET) project was developed by the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) with a goal to expand and diversify the nation's technical workforce by increasing the number of high schools offering advanced engineering technology completer type programs; providing professional development for teachers and school counselors; and creating and implementing a more easily negotiated, but rigorous pathway from high school to community college and baccalaureate programs in engineering technology.  Grant personnel worked with the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA) using and enhancing their previously developed Engineering by Design curriculum.\n\nThe GET ET grant assisted a number of colleges to investigate the alignment of the ITEEA Engineering by Design (EbD) curriculum with their own Engineering Technology curriculum.   Many required no changes or additions to the curriculum and implemented a pathway from EbD curriculum to their college.  Delaware Tech Community College required a module on Tensile Strength for the high school curriculum to be aligned.  The material was researched and the module developed that was added as an option to the EbD curriculum.   Materials were developed in conjunction with ITEEA and are held in an ITEEA repository, EdBuzz, accessible by participants.    The original curriculum, Advanced Design Applications (ADA) and Engineering Design (ED) was updated and enhanced as more instructors used it and provided feedback.   A new course, Advanced Technologic Application (ATA), was developed and added in 2018. \n\nThe GET ET grant expanded the use of the ITEEA Engineering by Design (EbD) curriculum from the original two states listed in the grant, Maryland and Illinois, to its use in fifteen (15) additional states.  This was accomplished by providing nine (9) Advanced Technology Institutes (train-the-trainer) which trained 63 new trainers.    These trainers then assisted in the training of 231 instructors from the seventeen (17) states to use the curriculum.  These professional development offerings were held in various locales across the United States and at a variety of times to allow for greatest participation.  The EbD curriculum can now be utilized in a number of additional high schools providing students with a rigorous technology pathway.   Other examples of this outreach include not only adding the EbD curriculum to schools in Louisiana, but preparations are also underway there to provide a more focused emphasis on STEM career exploration for all districts.  \n\nEfforts continue to provide a continuous pathway from high school EbD programs to Engineering Technology programs at many colleges.  Colleges such as Delaware Technical Community College and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) provide articulated credits for students who complete the prescribed EbD program.   Kentucky is finalizing an online dual credit course for high school students with Eastern Kentucky University and Pennsylvania has established an articulation agreement with Elizabethtown College and has plans to establish partnerships with other schools and universities. The grant also provided the means for community colleges to investigate transfer pathways to four-year institutions. The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) has made changes to the Engineering Technology AAS degree program which should provide additional transfer pathways to regional four-year institutions.   CCBC is in discussion with UMES and Penn State Harrisburg regarding transfer options for students.  Both the Illinois State University and Fort Hayes State University (Kansas) are working to facilitate transfers from participating community colleges.\n\nStaff development in Maryland and Kansas provided school counselors the knowledge to engage and encourage students to pursue engineering technology.   Training included information about Engineering Technology course articulation and career pathway options.   Sessions also included the neuroscience of decision making and the physical process of learning and the impact of teen years on the decision making process.   A number of training sessions were held in Maryland for elementary, middle, and high school counselors training more than 180 school counselors. At UMES, fourteen (14) students and instructors from the Master's Degree program in Education and Community Based Counseling received training. A session in Kansas provided training to 21 high school counselors.  In order to provide training for those unable to attend a specific session, training videos were created and promoted to other jurisdictions and states who wished to participate.
