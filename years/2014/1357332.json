 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estimating the Impacts of a Microfranchising Intervention\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nIntegrating youth into the formal labor market is a major challenge facing developing nations.  High levels of unemployment, especially among young adults, have led policymakers to advocate credit programs aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.  However, evidence on the overall impacts of such programs has been decidedly mixed, particularly among women.  In light of this evidence, we are conducting a randomized impact evaluation of a new policy intervention:  microfranchising.  The evaluation will measure the impacts of a microfranchising intervention designed specifically for young women. Microfranchising, which connects unemployed participants with businesses via small-scale, multi-person franchises, is a recent policy innovation whose efficacy has not yet been convincingly demonstrated.  By eliminating the need to develop a novel business model, but leaving participants to manage their own time and entrepreneurial effort, microfranchising strikes a middle ground between full entrepreneurship and conventional salaried employment. \r\nConceptually, a microfranchise has features in common with both a formal sector job and self-employment: while microfranchisees do not need to devise business models of their own, they work with very little managerial supervision and considerable latitude for creativity.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will evaluate the second wave of the Girls Empowered by Microfranchise (GEM) Project.  The evaluation estimates the impact of the microfranchising program on young women's labor supply, income and expenditures, savings, empowerment and self-actualization, and overall well-being.  \r\n\r\nA randomized design compares the microfranchising program to both the control group which receives no intervention and the treatment.  Random assignment of applicants to treatment will generate unconfounded estimates of the impact of the program on girls in the treatment group.  To explore potential spillovers, the baseline data collection will include detailed questions on local friendships which allow the PIs to map each girl's social network, and determine the number of friends in the program who were randomly assigned to the treatment group(s).  \r\n\r\nThe randomized design allows the PIs to credibly estimate the impact of the microfranchising program on participants, generating cleaner evidence of program effects than a non-experimental study could provide.  The design also allows for the estimation of the indirect effects of the program on pre-existing businesses within the treated sectors. \r\n\r\nProviding increasing numbers of unemployed and underemployed youth with viable income-generation strategies is a pressing policy priority, particularly in light of the perceived failure of microfinance to live up to its promise as a radical tool for transforming the lives of the poor through entrepreneurship.  Microfranchising provides a potential alternative to  microfinance which relaxes the need to develop a new business model before starting a business.  Thus, the first ever impact evaluation of a randomized microfranchising intervention is likely to be of substantial interest to policymakers and development professionals.  Yet, no rigorous evaluation of a microfranchising program exists.  As a result, this research is likely to have broad policy impacts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEstimating the Impacts of a Microfranchising Intervention\n\nAndrew Brudevold-Newman, Maddalena Honorati, Pamela Jakiela, and Owen Ozier\n\n \n\nIn many low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, high youth unemployment is a major policy challenge.  While growing, the formal labor market remains small and as a result, many policymakers have advocated entrepreneurship programs to help unemployed youth generate an income through self-employment. \n\n \n\nThis project provided research support to a randomized evaluation of two labor market interventions targeted to young women in informal settlement neighborhoods of Nairobi.  One intervention offered participants a multifaceted entrepreneurship treatment consisting of training, capital, and ongoing support while the other intervention provided women with an unrestricted cash grant, without either training or support. The design of the evaluation allowed us to directly compare the impact of these interventions against each other and relative to a control group.  Surveys were administered beginning six months after treatment and were designed to track program impacts over time.\n\n \n\nIn the medium-term, both the multifaceted program and cash grant treatments had significant positive impacts on young women's lives:  both treatments economically and statistically significant impacts on income.  Women in both treatment arms were also more likely than those in the control group women to be self-employed.  The impacts were largely comparable across the two treatments, though the cash grant treatment increased the number of hours women worked while the multifaceted program did not.\n\n \n\nAt endline, more than one year after treatment, women in both the multifaceted program and cash grant treatments were still more likely to be self-employed relative to control group women.  However, the medium-term impacts on income did not persist, and there were no differences across treatment arms in food security, living conditions, empowerment, personal expenditure, or household composition.  The similar pattern of (both medium and longer term) impacts across treatment arms suggests that the additional structure and training provided as part of the multifaceted intervention did not increase productivity sufficiently to create an enduring, profitable enterprise.\n\n \n\nBoth interventions were designed to ease credit constraints and led to large increases in self-employment without sustainable increases in income.  The lack of sustained impacts on income suggests that, in this setting, credit-constraints are not creating poverty traps that prevent youth from launching profitable businesses.  Our results are consistent with prospective entrepreneurs having limited secure savings mechanisms, leading them to start unsuccessful businesses which they subsequently consume over time.  The lack of sustained impacts across both arms suggests that self-employment may not be the solution to high youth underemployment, at least in this context. \n\n \n\nThe project supported one PhD graduate student who is set to graduate this year.  Through the project, he developed local contextual knowledge that aided his dissertation; all three chapters of his dissertation use data and policies in Kenya while one chapter stems directly from this project.  He also developed contacts and connections through the project that have led directly to other research opportunities; the research organization coordinating the project asked him to assist an international NGO on the design and implementation of impact evaluations in both Kenya and Rwanda.\n\n \n\nA full description of the project and results can be found in the following working paper:\n\nAndrew Brudevold-Newman, Maddalena Honorati, Pamela Jakiela, and Owen Ozier.
