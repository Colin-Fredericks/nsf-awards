 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: The role of iron and reactive oxygen species in the oxidation and fate of DOM in natural waters \r\n\r\nThis study will determine the direct and indirect roles of iron in both light and dark reactions involving DOM degradation, and estimate the importance of iron in determining whether this degradation will shunt C as DOM down rivers to oceans, or fully oxidize C to CO2 released to the atmosphere. The proposed work will advance our understanding of the degradation of soil carbon exposed to oxygen or sunlight at Earth?s surface during land-surface disturbances. This knowledge will allow scientists to better predict the fate of C in arctic permafrost soils, and through an education and outreach plan, will allow society to better prepare for the potential acceleration of global warming through a positive feedback from the thawing Arctic. To engage underrepresented students in science, the PI proposes to expand the infrastructure of education through partnerships that will offer new opportunities to enhance teaching and communication skills. The PI will develop a curriculum in earth and environmental science integrated with her research, grounded in core education principles, and mapped to assessment goals. A novel contribution to curriculum development will be the combination of (1) education modules that ?telescope? in age-context and difficulty from K-12 to undergraduate to adult outreach levels, (2) data generation on student engagement and learning through micro-assessments of performance, and (3) enhanced active learning by iterative improvement of modules by students for their own peer groups. \r\n\r\nThis research will be done in the Alaskan Arctic because (1) the lakes, streams, and soil waters provide a natural experimental matrix of both high and low light, oxygen, DOM and Fe concentrations, and (2) there are tremendous stores of organic C in frozen soils (at least twice the amount of C now in the atmosphere) which are rapidly thawing from global warming. Using field surveys and experiments on natural waters to test mechanistic hypotheses, the PI will answer two main research questions: (1) Do reactions mediated by iron favor the complete oxidation of DOM to CO2 by sunlight and microbes? (2) Is the iron-mediated oxidation of DOM in the dark an important determinant of DOM fate?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Scientific Merit.  The Arctic is warming twice as fast as any place on earth in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.  Warming is thawing permafrost soils in the Arctic, which store tremendous amounts of organic carbon that has been frozen for many thousands of years.  Once warmed and thawed, soil organic carbon can be oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas.  CO2 produced from organic carbon in the permafrost contributes to the \"Arctic Amplification\" of climate change, where thawing permafrost releases carbon that is oxidized to CO2, increasing warming, thus thawing more permafrost in a positive feedback loop.  Given the current trajectory of climate change, estimates are that the CO2 produced from thawing permafrost soils could result in an additional one third degree Celsius of warming on Earth by 2100.   The main conclusion from this project is that the current estimates of additional climate warming from the permafrost carbon feedback are too low because they do not consider the integrated chemical and biological processes that oxidize organic carbon draining from permafrost soils to CO2.  Specifically, in both dark soils and in sunlit waters, the conversion of soil organic carbon to CO2 in the Arctic is mediated by chemical and biological interactions between iron and organic carbon. \n\nIn dark soils, chemical and biological (redox) cycling of iron produces reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radical (Figure 1).  This project showed that the hydroxyl radical oxidizes dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to CO2, and that this process is an important component of the Arctic carbon budget. This project showed how the CO2 produced from the iron redox cycling depends on the patterns and amounts of rainfall that oxygenate the soil (Figure 1), allowing predictions of the CO2 produced under current and future hydrologic conditions.  These findings apply to soils at any latitude that contain iron and organic carbon.  This project also demonstrated a strong correlation between the export of iron and organic carbon from land to water in the Arctic, which led to a second major discovery.\n\n \nOnce in sunlit surface waters, iron catalyzes the photochemical (sunlight-driven) oxidation of DOC to CO2 (a process called photo-decarboxylation; Figure 2).   This discovery of the iron-catalyzed photo-decarboxylation of DOC to CO2 settled a debate on whether sunlight can oxidized ancient permafrost DOC to CO2.  The debate was settled with the first measurements of the radiocarbon age of the CO2 produced upon exposure of permafrost DOC to sunlight.  Ancient DOC (greater than 4,000 years old) draining permafrost soils is quickly oxidized to CO2 by sunlight (Figure 2).  These measurements were made across the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of sunlight (i.e., from UVB to UVA), showing that even less energetic longer wavelengths of sunlight can oxidize ancient DOC to CO2, and that this reaction is catalyzed by iron.  Settling this debate has critical implications: if sunlight oxidizes old DOC to CO2, then this CO2 will contribute to the Arctic amplification of climate change.  This project showed that the current estimates of additional climate warming from the permafrost C feedback are too low by at least 14%.  This estimate is conservative because it does not account for increased sunlight exposure of DOC from earlier ice-out on lakes across a warming Arctic. \nBroader Impacts.   Earth and environmental sciences (EES) are among the least diverse of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the United States (US). Increasing the diversity of students in EES is critical for (1) a broad coalition of next generation of scientists who will discover and apply solutions to climate change, and (2) because the burden of climate change is unequally distributed.
