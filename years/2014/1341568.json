 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bassis/1341568\r\nThis award supports the development of a model that can simulate both the flow and fracture of glacier ice, (including the slow creeping of that ice) as it spreads under its own weight all the way to the complete failure and detachment (calving) of icebergs from glaciers and ice shelves (floating expanses of glacier ice).   Because iceberg calving accounts for nearly 50% of the mass lost from ice shelves, it plays an important role in the mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets, but remains a poorly understood process.  Iceberg calving is also not yet accounted for in the current generation of continental-scale ice sheet models, which are used in state-of-the-art climate simulations and sea level rise projections, because simulating iceberg calving requires that we understand the initiation and propagation of fractures within the ice over timescales that can range from a few seconds to decades or even centuries.  To address this problem, the primary objective of this project is to address this gap in our understanding by translating physical and computational approaches originally developed to simulate the fracture of quasi-brittle materials, like metals and concrete, to the fracture of glacier ice.  Since it is both impossible and impractical to simulate the propagation of each individual crack in an ice sheet, we will seek a \"continuum damage mechanics\" approach that handles collections of cracks in a physically and thermodynamically consistent way to simulate failure at the large scale. This will be accomplished by using an approach that can simulate what happens to fractures after they form at the interface with the ocean.\r\n \r\nThis project seeks to advance our ability to predict the fate of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and to quantify the ice sheet contribution to sea level rise in the coming centuries.  Accomplishing this requires that we have a better understanding of why icebergs that can exceed the size of small New England States, detach and drift away from ice shelves.  The broader impacts of the project also include graduate and undergraduate education through directed research projects and targeted engagement of under-represented minorities in low-income regions at the elementary and high school levels.   Engagement with under-represented minorities will include counseling and planning for future career paths in the STEM fields and mentoring selected students during summer internship programs hosted by the University of Michigan, Vanderbilt University and Columbia University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCoastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which is directly related to the growth and demise of ice sheets.  To improve the decision making process, social scientists and policy makers require easily accessible projections of sea level rise to implement planning decisions and our research directly feeds into that need.  Moreover, projections of ice sheet response to future climate change requires physical models of the processes governing flow and fracture of ice. Our project focused on simulating the iceberg calving cycle from glaciers and ice shelves by translating techniques developed in computational fracture mechanics to glaciology.  Our project examined the evolution of fractures in ice, called crevasses, in glaciers and ice sheets to better understand the processes controlling how ice breaks with the ultimate goal of include these processes in continental scale ice sheet models used for sea level projections.  As part of this project, we developed a new model that can simulate the propagation of water filled crevasses using a tool called damage mechanics.  This new method is an improvement over previous tools because it can not only be included in existing continental scale ice sheets models, but it can also  simulate a wide spectrum of calving behaviors observed to occur.  Using this new model, we were able to show that when a warm ocean erodes the ice near the terminus of a glacier, it changes the stress distribution in the glacier and this can increase or decrease the likelihood  that the ice will break: submarine melt can increase the rate at which blocks of ice detach by more than a factor of 10 or suppress calving.  We also discovered that many of the traditional approaches used by glaciologists--built on a theory called linear elastic fracture mechanics--are inconsistent with the large scale ductile flow of ice.  The damage mechanics approach we developed as part of this project, however, alleviates this issues.  The models developed by the University of Michigan as part of this study are posted are freely available on GitHub (https://goo.gl/R4DwVZ).  \n\nThis research project also bridges computational solid mechanic and glaciology. The damage mechanics based hydrofracture model we developed could apply to a wide variety of materials that fail through ductile and brittle mechanisms, including concrete and sea sea ice. Our fundamental research in this area is thus relevant to a broad spectrum of computational mechanics and material science problems.\n\n In additional to providing tools that will ultimately improve sea level projections, our study also examined how useful or usable projections are to local communities.  As part of our study we also educated several graduate and undergraduate students.
