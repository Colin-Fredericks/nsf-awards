 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigator will participate in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic Ocean expedition and measure silicon isotopes composition of silicic acid in seawater samples, as well as diatoms and sea ice. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. As silicon is a key component of diatom shells, the measurement of their concentrations in this study can provide an important indicator of primary productivity, both in the present day, as well as past oceans. The project will provide training for undergraduate students and a post-doctoral researcher in silicon chemistry, as well as include outreach to K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe silicon isotope proxy is increasingly being used to assess the role of diatoms and silicic acid supply to past shifts in ocean productivity and their role in Earth's climate. Application of the proxy requires knowledge of the silicon isotopic composition of ventilating water masses. Uncertainty in these values translates directly into uncertainty in the level of productivity implied by the proxy. The growing global data set of silicon isotopes in marine waters suggest that silicon isotopes in subsurface waters are not uniform, but vary systematically driven by interactions between silicon isotope fractionation, the biological pump and thermohaline circulation. In addition, significant anomalies exist between model predictions and observations. In this study, researchers will test hypotheses regarding the origin of this signal and the mechanisms controlling silicon isotope distributions within the Arctic Ocean by greatly expanding the silicon isotope data set for this region. The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that silicon isotope distributions are controlled by the coupling of silicon fractionation during silica production and during silica dissolution to the biological pump and to the meridional overturning circulation.",

Dissolved silicon in seawater supports the growth of microscopic algae called diatoms that use silicon to build a house of glass called a frustule.  For diatoms silicon is an essential nutrient. Without silicon diatoms cannot grow.  Understanding what controls diatom growth in the sea is important because these tiny microscopic organisms produce 20% of the oxygen generated through photosynthesis on planet Earth each year. They are also import for food security as diatoms form the base of the food web for most of the world?s largest fisheries. \n\nThe diatom need for silicon means that the amount of silicon dissolved in seawater can control where diatoms grow and how many grow in a particular place. Diatoms are photosynthetic organisms so they live in the surface ocean where sunlight is abundant.

It turns out that diatoms discriminate against heavy isotopes preferring the lighter ones for building their shells. They do this in a systematic fashion allowing us to use their isotopic composition to assess their cumulative growth and productivity in a given region of the ocean.  However, there is a trick.  To do this it is necessary to understand the isotopic composition of dissolved silicon that they are using to grow.   We are learning that the ocean is far from homogenous when it comes to the isotopic composition of the dissolved silicon in the deep ocean waters that come to the surface.  So how will we know what kinds of waters are coming to the surface in a particular place?  Developing the understanding that will let us answer this question was a major goal of this study.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is somewhat of an enigma for Si isotopes. Prior to our work only six full-depth profiles of the isotopic composition of dissolved silicon in the Arctic Ocean had been published.  Those data showed that the isotopic composition of deep waters in the Canada Basin were isotopically heavy (a high ratio of heavy silicon atoms to lighter ones) compared to deep waters from other deep ocean basins. Results from this project confirm the heavy nature of deep waters in the Canada Basin and provide new data that show similar heavy signatures in the deep waters of the Makarov and Amundsen Basins.

That mechanism may be the shallow depth of the ocean gateways that govern the exchange of water between the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

The Fram Strait in the Atlantic is deeper, nearly 2000 m, with additional inflows over the Barents Sea which is much shallower at only a few hundred meters.  Why does this matter?
