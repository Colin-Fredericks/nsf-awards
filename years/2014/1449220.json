The annual Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference promotes this process by providing an inclusive forum for the exchange of experimental and theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems neuroscience.  This purpose of this project is to broaden participation at the Cosyne meeting to include more individuals from under-represented groups through a continuing travel grant program targeting early-career scientists, and a new program of mentored travel awards for undergraduates.  Both programs will be active for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Cosyne meetings.",

In the past 3 years (i.e. the term of this grant), $16,000 in grant support was given out in each year, benefitting 20-30 female and UR participants per year.\n\n\nThe number of NSF \"broadening participation\" grants has remained roughly constant over the past 3 years (owing to the constant size of the NSF contribution).  However, in a positive sign of awareness and engagement of female and UR attendees, the absolute number of female and UR (and total female+UR) applicants was at an all time high at this year's meeting (431 in 2018 compared to 319 in 2015), and the number of such applicants as a fraction of the total applicant pool was also at an all time high this year (44% female and UR applicants in 2018 compared to 38% in 2015).\n\n\nWhile the benefit received by each of the female and UR awardees has an obvious financial aspect, it is also the case that such grants are viewed as an honor and/or sign of merit, and they are typically reported as such on the CV's of grant recipients.\n\n\nIn summary, NSF's support of participation and travel grants has over the past 6 years directly and indirectly benefited well over 100 female and UR Cosyne attendees.  The conference remains demographically unbalanced, however, so that the type of assistance NSF has given remains very important moving forward.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bartlett W Mel"
