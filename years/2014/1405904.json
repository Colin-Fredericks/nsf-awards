 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is an indispensable part of society today, but many of the details about how well it operates are poorly understood.  This project will support and enhance the Seattle community testbed, one of the tools supporting experimentation for measuring and understanding the Internet.   The Seattle testbed allows researchers the ability to safely run experiments on real user devices and networks and gives experimenters access to thousands of devices around the world.   End users must decide to 'opt-in' by installing the Seattle software on their tablet, smartphone, or other computing device to participate in Seattle.  Via enhancements to the Seattle platform, the project will improve the ability of researchers to understand smartphone and future network environments as they exist in the Internet today, so that they may improve the Internet and design better networks in the future.\r\n\r\nThis project will support the continued growth and development of the Seattle Testbed.   The programming APIs of the Seattle sandbox will be enhanced to add support for IPv6, reading device sensors, and multi-homing.   It will also improve support for NAT traversal, mobility, and similar code on the platform.   Several scalability and stability issues with the platform will be addressed, including automated build testing and similar practices.   The project will also more explicitly expose the community-driven development model at the project's core to make it easier for outside groups to participate in Seattle development and to also address the long-term sustainability of the Seattle code-base.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project extended the Seattle Testbed, a testbed used by thousands of students and researchers, to support wireless access points.   Prior to this work, the Seattle testbed ran in the background of tens of thousands of laptops, desktops, phones, and other devices around the world.  Seattle is commonly used for education, censorship detection / avoidance, and network measurement.  It provides unique capabilities because of the open model of use / participation and the utilization of devices owned by outside users.\n\nSOAR (Seattle on Access Routers) extended Seattle Testbed to run on\nwireless router devices at the edge of home networks, thus founding a\ndistributed cloud platform that permits researchers to securely run\nexperiments while preserving the privacy of the router?s owner, and the\nsafety and efficient operation of the device itself.\n\nSOAR addressed many challenges that hinder research on home networks.\nAny research platform designed for such studies must provide a set of programming interfaces to support as wide an\narray of measurements as possible. In addition, deployment on a home\nwireless router has tighter resource limitations than a home computer,\nor even\na cell phone. The SOAR platform addressed these concerns. It\nderives its  basic building blocks from the Seattle project, a proven\nlarge-scale, open-source testbed system. Seattle enables code from\nuntrusted sources to run securely on resources donated by volunteer\ncontributors from around the world.
