 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists combine an understanding of current conditions with models to predict the effects of future environmental conditions on populations and communities. Many of the models used are incomplete, hindering these important predictions. This project improves predictions of where species will occur as environments change by including new data on the similarity, or degree of dependency, among observations that are closely associated in space. It will significantly advance fundamental research in ecology. Simultaneously, the research will result in a clearer general understanding of how species will respond to increasing habitat degradation, invasive species, disease, and climate change, thereby contributing directly to biodiversity conservation. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to investigate the relationship between stream flow variability, spatial relatedness, and fish species occurrence across sites within the Big River watershed in East Central Missouri while developing statistical techniques to account for the effects of spatial autocorrelation on species distribution predictions. Spatial autocorrelation is the positive association between the proximity of sample locations and the similarity of data at each location. It reduces the accuracy of current species distribution models. Stream fish assemblages at 50 sites across the watershed will be sampled and predicted based on spatial relatedness to other sampling sites and flow variability data estimated from high resolution in-stream depth gauges. The Big River watershed is a primary focus of collaborative conservation efforts by the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy in Missouri.  The data and results generated from this study will be of practical use by these agencies during their attempts to balance human activities and the conservation of biodiversity in this unique aquatic ecosystem. The project will significantly enhance ongoing dissertation research by providing field tests of model predictions, broadening and strengthening graduate student training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOngoing changes in the environment associated with human activities are having significant impacts on the distribution of biodiversity.  These changes are expected to continue and intensify over the coming century.  The conservation and management of biodiversity and ecosystems is dependent on our ability to predict how species will respond to these predicted changes.  Species distribution models (SDMs) combine data on the contemporary geographic locations where a species is known to occur with data on the environment at each location.  This approach is used to identify regions a species could occupy and has wide applications in biology, particularly in assessing the effects of environmental change on the distribution of biodiversity.  However, the data used in these models generally exhibit a pattern known as spatial autocorrelation, which is the positive association between the proximity of sample locations and the similarity of data at each location.  Unfortunately, spatial autocorrelation reduces the accuracy of traditional SDM predictions and thus limits our ability to accurately represent species\u00c6 responses to future environmental conditions.  SDMs that are able to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data should provide more accurate species distribution predictions.  The goal of this research has been to investigate the relationship between stream flow variability, spatial relatedness, and fish species occurrence across sites within the Meramec River watershed in east central Missouri while developing statistical techniques to account for the effects of spatial autocorrelation on SDM predictions.  Stream fish assemblages at 40 sites across the watershed were sampled and predicted based on spatial relatedness to other sampling sites and flow variability data estimated from high resolution in-stream depth gauges.  Initial results suggest that models that incorporate environmental conditions as well as account for spatial relatedness of samples provide more robust estimates of species diversity, thus confirming the importance of accounting for spatial autocorrelation in SDM approaches.  We intend to repeat this research effort in 2016 to assess the consistency of these results.\n\nAquatic taxa are some of the most imperiled organisms on the planet due to the effects of habitat degradation, invasive species, and ongoing changes in climate.  This research contributes to the development of techniques that provide spatially informed predictions of the distribution of aquatic species related to environmental conditions, thus providing important information for species conservation.  The methods developed are generally applicable, making them of use to anyone interested in the accurate prediction of the distribution of biodiversity.  The Meramec River watershed is a primary focus of collaborative conservation efforts by the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy in Missouri.  The data and results generated from this study have provided important information that is being used by these agencies during their attempts to balance human activities and the conservation of biodiversity in this unique aquatic ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason H Knouft"
