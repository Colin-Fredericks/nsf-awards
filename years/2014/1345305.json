 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA) project aims to design, evaluate, and realize a future network architecture that provides inherent trustworthiness, supports long-term evolution of network use models and network technology, and addresses adoption through careful design of APIs and reasoned analysis of interactions (or tussle points) between multiple stakeholders. XIA offers intrinsic security by offering each entity the ability to unilaterally validate that it is communicating with the correct counterparties. XIA admits new usage models to evolve through the use of flexible addresses. This architectural flexibility also exposes new features, for example, enabling users to trade-off maintaining anonymity against maximizing efficiency in content retrieval. To date, the XIA team has developed an initial architecture; built prototype implementations of the XIA data plane, network protocol stack, and secure unicast communication using Scalability, Control and Isolation On next-generation Networks (SCION); engaged in a wide range of basic networking and security research; and investigated questions raised by future Internet architecture research.\r\n\r\nIn the next phase of research on XIA, principal investigators (PIs) advance the original vision of XIA by deepening the ongoing research thrusts, driven in part by research questions exposed during the initial investigation. The research agenda also includes an increased emphasis on control protocols based on a unified control plane architecture. The research will be driven through two network deployments that challenge the architectural framework: a vehicular network deployment in the city of Pittsburgh, and a video delivery environment spanning the U.S. These deployments also leverage and deepen the work on secure network operations, including providing a highly available infrastructure and secure authentication mechanisms. Finally, these deployments necessitate further research on building a robust XIA network, and establish best practices for using the XIA architecture, including support for mobility and a rich session layer. The research will continue to be informed by issues of deployability and economic viability, and to consider XIA as perceived by end users. The plan therefore includes research on governance, economic implications of high availability, and user studies that investigate the interplay between privacy, transparency and user control. Finally, the PIs will develop methods for performing a comparative evaluation of future Internet architectures. This evaluation methodology includes a definition of evaluation criteria, a discussion of the importance of direct and indirect evaluation, and evaluation using the XIA network environments and other use cases.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed work is an ambitious study of the effectiveness of a new architectural framework, evaluated in the context of two challenging network environments. The cross-cutting expertise of the team enables broad and deep investigation, starting from specification and implementation of many key network and security building blocks, up to application-specific methods delivering innovative solutions in the vehicular and video delivery environments. The evaluation spans multiple disciplines, ranging from low-level performance evaluation to reasoning about incentive-compatibility and economic benefits of the PIs' approach to a quantification of user experience. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will establish a framework for evaluating network architectures that will be broadly applicable to FIA research. The PIs propose a variety of education and outreach activities to accompany the proposed research. Educational activities include new courses on clean-slate network design, and teaching and internship activities for under-represented and high school students. Broader outreach activity also includes a plan to involve and inform policymakers on the health of the current and future Internet led by a PI who formerly served at the FCC.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Internet has been widely successful and has become an integral part of our society.  It is also facing a growing number of significant challenges, such as the security of both endpoints and the network infrastructure, user privacy, and the need to support increasingly diverse services and applications.  This project evaluated and redined the XIA architecture and its prototype implementation using two use cases: vehicular networks and large scale video distribution.\n\nBoth the vehicular and video use cases helped in the evaluation and further refinement of the architecture.  The video distribution research showed that opportunistic caching can significantly improve the video quality received by users.  However, care must be taken that caching does not negatively impact the video player?s bit rate optimization and the video broker?s CDN selection algorithms.  The study also led to a more in-depth study of how XIA can support information centric networking.  This allowed us to show the benefits for XIA?s three main features.   XIA?s ability to introduce new content identifier types for different types of content.  The use of fallbacks means that content addresses can be opportunistic, i.e., they do not have to be universally reachable.  Finally, we were able to implement different intrinsic security mechanisms for the different types of content.  The vehicular use case showed that XIA?s flexible address format and support for in-network functions makes it possible to optimize network access for intermittently connected vehicles.  Building on this result, we were able to use XIA to implement more general primitives for asynchronous communication, i.e., between nodes node simultaneously connected to the network.\n\nThe project has had significant broader impact.  The project has high visibility in the networking research community and industry, and its research results are having an impact, both by helping establish an active future internet architecture research community, and by contributing specific concepts that have shown to improve network evolvability, customizability, and security.   The project has also trained a large number undergraduate, MS, and PhD students and postdocs in the context of a unique project, that is not only interdisciplinary, but also focusses on ``big systems?? research and is very forward looking.  A specific example is that our research on supporting the use of trusted that are explicitly inserted by the endpoints in TLS sessions is part of a standardization effort by ETSI.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Steenkiste"
