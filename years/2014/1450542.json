The project will study the potential for leveraging NSF?s National Innovation Network to help support the training of SBIR PIs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The proposed EAGER project has two goals: to design new content for a syllabus and manage the delivery of a ten-week Life Sciences curriculum to scientists and engineers; and to conduct evaluation studies that refine the I-Corps curriculum during delivery and assess its value and potential for broader implementation among NSF/NIH grantees. \r\n\r\nThe proposed training will enable researchers to avoid many of the pitfalls that commonly cause start-up enterprises to fail, thus accelerating the commercialization of new technologies and discoveries that benefit society. In order for the U.S. to realize the nascent potential of its investments in basic research and remain a world leader in STEM innovation, researchers need formal training that helps them evaluate whether their discoveries and inventions can realistically be translated into applications and eventual commercialization.",

Through a dynamic collaboration with National Collegiate Inventors &amp; Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), NSF offers select participants from U.S. academic laboratories the opportunity to participate in a special, accelerated version of Stanford University\u00c6s Lean LaunchPad course. This revolutionary course engages participants in moving products out of the lab and into the market by talking to potential customers, partners and competitors, and encountering the challenges and uncertainty of creating and commercializing successful innovations.\n\nThe I-Corps curriculum builds on four core understandings that have proven effective for NSF-funded scientists and engineers:\n\nSuccessful startups begin by testing a series of hypotheses with potential customers;\nSuccessful ventures refine their assumptions based on data generated through testing;\nResearchers apply their hypothesis-testing skills to business model development; and\nEntrepreneurial skills can be taught to innovators through immersion in an intensive ten-week customer and business model discovery curriculum.\n\n\nProject Goals: Building upon the successful scale-up of the I-Corps program for NSF-funded researchers, the work conducted within the scope of this grant provided the opportunity to pilot and evaluate the efficacy of a new I-Corps curriculum specifically designed for researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) phase 1 SBIR program.\n\nFederal Award # 1450542 achieved its two primary goals:\n\n\n\n(1) Design content for a syllabus and manage the delivery of a ten-week Life Sciences curriculum for NIH-funded scientists and biomedical engineers, including:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCreate new life-sciences curriculum materials;\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nAssemble a teaching team that includes experts in biomedicine, technology, and financing to help design and deliver the new NIH I-Corps (life-sciences) curriculum;\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nDesign and deliver content-specific workshops and online training; and\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nFacilitate ongoing opportunities for professional networking and business development through NCIIA\u00c6s NSF-funded National Innovation Network.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n(2) Conduct evaluation studies that measure the efficacy of the revised I-Corps curriculum in instilling new entrepreneurial skills among 70+NIH I-Corps team members. NCIIA\u00c6s longitudinal evaluation measured the NIH I-Corps teams\u00c6 ability to:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nAssess the commercial readiness of their technology;\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nArrive at a clear decision regarding next steps in the venture development process; and\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nDevelop a commercialization path to move their technologies to market.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProject Impact:  The project\u00c6s success in tailoring the NSF I-Corps curriculum for NIH phase 1 SBIR teams demonstrates that a large-scale dissemination of I-Corps training in the life sciences can be implemented among hundreds (and thousands) of U.S. scientists and engineers who are innovators in biology, medicine, biotechnology, public health, bio-informatics, and health care management. Based on the success of this first I-Corps training for life sciences teams, in FY2016, the National Institutes of Health funded two cohorts totaling 38 teams to participate in I-Corps training using the life sciences curriculum developed under the auspices of this pilot project. I-Corps training for NIH-funded researchers is now enabling participating teams to avoid many of the pitfalls that commonly cause startups to fail, thereby accelerating the commercialization of new technologies and getting much needed discoveries and products to the people and communities for whom they were intended to benefit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip J Weilerstein"
