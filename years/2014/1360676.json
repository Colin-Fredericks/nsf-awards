 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference at the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia from March 13 to March 15, 2014.  The Spring Topology Conference is one of the largest and most successful annual topology conferences in the United States. The conference generally attracts 150-200 participants from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and, increasingly, from Europe, Asia, and even New Zealand. The conference allows participants to interact with a large number of active topologists, both within and outside their specialties.  The conference has expanded to encompass most of the major branches of topology, as well as dynamical systems, and now includes sessions in set theoretic/general topology, continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology, and geometric group theory. \r\n \r\nThis grant will support travel for the 18 plenary/semi-plenary speakers and for graduate students and younger researchers who lack institutional support for travel.  Participants in the sessions come from a broad range of institutions from small liberal arts colleges to research universities, and range from graduate students to senior researchers.  Most participants do not have colleagues in their home departments with research interests close to their own. They rely on this conference to keep up with recent work in topology and dynamical systems, meet with colleagues who do have research interests close to their own, and present what they themselves have been able to contribute. For more information visit the conference web site.\r\n\r\nhttp://math.richmond.edu/resources/topology-conference/index.html",
