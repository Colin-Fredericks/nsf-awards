 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical: \r\n\r\nThis award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to University of California, Merced is to understand how DNA folds to make a variety of large scale structures.  Nature has developed the ability to assemble biomolecules into complex biological structures which allow the molecular components to work in concert to perform the elaborate functions of life. A long-standing endeavor is to develop methods that allow molecular building blocks to self-organize into higher order structures. The DNA origami method folds a long, single-stranded DNA molecule into nanoscale shapes using short oligonucleotide strands with complementary sequences.  By developing high-resolution microscopy techniques that can capture snapshots of individual DNA origami structures as they form, the PI will begin to understand the mechanism of the self assembly process.  The findings of this research may enable the self-assembly of complex structures that can perform novel functions such as sensing and nanoelectronic and photonic circuits.\r\nThe project will provide graduate students and postdoc researchers with interdisciplinary training that is needed to address high-profile challenges in biomolecular materials. It will also bring new research opportunities to undergraduate students at UC Merced, a large fraction of whom are under-represented minorities.  Working with the local school district, the PI will host lab tours and develop nanoscience demonstrations.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to understand the self-assembly pathways of DNA origami and introduce precise surface interactions to regulate the self-assembly process.  The ensemble spectroscopy and ex-situ microscopy techniques commonly used provide limited information concerning the intermediate structures. The PI will fold DNA origami tiles on dynamic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces, which can rapidly trap the intermediate structures for high resolution AFM imaging.  With detailed structural information of the folding intermediates, the PI will begin to reconstruct and elucidate the folding pathways. Building upon novel surface chemistry developed in the lab, the PI will enable individual oligonucleotide molecules to nucleate the formation of origami tiles of specific size, shape and internal arrangement on the SAM surface. If successful, the study will significantly advance the understanding of the self-assembly process of DNA origami nanostructures and potentially allow the formation of much larger structures with more sophisticated functions.  The project will prepare graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar to tackle high-profile challenges in biomolecular materials, a field demanding highly interdisciplinary solutions.",
