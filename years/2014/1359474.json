 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center will continue its marine technical internship program, which represents a partnership with University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The program will provide 14 undergraduate students with two to eight week internships and one student with a six-month internship each year for the next three years (2014-2017).  MATE interns work with marine technicians and scientists onboard UNOLS and USCG research vessels, and these experiences provide them with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills. MATE's at-sea technical internships help undergraduate students gain the experience they need to be qualified for technical jobs in marine-related academic and industry careers, and it provides ocean-related employers with access to qualified technical professionals who can fill their workforce needs. The MATE Center has 56 formal community college and university partnerships from which the interns are actively recruited. The program targets community college students enrolled in marine science and technology programs and university students interested in marine technical careers. The program's primary target audience is students enrolled in community colleges as these students tend to be more diverse (age, socioeconomic and ethnic) than four-year university students and are not typically provided with research opportunities. Evaluation into the success of the internship's long-term impact on student career trajectories is planned. Through this work, the internship program continues to expand its reach and impact on undergraduate marine technical education.",
