 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant number of today's mathematics graduate students will enter the workforce as college faculty members for which teaching undergraduate students will comprise a significant portion of their professional responsibilities. Although some resources are available for the professional development (PD) of graduate students or novice college mathematics instructors, mathematics departments wishing to develop or expand such a program to enhance undergraduate teaching and learning find it challenging to obtain instructional materials and/or appropriate faculty expertise on which to draw. There are informal networks of faculty who work in this arena, but the resources that do exist often are inaccessible or difficult to locate for those new to the teaching workforce. Against this backdrop, the project will: (i) provide better access to the existing resources; (ii) develop new resources and opportunities for access; and (iii) create lasting versions of the existing informal networks of faculty practitioners and researchers. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will create an infrastructure, housed, supported, and sustained by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), to enhance the mathematics community's ability to provide high quality, teaching-related PD to graduate students. Associated activities will include the creation of a community of practice and online resource library to help mathematics departments start and strengthen programs to prepare graduate students to teach undergraduate mathematics. Three primary audiences will benefit: 1) Providers - experienced faculty who provide PD opportunities to graduate students teaching or preparing to teach undergraduate mathematics; 2) Scholars - faculty and graduate students who develop PD materials and programs and/or conduct research on the teaching of undergraduate mathematics; and 3) Teaching Assistants (TAs) - the graduate students themselves who seek professional development. Key components of the infrastructure include: 1) a multimedia suite of resources for Providers and mechanisms for building it; 2) a professional community of practice bringing together Providers and Scholars; 3) workshops and webinars for Providers and Scholars; and 4) distance delivery of PD for graduate students who have no face-to-face opportunity at their local institution. Evaluation will be a key component integrated throughout the project, and will focus on both formative input of each component as the project develops and a final summative report. Included will be a needs assessment survey of graduate programs as well as research to contribute to the understanding of (i) how to develop effective programs that lead to expansion of systematic and sustainable TA PD programs across the nation and (ii) how the components of the project work together to help create a community of practice and the potential of this community to expand and thrive.",

Similarly, despite the important roles they play in undergraduate mathematics education, little attention has been focused on preparation of graduate student teaching assistants (GTAs) for the classroom. The nature of this preparation also varies widely: some universities have well-established programs for GTA professional development for teaching (PDT) while others have no program at all. This stands in stark contrast to preparation of elementary and secondary teachers who complete courses focused on teaching methods and supervised student teaching experiences and who participate in PDT throughout their careers. When this project began, most university faculty described the entirety of their preparation for teaching as</span><span> some variation of this story: \"In graduate school, when I became a TA someone gave me a textbook, syllabus, and a room assignment and told me that classes start on Monday.\"</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In 2014, we conducted a survey of U.S. mathematics departments and found considerable interest in developing programs for GTA PDT. However, interested faculty (we call them Providers) often found it difficult to locate materials or to obtain advice from experienced Providers. </span><span>This situation was strikingly similar to the earlier situation with new GTAs: a member of the department is assigned to offer PDT to graduate students and is told when and where the course will meet. And in this case, there wasn&rsquo;t even a textbook for them to refer to and it is likely that the faculty member never took a course like this when they were a TA.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The purpose of this project, \"Improving the Preparation of Graduate Students to Teach Undergraduate Mathematics\" (now known as the College Mathematics Instructor Development Source (CoMInDS)), is to address this by developing a freely available online resource of materials housed by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and to offer professional development to Providers of GTA PDT.&nbsp; Since 2016, we have offered nine three-day workshops to help Providers develop PDT programs and have created a community of practice to sustain these efforts.&nbsp; The online Resource Suite has more than 130 entries (e.g., activities, assignments, readings).&nbsp; </span><span>We originally planned to offer two workshops for a total of 48 participants. However, each year there were more applications than available spots. Because of this demand, we obtained funding for seven additional workshops. </span><span>To date, a total of 267 faculty members have participated in one of our workshops. These faculty are from 121 institutions (master degree and Ph.D granting), representing about 48% of the U.S mathematics Ph.D programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During the workshops, participants learn to design a successful graduate student professional development program, gain familiarity with research and evaluation related to teaching and instructor preparation, gain access to a large collection of lessons, activities, and assignments to use in their program and become familiar with activities designed specifically for use with graduate students teaching undergraduate mathematics. Built into the schedule is time for participants to plan and get input from experienced providers and to network with others who run GTA PDT programs. The external evaluator reported, \"Participants valued networking with other TA PD providers, sharing knowledge about their practice, and learning about topics important to TA PD. Most perceived the CoMInDs resource suite to be a useful resource.

They hoped to continue to interact with other providers but acknowledged they would need structures and prodding to do so.\"</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intellectual Merit:&nbsp; This project addressed the critical need to improve student learning opportunities in undergraduate mathematics by enhancing GTA PDT.&nbsp; There now exists a professional community of practice of experienced PDT providers, educational researchers and a leading professional organization to support and sustain these efforts. A toolkit of online resources together with workshops and webinars equip community members to develop and deliver research-based PDT. A rigorous, comprehensive project evaluation has also contributed to the intellectual merit by identifying effective aspects of the project&rsquo;s approach to preparing graduate students to teach undergraduate mathematics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Broader Impacts:&nbsp; Having involved faculty from 121 mathematics departments, the project has impacted teaching done by graduate students during their years of graduate study at those institutions and in their subsequent careers. The CoMInDS workshops and resource suite will continue to support, sustain and improve the work of Providers of PDT. Providers who have participated in CoMInDS activities will improve the teaching of thousands of graduate students, many of whom will teach thousands of undergraduates during their careers.
