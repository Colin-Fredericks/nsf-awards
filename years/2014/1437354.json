Partial or complete obstruction of flow can occur in a variety of situations, perhaps most notably in stroke victims whose cerebral blood flow is blocked owing to a blood clot in a vessel.  Delivering drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that can dissolve a clot and restore blood flow is a challenge because the drug must diffuse to the clot, which is slow and often ineffective.  This GOALI project will explore the use of micron-sized iron particles in a magnetic field that can cause fluid mixing in blocked channels and improve transport of tPA along the length of the vessel to the clot. Investigators at The University of Texas and Pulse Therapeutics, Inc. will conduct a series of experiments and numerical simulations to analyze the flow induced by the particles and optimize transport of clot-dissolving agents in blocked vessels.  The results of the project could improve the effectiveness of tPA therapy, and be helpful in a diverse array of technological applications, including using surfactants to remove trapped water in shale and tight gas-sand reservoirs to improve oil and gas production.\r\n\r\nThis GOALI project will develop an experimentally validated model and simulation of magnetically driven convection of iron-containing fluid to understand how the strength of the magnetic field, its gradient and rotation rate generate flow and the sensitivities of the flow to these parameters.  The simulation tool will help optimize design of the magnetic system and selection of particle properties.  At the particle scale conservation equations will describe the local concentration of free particles and particles that chain together to form rods, including the formation and destruction of the rods due to the applied magnetic field, shear flow and interactions with the walls of the vessels.  It is hypothesized that these rods rotate in the field and generate localized vorticity that drives the macroscopic convective flow in the vessel. At the vessel scale conservation of mass and momentum equations will describe this magnetically-induced vorticity driven flow. The model equations will be solved asymptotically and numerically to understand this unique process for creating convective flows in dead-end or blocked vessels. Complementary experiments conducted by research team at Pulse Therapeutics will validate the model and indicate modifications as necessary.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of small magnetic particles and magnetic fields in fluids to create convective flows in blocked conduits was studied and optimized computationally and experimentally. Rapidly dissolving clots to unblock arteries in stroke victims is critical for their recovery and elimination or reduction of post-stroke disabilities.  In addition removing trapped water in the small pores in rock at well bores greatly increases oil and gas production in shale and tight gas-sand reservoirs.  The technical challenge is the delivery of clot-busting drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to the clots in the dead-end arteries or surfactants to the water drops in the blocked pores.  Transport of these molecules is usually by very slow and ineffective diffusion since the conduits are blocked.  It has been demonstrated that the addition of one micron iron particles to a fluid coupled with a rotating magnetic field with a field gradient can create a convective flow in blocked conduits and dramatically increase the delivery of the appropriate molecules to blockages and remove them.  The details and understanding of this method are unknown, and tools to optimize the process are lacking.  The GOALI partners at The University of Texas and Pulse Therapeutics, Inc. created experimentally validated models and simulations to understand and optimally design this process, potentially revolutionizing stroke treatment, near oil and gas well-bore water removal, and other systems that require convective flow in dead-end or small channels.\n\nA model and simulation of the magnetically driven convection of the iron containing fluid was created in order to understand how the strength of the magnetic field, its gradient and rotation rate generate the flow and the sensitivities of the flow to these parameters.  This simulation tool enabled the identification of the the optimal design of the magnetic system and the iron particle size and concentration.
