 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the selection and attendance of eight U. S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the 2014 Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in Heidelberg, Germany on September 21-26, 2014.  The HLF brings together Laureates of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science (the Abel Prize, the Fields Medal, the Turing Award, and the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize) to spend a week interacting with 200 early career researchers from all over the world. This award allows early career researchers from the U.S. to participate in this valuable international activity.  In addition to the  scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, young researchers at the Forum gain a valuable global perspective on the mathematical and computer sciences.  \r\n\r\nThe HLF provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers extraordinary access to a group of scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations.  Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career researcher.  Oak Ridge Associated Universities will recruit a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum.  This award is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nForum web site:  http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/",
