The contribution to the theory of geometric data analysis was the understanding of the organization of the second&shy;tier behavior of the data. This development should lead to a better understanding of trends in phylogenetic distance data and give insight into other possibilities for methods of geometric data analysis.\n\nBy finding a shelling order and identifying and counting the homology facets of a nonpure, disconnected simplicial complex, the PI and co&shy;authors re&shy;proved a well&shy;-known identity of Dixon by showing that it encoded the reduced Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex in question.
