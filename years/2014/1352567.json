 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-ray astronomy impacts a broad range of key science questions: indirect dark matter detection and tests of fundamental physical laws; cosmological studies; jet physics associated with active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and microquasars; and particle acceleration in galactic tevatrons and pevatrons. Today, extremely sensitive instruments operate in the high energy (AGILE and FERMI in the range 100 MegaelectronVolt (MeV) - 100 GigaelectronVolt (GeV)) and very high energy (VHE) (HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS at energies greater than 100 GeV;) regimes simultaneously. Among the most exciting results from VERITAS are the detection of emission from the Crab Pulsar above 100 GeV (requiring the presence of a new emission component), the discovery of gamma-ray emission from a starburst galaxy, M82 (firmly associating cosmic-ray acceleration with star-forming regions), and the detection of correlated variability in the radio and Teraelectronvolt (TeV) regimes in radio galaxies (helping to constrain the emission to be originating within the jet collimation region). The upper limit on the gamma-ray emission from the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy set by VERITAS rules out most of the leptophilic dark matter parameter space favored by recent cosmic-ray positron measurements. A major upgrade to the VERITAS cameras during summer 2012 introduced high-quantum-efficiency photo multiplier tubes to lower the energy threshold of the array by 30%, and the array will be further augmented by the arrival in 2015 of a prototype 10 meter class Schwarzschild-Couder telescope under development for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). \r\n\r\nFollowing the recent VERITAS hardware upgrade, great promise for further improving the science potential of the instrument comes from a focus on data analysis. This CAREER award provides support for developing major improvements in VERITAS data analysis methods aimed at lowering the analysis threshold, improving angular and energy resolution, and increasing background discrimination. It will also support analysis of VERITAS data to search for dark matter signals from the Galactic Halo, Fermi unassociated sources, and related targets, as well as studies of Galactic accelerators of cosmic rays. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The science of VERITAS and CTA - searching for dark matter and investigating the most powerful cosmic accelerators - has broad applications to both astro- and particle physics, and addresses questions that can capture the public's imagination. Group members will share that excitement via public lectures at area high schools and to groups in the local Morningside Heights and Harlem areas of Manhattan and Westchester County, and by engaging undergraduates and area high school students in the group's research activities. As a centerpiece to tie together these outreach activities, the group plans to develop a Visitor Center at Nevis Labs that will occupy both physical and virtual spaces and provide a focal point for visiting groups to learn about the history and current research at Nevis.",

The award supported scientists working on the VERITAS telescope at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona, USA. VERITAS detects gamma rays, the most energetic particles of light, and uses them to study astrophysical environments powered by extreme electric, magnetic, and/or gravitational fields. Columbia scientists participated in all aspects of the VERITAS project, including planning the observing program, taking observing shifts, performing calibration and engineering measurements, analyzing data and taking data-quality-monitoring shifts, interpreting the results, and preparing them for publication and presentation. Some of the scientific results led by Columbia scientists supported by this award include studies of Galactic cosmic-ray acceleration at shocks in supernova remnants, rapid variability in flaring gamma-ray emission from structures in the <em>jets</em> produced by some supermassive black holes, searches for dark matter sub-halos in the Milky Way galaxy, a refined measurement of the spectrum of gamma rays from the starburst galaxy M 82, constraints on the environment in which a nearby gamma-ray burst erupted, and development of improved data-analysis methods to enhance the sensitivity of VERITAS.</p>\n<p>Columbia scientists are also contributing to the development of a new design of telescope (Figure 1) with a <em>Schwarzschild-Couder</em> optical system, in preparation for a future, much more sensitive array of telescopes named the Cherenkov Telescope Array, to help advance the field of particle astrophysics over the coming decades. Columbia scientists performed simulation studies demonstrating the performance benefits of this new design. They also helped to development the alignment system for the segmented primary and secondary mirrors, building over 300 sensors to mount across the edges of neighboring mirror panels so that their relative positioning can be calibrated and tracked over time. Columbia scientists have also led the development of the control software for the alignment system. Working with collaborators to deploy and align the optical system resulted in achieving an excellent alignment of the mirrors, as demonstrated by observations of individual bright stars (Figure 4). An initial observing campaign with this telescope resulted in a high-significance detection of the Crab Nebula, the ?standard candle? source for gamma-ray astrophysics.</p>\n<p>One result was a deep observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 with both VERITAS and the <em>Fermi</em> Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (FGST), which covers a lower range of gamma-ray energies than the ground-based VERITAS. This middle-aged (probably around 10,000 years old) SNR is expanding into and colliding with various clouds of gas, some much denser than others. Together, the observations show that the gamma-ray emission from IC 443 looks essentially the same across a very wide range of energies, more than a factor of 100, despite the very different environmental conditions on different sides of the SNR (Figure 2 left, center). Another result using VERITAS and FGST was a study of the Cassiopeia A SNR, only about 350 years old, which supports the notion that it is a source of Galactic cosmic rays (Figure 2 right). Determining what types of objects in the Galaxy are mainly responsible for accelerating cosmic rays is one of the major goals of particle astrophysics. These two observations together provide support for the long-theorized notion that supernova remnants are the primary class of objects responsible, though more work remains to be done, as neither shows evidence of accelerating cosmic rays to a sufficiently high energy.</p>\n<p>Another result was the observation of a surprisingly rapid flare of very-high-energy gamma rays from the active galactic nucleus BL Lacertae (Figure 3): the gamma-ray flux rose over a time scale of about 2 hours, and then dropped much more rapidly, over about 30 minutes. Radio observations made nearby in time suggest that the gamma-ray flare may have been associated with a clump of material passing through a standing shock along the <em>jet</em> (or collimated beam) of matter and electromagnetic energy being emitted by this system.</p>\n<p>Columbia scientists worked to improve the sensitivity of VERITAS by using machine-learning methods alongside more advanced data-reconstruction techniques developed by collaborators in order to more efficiently reject background events. This combined <em>image template method</em> plus <em>boosted decision trees</em> analysis (ITM plus BDTs) improves the sensitivity of VERITAS by 30 to 50 percent, depending on the gamma-ray energy (Figure 5).</p>\n<p>Columbia scientists also shared the excitement of particle astrophysics research with high school and undergraduate students in a variety of ways, including summer internships and working with collaborators at Barnard College to host a summer school (Figure 6 left, center). Contributing to the development of a Science Center at Columbia?s Nevis Laboratories, that has exhibits spanning a wide range of physics activities, Columbia scientists on this award also gave public lectures to the local community and demonstrated how to make (and eat!) ice cream using liquid nitrogen, as part of an event with several local Cub Scout troops (Figure 6 right).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/19/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;Humensky</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1352567/1352567_10290232_1621432454172_psctPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1352567/1352567_10290232_1621432454172_psctPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1352567/1352567_10290232_1621432454172_psctPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The prototype 9.7-m-diameter Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope at the Whipple Observatory.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ribeiro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;Humensky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1352567/1352567_10290232_1621432112588_snrs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1352567/1352567_10290232_1621432112588_snrs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Studies of Supernova Remnants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1352567/1352567_10290232_1621432112588_snrs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Studies of Supernova Remnants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(left) VERITAS map of the SNR IC443 (Jellyfish Nebula).(center) Fermi-LAT and VERITAS photon energy spectra for the four regions indicated in the left panel.
