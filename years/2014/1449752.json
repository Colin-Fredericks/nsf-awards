The project consists of three major activities: 1) a summit of relevant, high-level federal administrators, university leaders and others to examine problems in and solutions for achieving compliance with Title IX, 2) an online Title IX toolkit with technical assistance as well as a new research instrumentation for collecting and analyzing intra-university data, and 3) the development and dissemination of a set of Title IX best practices based on the case study of effective implementation of Title IX in California. These activities have the potential to advance desired societal outcomes related to compliance with Title IX and a reduction in female STEM attrition, especially for early career female scientists and engineers.",
