 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) project is a collaborative endeavor involving Rochester Institute of Technology and Alfred University.  It addresses the need for biological sciences courses to encourage students to think critically, focus on unifying concepts, and practice experimental design, analysis of data, and scientific models.  Evidence reveals that the shift to these emphases requires the use of interactive instructional practices that have been shown to increase student learning gains. The modules being created by this project include many instructional practices that have been found to be effective in improving deep understanding of core concepts in biology defined by the Vision and Change initiative (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/) and the Next Generation Science Standards (http://www.nextgenscience.org/). The cornerstone of each module will be a new genre of web-based learning tools called Interactive Video Vignettes (IVVs). IVVs incorporate lessons learned from education and cognitive research on how people learn. They promote active learning by engaging learners with real-world problems, providing needed support, feedback, and guidance for the students, and requiring them to reflect on their own learning processes.  \r\n\r\nThe PI team is creating 14 modules that help biology students overcome common conceptual and learning difficulties and enrich student understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed through observation and experimentation. The design and implementation of the modules are informed by the results of a pilot project carried out by the PI team.  In that project, dramatic student learning gains were observed when IVVs were used in an introductory biology and an upper level cell biology course.  The PI team is extending their research on the learning outcomes to include the use of all of the newly developed IVVs.  The research methods include pre- and post-instruction assessment to examine student learning gains, comparative learning gains of students using the IVVs and students in traditional lecture classes, and direct queries (surveys and interviews) concerning students' attitudes to the biological sciences.  Modules tested at RIT and Alfred University will subsequently be studied at a broad range of institutions recruited by the PI team.   The knowledge resulting from these research studies is informing the design of STEM courses and the ways in which these effective instructional practices can be effectively integrated into traditional biology curricula nationwide.",

The core of each module is an Interactive Video Vignette (IVV), which is a new genre of a web-based learning tool that employs research-based strategies that are known to promote learning such as interactivity, prediction, analysis and reflection.  Each IVV centers on a real-life scenario that is accessible to a wide variety of learners and includes numerous opportunities for users to answer embedded questions (in a variety of formats such as open ended, multiple choice, multiple select, fill-in, etc.) make predictions about experimental results, analyze data and reflect upon what has been learned.  Each IVV was created to align with National Standards for undergraduate biology education.  Careful attention to language and actor-choice was also made to help bring awareness to the diversity in society and in science. \nThe team took a ?backwards design? approach when creating each IVV so that ideas contained within each could be aligned with novice ideas and ultimate learning goals.  Assessment questions were created so that the effectiveness of the IVV tools could be measured.   Currently 12 of our 14 IVVs are available for the public to use, and the other two will be ready this spring. From 12/1/2012 through 11/15/18, a total of 6,902 completions (users beginning and finishing an entire IVV) were recorded. \n \n\nAdditional capabilities were incorporated into the IVV software in each year of the project, which has the potential to positively impact others that wish to develop IVVs.

The IVV software, Vignette Studio, is freely available for use via the physics education resource, Compadre.org.\n\nBecause IVVs are intended to serve as primers to deconstruct incorrect ideas prior to in-class learning, the research team developed multiple-select style assessments for 10 of the IVVs.  Then it was necessary to develop a new method of pre-post multiple select assessment analysis that allowed us to probe progression away from incorrect and toward correct understanding.  In the process we developed new scripts in R to handle the complex data structure.  Preliminary analysis suggests that IVVs are good learning tools; most students enjoy the format and find the scenarios engaging and pre/post assessment data reveals learning on some important concepts.  Further analysis is required to fully vet all of the IVVs.\n\nThe other major accomplishment of this project was the creation of the modules that complement each IVV, and the development of a new website https://ivv.rit.edu/MINT to host all the MINTs.  Each MINT contains MINT Learning Objectives, Alignments to National Standards, an IVV (with description, associated Novice ideas and IVV Learning Goals), recommended in-class curricular material, a link to request assessment materials.
