 "awd_abstract_narration": "During this project, a two-year field campaign will measure the turbulent character of thunderstorm flow with two high-resolution weather radars. Comparison of the turbulence data to lightning flash rate and extent will test the hypothesis that turbulent convective motions are the source of electrical energy in storms. The rich textural character of thunderstorm data will be conveyed to the public in an innovative art exhibit. Data and software will be shared openly alongside traditional forms of publication.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nAfter thunderstorms become electrified, it is of basic interest to understand how often lightning will occur and how extensive those lightning flashes will be. Electrical potential energy stored in a storm's electric field is the result of charge carried on precipitating and non-precipitating hydrometeors which are themselves embedded in the storm's flow. In updraft regions of the storm, where conditions are most favorable for electrification, the storm's flow is highly turbulent, while downstream in anvils or in organized stratiform precipitation regions, flow is smoother. Recent work with a Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) has revealed that a lightning energy spectrum calculated from flash extent and flash rate looks much like the energy spectrum that would be predicted by Kolmogorov's classical turbulence theory for thunderstorm convective plumes. This project will assess turbulent characteristics of thunderstorms using high-resolution radars to quantitatively measure thunderstorm kinematics with weather radars. The combination of radar and LMA data will provide a quantitative test of the hypothesis that turbulence controls the distribution of sizes of charge regions, which in turn controls flash rate and extent. By establishing quantitative links between convective and electrical energy at the range of scales native to both lightning and the convective character of the plume, this project is expected to establish a fundamental new relationship between lightning and deep convection, including a reliable statistical statement about the distribution of flash sizes expected in thunderstorms.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nAttending lightning are recreational, commercial and environmental impacts, which makes lightning an area of interest to individuals and formal decision support services provided by and between businesses and government agencies. This project will help clarify the distribution of electrical potential in storms, which controls to a large extent whether a flash strikes ground. The field campaign and its results will be shared at local high schools to stimulate interest in science and mathematics. During the project, artists will produce an immersive gallery exhibit derived from field data. This exhibit will include a survey component to test its effectiveness in presenting lightning data with the rich texture as it actually exists in storms, countering notions of lightning as singleton storm-wide discharges between simple vertically stacked charge layers. Data collection, analysis, and publication of results in a team setting will provide students with scholarly and methodological training through a project that is rich in cross-disciplinary theory and in practical skills tied to observational work. In an era of increasing computational resources and emphasis on data management and digital knowledge dissemination, this project will train students to adopt best practices in reproducible scientific research using open, pan-disciplinary tools enabled by dispersed, diverse internet-based communities.",
