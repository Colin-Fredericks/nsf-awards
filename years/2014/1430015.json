 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal  to fund a research training cruise on the University of Minnesota's R/V Blue Heron for early career scientists from the Great Lakes basin. The proposed work will have two goals: 1) teach early career lacustrine scientists how to acquire, plan for,\r\nand manage cruises aboard UNOLS ships, possibly having some impact on the long-term decrease in requests for ship time on UNOLS ships in general; and 2) expose members of the Great Lakes scientific community, which has an abysmally low submittal rate of proposals to NSF requesting UNOLS ships, to UNOLS and the academic fleet. This project mirrors the successful Chief Scientist training program that Dr. Claire Reimers at Oregon State University has run on ocean-going\r\nships such as the R/V Wecoma, New Horizon and Endeavor.\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe training cruise envisioned herein will allow early career scientists to collect seed data\r\nand test hypotheses for future proposals to NSF.\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThis proposal intends to educate the next generation of researchers about the capabilities\r\nof UNOLS. This type of outreach between UNOLS and potential users is not only important for\r\nthe broader scientific community, but doubly important for the Great Lakes community which\r\nseems resistant to using assets like the UNOLS fleet.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUsing funds provided by the National Science Foundation in grant OCE-1430015 \u00e6EAGER &ndash; Introducing Early Career Scientists to Research on the Great Lakes\u00c6, the University of Minnesota Duluth was able to stage multiple workshops and take two groups of early career researchers (graduate students, post doctorial researchers, and 1st and 2nd year faculty members) out on multiday cruises on the University\u00c6s research vessel, the Blue Heron.  These workshops and short cruises were undertaken to help counter two problems, one specific to the Great Lakes basin, and one impacting marine research in general.  In the Great Lakes basin, researchers often underestimate their vessel and equipment needs for work on the big lakes.  Since the Great Lakes can be quite dangerous in a small vessel this can endanger researchers.  For the broader marine research field, there is a concern that early career scientists are not receiving the training they need in how to acquire, plan for, and manage cruises aboard the research vessels found in the U.S. academic fleet (UNOLS-University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System).  With these workshop and cruises we not only gave some early career scientists the training they need to be successful Chief Scientists, but also exposed future Great Lakes researchers to researcher aboard a well-outfitted research vessel, the R/V Blue Heron.\n\n \n\nThe programs were very successful.  Post program assessments indicate that the participants felt the program was useful.
