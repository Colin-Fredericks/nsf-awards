 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing more, highly qualified mathematics and science teachers is a national priority. This Phase I, Track I Noyce Teacher Scholarship project, Acquiring Teaching Opportunities in Mathematics and Science (ATOMS), will recruit 24 juniors who are majoring in biology or mathematics who have not considered a career in teaching and will provide them with three-year scholarships to complete the requirements for a baccalaureate degree in their discipline and Ohio's Adolescent/Young Adult (AYA) Integrated Mathematics or Life Science licensure for grades 7-12. The program will also recruit and financially support eight individuals who have completed an undergraduate and/or graduate degree in mathematics, science, or a related field through a one-year rapid post-baccalaureate program to become AYA licensed in Integrated Mathematics or Life Science. The ATOMS program will bring together a strong team of faculty from biology, mathematics, and education, as well as leaders and teachers in high-needs partner schools, to prepare these ATOMS scholars with strong content knowledge; commitment to inquiry-based science; and an understanding of how to inspire, evaluate, and measure student learning. The ATOMS program will involve its scholars in early field experiences in high-needs schools, education internships at the collegiate level, workshop series focusing on integrating content and pedagogy and developing high-leverage practices, mentorship programs, and robust interactive communities of practice. Collectively, the ATOMS program will aim to generate knowledge on the benefits of coupling best practices with rigorous preparation for future teachers.",
