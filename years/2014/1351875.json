 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to test the hypothesis that the flexoelectric response can be enhanced by controlling the morphology, the size, and the substrate-induced buckling of inorganic nanomaterials including two-dimensional (2D) atomic layers. In contrast to piezoelectricity, which describes electrical polarization induced by uniform mechanical deformation, electrical polarization induced by strain gradients known as flexoelectricity has long been overlooked due to its relative weakness in bulk ceramics which will rupture before large strain gradients are achieved. Nanomaterials, on the other hand, can survive orders of magnitude higher strain gradient generated by microscale buckling and wrinkling. Recently, enhanced electromechanical coupling at nanoscale has been discovered and was hypothetically attributed to flexoelectricity without direct experimental evidence. The project will be carried by combining experiments with modeling and simulations in four research thrusts: i) flexoelectric response of barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanowires, nanoribbons and nanomembranes on deformable substrates, ii) electromechanical coupling in atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) supported by deformable substrates, iii) failure mechanisms and fracture mechanics of flexoelectric nanomaterials on deformable substrates, and iv) scaled flexoelectric response by nacre-inspired multilayer stacking. \r\n\r\nThis research will enable rationalized design, optimization and scaleup of sensors, actuators and energy harvesters based on the principle of flexoelectricity. A central goal of this program is to promote interdisciplinary research and teaching and to expose underrepresented groups to cutting edge interdisciplinary research. The PI will initiate a school-wide interdisciplinary course on \"Mechanics and Materials of Flexible and Stretchable Electronics\". The PI will provide interdisciplinary research opportunities specifically designed for undergraduate and high-school students from minority institutes through the connections established by the Engineering Research Center (ERC) - Nanomanufacturing Systems for Mobile Computing and Mobile Energy Technologies (NASCENT) and the Women in Engineering Program (WEP) at the University of Texas at Austin. The PI and the students will also prepare demos of wearable stretchable electronics and generators for lab open houses and for university-wide outreach activities. The PI plans to distribute both her research and education outcomes globally via publications, conferences, and online Journal Clubs and videos.",

Major activities carried out in the past five years under this grant include i) invention of a dry and freeform ?cut-and-paste? process for manufacturing patterned thin films (metallic, ceramic, polymeric, 2D materials) on deformable substrates (Fig. 1) [1-3]; ii) development of the theoretical and numerical framework for modeling flexible and stretchable piezoelectric membranes (Fig. 2) [4, 5]; iii) creating, observing and modeling buckled and curved 2D materials through buckle-delamination, nanobubbles and nanotents (Figs. 3-5) [6-8]; iv) experimental exploration for flexoelectricity of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) materials (Fig. 6) [9]. The education and outreach objectives of this CAREER development plan is to tightly integrate the research efforts and results with the graduate, undergraduate and K-12 education and to globally disseminate both the research and the education outcomes.&nbsp;Intellectual Merit: Intellectual merit can be summarized for each activity. (i) The ?cut-and-paste? process we invented is a subtractive digital fabrication process that is complementary to the popular printed electronics process for patterning non-printable membranes such as 2D materials and piezoelectric sheets. (ii) The theoretical and numerical framework established for flexible and stretchable piezoelectric membranes provides fundamental understanding for all kinds of piezoelectric materials which can be applied to guide the design of flexible and stretchable energy harvesters and sensors. (iii) Fundamental interface properties and strain-dependent physical behaviors of 2D materials have been successfully revealed as a result of the fundamental understandings of the mechanics of buckled, bubbled, and tented 2D materials. iv) The experimental evidence of out-of-plane electromechanical response of TMD materials opens the door for exploring flexoelectricity in 2D materials.Broader Impacts: The ?cut-and-paste? process and later the ?cut-solder-paste? process derived from it opened up the possibility of rapid prototyping of stretchable electronic devices such as hair thin, skin soft e-tattoo stickers for continuous wireless biometric sensing as well as continuous energy harvesting from human motion. The fundamental mechanistic and electromechanical understandings achieved for the piezoelectric and flexoelectric nanomembranes can guide the design and manufacture of next generation flexible and stretchable electromechanical devices. Four PhD students (one Hispanic) and more than five undergraduate research assistants (four from underrepresented group) have been engaged in this research. They have received numerous fellowships and recognitions as a result of their research. Nine journal articles, one Master?s and four PhD theses were published and 34 conference talks were delivered to disseminate the research outcomes globally. Wearable energy harvesters manufactured out of stretchable piezoelectric polymer using the ?cut-and-paste? method are demonstrated to more than 200 K-12 students during annual Lu Lab Open House on Explore UT Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Peer Reviewed Journal Publications:<br />1.<span> </span>Lu, N.S. and S.X.
