 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) at the University or Colorado will investigate the characteristics and external factors influencing young women's interest in and pursuit of computing during and after high school. Current research provides much evidence about what inhibits female participation in computing, but only piecemeal insights into why, and how, some women persist in the face of many challenges. NCWIT's Aspirations in Computing (AiC) program has attracted thousands of female applicants since 2007. The project team will conduct surveys, interviews and focus groups with AiC applicants. Analyses of the resulting dataset will enable the computing community to learn more about what circumstances encourage or hinder young women's pursuit of computing.\r\n\r\nNCWIT will analyze data from the AiC application portal and program to create a dataset on women's pathways in computing from high school to college and early career. This unique, large, national dataset will be built upon through surveys, interviews and focus groups. This project will use a quasi-experimental research design to conduct a longitudinal, mixed methods study to answer the following research questions: 1) What factors support young women's pursuit of computing, and how do these influence their interest, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, perceived social supports/barriers, and intent to persist in computing over time? 2) What challenges do young women encounter in the field of computing, and how do these influence their interest, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, perceived social supports/barriers, and intent to persist in computing over time? 3) What factors contribute to why, and how, some women pursuing computing activities, study or careers, persist despite many challenges to their inclusion in the field?",
