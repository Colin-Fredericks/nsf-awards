 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A Program (CSDM-A) and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program (CLP) of the Division of Chemistry support Professor Lauren Webb of the University of Texas at Austin in a project that will investigate new methods for attaching proteins to surfaces under conditions that allow the protein activity to be studied. These studies, which will allow construction of surfaces with functional proteins attached, will have applications in material science and biomedical engineering. This project, which combines biophysics, molecular biology with surface and materials chemistry, will provide multidisciplinary training to students, from undergraduates to post-doctorals, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nProf. Webb and her group are conducting a multi-pronged effort with the aim of developing surfaces that mimic stable and functional biological materials capable of both natural and artificial functions.  Specific experiments that are being conducted include: (1) the further work on the chemical functionalization of alkane thiol surfaces with peptides, with engineered secondary structure; (2) the binding of more complex protiens to the protein surfaces created in (1); (3) the use of surface functionalization developed in (1) to drive the formation of protein aggregates on the surface; (4) the use of protein-functionalized surfaces to bind functional forms of enzymes to the surface and to measure their activity.  Students working with Prof. Webb are obtaining significant experience in analytical, physical and biochemical methods.  This interdisciplinary training prepares them for work in the technical workforce.",

This project used a multidisciplinary approach for fabricating novel biomimetic materials at the so-called \"bio/abio interface\" in a comprehensive experimental and theoretical approach.  Our project goals were enabled by a surface chemical functionalization strategy previously demonstrated in our laboratory, shown in Figure 1.  In this strategy, mixed monolayers of alkane thiols, some terminated in a reactive azide (N3) group, form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on a flat gold surface.  The azide groups are then exposed to peptides containing multiple triple bonds, and under appropriate conditions, react through a Huisgen cycloaddition (\"click chemistry\") to chemically bond the peptide to the surface in multiple locations.\n\nThere are four major results from this work.\n\n1) We have expanded the complexity of our surfaces by adding chemical diversity to all aspects of our substrate and surface-bound biomolecule. This expands the capability of this surface chemistry for a variety of applications, both in our laboratory and for other researchers.\n\n2) We have demonstrated the controlled nucleation and growth of functional peptide-based fibrils on functionalized gold surfaces.

This is vital information for the large community of researchers who use SAMs in their experiments. \n\nAt all points, we have sought to characterize our surfaces in significant detail in order to reliably replicate and modify previous successes, often a weakness in studies of surface-bound peptides and proteins.  This work has resulted in four publications, one additional manuscript in preparation, and we anticipate at least one further publication acknowledging this NSF support.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The primary goal of the Broader Impacts of this project was to develop, administer, analyze, and report the results of a comprehensive, longitudinal survey of the quality of life of graduate students in the Department of Chemistry at UT-Austin.
