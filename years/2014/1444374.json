The symposium will foster advances in the leading research on various types of Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. There will be invited talks and contributed presentations. The Symposium encourages graduate student participation and provides them with the opportunity to gain exposure to new wide bandgap power semiconductor technologies. Topics to be addressed include materials and fabrication technology, power semiconductor switching devices, power packaging and thermal management, reliability engineering and device, circuit modeling. The Symposium will promote interactions between leading researchers in power device technologies and will focus on the technical challenges of these materials and their applications. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through the Electrochemical Society's Proceedings.",
