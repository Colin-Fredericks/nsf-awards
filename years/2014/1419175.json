This would be the 15th time that this biennial program is organized by the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR). \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nThe CTR summer school program is an immersive, hands-on meeting that focuses on developing of new models and testing hypotheses proposed by the participants, utilizing large turbulent flow databases. The meeting covers many important areas of turbulent flow research, such as instabilities and transition, large eddy simulation, Reynolds averaged modeling, multiphase turbulent flows, combustion, and turbulent transport of mass and heat. New calculations to generate new databases are often performed during the Summer Program. The participants, who are competitively selected based on proposals for research, are divided into focus groups based on their proposals.  The meeting will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics from around the world, who will be discussing future directions of research and research challenges in these research areas. The meeting will also address modeling challenges involved in advancing the field for the next two to five years.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe CTR Summer Programs involve participants from inside and outside of Stanford, who join NASA scientists for over 20 days of intense study. The previous workshop, in 2012, involved 93 participants from 14 countries, including participants from 10 U.S. universities and national laboratories. The program affords opportunity for an intense collaborative effort by about fifty advanced graduate students, their advisors, research scientists, and engineers from industry and National Laboratories. The experience gained from this event will have a positive impact in training scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nOne of the main goals of the conference is to frame the challenges in turbulence modeling for the next few years. The findings of the program will be collected and published as a comprehensive technical report. It is expected that the report will consist of forty to fifty technical papers (about 500 pages), which will be delivered to NSF and to other sponsors of the program, in addition to worldwide dissemination at the end of the calendar year. The report, like the reports from the prior workshops, will be available on the worldwide web for downloads, (http://www.stanford.edu/group/ctr/). Many of the papers in the report will be eventually published in high quality technical journals.",
