Support will also be provided to enable the participation of underrepresented minorities and women, to ensure the discussions will represent important and emerging areas throughout the CPS and energy research communities. The intellectual merit of the proposal is due to the important nature of the workshop -- to define a research agenda for cyber-physical systems in the context of energy. The broader impact is due to the pervasive nature of energy in CPS, and the generation of a long-range research agenda as well as the formulation of new collaborative teams pursuing efforts in this space.",
