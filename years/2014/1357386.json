 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview:\r\nBiological introductions, defined as the establishment of species in geographic regions outside the reach of their natural dispersal mechanisms, have dramatically increased in frequency during the 20th century and are now altering community structure and ecosystem function of virtually all marine habitats. To date, studies on marine invasions focus principally on demographic and ecological processes, and the importance of evolutionary processes has been rarely tested. This knowledge gap has implications for management policies, which attempt to prevent biological introductions and mitigate their impacts. The Asian seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has been introduced to every continental margin in the Northern Hemisphere, and preliminary data indicate that non-native populations are both more resistant to heat stress and resistant to snail herbivory. The project will integrate population genetics, field survey and common-garden laboratory experiments to comprehensively address the role of rapid evolutionary adaptation in the invasion success of this seaweed. Specifically, the PIs will answer the following.  What is the consequence of introductions on seaweed demography and mating systems? How many successful introductions have occurred in North America and Europe? Where did introduced propagules originate? Do native, native-source and non-native locations differ in environmental conditions? Do native, native-source and non-native populations differ in phenotype?\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is based on three gaps in the literature. First, while biological invasions are widely recognized as a major component of global change, there are surprisingly few studies that compare native and non-native populations in their biology or ecology.  Native and non-native populations will be surveyed in a similar manner, allowing assessment of differences in population dynamics, mating system, epifaunal and epiphytic communities, and the surrounding abiotic and biotic environment. Second, G. vermiculophylla exhibits a life cycle typical of other invasive species (including some benthic invertebrates), yet we still lack data on the effects of decoupling the haploid and diploid stages on genetic structure, and in turn, on the evolvability of their populations. Finally, this project will provide unequivocal evidence of an adaptive shift in a marine invasive. To our knowledge, such evolutionary change has been described previously for only a complex of marine copepod species.  G. vermiculophylla will serve as a model for understanding evolution in other nuisance invasions, and perhaps lead to novel methods to counter future invasions or their spread.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThere are several broader impacts afforded by this project. The postdoctoral researcher will receive extensive training in population and ecological genetics, develop skills necessary to further development as an independent researcher, and develop career-enhancing interpersonal skills by leading the field trips and mentoring undergraduates. At least four undergraduates will be recruited, all of whom will generate data and will be encouraged to pursue independent projects. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and be presented at national and international meetings of both applied and basic scientists, during lectures and seminars at our home universities and at other universities. Finally, a co-PI has successfully implemented after-school hands on plant-ecology programs at the urban public library in their after-school programming for K-5 students (http://www.cclpl.org) with undergraduate research apprentices and collaboration with undergraduate senior education majors. Offerings will be expanded in this after-school program by developing hands on quantitative inquiry based modules on marine invasive species, marine algae and other topics. Undergraduate students on this project will have the opportunity to interact with undergraduate students in other ongoing projects in our group (see http://arabidopsisunpak.org). Thus research students across different areas of ecological-genetics will have the opportunity to share experiences and expertise.",

To date, studies on marine invasions focus principally on demographic and ecological processes, and the importance of evolutionary processes has been rarely tested. This knowledge gap has implications for management policies, which attempt to prevent biological introductions and mitigate their impacts. This grant uses an invasive seaweed (Gracilaria vermiculophylla) as a model system to illustrate how combining multiple tools (population genetics, high-throughput phenotyping assays, and niche models) can help to assess the importance of phenotypic evolution in facilitating marine invasions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gracilaria vermiculophylla is native to China, Korea, Russia and Japan, and has been introduced to every continental margin in the Northern Hemisphere. Using population genetics, we found that &gt;95% of introduced thalli have a genetic signature similar to thalli of the Pacific coastline of northeastern Japan, strongly indicating this region served as the principal source of the introductions to North America and Europe. Notably, northeastern Japan exported the vast majority of the aquacultured oyster <em>Crossostrea gigas</em> during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and both <em>G. vermiculophylla </em>and oysters thrive within shallow, soft-bottom and estuarine habitats. Thus, the preponderance of evidence suggests that <em>G. vermiculophylla </em>was inadvertently introduced with <em>C. gigas </em>shipments, and moreover, that northeastern Japan is a common source region for a several estuarine invaders in or near oyster beds (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>We also demonstrated a shift in mating system during the invasion. Native populations in the northwest Pacific Ocean were nearly always attached by holdfasts to hard substrata and, as is characteristic of the genus, haploid-diploid ratios were slightly diploid-biased. In contrast, along North American and European coastlines, introduced populations nearly always floated atop soft-sediment mudflats and were overwhelmingly dominated by diploid thalli without holdfasts. Introduced populations exhibited population genetic signals consistent with extensive vegetative fragmentation, while native populations did not. Thus, the ecological shift from attached to unattached thalli, ostensibly necessitated by the invasion of soft-sediment habitats, correlated with shifts from sexual to asexual reproduction and slight to strong diploid bias (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Finally, we found that introduced populations have greater survivorship under extreme heat, cold and low-salinity stresses relative to Japanese source populations. The invasion of <em>G. vermiculophylla </em>was also accompanied by local adaptation within eastern North America, as populations from warmer, lower-latitude estuaries had greater heat tolerance than did populations from colder, higher-latitude estuaries. This cline recapitulates a parallel decline in native Japan and was generated at a remarkable rate, given that the introduction occurred within the last 20 years. We conclude that rapid evolution plays an important role in facilitating the invasion success of this and likely other marine species and reinforces the threat that introductions represent to nearshore ecosystems (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>This grant facilitated the training of 2 high school students, 6 undergraduates, 3 MS students and a postdoctoral associate. Three of these students (2 undergraduates and 1 MS students) are now enrolled in PhD programs, and the postdoc is now an Assistant Professor. The grant also facilitated a citizen-science program in close collaboration with a local non-profit educational center.&nbsp;A custom-built curricula for K-8 students in Charleston County elementary schools. Entitled &ldquo;Lowcountry Algal Monitoring Program for Students&rdquo; (or LAMPS) centers on statistics and marine ecology using &ldquo;Case Studies&rdquo; that are based on real data the students collect. Each month, we take pictures of long-term quadrats on a Charleston Harbor mudflat, and the students use a point-intercept method to assess percent cover of the invasive seaweed. Since Spring 2015, at least 3990 K-12 children have helped to generate data, and we&rsquo;ve helped train 340 teachers from across South Carolina.
