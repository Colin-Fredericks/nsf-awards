 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  \r\n\r\nThe 2014-2019 Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP) program under the leadership of the University of Puerto Rico, includes three new members in the alliance from the private higher education sector in Puerto Rico to recruit STEM students in 2-year programs and promote their transfer to 4-year programs and advanced degrees in STEM fields. The alliance is comprised of: (1) the University of Puerto Rico System: two graduate campuses - R\u00edo Piedras and Mayaguez and six 4-year campuses - Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamon, Cayey, Humacao, and Ponce; (2) the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico; and (3) the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System - the Universidad Metropolitana, Universidad del Este, and Universidad del Turabo. The three new partner campuses of the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez System offer ten 2-year degrees in a variety of STEM disciplines. In addition, during the project duration, PR-LSAMP increases its scope to include the ten 2-year programs offered at University of Puerto Rico institutions - Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamon, and Humacao. \r\n\r\nPR-LSAMP impacts a large cadre of underrepresented college students in 2-year programs by expanding their opportunities to engage in undergraduate research and continue studies in 4-year and graduate institutions. The students' world view of science is broadened through research experiences at international and national research centers. It is anticipated that the efforts of PR-LSAMP  improves families' opinion of STEM careers and increase the number of underrepresented students that choose STEM careers, thus contributing to a diverse STEM workforce. The long-term impact will be significant as PR-LSAMP contributes at least 20% of undergraduate Hispanics. \r\n\r\nStudents and faculty in the 2-year programs participate in PR-LSAMP activities that will be modified to promote student completion of 4-year STEM degrees through mentored undergraduate research and faculty development through research projects and Learning Science Education Groups. The long-term goal of PR-LSAMP is to build a highly competitive STEM education and research enterprise and to assist in meeting the national need for a diverse STEM workforce. To reach this goal, the objectives of PR-LSAMP are to: 1) promote the efforts of students from 2-year programs, with particular emphasis on underrepresented college students, to continue and complete their BS degree in a 4-year institution; 2) increase the high rate of BS degrees conferred in STEM fields from PR-LSAMP institutions; 3) increase the number of students who enter a graduate degree program in STEM fields; 4) increase the number of students who complete a PhD program in a STEM field; 5) maintain and enhance the direct student support strategies, such as undergraduate research experiences and mentoring; 6) promote mentoring activities and institutionalize the exchange of successful teaching and learning strategies through PR-LSAMP STEM faculty collaboration; 7) promote faculty scholarly studies and improved STEM education through and Learning Science Education Groups; and 8) meet with high school counselors and send brochures to families to inform them about academic preparation and career opportunities in STEM. \r\n\r\nPR-LSAMP provides a model for a seamless pipeline to increase the number of underrepresented groups that complete a PhD in STEM fields. It documents and disseminates the effectiveness of the replicable undergraduate research mentoring strategy to increase the number of underrepresented students that continue on to graduate studies and contribute to the diversity of the nation's STEM workforce. Furthermore, it disseminates and applies concepts of Learning Science to improve learning and teaching in STEM disciplines in a transformative manner.\r\n\r\nOver the five-year grant period, PR-LSAMP will reach almost 30 thousand underrepresented STEM students to promote its goals.",
