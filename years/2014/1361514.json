It would also include international cooperation through collaboration with the microsensor laboratory group at the Max Plank Institute for Marine Microbiology and combined with the expertise and EC instrumentation from the University of Virginia, would enable the collaboration between three of the very few research groups presently engaged in aquatic EC research.",
