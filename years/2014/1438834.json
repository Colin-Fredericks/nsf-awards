Florida Memorial University will implement a Targeted Infusion Project entitled: Physics Laboratory Technology Infrastructure Enhancement and Summer Undergraduate Research.  This project involves the development of pedagogical methodologies for providing instruction in physics. The aim is to engage students in an interactive learning process using digital media to stimulate learning and comprehension. This project will aid in the recruitment, retention, and preparation for graduate school and the workforce of physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics majors at the university.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, the teaching and learning process moves from the traditional method of instruction to a blended method of computer-based, web and internet assisted instruction.  Specific objectives include: upgrading the physics laboratory; establishing a faculty and student led learning community via supplemental instruction; providing tutoring sessions in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics; and providing intensive problem solving sessions for Algebra, Pre-calculus, Trigonometry, Chemistry and Physics courses. Summer research experiences will enable undergraduate students to develop critical thinking skills and work with a mentor.",

Drs. Huisso (PI), Tamalis (Co-PI), Stiffin (Co-PI) and Sherman (Co-PI) have served as mentors,&nbsp; and have organized a follow-up research program activities during each academic year by preparing and nurturing the students for the Florida Memorial University Annual Research Experiential Learning and Performing Arts Day (RELPAD), and for the regional research conferences and meetings. The students have successfully presented their preliminary and final research results at the FMU RELPAD, and some of the student abstracts have been accepted for the \"2017 Emerging&nbsp;Researchers National&rdquo; (ERN) Conference in STEM in Washington DC (3/2-3/3/ 2017), and for the Life Sciences of South Florida Symposium (April 8, 2017) where they have successfully presented their findings. The students were able to familiarize with STEM related research activities such as literature search, designing of experiments, the operation of laboratory equipment, the use of proper controls, analysis of data, and scientific writing; they helped disseminate and educate the student body at Florida Memorial University about their research results. Through the research experience and seminar activities, we were able to place, during the grant&nbsp; three year period, more than 25 students into summer research internships of various institutions. The grant program evaluation [3] showed that. the students&rsquo; participation in research cemented in them an unwavering desire[4] to pursue advanced degrees&nbsp; in STEM areas.The student research presentation pictures are attached.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>c. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Divisional </span></strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Research Seminars</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>As a part of the grant activities, we have organized many Seminar Series to inform and expose our students to research activities of faculty members from FIU and other Research Institutions. We would like to thank Dr. Moon (FIU) for his sincere collaboration, and all the guest speakers for their excellent presentations; they have truly and greatly impressed, engaged and motivated our students in their research and internship activities. The students gained [4] an important appreciation and interest for the research seminars as a method of seeking internships. Through these research seminars, and with the help of our guest speakers, more than 25 students have been placed into summer&nbsp; research internships of various institutions during the grant period (2014-2017).&nbsp; The seminar&nbsp; presentation pictures of Dr. Hutcheson, one of our many guest speakers from FIU, are attached.</p>\n<p><strong>d. </strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Student Tutoring and Supplemental Instruction</span></strong></p>\n<p>We have provided peer-to-peer tutors and mentors, faculty advisors and research facilitators to increase retention, progression and graduation rates in the STEM fields.<strong> </strong>Under the grant, four students in pre-engineering and chemistry programs with a strong background in calculus, multivariable, differential equation, physics and chemistry have been recruited for&nbsp; tutoring activities. They have helped the students with their homework assignments, class projects and laboratory reports. They have provided&nbsp;them with an important academic support [4] of intensive problem solving skills. Faculty&nbsp; have&nbsp;an &ldquo;open door\" policy for their office hours often used for a supplemental instruction.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp; 1.

The students have successfully presented their preliminary and final research results at the FMU RELPAD, and some of the student abstracts have been accepted for the \"2017 Emerging Researchers National\" (ERN) Conference in STEM in Washington DC (3/2-3/3/ 2017), and for the Life Sciences of South Florida Symposium (April 8, 2017) where they have successfully presented their findings. The students were able to familiarize with STEM related research activities such as literature search, designing of experiments, the operation of laboratory equipment, the use of proper controls, analysis of data, and scientific writing; they helped disseminate and educate the student body at Florida Memorial University about their research results. Through the research experience and seminar activities, we were able to place, during the grant  three year period, more than 25 students into summer research internships of various institutions. The grant program evaluation [3] showed that. the students? participation in research cemented in them an unwavering desire[4] to pursue advanced degrees  in STEM areas.The student research presentation pictures are attached.\n\n c. Divisional Research Seminars \n\nAs a part of the grant activities, we have organized many Seminar Series to inform and expose our students to research activities of faculty members from FIU and other Research Institutions. We would like to thank Dr. Moon (FIU) for his sincere collaboration, and all the guest speakers for their excellent presentations; they have truly and greatly impressed, engaged and motivated our students in their research and internship activities. The students gained [4] an important appreciation and interest for the research seminars as a method of seeking internships. Through these research seminars, and with the help of our guest speakers, more than 25 students have been placed into summer  research internships of various institutions during the grant period (2014-2017).  The seminar  presentation pictures of Dr. Hutcheson, one of our many guest speakers from FIU, are attached.\n\nd. Student Tutoring and Supplemental Instruction\n\nWe have provided peer-to-peer tutors and mentors, faculty advisors and research facilitators to increase retention, progression and graduation rates in the STEM fields. Under the grant, four students in pre-engineering and chemistry programs with a strong background in calculus, multivariable, differential equation, physics and chemistry have been recruited for  tutoring activities. They have helped the students with their homework assignments, class projects and laboratory reports. They have provided them with an important academic support [4] of intensive problem solving skills. Faculty  have an \"open door\" policy for their office hours often used for a supplemental instruction.\n\nReferences\n\n  1. Pasco 850 Comprehensive Physics System (www.pasco.com)\n\n  2.
