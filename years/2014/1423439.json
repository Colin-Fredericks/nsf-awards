 "awd_abstract_narration": "As new institutions are created in a global world, practices concerning inclusion by gender can continue as they have been or they can be transformed by having newly been created in a different context from instituions with established practices.  In particular, the globalization of practices concerning inclusion by gender in emergent transnational firms seem to have different outcomes than might have been expected by analyzing business practices as solely domestic.  This project will analyze practices of inclusion in a large globalizing national state, hypothesizing that global norms override dominant local practices of exclusion. Using in-depth interviews and new survey data with past and present professionals in different organizational sites, this research explores comparative frameworks to explain institutional emergence and egalitarian advantage in new professional spaces. This project is empirically significant because of the dissonance between inegalitarian norms and what may be emergent egalitarian practices.    Investigating these organizations and women who have avoided otherwise persistent gender-priming obstacles is theoretically significant because it speaks to three important conversations on organizational innovation, gender stratification and the influence of globalization in emerging markets.  The question of equity of practices in employment is important to public policy.\r\n\r\nNew contexts such as transnational firms provide and opportunity to test neo-institutional theorizing concerning globalization, organizational emergence, and loose coupling between organizational norms and practices.",
