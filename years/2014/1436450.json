 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Philip K. Demokritou\r\nProposal Number: CBET - 1436450\r\n \r\n\r\nNano-sized materials have enabled an increasing number of new materials to be produced. These manufactured products are called Nano-Enabled Products (NEPs). Because of the extremely small sizes of the nano-material components, there are additional physical, chemical, and physiological hazards not attributed to their bulk counterparts. The proliferation of NEPs thus poses potential environmental health and safety (EHS) risks during their life cycle, including their disposal at the end of their life-cycle. Specifically, NEPs decompose and release nano-materials under elevated temperatures when they are incinerated for their final disposal or under incidental fires. The proposed study is to generate a data base and to provide knowledge on the fundamentals of how such thermal decomposition takes place. With this knowledge it should be possible to design safer NEPs. That is, the \"safer-by-design\" capability will help to remove risk-uncertainties of NEPs and contribute to the sustainability of the nano-technology industry. Besides contributions to industry, the proposed study will involve students in research and train K-12 teachers and students in Boston area public schools and the Edward M. Kennedy Academy of Health Careers. \r\n\r\nThermal decomposition of NEPs, either in incineration facilities or in incidental fires, may release nano-scale materials used in their synthesis and produce air and soil hazards and potential threats and risks to the environmental and human health. There is a major knowledge gap on the fundamentals of thermal decomposition of widely used families of NEPs, potential nano-release mechanisms, and characteristics of byproducts and potential nano-EHS implications. In order to fill this large knowledge gap, a new methodological approach, using both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, is proposed to the current nano-risk assessment paradigm to address EHS implications of NEPs during incineration: 1) Develop \"best practice\" methods suitable for the generation, physico-chemical and toxicological characterization of realistic exposures associated with thermal decomposition of NEPs; 2) Demonstrate the reproducibility of these methods and build our knowledge on factors influencing nano-release for representative classes of NEPs currently in the market; and 3) Utilize the developed methods and knowledge to generate \"safer by design\" NEPs and exposure control strategies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     The widespread use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in consumer products inevitably raises concern for potential exposure to ENMs released from such nano-enabled products (NEPs). It is therefore important to understand the scenarios and mechanisms by which ENMs\nare released over the lifecycle of a NEP causing exposure and potential environmental health and safety (EHS) implications.\n\n     In this project, we focused on understanding the fundamentals related to the incineration/thermal decomposition of industrially relevant NEPs, such as thermoplastics and coatings, widely used in many applications. The potential release of ENMs (used as nanofillers in NEPs) into the environment and the physicochemical, morphological (PCM) and toxicological properties of the released byproducts (released aerosol, residual ash and off-gases) were assessed. The roles of NEP matrix composition, nanofiller type/size/mass-loading and thermal process conditions on the thermal decomposition behavior, release dynamics and byproduct PCM properties were investigated in detail. The potential cellular toxicological implications of the released aerosol were assessed and linked to PCM properties of the NEPs.\n\n     Key findings suggest that inorganic (and catalytic) metal oxide nanofillers such as TiO2, Fe2O3 and CuO are more likely to be released into the aerosol compared to carbonaceous nanofillers (e.g., CNTs (carbon nanotubes)) and inert metalloid oxide nanofillers (e.g., SiO2). Moreover, majority of inorganic nanofillers are retained loosely in the residual ash as flaky clusters, prompting the concern for their subsequent release into the environment (due to\nweathering, leaching, etc.), whereas CNTs are completely combusted at the high incineration temperatures (&gt;800 &deg;C). More importantly, in the case of released catalytic metal oxide nanofillers, due to their synergistic interactions with gaseous semi-volatile organic byproducts, carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) could be formed and thus present a significant inhalation exposure hazard for incineration facility operators, firefighters and surrounding communities. Furthermore, increased bioactivity and toxicity of the released aerosol compared to the control (no nanofiller) are also confirmed in cellular studies.\n\n     Findings highlight significant EHS implications from end-of-life processes such as incineration/thermal decomposition in the case of NEPs discarded as waste or destroyed in fires. The data generated from the study reflect real-life exposure scenarios for those in the incineration occupational environment, firefighters and those residing in proximity to a commercial incineration facility. This study will be a significant contribution to lifecycle-based nanotechnology risk and safety assessments, and will provide a solid framework to risk assessors and public health regulators to manage the nano-waste risk. In addition, the study will also prompt innovation in the material science domain, both at academic and industry levels, to produce novel safer-by-design NEP formulations that would reduce probability of nanomaterial release over the product lifecycle.\n\n     Future studies should investigate effects of sequential lifecycle stresses such as environmental weathering (e.g., sunlight/rain) on thermal decomposition of NEPs. Additionally, environmental fate and transport of ENMs from residual ash should be performed to assess potential environmental health risks and develop mitigation strategies associated with incineration/thermal decomposition of NEPs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip K Demokritou"
