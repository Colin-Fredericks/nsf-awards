The meeting starts with a Friday afternoon lecture and then there are seven to nine presentations on Saturday and Sunday by well-known active geometers primarily from the Midwestern region.\r\n\r\nThe Bloomington Geometry Workshop aims to promote scientific cooperation between geometers in Indiana and its neighboring states. Graduate student participation has continued to increase, and the organizers encourage this by asking speakers to make at least a portion of their talk accessible to graduate students. The Workshop organizers also invite at least one graduate student speaker and solicit graduate student participation from individual departments, especially from among under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nMore information about the workshop can be found on the website \r\n\r\nhttp://www.math.indiana.edu/bgw/",
