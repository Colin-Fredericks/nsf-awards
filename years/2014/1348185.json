 "awd_abstract_narration": "ICDP is an internationally managed and operated Earth Science research program. It addresses\r\nfundamental geoscientific problems of global significance and is undertaken by international\r\nteams of scientists at carefully selected sites around the world. ICDP serves the entire Earth\r\nScience community and is peer-reviewed.\r\n\r\nSignificant progress has been made in recent years in the conceptual understanding of the\r\nhighly complex 'System Earth' with its numerous subsystems. As a result, it has become clear\r\nthat scientific drilling is an indispensible tool in our understanding of Earth processes\r\nand properties. Drilling provides the only means of obtaining direct information on processes\r\noperating at depth. It allows for determination of in situ-properties of solid materials and\r\nfluids and permits testing of hypotheses and models derived from surface observations, remote\r\nsensing data and laboratory experiments. In addition, drill holes may be used as a natural laboratory for experiments and as an observatory for long term monitoring of ongoing active processes. Earth drilling, therefore, plays a critical\r\nrole both in scientific research directed towards improved understanding of the workings of our planet and in solving urgent societal problems.\r\n\r\nICDP support is based on the 'comingled funding' principle and international costsharing.  Each drilling project is independently organized in the form of a Joint Research Venture(JRV)between the ICDP and the Principle Investigator(s).  This award provides continued support for the U.S. participation in ICDP.",
