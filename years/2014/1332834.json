 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: Over the last decade, a growing international research effort has focused attention on the physical state of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), including its climatically-vital transports of heat, mass and tracers, and the causes and consequences of its variability. Begun in 2004, the Line W program - moored and shipboard measurements of the equatorward-flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) and poleward-flowing Gulf Stream along an altimeter track between New England and Bermuda has acquired a remarkable 10-year time series of this component of the AMOC. The goals of this project are to conduct a final Line W cruise to recover the current meter array presently in the water and reoccupy the hydrographic section, to process the recovered sensor data to final form and refurbish the sea-going equipment, and to complete the scientific analysis of the Line W data set in conjunction with fellow AMOC investigators.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Property and transport time series generated by several AMOC programs are now approaching or exceeding a decade in length and are starting to provide truly unprecedented views of the AMOC's structure, strength and variability. Synthesizing these results and combining them with state estimate models will undoubtedly result in improved understanding of the mechanics, dynamics and impacts of AMOC variability. Key foci of this project?s analysis effort include careful quantification of the local variability at Line W, estimating variations in net (coast-to-coast) meridional transport of selected water masses by combining Line W observations with interior-ocean data and via models, and investigating the meridional coherence of water property anomalies and AMOC fluctuations by comparing Line-W observations with water property observations and AMOC estimates at other latitudes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A graduate student in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program will be funded to complete her Ph.D. thesis that will be based on Line W. As in past years, several students and/or postdocs will be involved in the final Line W cruise to gain hands-on experience with hydrographic sampling procedures and physical oceanographic mooring work. In this analysis and synthesis project, the original Line W investigators are entraining a new junior scientist into the research effort. This will introduce the investigator to new observational practices and associated data reduction and analysis procedures while bringing new expertise and viewpoints to the study. It is absolutely critical to observational physical oceanography that young investigators become fully versed in modern observational methods. The project's investigators will additionally continue to showcase Line W in public outreach events as a demonstration of ocean science and climate variation studies. Beyond these human elements, the Line W program is continuing to serve as a testbed for several emerging ocean measurement technologies and associated data processing procedures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe global meridional overturning circulation of the ocean is a critical component of the earth?s climate system.  Surface water warmed by insolation at low latitudes flows to high latitudes where it becomes denser in winter by cooling and the injection of salt to surrounding water when sea ice forms.  This dense water sinks and flows back towards low latitudes and crosses the equator entering the opposite hemisphere, slowly upwelling into the surface ocean as it spreads.  The densest water that fills the oceans below about 1500 m forms at only a few locations: the northernmost North Atlantic Ocean and several locations around Antarctica. Line W focused on investigating the North Atlantic component of the global meridional overturning circulation.  Water properties, including temperature, salinity, oxygen, and the anthropogenic tracers: CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, (chlorofluorocarbons-11, -12, -113), SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) and I-129 (iodine-129), were measured on research cruises along a line extending from the continental shelf south of Cape Cod to Bermuda (Fig 1).  This line crosses the Gulf Stream, a major pathway for the transport of warm water from low latitudes northward to high latitudes, and the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), which transports cold dense water that has sunk from the surface in the northern North Atlantic and flows southward. Cruises were conducted 1 - 2 times per year to measure water properties for a 10-year period, providing information on the decadal mean water mass structure and strength of the overturning circulation.\n\n \n\nCFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and SF6 are manmade gases that have been used extensively in industrial processes since the mid-20th century and have entered the atmosphere and surface ocean.  The atmospheric concentrations have been carefully monitored and are well known functions of time (Fig 2b).  The concentration in the surface ocean can be calculated from the atmospheric record.  When surface water sinks, it carries CFCs and SF6 with it and concentrations in subsurface water can be compared to the atmospheric concentration record to estimate the time since the water sank.  I-129 is produced by nuclear fission and is released when nuclear fuels are reprocessed.  Nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in Sellafield, England and La Hague, France, release I-129 laden effluent into the North Sea, which becomes incorporated in the North Atlantic Current and enters the Norwegian and Greenland seas and the Artic Ocean (Fig 2a).  This water circulates through these seas becoming denser and then flows southward across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge into the deep North Atlantic.  The concentration history of I-129 in the overflow waters has been determined from measurements and the release history from the reprocessing plants (Fig 2c) and can be used in a similar manner to CFCs to estimate deep water ages. \n\n \n\nA similar program to Line W was carried out along Line AR7W extending across the Labrador Sea (Fig 1) by Canadian scientists.  This line sampled the deep flow upstream of Line W and the CFC-11 and I-129 measurements along this line were used as a boundary condition for a numerical model calculation of the flow between there and Line W.  The transit time for the DWBC was calculated to be 5.5 years.  In 2010 Line W was extended southwest of Bermuda and revealed an interior branch of deep-water flow.  The model applied to these data yielded a transit time of 9 years indicating a slower spreading rate by this pathway.\n\n \n\nThe water mass properties and anthropogenic tracers were also used to determine the surface source regions for deep water and the fraction of water from each region, along the GA03 section (which includes Line W) extending southeastward across the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean and northward along the African coast (Fig 3).  The source water locations and the percent of water from each region that comprise the water between 1000 m and the bottom along the section are displayed in Figure 3.  The composition of deep water along Line W is very similar to the average composition for the entire GA03 section, although Line W has a slightly higher percent of water from the North Atlantic.  The two primary sources are inflow of dense water from the Arctic Ocean/Norwegian Sea/Greenland Sea (Fig. 2a), and the Labrador Sea where convection can reach depths of 2000 m during winter.  This accounts for about 55% for the dense water. The Mediterranean Sea is an important source providing about 14% of the water.  High salinity dense water forms there due to extensive evaporation and it overflows a shallow sill, sinking to deeper depths in the Atlantic.  Dense water formed around Antarctica flows northward and crosses the equator spreading to the subpolar regions of the North Atlantic where is mixes with the northern source waters and provides about 25% of the deep water along the section.  North Atlantic subpolar and subtropical surface water also provide a small fraction of the water.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William M Smethie Jr."
