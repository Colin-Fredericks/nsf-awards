 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SOLVER (Sustainability for our Lives, Values, Environment, and Resources) project is offering two year scholarships to 26 academically talented, financially needy transfer or rising junior students majoring in biology, geology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, engineering, or computer science. The overall objective of the program is to increase the quality and diversity of students graduating with baccalaureate degrees in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, with an emphasis on recruitment, retention, and graduation of Hispanic and Native American students. The program is providing scholars with financial, academic, personal, and professional support. It is using six interrelated practices that have been shown to increase both student persistence and achievement on essential learning outcomes for STEM professionals: a learning community organized around the issue of sustainability, common intellectual experiences among scholars, diversity learning, undergraduate research opportunities, academic service learning, and internships. These practices are being coupled with strong student support, including targeted recruiting and application assistance, community and family involvement, individualized academic counseling, faculty and peer mentoring, tutoring, career development, and leadership training.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThis program is based on educational practices that have been shown to be exceptionally effective in promoting retention, academic excellence, and career preparation in STEM students. Based on published STEM education research, these represent best practices for all students, but are particularly powerful for underrepresented minorities. Quantitative and qualitative data on SOLVER scholars and a control group of STEM students are being gathered to assess the impact of each practice. In addition, all scholars have the opportunity to contribute to the STEM knowledge base through independent research projects.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe SOLVER program is designed to increase the number and diversity of STEM majors by instituting practices that target Hispanic and Native American students. SOLVER scholar projects, involving academic service learning, research, or internships, are designed to have direct, positive impacts on local communities. The program is strengthening the ties between the university and the local Hispanic and Native American communities; training faculty mentors in cultural responsiveness and student support services; and making the university community generally more inclusive and aware of regional diversity through campus wide events. All of these activities build the capacity of the university to increase the number and diversity of STEM graduates into the future.",
