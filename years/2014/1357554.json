 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mail surveys are becoming more popular among survey researchers because they can achieve better coverage and response rates at a lower cost than can be achieved with telephone surveys.  However, there are still challenges when using mail surveys.  This research project will examine a common design challenge that has received only minimal research attention: how to get respondents to correctly navigate skip patterns without computer or interviewer assistance.  The study will advance the visual design literature within survey methodology from its previous focus on individual items to a new focus on how visual design can be used across questions.  As such, it has the potential to broaden our understanding of how visual design can be used to design good questionnaires, not just good questions.  Researchers from multiple disciplines and across all survey sectors will be able to utilize findings from this research in their own surveys to minimize skip errors, thereby reducing missing data and increasing statistical power.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.\r\n\r\nFailing to correctly navigate skip patterns in mail surveys without computer or interviewer assistance often results in missing data.  Recently, survey methodology has incorporated knowledge from the vision sciences and cognitive psychology into understanding how visual design can be used strategically in questionnaire design.  This study uses an experimental design to examine the effect of visual design features that create stronger grouping and subgrouping among items within skip patterns on skip errors in a mail survey.  The survey will be administered to a sample of Nebraska residents drawn from the Computerized Delivery Sequence File.  Specifically, this study will examine how grouping questions through enclosure or common region and indentation affects the rate of skip errors.  There will be four forms sent out.  The control form will have all of the questions located in the same continuous region (as established by a common shaded background) and all questions started at the left margin.  The second form has the same continuous region but all follow-up items will be indented.  The third form will have all questions start at the left margin, but the follow-up items will be in a separate background region from the initial feeder question.  Finally, the fourth form will examine the combined effects of grouping through the use of both enclosure and indentation.  Rates of skip errors for each objective will be examined across respondent characteristics (i.e., age, education, literacy) and question types (i.e., number of response options, number of follow-up questions).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research project was to examine the effects of visual grouping cues in skip patterns in mail surveys.  In surveys, there are certain questions that do not apply to all respondents.  In interviewer or computer administered surveys, the interviewer or computer can make sure respondents are only asked questions that apply to them, skipping those that do not apply.  However, in mail surveys, researchers must use written instructions to jump respondents over the questions that do not apply to them.  Respondents often have difficulty carrying out these written instructions and navigating skip patterns correctly, resulting in errors that diminish data quality.  This research examined different ways visual design elements in the survey could be used to help the respondent navigate skip patterns in mail surveys and avoid making skip errors, thereby improving data quality.\n\nSpecifically, this research explored two visual design elements that were hypothesized would help respondents recognize relationships between questions in a skip pattern and as a result, navigate the skip patterns correctly: indentation and common region.  Indentation was implemented by indenting the follow-up questions that did not apply to all respondents, and keeping questions all respondents should answer left aligned (see Form 3 in the attached figure).  Common region was implemented by using a separated background for the follow-up questions (see Form 2 in the attached figure).\n\nThe goal of this project was to determine if one or both of these visual design elements decreased the number of skip errors compared to the current best practices method used by the U.S. Census (see Form 1 in the attached figure&mdash;Redline et al. 2003).\n\nThe effect of the visual design elements was tested in a 4-page mail survey sent to 3,000 Nebraska residents.

The research contributes to both our understanding of visual design of surveys and our understanding of how best to design skip patterns.  However, the research has much broader impacts as its findings can be used to improve survey data quality in any social and behavioral science fields that rely on mail survey data as well as government agencies using survey data (e.g., the decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the Census of Agriculture, etc.).  These findings might also have application outside the sciences where information is collected such as on medical intake forms, insurance forms, loan applications, etc.  Moreover, improving survey data quality is key to being able to make data-driven decisions..."
