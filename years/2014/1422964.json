 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interference between wireless devices will become a serious bottleneck for future wireless networks as\r\nthey become more pervasive in our everyday lives. The traditional approach of dealing with interference\r\nis to share limited resources, such as spectrum, among many users such that a given resource is used by\r\nonly one user at a time. The recent notion of interference alignment (IA) proposes a new paradigm where\r\nseveral users can simultaneously send information by sharing the same resource. This new approach\r\nresults in increased network capacity where every user gets half the interference-free throughput. In this\r\nresearch, the project team will leverage reconfigurable antenna systems to design and enhance\r\ninterference alignment techniques for multi-user wireless networks. Reconfigurable antennas are capable\r\nof electronically switching between different radiation patterns (or 'states') in response to the needs of\r\nthe overlying communication link and network. In this regard, reconfigurable antenna systems represent a\r\nsignificant new degree of freedom for developing interference management techniques. The project team\r\nproposes new ways of using the antennas to enable more practical solutions for future multi-user\r\nnetworks and also provide a software defined radio platform to enable further research within the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWhile the vast majority of existing research in this area considers an antenna to be a monolithic 'black\r\nbox', the project team will develop and demonstrate new compact form-factor electronically\r\nreconfigurable antenna technologies that are capable of providing pattern agility. This additional degree\r\nof freedom allows for the dynamic selection of radiation patterns to seamlessly integrate with, and extend\r\ninterference alignment techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate how electrically reconfigurable\r\nantennas can greatly enhance the sum capacity achieved via distributed interference alignment, especially\r\nat low SNR, by improving the subspace design. The second objective is to demonstrate how blind\r\ninterference alignment can be practically achieved by combining antenna state selection algorithms with\r\nmultiple physical layer transmission schemes. The additional channel diversity provided by\r\nreconfigurable antennas comes with an overhead to acquire information about the state of all the channels,\r\nrevealing a need for a strategy to select the optimal state and most importantly an ability to learn the\r\nchanges in the channel state in order to adapt. With these goals in mind, the project team will utilize\r\nonline learning based on multi-armed bandit theory to design algorithms to control and adapt the state of a\r\nreconfigurable antenna system. For the multi-user network, the team will analyze the cost of learning\r\nunder an unknown statistical model of the channel and compare it with the oracle with full prior\r\nknowledge. Finally, the team will focus on implementing the developed interference alignment algorithms\r\non Drexel's Software Defined Communications (SDC) testbed. The SDC testbed is based upon a Scalable\r\nOFDM physical layer, which operates close to many different standards. The project team will develop\r\nnew blocks for precoding and decoding, cross-transmitter symbol-timing synchronization, as well as\r\nimplement more efficient synchronization techniques that require less data overhead. The proposed\r\ncombination of the Drexel SDC testbed with IA algorithms will result in a product that has high relevance\r\nto the industrial and academic research communities. Special effort will be made to not only disseminate\r\nresearch results through relevant conference and journal publication, but also through testbed technology\r\ndemonstrations. In order to extend the outreach of the proposed research beyond the research community,\r\nhigh school students and teachers, specifically under-represented populations, will be invited to\r\nparticipate in the PIs research laboratories through pre-existing educational programs. The developed\r\ntestbed will be used to develop demonstrations and laboratory-based course modules.",
