 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual search for specific objects, people, or activities is an important requirement in many occupational tasks, including reconnaissance and search and rescue operations.  Increasing deployment of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) has further added to the need for human operators to search for targets in still and video images provided by sensors on such vehicles. Developing expertise in such tasks typically takes extensive practice and training.  The purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility and benefits of using non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to accelerate learning on a complex visual search task simulating UAV operations. This work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Callan, an expert in the field of aviation research, at the Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNET) in Osaka, Japan.  \r\n\r\nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be used to identify specific regions of activation in frontoparietal cortical networks during task performance. These areas will then be targeted for stimulation using tDCS. Electroencephalography (EEG) data will also be collected during task performance before and after tDCS training in order to observe the effects of tDCS on neural responses related to complex visual search. The results of this study will advance theoretical knowledge of the neurocognitive mechanisms of complex visual search and identify methods for improving skill acquisition in such tasks.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the benefits of using non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on a real world task and how this method affects the brain. The objective for this study from a behavioral standpoint was to investigate whether brain stimulation over the right posterior parietal cortex during realistic visual search training would result in improved or accelerated learning when compared to a sham stimulation group. The objective from a cognitive neuroscientific standpoint was to not only determine brain areas associated with sustained visal attention on a realistic visual search task, but also to observe how tDCS might moderate brain activation in these areas. Thirty-five Japanese participants were recruited to take part in the study. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was first used to determine activated brain sites during task performance. The most active site was in turn used as the stimulation area for tDCS during task training. Next we applied tDCS while participants completed a high fidelity UAV visual search simulation. FMRI data was also collected concurrently with tDCS during task performance in order to observe the effects of tDCS on brain activation related to sustained selective attention during realistic visual search. Our results have given us insight about the neural underpinnings of the behavioral effects of tDCS that has been observed and replicated so many times before in previous studies. The results of this study advance theoretical knowledge of the neurocognitive mechanisms of complex visual search and promote tDCS as a method for improving skill acquisition in such tasks. By focusing on complex skill acquisition, the research will have broad implications for learning and training. These two institutions are continuing to work together on data analysis and will be submitting the results to peer-reviewed journals in the future.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/23/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;L&nbsp;Falcone</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
