The worskhops furthers attainment of two salient objectives of the National Science Foundation?s Science of Science and innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program by (1) contributing to an understanding of the means by which federal government support of research and development fosters scientific and technological change, and in turn the attainment of desired societal outcomes; and (2) building a community of practice between academic researchers and federal government officials and others such that the academic research community addresses policy relevant questions and that the policy/practitioner community finds that answers produced by SciSIP-supported research are accessible, relevant, timely, and convincing. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nAnecdotally, findings from SciSIP-funded research have demonstrable relevance to several science policy issues currently being addressed by several Federal agencies. The workshop will examine the evidence to date and accelerate the dissemination of these findings.",
