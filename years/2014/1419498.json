The main theme of the conference is the insights \r\ninto stochastic processes which arise in the light of high dimensional \r\nphenomena. It will focus on several closely related directions including: \r\nGeometric problems about Gaussian and linear stochastic processes;\r\nTypical distributions, concentration and other high dimensional phenomena;\r\nOptimal transportation, associated Sobolev-type and information-theoretic \r\ninequalities.\r\n\r\nThe mission of this forum is to consolidate and further encourage \r\ninvestigations in the above mentioned directions. There will be talks by \r\ninternationally known speakers on a wide variety of topics. The organizers \r\nexpect about 12-15 participants from USA, out of the total number of 40-50 \r\nscientists representing different schools. It provides an opportunity to \r\nreview the latest results in the field and to meet several generations of \r\nresearchers including postdoc and graduate students. Broadening participation \r\nof women and junior scientists from under-represented groups is anticipated. \r\nThe results of the meeting will be disseminated and contribute to the \r\nenhancement and improvement of scientific and educational activities.\r\n\r\nWebsite of the conference: http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/EIMI/2014/Sppd/index.html",
