In fact, the US EPA found that half of identified hazardous waste sites impact surface water. Excess nutrients also frequently well-up into rivers in agricultural areas. As groundwater contaminants move toward rivers, they eventually cross through the hyporheic zone beneath and adjacent to rivers, where mixing of surface water and groundwater in shallow sediments creates conditions that are often far more reactive than in overlying surface water or deeper groundwater. Contaminants that have degraded little in up-gradient aquifers can degrade up to 100 % once they reach the hyporheic zone (hyporheic natural attenuation). Yet upwelling contaminants often require mixing with reactants from surface water in the hyporheic zone in order to capitalize on this great potential for hyporheic natural attenuation.  The results of this project will transform groundwater remediation, risk assessment, and total maximum daily loads to address ecological, human health, and human recreational risks and impairments due to groundwater contamination intersecting surface water. Knowing how hyporheic natural attenuation potential varies with hydrologic and geomorphic conditions will allow calculating the amount of hyporheic natural attenuation expected at specific sites. The proposed project will also lead to subsequent projects addressing specific contaminants and engineering approaches to enhance hyporheic natural attenuation, such as carbon amendment by riparian reforestation. These lab experiments will serve as excellent tools for students in the PI's surface water-groundwater class to visualize hyporheic zone processes in ways that are otherwise not possible. The PI will work with the School of Engineering's Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity to recruit under-represented undergraduates to participate in project research.\r\n\r\nControls on such mixing have received almost no attention, yet recent work shows that such mixing is highly sensitive to hydrologic conditions. To tap the potential for hyporheic natural attenuation, it is necessary to better understand such controls on hyporheic mixing, and better distinguish mixing-dependent reactions from related processes such as dilution. This will allow prediction of how hyporheic natural attenuation varies among rivers of differing hydrologic, climatic, and biogeochemical conditions; among different types of contaminants; across time scales such as storms and seasons; and in response to engineered enhancements. This project will be the first to examine how the behavior of upwelling contaminants is affected by realistically complex hydrologic flow paths in the hyporheic zone. Both the tracer and biogeochemical portions of this study are therefore fundamentally novel. For example, this project will produce the first measurements of local dispersivities and first estimates of microbial growth parameters for riverine sediment subject to realistic hyporheic zone flow conditions. Such parameters are required for a wide range of biogeochemical reaction modeling of hyporheic zone processes. This project will also be groundbreaking methodologically, including the first laboratory simulation of upwelling of tracer and mixing with surface water advecting through the hyporheic zone. By focusing on broadly relevant processes like transport and transformation of tracers, oxygen, and carbon, this project will shed light on transformations of a wide range of pollutants in the hyporheic zone, including metals, organic contaminants that act as electron acceptors (e.g., chlorinated solvents), and organic contaminants that act as electron donors (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons). This work will support future studies that evaluate other electron acceptors (e.g., nitrate, iron), specific contaminants, and entrained particular carbon, as well as extension of these experiments to larger lab experiments (flowing flume) and field sites.",

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2019s National Priorities List indicates about half of more than 1000 identified hazardous waste sites impact surface water.  The prevalence and importance of groundwater pollutants exiting to surface water is underscored by the large number of studies investigating degradation or transformation reactions at the surface water-groundwater interface. This interface is known as the hyporheic zone, where mixing of surface water and groundwater occurs in shallow sediments of streams, rivers, and riverine estuaries.

This set up a mixing zone at the interface between these two source waters within the sediment.  For a subset of experiments we then added reactants to each water source to simulate a mixing dependent reaction at the interface.  For all experiments, we varied a series of potential controls on the reactions, including the variation of surface pressure.  We watched the progress of the mixing by photographing colored dyes added to the source waters.  We watched the progress of reaction by measuring dissolved oxygen patterns throughout the sediment and measuring reaction products at the outflows of the system.  Finally, we simulated the various laboratory experiments using computer models of water flow, pollutant transport, and pollutant reactions.
