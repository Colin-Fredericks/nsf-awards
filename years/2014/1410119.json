 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances in medicine, energy, and electronics often depend on the availability of suitable materials. Polymers, which are long chains made up of hundreds of monomer subunits, are an important class of materials employed in many of these fields.  Although the properties of biological polymers, like proteins and DNA, are derived from sequence, few methods for preparing non-biological polymers with controlled sequences exist.  Professor Tara Meyer of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF to develop a new method for preparing polymers from sequenced monomer units.  Using this method a large number of polymers with a range of properties can be constructed by rearrangement of a limited number of monomer subunits, e.g., ABABABAB... vs.  AABBAABB... .  The method employed herein offers important advantages over the few competing strategies including increased scale, control of chain length, and the potential for the creation of more complex architectures.  Undergraduate and graduate education is a significant component of this project.  Students are trained specifically in polymer chemistry by participation in the research and more generally in career skills by direct mentoring from Prof. Meyer and through participation in a series of workshops.  The workshops, although offered generally to all interested graduate student participants, stress skills and knowledge that are recognized as particularly helpful for students from underrepresented racial, gender, and socioeconomic groups. \r\n\r\nEntropy-driven ring-opening polymerization (ED-ROMP) of macrocycles with embedded sequences of 3-12 monomers is employed to produce polymers with a periodic display of the encoded sequence and controlled molecular weights.  Two new variants of the fundamental ED-ROMP protocol, Selectivity Enhanced (SEED-ROMP) and Deactivation (DED-ROMP), are developed in order to improve molecular weight control, lower dispersities and allow for the preparation of more complex block architectures.   By studying the kinetics, molecular weights and dispersities for each process, this research aims to gain a better fundamental understanding of these processes and information important for developing optimized, universal protocols for ED-, SEED-, and DED-ROMP.   These methods are applied to the preparation of two distinct classes of sequenced copolymers: biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)s and semi-conducting conjugated arylene vinylenes.  Properties related to the targeted application of each system, i.e, bioengineering and optoelectronics, are be measured and compared with those of the starting oligomers and/or the copolymers prepared by direct step-growth coupling of the sequenced oligomers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nTechnological advances in medicine, energy, and electronics often depend on the availability of suitable materials. Polymers, which are long chains made up of hundreds of monomer subunits, are an important class of materials employed in many of these fields.  A new method for preparing polymers from sequenced monomer was developed.  Using this method a large number of polymers with a range of properties were constructed by rearrangement of a limited number of monomer subunits, e.g., ABABABAB&hellip; vs.  AABBAABB&hellip; .   Although the properties of biological polymers, like proteins and DNA, are derived from sequence, few methods for preparing non-biological polymers with controlled sequences exist.  In this project we developed a new method for creating seqeunced polymers that involved the incorporation of shorter sequence blocks into a cyclic unit that could then be opened and combined with other cyclic units.  The resulting structure exhibits a perfect repeat of whatever units were incorporated into the cyclic structure.  By changing the chemical identity of the special unit that was used to chemically open these rings, it was possible to not only create sequenced polymers but also to improve the length-control of the method.   This new strategy was applied to a class of biodegradable polymers, which were prepared from a set of only three monomeric units.   The resulting polymers were characterized for both their sequence purity and their degradation in the presence of water.  The degradation was shown to be extremely dependent on the exact sequence and also on the identity of special linker groups that were incorporated.  The method should extend to a wide range of monomers so that future researchers can exploit this method as a tool to make other polymers\n\nThe understanding of how sequence affects properties of polymers is fundamentally important.  Using the strategies developed in this project it was possible to study the structure-function relationships of these materials in a way that was previouslly not possible.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nUndergraduate and graduate education was a significant component of this project.  Students were trained specifically in materials chemistry by participation in the research and more generally in career skills by direct mentoring from the primary investigator and through participation in a series of workshops on \"Self-Mentoring\".  The workshops, although offered generally to all interested graduate student participants, stressed skills and knowledge that were recognized as particularly helpful for students from underrepresented racial, gender, and socioeconomic groups. \n\nThe biodegradable materials prepared using the methods developed in this project have a potential for application in bioengineering devices including those used for drug delivery, cell scaffolding, and bone fixation.  The sequence control introduced using the strategy described provides and important tool to optimize the performance of polymers.  \n\nIncreasing diversity in chemistry was another important outcome of the proposal.  Three African-American undergraduate students and a female graduate student participated in the research and received degrees in Chemistry.  The PI was also engaged in the mentoring of female faculty members in her department.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tara Y Meyer"
