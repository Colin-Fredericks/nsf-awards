 "awd_abstract_narration": "The possible states of a quantum particle can be described by solutions to equations of mathematical physics, such as the Schroedinger equation.  In many circumstances, the energy of a particle is \"quantized\", i.e. can assume only special discrete values.  These values depend on the parameters of the problem, such as the electric and magnetic potentials present.  Each special value corresponds to a solution (an eigenfunction), which describes the probability amplitude of finding the particle in any given location in space.  In particular, the zero set of an eigenfunction is a set of positions that the particle avoids completely.  In some important applications, such as crystal structures, the energy is no longer discrete, but is a function (called the dispersion relation) of the direction of the particle's motion.  The goal of the project is to investigate possible connections among the following three questions: (a) effect of the magnetic field on the energy levels of Schroedinger equation, (b) properties of the zero sets of eigenfunctions, and (c) existence and stability of conical inclusions (\"Dirac points\") in the surface of the dispersion relation. In addition to all three being active areas of theoretical research in mathematical physics, the latter question has direct implications to the study of novel materials, such as graphenes and carbon nanotubes, and to design of new materials with desired physical properties, which are often governed by the presence of the Dirac points.  The existence of any connection between area (b) on one hand and areas (a) and (c) on the other was not known until few years ago. Each of the three areas is expected to benefit from an improved understanding of the other two.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on spectral analysis of Schroedinger-type operators on manifolds and graphs (both discrete and quantum).  Among the particular aims of the project are the following: describe the spatial configuration of the magnetic field that reduces the energy of the n-th eigenstate of a quantum particle and relate it to the zero set of the n-th eigenfunction; investigate the \"optimal\" placement of an Aharonov-Bohm flux-line on a manifold; investigate the properties of the (generalized) eigenfunctions calculated at the edges of the energy bands of periodic structures; formulate the conditions for the persistence of the Dirac points in graphene-like structures under perturbations reducing the symmetry; design a constructive method for predicting the location of Dirac points and of extremal points of energy bands; investigate the connection between the number of singularities in the dispersion surface and the number of zeros of eigenfunctions calculated at special points of the surface.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe sponsored research project was dedicated to the study of differential equations on networks (known as \"quantum graphs\"), in particular to the properties of the special solutions called eigenfunctions.  Such solutions can be visualized as the standing vibration modes of a network of strings.  Particular emphasis was placed on understanding the quantitative properties of points on the network where oscillation amplitude is zero --- the nodal points of an eigenfunction.\n\n\nAmong the 11 papers published or submitted for publication in the course of the project we highlight several.  A paper by the PI and his former graduate student Wen Liu settled the question whether a typical network has at most one vibrational solution of given frequency and whether this vibrational solution typically does not vanish on the junctions of the network.  This question is of foundational nature (the answer was intuitively clear), but it was important to elucidate the precise conditions for the positive answer and to provide rigorous proofs.  This result is useful as a starting assumption in many other explorations; as a consequence, as of March/April 2018, the paper received enough citations to place it in the top 1% of the academic field of Mathematics, according to the citation data website Web of Science.\n\n\nIn an effort to consolidate knowledge, the PI and colleagues (James Kennedy, Pavel Kurasov and Delio Mugnolo) systematized the theory of spectral surgery on quantum graphs, discovering new tools and sharpening the old ones.  \"Spectral surgery\" refers to various types of local or global modifications to the geometry of the network that result in predictable changes in the vibrational frequency.  This effort was inspired by application to the control of the spectral gap (which is responsible for the speed of heat equilibration in a network, among other things), but other applications are within sight (for example, in civil engineering, to the question of optimal placement of an extra support in a network of beams which maximizes resistance to buckling).\n\nAmong the results that can be classified as discovery, the PI with Lior Alon and Ram Band proved that the number of extra nodal points in a vibrational mode on a graph with disjoint cycles behaves like a random variable with binomial distribution.  This result built upon a connection, previously discovered by the PI while supported by NSF, between the extra number of nodal points and the stability of the vibration energy with respect to a perturbation by magnetic field. Further numerical investigations suggested that for several families of graphs the distribution has a similar form, becoming Gaussian (bell-shaped) in the asymptotic limit of many cycles.  Proving this conjecture remains an open --- and challenging --- problem.\n\nAs a part of the outreach, the PI prepared a lecture course and an accompanying review \"An Elementary Introduction to Quantum Graphs\" for the NSF co-sponsored summer school \"Geometric and Computational SpectralTheory\" in Centre de recherches math\\'ematiques, Montreal in June2015.  The review was subsequently used by colleagues worldwide for training graduate students.  A companion collection of exercises with solution hints was subsequently prepared and published by two of the colleagues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory Berkolaiko"
