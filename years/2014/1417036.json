What types of barriers affected this connectivity, and how permeable were these barriers to gene flow? The PIs will study how caballine horses, that inhabited ice-age Beringia (the biogeographic connector between Asia and North America), were affected by changes involving three different biogeographic barriers/corridors (1. the Bering Strait/Bering Land Bridge, which controlled dispersal and gene flow between Eurasia and Alaska; 2. the Ice-Free Corridor, which controlled gene flow between the Yukon and the Lower 48 States; and 3. biome shifts that periodically disrupted the spatial continuity of the Mammoth-Steppe, the unique ecosystem that stretched from France to the Yukon during the ice ages) during the last 30,000 years of the ice age. This study will evaluate the effects that each of these putative barriers to gene flow had on the abundance, distribution, and evolutionary trajectories of ice-age horses in the Arctic using new paleogenomic and paleoenvironmental data. The results will provide new insights into the roles played by environmental change and population fragmentation in determining extinction risk, and help predict how ongoing environmental changes will affect arctic ecosystems. This project will lead to advances in the rapidly developing field of paleogenetics and further the brand-new discipline of paleogenomic ecology. The Broader Impacts plan focuses on: a) research and professional development opportunities for graduate students, b) new training opportunities for undergraduate students who aspire to become STEM high school teachers, c) outreach to Native communities in rural Alaska, and d) outreach to K-12 students in Fairbanks, AK. At the end of each summer, the pre-service teachers, graduate students, and PIs will produce an inquiry activity module for grades 9-12 to be shared with local schools. Finally, the PIs will engage in both professional and public discourse, and use the results in media productions.\r\n\r\nThis is an interdisciplinary study combining cutting-edge paleogenomic techniques with newly synthesized paleoecological data to infer how arctic species were affected by past changes in climate, vegetation, and population connectivity. It builds on extensive previous work by the investigators, including hundreds of previously 14C-dated horse bones from permafrost that comprise a globally unique archive of ancient DNA.",

Because environmental impacts are difficult to measure in real-time, our project aimed to measure how populations of Arctic mammals responded to environmental shifts that happened in the past. Our ultimate goal with this work was to provide new insights that can help make informed decisions about managing present-day populations that are affected by habitat loss and change. Focusing on horses that lived in the Arctic throughout the last 100,000 years, we used ancient DNA, or DNA that is preserved within the remains of organisms that used to be alive, to reconstruct the population history of horses across arctic Eurasia and North America. By estimating patterns of genetic diversity, this approach makes it possible for us to learn when horse populations were growing or declining, to detect local extinctions and replacements, and to track long-distance movements of horses, such as between Asia and North America across the sometimes-exposed Bering Land Bridge. Using these data, we estimated how changes in vegetation and available habitat altered the connectivity between horse populations, and how this impacted their genetic diversity and their long-term survival. We found that available vegetation and competition with other herbivores best predicted the abundance of ice age horses, which became extinct in North America during or after the transition from the last ice age into the warm Holocene of today. We also found that the ability to disperse between patches of useful habitat was key to maintaining genetic diversity in ice age horse populations. When horse populations were connected via habitat corridors, horses migrated between even very distant habitats, exchanged genes with populations that lived in these distant habitats, and maintained overall high levels of genetic diversity. When habitat became scarce, populations became isolated and lost genetic diversity, ultimately leading to their extinction in North America and across much of their previous range. Our results suggest that the maintenance of habitat connectivity will be crucial to sustaining populations today that are increasingly isolated by changes to their habitat due to human land use and other factors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to contributing new genomic and radiocarbon data to the larger scientific community, our project has broader impact via the development of new technologies and human resources. Several postdoctoral scholars, three graduate students, and broad diversity of undergraduate students were trained cutting-edge experimental and bioinformatics approaches, as well as in the effective communication of science. We developed new technologies to recover ancient DNA that have been transferred from academia to industry, and created a new classroom resource for middle and high school students that explores the consequences of habitat change on large mammal populations. We trained two pre-service science teachers during the course of our project, and both have taken their skills and experience to schools that serve communities that are traditionally underrepresented in science. Finally, we created and implemented a new field-based undergraduate course in which 13 undergraduate students traveled to the North American Arctic to interact with working scientists and engage with local people. These students not only had first-hand experiences as professional scientists, but developed and practiced new skills in science communication through the creation of podcasts and participation in a live debate. Nearly all of these students are continuing their training in natural sciences, science communication, or as science teachers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/14/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Beth&nbsp;Shapiro</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523737714_loessBluffs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523737714_loessBluffs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Loess Bluffs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523737714_loessBluffs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Loess Bluffs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in the Arctic Ecology field course scouring Pleistocene-age loess bluffs in Klondike, Yukon, searching for bones from extinct horses and other megafauna.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Beth Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Beth&nbsp;Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Loess Bluffs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523241620_archaeologicalSite_students--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523241620_archaeologicalSite_students--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Archaeology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523241620_archaeologicalSite_students--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in the Arctic Ecology course helping to move dirt from the previous year's excavation at an archaeological site near Fairbanks, Alaska</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Beth Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Beth&nbsp;Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Archaeology</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523364744_Debate--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523364744_Debate--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Debate\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523364744_Debate--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Debate\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in the Arctic ecology field course participating in the public debate about the future of the Arctic at the Beringia Center, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Beth Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Beth&nbsp;Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Debate</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523131340_babyMammothTooth_landscape--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523131340_babyMammothTooth_landscape--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"baby mammoth tooth\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1417036/1417036_10324501_1552523131340_babyMammothTooth_landscape--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"baby mammoth tooth\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A tooth from a juvenile mammoth found by Arctic ecology course students at a field site in the Klondike, Yukon, Canada.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Beth Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Beth&nbsp;Shapiro</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">baby mammoth tooth</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
