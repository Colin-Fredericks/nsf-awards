Funds will be given as an NSF fellowship to attend the conference, where students will present their research as oral or poster presentations. Students will have the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge and insight into leading edge research from international researchers in nanotechnology. Students will also have the opportunity to attend workshops lead by experts in their fields to gain skills in new areas of nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this grant is student training in nanotechnology, nanoscience, and nanoengineering, which are critical research and development areas for the US. By enabling the participation of graduate students from US institutions in this conference, they will gain valuable knowledge through their active participation in giving technical presentations on their research, attending oral talks, and poster presentations. They will also have the ability to network and learn about global research in the nanotechnology community through formal and informal events.",
