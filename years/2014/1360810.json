Most extant continuously operating GNSS receivers that have been installed around the world are used for detection and quantification of subtle (mm) or not so subtle (m) position changes caused by tectonically, seismically, volcanically, surface load or subsurface fluid dynamics-forced deformation of the Earth? crust.  In preliminary analyses of GNSS signal to noise ratio observations at stations proximal to volcanoes with a known record of eruptive ash cloud activity, the PI has demonstrated the feasibility of the technique for detection of plumes.  This project will further develop and test algorithms to automatically detect volcanic plumes using GPS signal strength data and will rely on GNSS data taken from hundreds of sites over multiple years to establish the precision of retrievals. The sites will include U.S. GPS and Russian GLONASS capable satellite receivers from various manufacturers.  The results will be validated against scanning radar observations of volcanic plumes in Alaska and Iceland.  The performance of different receivers will be catalogued to provide feedback to volcano scientists seeking to implement GPS plume sensing networks.  In addition to developing code for GNSS detection of volcanic ash plumes, the project will involve forward modeling of GPS data in an attempt to link GPS signal strength observations to ash concentrations and particle size.\r\n\r\nHaving another observational modality in the toolkit for detection of hazardous volcanic ash plumes at marginal cost, given that multiple GNSS networks are operating around the globe with many proximal to active volcanic systems, has implications for the protection of life and property and is of particular interest to mitigating airline hazards.\r\n\r\n***",
