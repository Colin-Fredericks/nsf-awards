 "awd_abstract_narration": "3D Printing is one of the most promising new manufacturing technologies today, with many applications already and the promise of many more in the future.  However, while today's 3D Printing processes can produce parts with very complex geometries, they are slow, rough, and difficult to inspect and this limits their use in industrially-relevant applications.  Support will provided for the participation of leading US researchers in 3D Printing in discussions aimed at identifying promising breakthrough approaches to improving 3D Printing with leading researchers from the UK. These workshops will be held in conjunction with two of the leading annual conferences focused on 3DP, one in the United Kingdom and one in the United States.\r\n\r\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM) has huge potential, but currently has technological limitations, including slow build speed, poor surface finish, limited ability of conventional inspection methods to characterize complex AM parts, requirements for temporary support structures that must be removed after process completion, and often poor energy efficiency.  Two workshops are proposed, the first on July 7, 2014, the day before the 9th International Conference of Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing in Nottingham, UK, and the second on August 7, 2014, the day following the 25th International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium in Austin, Texas. These workshops will bring together leading researchers in the US and the UK for focused discussions on identifying breakthrough approaches to addressing the limitations in current AM processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this workshop grant was to hold two workshops to allow leading academics and industrialists to discuss and debate the next major advance in Additive Manufacturing. The emphasis is on forward-looking, transformational developments rather than incremental advances associated with most other meetings and road-mapping activities.   Based on the outcome, a US/UK collaborative research activity was defined which resulted in submission of a proposal to the NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes Program (SAVI).\n\nTwo meetings were held.  The first was on July 7, 2014 in Nottingham, UK.  Chaired by Phill Dickens, the approximately 10 attendees heard presentations on research approaches in the US and UK.  A general discussion of future breakthrough developments in AM took place.  Some brainstorming of ideas took place for US-UK collaborative research in Additive Manufacturing.  The meeting closed with preliminary planning for the second meeting.\n\nThe second meeting took place in Austin TX on August 7, 2014.  There were 27 attendees, 10 from the UK and 17 from the US.  Representatives included The Universities of Nottingham, Newcastle, Bath and Harriot Watt.  Industrial representation for the UK was from GSK, 3TRPD, Renishaw and Econolyst.  The US delegation included the Universities of Texas/Austin, Texas/El Paso and Louisville.  Industrial representation from the US came from Harvest Technologies, Printed Performance and Met-L-Flo.  The meeting opened with an overview of the UK workshop by Phill Dickens.  There were short presentations from industry delegates on where they would like to see AM in 10 to 20 years.  Following was a discussion on the next major advances in Additive Manufacturing.  Four areas of impact were discussed.  First was moving from point, line and area based manufacturing towards true volume manufacturing.  The main impact was time for part production with concomitant reduction in part cost.  Second was remanufacturing.  Third was a group of impacts called software enabling tools.  These included process optimization, generative design, and process/property relationships.  Last was a category called hybrid machines.  This included embedded sensors, part finishing in situ, combined AM processes and additive/subtractive processes.  A brief presentation on potential NSF/UK interactions was given at the end of the meeting.\n\nThe networking of world-class researchers and industrialists was strong.  Grant activities formed a starting point for continued collaboration between US and UK researchers in AM.  The workshops constituted a starting point for education and development of researchers in additive manufacturing.  Future activities planned as part of the workshops and follow-on will engage junior faculty and graduate students in cross-cultural research activity. The advances are expected to result in machines and processes that will enhance domestic productivity. The workshops provided an excellent opportunity for industry to take a pivotal role in helping to guide the future of AM research and to be involved in a systematic program of collaboration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Bourell"
