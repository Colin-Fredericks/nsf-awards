 "awd_abstract_narration": "This S-STEM scholarship project at the  University of Vermont (UVM) addresses the significant shortage of computer scientists, both in Vermont and at the national level. The project is increasing the number and diversity of well-educated, skilled employees in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe project improves educational opportunities for UVM computer science students by providing scholarships to students with a demonstrated financial need. The project improves UVM's ability to develop leaders in the field of computer science by raising awareness through outreach efforts and recruiting individuals who do not traditionally select computer science as a major.  Female award recipients are assigned dedicated female faculty mentors and advisors and participate in a female subsection of the department-sponsored student organization, CS Crew, to create a strong female cohort and increase retention and recruitment of female students, both scholarship recipients and others.  The project builds on several recent initiatives at UVM, including the highly successful STEM-Connect internship program in the UVM College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences.  STEM-Connect provides internship placement services and career placement services to computer science scholarship award recipients as they near graduation.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated using the Taskstream Electronic Assessment program.  Enrollment trends, student progress, outcomes of work-based learning opportunities, and career placement rates will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the program.  Finally the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) will be administered in each year of the program to measure student satisfaction and learning gains. The results of the NSSE survey will be used to compare the effectiveness of this program with other institutions and students at UVM who are not part of the program.",

Graduating S-STEM scholars had a median grade point average of 3.64 (Figure 2), and represented a diverse student group (see Table 1). Specifically, S-STEM scholars were 59% female and 27% students of color (both groups normally very under-represented in CS), and 55% were in-state (in comparison to only 28% in-state students at UVM). Of the recently graduated S-STEM scholars, 2 of them are pursuing graduate education in CS, 2 are in the job-search process, and the rest have already joined the workforce in full-time computing-related jobs.</p>\n<p>Several initiatives supported this award and improved educational and career development opportunities for students in the high-demand STEM area of CS, benefitting not only our S-STEM scholars but all UVM CS majors and minors. In addition to significant outreach and recruiting activities, we have made it a priority to build a strong sense of community and increase diversity and inclusive practices within CS. For example, in our introductory computer programming classes, students self-select between Gold sections (for students who have prior programming experience and/or are eager to be challenged in this area) and Green sections (for students who have no prior programming experience and/or are more intimidated by the material), enabling us to tailor the presentation to meet the needs of these two different audiences. We have found that more women and students of color select the Green sections and engage much more actively in class discussions than we had observed prior to these section splits; by the end of the semester, final grade distributions on the same tests have nearly identical distributions between Green and Gold sections. We have instituted a first year seminar designed to build community among CS majors and faculty with the goal of increasing student retention and engagement, and a career preparation seminar for upper-division CS students. We annually host our popular CS Fair and Agile Codefests, both of which excite and engage our students and provide opportunities for networking with industry sponsors. We have increased support for career development activities including resume building, internship and research opportunities, and mock-interviews with industry partners, with the result that approximately 82% of CS majors now do one or more forms of experiential learning to complement their coursework (including internships, teaching assistantships, and research projects with faculty supervision). With industry funding from our participation in the BRAID initiative (<a href=\"http://anitaborg.org/braid-building-recruiting-and-inclusion-for-diversity/\">http://anitaborg.org/braid-building-recruiting-and-inclusion-for-diversity/</a>), we have sent 18 CS majors to the Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference in 2015 and 89 CS majors (mostly female) to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conferences over the years 2015-2018.</p>\n<p>As a result of these initiatives, over the 5-years of this award we have succeeded in increasing the number of CS majors by 174% (from 179 to 443) and the number of CS minors by 119% (from 75 to 164). Notably, we were able to raise the percentage of female CS majors from 14% to 20% over this period, and the percentage of CS majors who are students of color and in-state students exceed the overall UVM percentages for these groups (see Table 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fundamental changes we have made to our academic programs, our career development services, and our extra-curricular enrichment activities will endure long beyond the termination of this award, continuing to increase the number and diversity of talented individuals with the technical skills and team-working abilities necessary in the computer science field, and area of extremely high and growing national demand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Margaret&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eppstein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1356426/1356426_10309671_1562006404664_awards--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1356426/1356426_10309671_1562006404664_awards--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1356426/1356426_10309671_1562006404664_awards--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Durations and amounts of scholarship funds awarded to each student.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Margaret J.
