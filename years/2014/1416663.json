 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most significant threats for marine organisms is acidification as a result of unabated anthropogenic CO2 emission.  On a global scale, acidification has the potential to impact biota that make their shells out of the minerals aragonite and calcite, that have a hard time forming shells in low pH waters.  One such group, the calcareous nannoplankton (haptophyte algae including coccolithophores that build shells of the mineral calcite), are a vital part of the open-ocean food chain. Laboratory experiments suggest that coccolithophores can adapt to more acidic conditions, but whether the group can adapt in the natural environment is uncertain.  The geological record contains a series of natural experiments that allow us to address the biological response of nannoplankton to greenhouse gas perturbations. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), a ~200,000 year long transient warming event 56 million years ago, is likely the best ancient model for the impact of massive greenhouse gas on marine ecosystems. Studies of nannoplankton from deep-sea sites show new taxa during the PETM including an increase in malformed morphotypes that could signify adaptation to lower calcite saturation.  Moreover, geochemical evidence suggests a similar magnitude pH decline during the initial stages of the event as projected to occur in the 21st century. The insight gained from this study will complement modern experimental and ecological studies, allowing mapping of the impact of progressive carbonate undersaturation on the ancestors of modern nannoplankton through space and time.  In addition to better understanding the long-term consequences of ocean acidification, broader impacts include training of students at the graduate and undergraduate level, support of a postdoctoral researcher, and outreach to K-12 classrooms.\r\n\r\nMuch of the information on the PETM derives from the study of cores drilled in the deep sea.  However, as the deep ocean also acidified during the event, the key early stage of the PETM and likely when the maximum surface ocean acidification took place, calcium carbonate has been dissolved in most deep-sea locations. Thus to study the full impact of ocean acidification on nannoplankton, this research focuses on nannoplankton contained within sedimentary sections deposited at continental shelf water depths. A superb opportunity to explore the impact of ocean acidification on PETM plankton exists in cores from the shelf on the Atlantic Coastal Plain where some of the shallowest and most expanded records of the event are found.  These core sections offer high temporal resolution and preserve a high-fidelity record of the early part of the PETM.  This project will use new and existing cores from Maryland and New Jersey to study the development and impact of acidification on the coastal ocean over millennial time scales.  The goal is to address the following hypotheses:  (1) Surface ocean carbonate saturation reached a minimum within the first twenty thousand years of the PETM then slowly recovered; (2) The response of nannoplankton to surface acidification was systematic with existing species tolerant of low saturation increasing in abundance followed by the evolution of new species and morphotypes; and (3) Eutrophication in the coastal ocean amplified the impact of acidification locally and played a critical role in drawing down CO2 during the early stages of the PETM.  These hypotheses will be addressed using closely integrated:  (a) nannoplankton assemblage studies to determine how species composition and morphology changed; (b) a suite of inorganic and organic proxies to elucidate the nature of environmental changes and particularly to unravel acidification from temperature signals; and (c) models to simulate the temporal variability of pH, saturation state and eutrophication on the shelf.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA 200,000-year-long transient warming event approximately 56 million years before present, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is viewed as possibly the best ancient analog for the impact of future global warming and associated environmental change.   The PETM involved 5-8o C global warming and acidification of the deep ocean driven by input of massive amounts of carbon over a geologically-rapid interval.  The geological abruptness of the event has often hampered previous investigations based on study of slow-sedimentation, deep-sea sites.  Our funded project took cores of PETM sediments from the subsurface in Maryland deposited on the North Atlantic continental shelf at much higher rates than the deep-sea sections.  These cores provided us with the ability to investigate aspects of the PETM in unprecedented detail, and we took advantage of this opportunity to understand the impact of the event on phytoplankton, ocean chemistry, carbon and nutrient cycling. \n\nOur investigation uncovered an extraordinary array of morphological variation among a group of malformed calcite-shelled plankton that originated during the event and disappeared before its end.   We propose that extensive malformation resulted from the migration of plankton to a corrosive, deep photic-zone refuge during the height of PETM warming and acidification.  In fact, the PETM is known to have resulted in acidification of the deep ocean but results from the shelf cores indicate that acidification may have been far more extensive than previous estimates. Cores are barren of microfossils during the onset of the event possibly as a result of abrupt pulse of acidification that extended out of the deep ocean to the shelf.   The shelf records also show for the first time that the recovery of the carbon cycle took longer than previous estimates, likely because there was additional input of carbon that has not been previously recognized.  Our investigation suggests that this secondary carbon derived from weathering of fossil carbon in soils and shallow sedimentary archives following the PETM onset.  Modeling shows that even small, localized changes in sedimentation can lead to major differences in the preservation of the PETM which is borne out by differences between cores taken closely together. Finally, high-resolution simulations of the PETM on the western North Atlantic continental shelf using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) suggests that warming led to a year-round, low oxygen levels. \n\nThe investigation has important implications for understanding modern warming, carbon cycling and ocean acidification.  First, migration as a response to warming may bring organisms into chemically hostile environments in a similar fashion to the malformed plankton during the PETM.  Second, the extent of ocean acidification is heavily dependent on the rate of carbon input; acidification of the shelf may have been a response to a very rapid pulse of carbon input during the onset of the PETM event.  Third, enhanced erosion and oxidation of ancient sedimentary carbon during this ancient warming event delayed recovery of the climate system for many thousands of years, a process that is not factored in modern carbon budgets.  Finally, predicted future low oxygen levels in shelf environments has occurred in the past in response to warming and nutrient input from rivers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy J Bralower"
