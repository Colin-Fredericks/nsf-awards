 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the impact of immigration on common-pool resource (CPR) management. The research will take place in Puerto San Carlos, a rural fishing village in Baja California Sur, Mexico, an ideal location to explore the impacts cof ommunity diversity on fisheries management outcomes because of the increased reliance on fisheries, the substantial migration to the region, and the presence of unsustainable management practices. Using a combination of ethnographic methods, social network analysis and experimental games, this project will compare the attributes, behaviors, and social integration of long-term resident fishers and recently arrived fishers to explore the relationship between immigration, social ties, and potential environmental impact. Results from this project can help clarify the currently inconsistent relationship between community diversity and cooperation, as well as question the widespread perception that immigrants inevitably are linked to environmental degradation.\r\n\r\nThe inconsistent relationship found in the scientific literature between community heterogeneity (i.e., diversity) and cooperation stems from two factors: a vague definition of heterogeneity, and poor specification of the mechanisms whereby heterogeneity affects cooperation. To remedy this situation, this project analyzes specific types of heterogeneity linked to environmental outcomes and their relationship to social ties. Additionally, the ambiguous environmental consequences of immigration may stem from the fact that immigrants are not necessarily dramatically different and marginalized outsiders. Questioning past assumptions about heterogeneity and its effect on resource management simultaneously questions assumptions about the environmental impact of immigrants.\r\n\r\nDespite the general perception in policy and the media that immigrants threaten the sustainable harvesting of natural resources, immigration is rarely addressed in fisheries and coastal management policy. This study will directly address the intersection of immigration and fisheries management, and contribute to remedying this significant policy oversight. Research findings will be shared with local residents and organizations, as well as the growing interdisciplinary network of U.S. and Mexican scholars investigating social-ecological systems within Baja California. To support local capacity for research and education, research assistant positions for local students will be created in collaboration with local organizations.",

This goal of the project is to investigate the impact of heterogeneity (i.e. community diversity) on common-pool resource management by studying immigration into Puerto San Carlos, a fishing town in the Comond&uacute; municipality of Baja California Sur, Mexico. For two years, the co-PI lived with a local family and immersed herself in the community by participating in local events, volunteering with the local NGOs, and teaching English and dance classes. To gain a broader understanding of the challenges surrounding fisheries management, conservation, and immigration, she conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants, collected migration narratives from residents, engaged in participant observation with fishers, analyzed Mexican fishing and environmental policies and regulations, and followed both mass media and social media coverage of current events. Ethnographic data was then used to create a survey for collecting data on household demographics, conservation attitudes, community involvement, local ecological knowledge, fishing practices, and social ties. With the help of 10 local research assistants, the survey was administered to 1568 households. Finally, 46 survey respondents also participated in an experimental game designed to measure how fishers respond to fishing norms and monitoring. Data entry is now 70% complete, and below we describe the project outcomes and preliminary findings with respect to our original goals for intellectual merit and broader impacts.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit Outcomes:</em></strong> First, the inconsistent relationship between heterogeneity and cooperation that characterizes the literature emerges from poor specification of both heterogeneity itself and the mechanisms whereby if affects resource management. Here we unpack this &ldquo;black box,&rdquo; systematically collecting survey data that speaks to differences in socioeconomic status, immigration history, other cultural and demographic factors, ecological knowledge, fishing practices, conservation values, and cooperative behavior. Our analyses of specific types of heterogeneity linked to environmental outcomes will provide a more nuanced understanding the relationship between heterogeneity and successful commons management. Second, by incorporating social network interactions in our analysis, we can suggest specific routes whereby immigration and heterogeneity affect resource use and management. To date, over 3,600 social ties have been recorded from the entered surveys. In our analysis, we will disentangle the effects of social ties and immigration history on the patterning of community heterogeneity. Finally, the ambiguous environmental consequences of immigration may also stem from the empirical reality that immigrants are not necessarily dramatically different and marginalized outsiders. The ethnographic data collected at the beginning of the project suggests that immigrant status is a salient point of difference, but that it does not necessarily preclude overlapping attitudes and behaviors, nor cooperation in the pursuit of shared interests. A prominent local narrative contrasts &ldquo;lazy locals&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardworking immigrants,&rdquo; with native&nbsp;<em>cholleros</em>&nbsp;(those born in Baja California Sur) more likely to characterize people from mainland Mexico as predatory and greedy rather than hardworking. However, regardless of immigration status, the idea of &ldquo;<em>gente de afuera</em>&rdquo; (outsiders) is often invoked. In other words, people who are not from Puerto San Carlos regularly join in blaming outsiders for the town&rsquo;s social and environmental problems; yet they do not consider themselves to be outsiders. Furthermore, recent local environmental activism surrounding the entry of sardine ships into Magdalena Bay and the formation of a protected area in the Gulf of Ulloa has involved both native and immigrant residents. Some of the most active residents &ndash; those who speak at fishing meetings, organize in monitoring activities, and participate in a recently formed federation of fishers &ndash; are immigrants who have lived in Puerto San Carlos for many years. And out on the fishing boats, native and immigrant fishermen alike knowingly violated fishing regulations.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts Outcomes:&nbsp;</em></strong>Immigration, both inter- and intranational, is a salient feature of 21<sup>st</sup> century life, as is environmental degradation. By replacing myths of immigrant damage with a quantitative unpacking of the diverse mechanisms entrained, our work informs future fisheries and coastal management policy options. More tangibly, by serving as Treasurer of the local Lion&rsquo;s Club, and Administrator of the Sea Turtle Festival Committee, Naar established rapport with local industries, the Municipal President of Comond&uacute;, district and regional heads of the Lion&rsquo;s Club, and director and staff of the Magdalena Baykeepers, thereby greatly facilitating the dissemination of project results beyond Puerto San Carlos. This strongly increases the chances of research informing future research and policy recommendations.<strong><em> </em></strong>To support local capacity for research and education, research assistants were selected from the Puerto San Carlos CETMAR continuing education program. At UC-Davis, five undergraduate research assistants (4 from underrepresented groups within the sciences) are assisting with data entry and transcription, and participate in lab activities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/25/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicole&nbsp;A&nbsp;Naar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052045602_javero--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052045602_javero--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Javero\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052045602_javero--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Javero\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Even at 90 years old, this fisherman and great-grandfather still works as a javero, receiving the shellfish sent up by divers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicole Naar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicole&nbsp;A&nbsp;Naar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Javero</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052169203_buso--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052169203_buso--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hookah Diver (Buso)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052169203_buso--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hookah Diver (Buso)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A local diver is suited up and ready to dive in search of chocolate clams (almeja chocolata) in Magdalena Bay.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicole Naar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicole&nbsp;A&nbsp;Naar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hookah Diver (Buso)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052391795_remendando--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052391795_remendando--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Repairing Nets\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357041/1357041_10309178_1488052391795_remendando--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Repairing Nets\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two shrimp fishermen work to repair a drag net (chango) that was torn by sharp rocks.
