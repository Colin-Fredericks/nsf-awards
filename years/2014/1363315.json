 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partially saturated soils are three-phase earth materials that contain both air and water in the void space between the solid grains.  Such soils are commonly encountered in field construction for a wide range of civil engineering works, including foundations, landfills, slopes, retaining walls, compacted fills, and highways.  The mechanical behavior of partially saturated soils is not well understood because of complex interactions of the three phases.  This award supports fundamental research, using both experimental and computer modeling methods, to provide needed knowledge of the mechanisms by which partially saturated soils undergo deformation and volume change (i.e., consolidation) under various loading conditions.  This work has the potential to transform current understanding of partially saturated soils, which has relevance to sampling, testing, characterization, and monitoring, as well as design and construction of sustainable civil infrastructures using these materials.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research program is to conduct a comprehensive experimental and computational investigation of multiphase consolidation for partially saturated soils, and then assess the significance of these findings for relevant applications in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering.  This work has both intrinsic scientific merit in terms of advancing the current understanding of a widespread physical process, as well as practical utility in terms of developing improved prediction methods for settlement, fluid flow, effective stress, and final material property profiles for a wide range of engineering applications.  The experimental program will include multiphase consolidation tests conducted for a variety of soils with changing stress and hydrologic conditions.  Measured data will be interpreted using a new and consistent framework based on unified effective stress theory and the suction stress characteristic curve.  The computational program will develop new models using a novel tri-lagrangian (solid-water-air) discretization method to track movements of each phase while accounting for geometric and material nonlinearities, compressible non-Darcy gas flow, coupled flow effects, phase discontinuities, and mechanical and hydrologic hysteresis.  Once validated, the new models will be used to perform numerical simulation studies to assess the significance of multiphase soil consolidation for a variety of engineering applications and highlight the importance of these effects to the broader geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering community.",

Using the results from both experimental and computational efforts, we assessed the significance of these results for a variety of applications in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering. We developed a new hydro-mechanical framework for analysis and modeling of large strain multiphase consolidation, taking advantage of important breakthroughs in effective stress theory and numerical computation over the last several years. We accomplished the proposed six research tasks: (1) material procurement; (2) material characterization; (3) multiphase consolidation tests; (4) development and validation of computational models; (5) numerical simulation studies; and (6) project collaboration and dissemination of results.</p>\n<p>The research has intrinsic scientific merit in terms of advancing the current understanding of a widespread physical process, as well as practical utility in terms of developing improved prediction methods for settlement, fluid flow, effective stress, and final profiles for a wide range of applications that involve partially saturated soils. The experimental program included multiphase consolidation tests conducted for a variety of soils with changing stress and hydrologic conditions. Measured data include: soil basic physical and mechanical properties, soil shrinkage curves (Image 1), and soil water retention curves for variety of clayey and silty soil (over a dozen of them, e.g., Image 1). These data have been interpreted using a new and consistent framework based on unified effective stress theory and the suction stress characteristic curve, and soil water isotherms (high suction range). New closed form equation for soil shrinkage curve is developed for all types of soil (illustrated in Image 2). The parameters in the closed form equation are directly linked to basic geotechnical indexes of Atterberg limits and basic soil properties of specific surface area and cation exchange capacity, and compressibility index (Image 3). A new method to quantify a soil?s specific surface area based on soil-water isotherm is developed (Image 4). The new models are used to perform numerical simulation studies to assess the significance of multiphase consolidation for a variety of engineering applications and highlight the importance of these effects to the broader geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of this collaborative project between the University of California-San Diego (UCSD) and Colorado School of Mines (CSM) are reflected in three areas. First, the project team recruited a women candidate at CSM and a women candidate at UCSD.

Third, a new theoretical framework and computational modeling method has been developed and evaluated for partially saturated soils. Findings has been disseminated to the scientific and professional communities through 9 journal publications in high-quality journals and presentations at 3 professional conferences.
