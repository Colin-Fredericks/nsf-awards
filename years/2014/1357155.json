 "awd_abstract_narration": "Are some languages easier to learn than others? This question, one that most linguists would find naive, is frequently heard among would-be language learners. A phenomenon often associated with more \"difficult\" languages is grammatical agreement, e.g. verb conjugation and noun-adjective gender and number, whose forms and rules seem to represent a net increase in complexity over languages that lack agreement. And yet, as one scholar remarks, \"Non-native speakers [...] will readily appreciate this demand. But most native speakers will hardly be aware that it exists at all; to them [...] agreement usually comes for free.\" But does it? And if so, how can systems that stymie learners be so easy for native speakers? In principle, the most effective way to determine the real-time complexity of grammatical agreement would be to \"turn it off\" and see whether speakers experience any sort of \"relief.\" An integral component of language such as agreement cannot be voluntarily deactivated, but given the proper combination of languages and an appropriate population of native speakers and learners it may be possible to indirectly explore the seemingly paradoxical fact that agreement appears effortless for native speakers but burdensome for all but the most proficient learners.\r\n\r\nThis research project focuses on bilingual speakers of two languages with highly similar vocabularies and sentence structures, one of which exhibits several forms of agreement and the other of which does not. The languages are Spanish and the creole language Palenquero, spoken in the Afro-Colombian village of San Basilio de Palenque. Although they are not mutually intelligible, Palenquero grammar is in many respects a proper subset of Spanish, lacking grammatical inflection on nouns, adjectives, and verbs and the accompanying agreement. In order to speak Palenquero without interference from Spanish, the bilingual speaker has to suppress grammatical agreement while producing essentially the same noun and verb phrases with the same basic words. Recent language-revitalization efforts have resulted in a cohort of native Spanish speakers who have acquired Palenquero as a second language. This study will include psycholinguistic experiments with first- and second-language speakers of Palenquero to test the suppressibility of agreement. In addition, by demonstrating that historically stigmatized languages can play a crucial role in addressing significant issues in linguistics, this study will aid in efforts to legitimize other languages and peoples struggling for acceptance.",

The study was based on a unique bilingual configuration: two languages that share almost all vocabulary and basic sentence patterns, but differ in that one has full grammatical agreement and the other lacks grammatical agreement altogether. The languages are Spanish and the creole language known as Palenquero and spoken together with Spanish in the Afro-Colombian village of San Basilio de Palenque, formed in the 17<sup>th</sup> century when enslaved Africans fled from Cartagena and established fortified communities in rural regions. Although Palenque was never reconquered by Spaniards, by the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century Palenqueros were painfully aware of the mockery heaped upon their language and adult Palenquero speakers made the conscious decision not to teach the language to their children. Matters have changed considerably in recent years; recognition by UNESCO and visits by scholars and tourists have energized language re-vitalization efforts.

Production tasks included speeded translation, simultaneous close-shadowing of recorded speech, andrepetition, in which participants repeated previously heard sentences after responding to distracting tasks such as describing a cartoon video or memorizing a series of random numbers.

The findings reveal that a completely regular and transparent grammatical process like Spanish gender marking, in which the same two endings (-<em>o </em>and -<em>a</em>) are added, is highly entrenched among native Spanish speakers, to such an extent that this agreement instinctively carries over to the gender-less Palenquero language. On the other hand, the general lack of transfer to Palenquero of      Spanish-like verb  agreement shows that maintaining or suppressing      agreement is not an  all-or-nothing affair, but rather crucially depends on      the  specifics of the agreement processes involved.</p>\n<p>Palenque and Palenquero speakers have gone from being demonized to being exoticized, but although most community members express pride in the retention of an ancestral tongue, the language remains little-known outside of the region.

The results&nbsp; have been shared with teachers and community leaders in Palenque. At the same time, this project has given me the opportunity to bring the linguistic and cultural reality of San Basilio de Palenque to a broader audience of scholars and the general public, to train a broad spectrum of student researchers, and most importantly, to encourage community members themselves to fully appreciate the valuable linguistic and cultural environment that they inhabit, and to become the next generation of researchers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/11/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;Lipski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
