 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program is funding the research of Graham Fleming of the University of California Berkeley to develop two new experimental methods to study the way energy flows through individual molecules, even if that flow is affected by the solvent the molecules might be dissolved in. Molecules in living tissue, for example, are always surrounded by a great deal of water and other substances that affect the way those molecules absorb energy from light and redistribute it. The influence of the water or other solvent can be quite large, and currently available experimental techniques are unable to separate the effects of the solvent from the molecule of interest. In this project, two new methods are being developed. The first method, which is called \"two dimensional electronic-vibrational spectroscopy,\" or 2D-EV, will enable the investigators to directly observe the flow of light energy in, for example, a green plant as it undergoes the process of photosynthesis. The second new technique being developed in this work, known as \"two dimensional fluorescence-detected coherent spectroscopy,\" or 2D-FDCS will more directly measure the influence of the solvent (usually water) on the molecule of interest. This work is having a broad impact on scientific infrastructure through the development of new devices so solve problems ranging from biology to materials science. Students at all levels will participate, including young students from local schools in the Oakland area who might not otherwise have the opportunity to consider a career in science.\r\n\r\nThis project has two aims: (1) to investigate electronic-vibrational coupling; and (2) to understand the role of the solvent environment in preserving quantum coherence. To achieve these aims, two new methodologies are being developed. The first of the new methodologies involves the construction of a new two-dimensional spectroscopic technique, 2D-EV, used to elucidate the involvement and role of nuclear motions in molecular and nanomaterial electronic dynamics. This technique measures the interplay between electronic and vibrational coordinates by correlating the electronic (visible) spectrum with a second dimension, the (mid) infrared spectrum of the system, as a function of waiting time. The ability to follow the ultrafast temporal evolution of both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom allows the study of coupling between electronic and nuclear dynamics in, for example, regions of the potential surface where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, such as in situations where conical intersections occur. By providing a site-sensitive tag, the method is, thus, enabling direct exploration of energy flow pathways. The second new technique, 2D-FDCS, aims to extend photon echo and related techniques to small ensembles and, eventually, single molecules. This method can be used to detect weak signals from small ensembles and single molecule nanoparticles and is allowing a sampling of fluctuations as well as the distribution of environmental frequencies. The result is new insight into the role of the solvent environment in destroying quantum phase and the degree to which the ensemble average masks the true microscopic dynamics. The group is also using theoretical methods to interpret their experiments and inform new directions for study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we successfully developed a new spectroscopic method, called two-dimensional electron-vibrational spectroscopy, and demonstrated its utility for revealing the mechanisms and pathways of light-driven molecular rearrangements.  We also showed how the crystal structure of highly promising perovskite materials for solar energy conversion influences the creation of electric current through modifying the separation of electrons and positive charges (\"holes\").  We identified a crystal vibration that seems to serve as a bottleneck in the loss of excess energy over that required to separate the charges, giving the possibility that the energy of sunlight photons above what is needed for creation of electrons and holes could be extracted for useful application.  This could lead to solar panels with 66% efficiency rather than the current maximum of about 23% where the excess energy is simply lost as heat.  The ability to create one atom thick two-dimensional sheets of certain materials gives rise to range of remarkable and exotic properties which could provide the basis for next generation low energy-consumption electronics.  As yet the electronic structure of such 2D materials is incompletely understood.  We used two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy in conjuction with advanced electronic structure calculations by S.G. Louie and coworkers (Berkeley, Physics) to demonstrate that a previously unobserved interaction in monolayers of molybdenum disulfide has a very significant effect, that carries important implications for the applications of these materials in next generation electronics.\n\nDuring the course of this project five postdoctoral researchers and three PhD students received training in the new spectroscopic methods developed in my laboratory.  Three postdoc now have faculty positions in research universities, the fourth works in Hi-tech industry using methods she learned during her training, and the fifth is still in my group.  After receiving their doctorates, one student is pursuing postdoctoral research, one joined Aerospace Corporation, and the third is still completing his thesis work.  My group focuses on providing a positive and supportive environment for women scientists and two of the postdocs and one graduate student were female.\n\nAs part of the project we connect with the community at multiple levels.  We hosted groups of students from underrepresented groups from under-resourced local High Schools, worked and led National committees to propose overall research directions which build on some of the fundamental discoveries this project has enabled.  Internationally, through annual discussions with political and industrial leaders worldwide at the annual Science, technology and Society (STS) Forum in Kyoto we raise awareness of upcoming changes and implications thereof from recent scientific and technological deveopments.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Graham R Fleming"
