 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will construct a new computer-based Resilient Infrastructure Simulation Environment (RISE) to allow individuals, groups (including students), and experts to test infrastructure network design configurations and crisis response approaches in three socio-technical infrastructure systems: electric power, water, and roadway networks. Researchers will link social and technical analysis with human subject research to discover the adaptive actions, ideas, and decisions that contribute to resilience. The project comprises of two major parts. In Part I (Modeling), researchers will identify the structure, dynamics (functionalities), and vulnerabilities of the networks that make up water, roadway, and electric power systems in Phoenix, AZ and Indianapolis, IN. Researchers will analyze the resulting US-based network models in conjunction with those from international partners in Asia, Australia, and Europe to learn and adapt global resilience principles . The results will be combined with belief networks to develop realistic decision models for the RISE. In Part II (Simulation), researchers will construct the RISE to study how different experts, stakeholders, individuals, and groups act in simulated decision scenarios. Through observation, researchers will identify the problem-solving and response strategies that result in resilient action, and thus understandthe organizational and social processes of sensing, anticipating, adapting, and learning. \r\n\r\nTaken together, this project will result in two principal research outcomes: 1) a measureable, testable description of resilience that fuses social, behavioral, and engineered elements for infrastructure system design, and 2) improved resilience among the students, managers, stakeholders and other participants participating in the study. The new knowledge will help policymakers design effective strategies to make America's water, power, and road networks more resilient.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Increasingly destructive disasters like the Camp Fire in California, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the heat waves in the American Southwest, and technological failures like the main Spillway at the Oroville Dam have raised important research questions about the performance of critical infrastructures systems under conditions of extreme stress.  This project investigated the interdependence of different technological and social infrastructure systems and how adaptive actions can either amplify or mitigate the adverse consequences of failure. In contrast to risk analysis, which identifies the likelihood of hazard, our approach advanced the theory and practice of resilience, which emphasizes examination of adaptive responses.  The project adopted a multi-pronged investigative method that employed network-based modeling, computer simulation, knowledge systems analysis, and case studies to make new discoveries and contributions in several fields important to resilience.  Among the highlights of these are:\n\nA new theory of resilient infrastructure systems that is suitable for responding to fundamental surprise.  This theory emphasizes resilience as performed, rather than possessed, by a system.  That is, it describes resilience as the emergent property of a complex socio-technical system that performs sensing, anticipating, adapting, and learning functions in response to volatile stressors, loads, or other conditions.  This theory provides a new way of examining case studies in resilient infrastructure systems and generating hypothesizes suitable for testing at multiple scales, as well as describing categories of technological and organizational adaptive capacities that contribute to resilience.\nComplex systems and network modeling of coupled systems (e.g., water, power, transportation) to demonstrate the potential for disruptions in one system to propagate into others.  The development of the Resilient Infrastructure Simulation Environment (RISE) platform now enables scholars to model power-water interdependencies with unprecedented flexibility and detail. Moreover, counter-intuitive insights into the percolation of disruptions through multi-layered networks reveals that prior assumptions about infrastructure network behavior have been too simplistic.\nBetter understanding of the relationship between human, organizational, and social dimensions of resilience and the performance of critical infrastructure systems under stress.  Modeling of the relationship between infrastructure policies, emergency governance, and infrastructure resilience has revealed that discordance between governance structures, technological structures, and environmental changes amplify the risk of catastrophic outcomes in interdependent infrastructure systems.  For example, stale design standards and outdated equipment specifications have failed to keep pace with the potential for extreme weather to overwhelm existing structures and accelerate infrastructure ageing.  Then, inflexible management structures may exacerbate the impacts of the resulting crisis, allowing damage to propagate across system structures and undermine the delivery of critical services.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas P Seager"
