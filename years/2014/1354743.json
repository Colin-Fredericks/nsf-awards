 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many insects, including pests of agricultural and medical importance, bear symbiotic bacteria that provide essential nutrients to their insect hosts, but the composition and amount of nutrients transferred between the partners are largely unknown.  This project will investigate insect-bacterial nutrient exchange in insects that feed on the extremely nutrient-poor diet of plant xylem sap.  Exploiting recent advances in genomics and metabolic modeling, the investigators will quantify the capacity of both insect and bacteria to synthesize key nutrients, and then integrate these results in the form of metabolic models that describe the amount of each nutrient transferred between the partners.  These models enable testing of two fundamental predictions: that nutrients produced in excess by one partner are required by other partners, achieving the nutritional efficiency that is required for insects to survive on xylem sap; and that the profile of nutrients received by the insects from their bacterial partners is defined by the overall metabolic network, and not simply the gene content of the bacteria.  The integrated molecular understanding of the nutritional interactions between the insects and bacteria generated by this research will identify specific targets for novel pest control strategies against important xylem-feeding insect pests which transmit plant pathogens affecting citrus, grape, coffee and other crops. The project will provide training in state-of-the-art genomic and modeling methods for a postdoctoral researcher and graduate and undergraduate students.  To address the increasingly recognized gap between research infrastructure and educational resources in sequence analysis and bioinformatics, the investigators will provide hands-on experience in genomics to students from local higher education institutions with limited genomics educational resources, and also develop lesson plans for genomics/ bioinformatics education in schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of this project is insects that feed on plant sap through the life cycle. Plant sap-feeding insects include the whiteflies, cicadas, aphids and spittlebugs. Plant sap is grossly deficient in essential amino acids, nutrients that insects and other animals cannot synthesize, and the plant sap-feeding insects possess symbiotic bacteria that provide supplementary amino acids. These bacteria cannot be cultured and, prior to our research, understanding of their function was based largely on their gene content. Specifically, these bacteria possess many or all the genes required for essential amino acids synthesis; but how this genetic capability is translated into metabolic function was unknown.\n\nTo investigate the metabolic function of the symbiotic bacteria, we constructed metabolic models.  We inferred the metabolic reactions and metabolites supported by the inventory of metabolism-related genes in each bacterium, then built a metabolic network and predicted the flux of metabolites through the network. We built multi-compartment models, linking the metabolic network for each bacterial symbiont and the insect host, and then quantified the predicted flux of different metabolites between the compartments (each compartment represents a bacterial symbiont or the insect host).  We conducted these studies for four different symbioses, enabling us to identify features that were common to all the associations.  We then tested the predictions of our models by metabolic studies of insects collected from natural populations.\n\nThe bacteria in the models of almost all the associations studied overproduced essential amino acids at high rates.  Exceptionally, one bacterium (Hamiltonella in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci) has the genetic capacity to synthesize two essential amino acids, but our models suggest that it has limited capacity to overproduce these nutrients because of metabolic constraints.  In other words, Hamiltonella behaves as a nutritional parasite that is exploiting the beneficial association between its co-symbiont (the bacterium Portiera) and the whitefly host. \n\nOur models also revealed that many of the bacterial symbionts utilize nitrogen remarkably efficiently.  Their metabolic networks are structured to use nitrogen sources (including insect waste nitrogen), transforming them to essential amino acids that are returned to the insect host.  For example, the bacterium Sulcia in cicadas recycle more than half of the nitrogen back to the insect.  We were also able to estimate the metabolic cost of maintaining the symbiotic microorganisms, finding a strong correlation between cost and genome size.  Previous research has suggested that the principal factors leading to small genome size of symbiotic bacteria are relaxed selection on genes not required in the animal host and genetic drift (i.e. chance loss of genetic capabilities).  Our data suggest that, in addition, genomes of small size may be selected by the advantage of reduced metabolic cost.\n\n To a very large extent, our metabolism studies confirmed the predictions of our metabolic models.  This demonstrates that the model outputs are biologically realistic, and so can be extended with confidence to other symbiotic systems, including associations that are intractable to experimental study.  However, our experimental studies yielded one surprise: that the insect cells harboring the bacterial symbionts (host cells) metabolize the sugar glucose to lactic acid.  This trait, which is variously known as the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis, was first identified in cancer cells and is characteristic of cells that are growing fast and require metabolic intermediates for biosynthesis.  Although the host cells in the insects we study differ markedly from cancer cells in that they are not disease-related and are not growing fast, these cells are biosynthetically very active, making the building blocks that the bacterial symbionts need for essential amino acid synthesis.   Many of the details of the metabolic program of these host cells are remarkably similar to the metabolic program of a cancer cell. \n\nThis research has supported 5 postdoctoral staff, and 5 undergraduate research students.  In addition, it has supported genomics education in local undergraduate institutions.  In each of three consecutive years, we ran a set of three workshops for 10 students: a week-long, hands-on training in sample preparation for DNA sequencing; a week-long training in data analysis using state-of-the-art bioinformatics programs; and a final one-day workshop where the student presented their results.  Each event was accompanied by professional development classes and informal interactions with graduate students at Cornell University.  Exit questionnaires and ongoing informal communication with the students revealed that the experience provided the students with technical experience and confidence that enhanced their career opportunities.  In addition, the postdoctoral staff funded by this grant gained valuable experience from the planning and conduct of the workshops, together with mentorship of individual students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Angela E Douglas"
