The project at Delaware State University seeks to enhance the undergraduate chemistry program in by infusing sustainable chemistry concepts in courses and laboratories, with the goal to  increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of chemistry majors.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are to: 1) develop a course and laboratory in sustainable chemistry; 2) infuse sustainability and green chemistry concepts in the existing chemistry undergraduate curriculum; 3) integrate learning with hands-on sustainable chemistry research experiences; 4) promote sustainable chemistry awareness at the university; and 5) widely disseminate the results of the project. The project is projected to impact all undergraduate chemistry majors at Delaware State University. The project will create knowledge related to how undergraduate students learn chemistry when the subject is taught in the context of green chemistry, environmental stewardship, climate change, food security and other aspects of sustainability.",
