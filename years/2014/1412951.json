 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program combines analytical studies with computer modeling to better understand large-scale fluid instabilities that lead to \"fingering convection\".  This process could play an important role in a range of natural systems, from Earth's oceans to the atmospheres of red giant stars.  This program will form the basis of a PhD thesis and provide opportunities for UCSC undergraduates and interns (visiting UCSC from the Ecole Normale Superieure in France) to gain valuable research training. In conjunction with this effort, the PI and her students will be involved with the next International Summer-Institute for Modeling in Astrophysics, a 6-week long program to solve topical outstanding problems in astrophysics. The program aims to train graduate students in a particular field through intense research experience, and to catalyze long-lasting collaborations between more senior researchers through shared mentorship of a student.   \r\n\r\nThe PI and her students will carry out analytical and computational modeling of the process of \"fingering convection\" and attempt to produce flux laws to predict how much heat and material is transferred by this process in various scenarios likely to be found in stellar astrophysics. Fingering convection results in radiative regions of stars from instabilities produced by a gradient in composition even when the density gradient is otherwise stable.  This can happen, for example, by the accretion of metal rich material is accreted or near the Hydrogen burning layer in red giants.  While primarily an analytical and computational study of instabilities and convection, this program could lead to modules that can be incorporated into stellar evolution codes.",

In most cases, these fluid dynamical processes take the form of turbulence, and scientists such as the PI are interested in quantifying the effects of this turbulence. The problem is complicated by the fact that turbulent processes depend sensitively on what causes the turbulence in the first place, and the environment in which it develops. Hence, we focussed here on one particular kind of turbulence, namely that which forms in the presence of fingering instabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fingering instabilities take place in regions of stars that have a stable temperature stratification (i.e. in the radiative regions of stars) and an unstable chemical stratification (where denser chemical elements reside on top). The combination of these competing stratifications can drive instabilities as illustrated in the Figure: if a parcel of fluid extracted from the upper regions which have high entropy (red) and denser chemical content (symbols) moves down, then it equilibrates thermally with the surroundings, and is left with only with its denser chemical content, and continues to sink. The reverse process takes place for a parcel from the lower regions brought upwards. The instability ultimately takes the form of roughly spherical parcels of denser concentration flowing down, and lower concentration flowing up, which slowly but steadily erodes the original chemical stratification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In previous NSF funded work, we investigated mixing by this small-scale instability using numerical modeling and were able to propose a simple model to quantify it, which only depends on the local conditions within the star, and can easily be implemented in stellar evolution codes. However we also discovered that in some cases, larger-scale instabilities can develop, that could invalidate the model and cause much more intense mixing than expected. This work was therefore dedicated to study all the possible situations in which large-scale fluid flows could spontaneously emerge from the small-scale fingering, and to quantify the amount of turbulent mixing that would follow. The Figure shows examples of numerical simulations in which we see large-scale instabilities developing, taking the form of large-scale waves and large-scale 'staircases'; in both cases, turbulent transport is substantially increased.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our main finding was, however, that the developments of these larger instabilities is limited to environments that are not found in stars (though could be relevant for some liquid metals, and might be of interest to the metallurgical industry).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We then proceeded to increase the realism of our model to include other physical processes that had not yet been included such as lateral variations of temperature and composition, rotation and magnetic fields, which are all present to some extent in stars. These studies revealed that (1) lateral gradients can lead to the formation of large-scale structures in fingering convection, that take the form of thermo-compositional staircases. Their evolution is very slow, however and takes place of very large scales that are difficult to study numerically, so further work will need to be done to better quantify that process. (2) rotation can cause the spontaneous formation of large-scale vortices from fingering convection, that act to funnel heat and chemical elements at their center and greatly increase transport. The process by which these vortices actually form, however, remains to be determined, and it also remains to be seen whether these vortices would actually form in a real star. (3) magnetic fields, finally, can have a fundamental impact on the turbulent dynamics of the fingering instability, and can greatly enhance vertical transport of both heat and chemical species by strengthening the fingers, and causing them to become more vertically coherent. This last process is now quite well understood, and we proposed a revised model for transport by fingering convection that includes the effects of magnetic fields, for stellar astrophysicists to implement in their evolution code.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while much remains to be done, our work has illustrated the complexity and extreme diversity of turbulent processes arising from a single, simple fluid dynamical instability in stellar environments. We hope to continue this work, and help stellar astrophysicsts to improve our understanding of stars by including better mixing parametrizations in&nbsp;their stellar evolution models.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/28/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pascale&nbsp;Garaud</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412951/1412951_10340904_1543427152890_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412951/1412951_10340904_1543427152890_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Large-scale structures in fingering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412951/1412951_10340904_1543427152890_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Large-scale structures in fingering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This Figure shows the state of basic small-scale fingering convection (left), the spontaneous emergence of large-scale waves (middle) and the spontaneous emergence of steps (right).
