 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eric Bittner from the University of Houston is supported in an award by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry and by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials Research to conduct research in charge and energy transport in photo-excited materials of interest for solar energy conversion. The goal of this work is to understand the behavior of electrons, nuclei, and light interacting in organic polymers, particularly those where the repeating parts of the polymers have small defects or are strongly disordered or come into contact with other materials. This work is to gain insight and advance materials design in energy applications and devices, e.g., plastic devices that generate electricity from sunlight.  While quantum mechanical processes in these systems occur on an ultra short (10^-15 s) time scale, they directly influence device behavior emerging on longer time scales (mesoscales). However, lack of detailed understanding and control of these mesoscale processes has thus far prevented researchers from fully exploiting these effects.  To this end, this research seeks understanding of how emergent phenomena arise due to interactions beyond on longer time and length scales.\r\n\r\nThe Bittner group's work in this field is the development of advanced theoretical methods for studying charge and energy transfer processes initiated by the absorption of photons. The electronic and optical properties of conjugated macromolecules are due to the delocalized pi-electron systems involving strong electron correlations and coupling of electrons to molecular structure in oorganic semiconductors. This project explores how quantum coherence and quantum entanglement both impact the initial charge separation following photoexcitation and help to suppress subsequent recombination of charges once they have formed. The theoretical approach combines the use of lattice models to describe the mesoscale structure of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction interafaces -- parameterized using ab initio and experimental data -- and time-convolutionless master equation methods to describe non-adiabatic interstate electronic transition as driven by phonons. This approach is being benchmarked against a series of model donor-bridge-acceptor molecules originally studied by Closs and Miller in their classic work that confirmed the Marcus inverted regime.  Other components include developing theoretical models for excitons/phonon polaritons in organic aggregates. Work is continuing in polariton Bose Condensation in J-aggregatea, especially in light of recent experiments by Bulovic's group at MIT.  An additional aspect of the work is in the photophysics of excitons in confined geometries, where one can exploit the Purcell effect to prepare states that are otherwise inaccessible to experimental probes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed a number of theoretical and computational methods that have advanced our understanding of charge and energy transfer in systems that are of interested for photovoltaic and light-harvesting applications.   One key advance was our development of an optimal search algorithm that can identify specific collective molecular motions that are most strongly coupled to the motion of an electron as it transits from one stationary state to another.   Identifying such motions allow us to tune and modify specific electron-transfer pathways by selectively populating specific vibrational modes that our algorithm identifies as being strongly coupled to the electron transfer coordinates.  In doing so, one can selectively switch on or off specific pathways.   \n\nRelated to this work, we developed the theoretical basis for a novel non-linear spectroscopic method for detecting the transient quantum coherence between an initial photoexcitation and the subsequent photocurrent produced by the quantum mechanical tunneling of charges from this state to form charge-separated states in a working photovoltaic device under operating conditions. By comparing our theoretical model predictions with related experimental efforts by Carlos Silva's group which has since moved to Ga Tech, we show that at least some fraction of the outgoing photocurrent can be attributed to the direct dissociation of excitons within the first 50fs following photoexcitation. This was a key observation in support of the \"hot\" exciton model. However, most of the photocurrent likely follows a \"cold\" pathway whereby excitons first form charge-transfer states at the phase boundary between donor/acceptor materials within the photocell, and it is these thermalized states that produced the bulk of the photocurrent. \n\nTo rectify the \"cold\" and \"hot\" models, we proposed a statistical model that accounts for the huge density of states that the exciton can dissociate into.  We show that the \"hot\" path tends to follow an energy landscape largely determined by the average Coulomb potential whereas thermalized states follow the free-energy landscape that becomes dominated by entropic factors at large electron/hole separations. \n\nLastly, our work continues to evolve to push the frontiers of photoinduced chemical dynamics into regimes in which the quantization of the photons themselves and their coupling to the molecular systems must be treated in a non-perturbative way.  Such is the case for molecules placed between reflective mirrors in optical microcavity devices.  We showed that under specific conditions plasmonic arrays of metal nanoparticle can lead to the formation of super-radiant states via quantum spontaneous symmetry breaking processes.  This prediction was subsequently verified, albeit in a system somewhat different than what we had envisioned.  Nonetheless, it has provided the necessary motivation to closely consider how QED effects can be exploited in a wide range of chemical and material systems and in particular how quantum light and photon-entanglement can be used as sensitive probes of many-body correlations and excitonic processes in systems with multiple interacting excitations.  \n\nIn terms of broader impacts, publications from our work continue to be highly cited.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric R Bittner"
