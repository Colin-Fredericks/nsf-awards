The leaf blade is a highly organized structure with cells in the upper and lower surfaces specialized for solar energy capture and gaseous exchange, respectively. The mechanism by which this highly organized blade development regulated is a longstanding question in plant developmental biology. The M. truncatula regulatory gene, STENOFOLIA (STF), critically regulates blade outgrowth in the middle region between the upper and lower leaf surfaces. The mechanism of STF function is unknown, which creates a major gap in understanding of the mechanism that governs leaf blade development. The overarching objective of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism of leaf blade development by analyzing the function of STF. This objective will be achieved using a combination of molecular and genomics approaches. The project will integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines including biochemistry, evolutionary biology, and developmental biology and will transform the mechanistic understanding of growth in plant lateral organs by providing the molecular basis for cell proliferation and expansion in the leaf tissue. This is very exciting because it will uncover the fundamental basis of plant form and function. The knowledge gained from this project will enable manipulating plant size and architecture to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and environmental adaptation to improve biomass and crop yield for food, feed, fuel, and fiber for the benefit of society. The project will provide excellent training to post-doctoral fellows, graduates, undergraduates, and senior high school students and is committed to cultivate minority participation in science.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>The leaf blade is a highly organized photosynthetic structure, which develops from a small group of pluripotent stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Once the leaf primordium initial cells are recruited from the peripheral region of the SAM, the primordium organizes itself into defined cell layers through highly regimented cell division and cell expansion patterns forming a flattened blade with distinct adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) surfaces. Because the leaf blade is essentially a solar panel, its size and design are of fundamental interest to basic biology, crop productivity, and environmental adaptation. However, despite extensive research and tremendous progress in the field, we still know relatively little about the mechanistic details of how the flat lamina develops. Polarity patterning along the adaxial-abaxial axis of the leaf blade is a prerequisite for blade outgrowth and this has been extensively investigated in Arabidopsis. Recently, a new regulatory domain at the adaxial/abaxial juxtaposition, so called ?middle domain?, was uncovered, which is critically required for lateral outgrowth of the leaf blade. This middle domain is governed by transcription factor <em>STENOFOLIA (STF)</em> in <em>Medicago truncatula</em> also called <em>LAM1</em> in <em>Nicotiana sylvestris</em> and <em>WOX1</em> in Arabidopsis belonging to the WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) family. <em>STF</em> positively regulates blade outgrowth by promoting cell proliferation at the adaxial/abaxial junction through a transcriptional repression mechanism. The overall objective of this project was to understand the mechanism of leaf blade lateral outgrowth regulation by dissecting the STF transcriptional regulatory network through genome-wide identification of direct targets and protein interaction partners.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>We are pleased to report that this NSF funding enabled us to successfully uncover that STF targets a wide range of transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, hormonal signaling components, and chromatin modifiers through protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to function in leaf blade expansion. We identified 387 putative STF targets, and 126 reconfirmed STF interacting proteins from a screen of 1.4 million clones, some of which have been functionally confirmed <em>in planta</em>. The project produced 17 publications to date in high impact journals. STF functions as transcriptional repressor and forms a multiprotein complex in the middle domain that involves the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (MtTPL). In Arabidopsis <em>tpl </em>mutant background, STF fails to repress one of its targets, the adaxial polarity factor MtAS2, indicating the importance of STF and MtTPL physical interaction for STF function in blade outgrowth. We found that STF represses cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenease enzymes that irreversibly catalyze the conversion of free cytokinin into non-usable conjugated forms, and in doing so STF promotes active cytokinin levels. In summary, our work uncovers two major functions of STF in controlling leaf blade expansion. 1. STF establishes and maintains a cell proliferation zone at the adaxial and abaxial juxtaposition by preventing both adaxial and abaxial polarity factors away from this zone through assembling a multiprotein transcriptional repressor complex that involves transcriptional co-repressors and chromatin modifiers (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). 2. STF promotes cell proliferation in the middle domain by increasing at least active cytokinin levels through repression of cytokinin degrading enzymes, but perhaps also promoting other phytohormones. We identified that the activity of STF is antagonized by another member of the WOX family, MtWOX9, which acts as a strong transcriptional activator in protoplast assays. Overexpression of <em>MtWOX9</em> in <em>stf</em> and <em>lam1</em> mutants exacerbates both phenotypes with additional severe defects in leaf length (<strong>Figure 2</strong>), while reduction of <em>NsWOX9</em> expression by antisense technology partially rescues the <em>lam1</em> blade phenotype. <em>MtWOX9</em> is involved in cell differentiation, and is directly repressed by STF (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Our findings suggest that balancing transcriptional activation and repression mechanisms by direct interaction of activator and repressor genes of the same WOX family may be a general requirement for the development of complex lateral organs in general and leaf blade morphogenesis in particular.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>Leaves are the primary organs of photosynthesis in plants where solar energy and carbon dioxide are assimilated into chemical energy providing food for heterotrophic organisms including humans to sustain life on earth. Similar to a solar panel, larger and more planar leaf surface area increases photosynthesis by capturing more solar energy leading to improved crop productivity. By ectopically expressing <em>STF</em> in transgenic switchgrass, we were able to optimize photosynthetic capacity to increase sustainable production of biomass for forages, biofuels, and biomaterials, and generated plants that have twofold higher total biomass and soluble sugar content compared to wild type (<strong>Figure 4</strong>), which is also true at least in rice, <em>Brachypodium</em> and wheat. We obtained a patent for this (U.S. patent No. 9, 074,216). This project enabled the training of eight high school students (4 males and 4 females) from the Southern Oklahoma technology center, and at least in part the training of four graduate students (2 males and 2 females) including two African-Americans underrepresented in STEM fields, five visiting graduate students, and four postdocs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/22/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Million&nbsp;Tadege</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1354422/1354422_10301234_1626996029264_Fig.2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1354422/1354422_10301234_1626996029264_Fig.2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
