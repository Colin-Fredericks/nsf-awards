Thomas and Earle R. Adams. The Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana is the center of a summer REU program, which is built around environmental chemistry with a primary objective of recruiting Native American students in the physical sciences and providing them with a relevant research experience. From prior REU programs at the UM campus, it is known that environmental issues often create interest among science students. This program is designed to include a writing experience, an industrial overview of a green industry, and personalized, well-focused research experiences that will broaden their depth of understanding in a STEM field. \r\n\r\nThe following components are in place for the success of this program: 1.) a director for Indigenous Research and STEM Education (IRSE), who provides a leadership role to build relationships and recruit Native American students in the STEM fields; 2.) focused research projects under the broader theme of environmental chemistry which is a specialty of UM chemistry faculty and of high interest among students at the tribal colleges in Montana and Idaho; and 3.) in collaboration with the Journalism Department and a present NSF program on campus, a Science Communicator will train students in writing techniques and media platforms that effectively reach Native audiences.",
