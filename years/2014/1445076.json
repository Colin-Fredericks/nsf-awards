 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project focuses on implementing an intensive, two year department level leadership development initiative for five selected mechanical engineering department leadership teams. TECAID - Transforming Engineering Culture to Advance Inclusion and Diversity has an overall goal to build the capacity of the department leadership to create, develop and sustain an inclusive department culture. Three specific professional development areas are targeted; change leadership, engineering culture and inclusive pedagogies. Change leadership will provide the ME leadership teams with the skill set necessary to effect change at either the individual or department level. Engineering culture refers to the intellectual, social, emotional and physical environments where our students learn. Inclusive pedagogies means utilizing instructional practices that improve student learning such as inquiry based learning, cooperative learning and use of student teams.\r\n\r\nThe premise is that the cultural environment within engineering departments is inhibiting the success of many students, particularly underrepresented students. The literature supporting this research indicates that this project will result in improved engagement, learning and social experiences for all engineering students, both majority students and those that are traditionally underrepresented in engineering. The project will utilize surveys to evaluate the existing department climate. The PIs will select five mechanical engineering departments to participate in this study, ensuring a wide variety of department types and sizes. Leadership teams from each department will participate in intensive professional development workshops and a facilitated virtual learning community enabling them to create and sustain inclusive, learner-centered environments.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project is in its ability to positively impact department culture resulting in an educational environment that welcomes all students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The project will utilize evidenced based interventions to effect a positive organizational change, increasing the awareness of factors that negatively impact students and changing the classroom environment to facilitate improved student learning. This project also represents a unique partnership with ASME, the mechanical engineering disciplinary society, which has great potential to substantially increase the reach and impact of this work.\r\n\r\nThis project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of reaching across society to ensure that the rich diversity of the nation's cultures is well represented in the STEM workforce and that individuals engaged in STEM fields are trained to participate fully in the global research enterprise. The creation of an environment that implements inclusive educational pedagogies will enhance learning for all students, facilitating equal participation of underrepresented students and contributing to broadening participation within the engineering workforce.",
