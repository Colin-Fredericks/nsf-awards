Random processes with an algorithmic flavor: the rigorous study of iterative algorithms for matrix pre-conditioning that are widely used in numerical linear algebra but poorly understood theoretically; the analysis of certain fundamental Markov chains that are beyond the range of current techniques; and the understanding, from a computational viewpoint, of non-linear stochastic processes known as \"quadratic dynamical systems,\" which generalize the classical Boltzmann equation in physics and models for recombination in population genetics.\r\n\r\n2. Computational aspects of statistical physics: the development of more sophisticated techniques for studying the key property of spatial mixing in spin systems and its algorithmic implications; the investigation of stability properties of naturally occurring combinatorial polynomials (partition functions) in statistical physics, and their applications to algorithms and computational complexity; and the potential application of models from statistical physics to the study of phenomena such as viral marketing in social networks.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project include graduate student training in the interdisciplinary field of theoretical computer science, statistical physics and applied probability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project used advanced mathematical techniques to study two types of phenomena and connections between them:\n\n1. Random processes and algorithms.\n\n2. Computational aspects of models in statistical physics.\n\nResearch was conducted by the PI and his graduate students and collaborators on a variety of specific topics within the above two broad themes.  Two full-time PhD students at UC Berkeley were supported by the project; other collaborators included faculty and postdocs in the US (Caltech, Georgia Tech, Univ of Rochester), India (Tata Institute), the UK (Universities of Oxford, London, Edinburgh and Bath) and Italy (Univ of Rome III).  The results of the project were disseminated in research papers in leading journals, as well as presentations at major international conferences and workshops.\n\nThe major outcomes of this work include the following.\n\n(i) Algorithms for matrix balancing.  Before performing many standard computations on matrices (such as computing their eigenvalues, or solving linear systems), it is necessary to first pre-process the matrices so that the resulting computations will be robust to numerical errors.  This process is known as \"balancing\".  A classical algorithm for matrix balancing, that is implemented in many of today's linear algebra packages, was developed by Osborne around 1960.  Surprisingly, the running time of this very powerful and widely used algorithm had never before been analyzed!  Our research provided the first such analysis, and also confirmed a conjecture about worst-case matrices for the algorithm.\n\n(ii) Genetic recombination.  The research established a new analysis of the rate at which strands of DNA in a population evolve towards equilibrium in simple models of genetic recombination.  The new analysis examined the rate at which entropy increases in this process, in contrast to previous analyses that were based on simpler measures.\n\n(iii) Phase transitions in statistical physics.  A \"phase transition\" in a physical system occurs when a small change in the value of some parameter, such as temperature or pressure, leads to a sudden change in the global properties of the system: common examples are the melting of ice and the boiling of water.  Phase transitions are often described mathematically as points where a certain function of the system (the \"partition function\") becomes non-analytic (i.e., it has zeros in the complex plane).  Another thrust of this research has been to exploit the absence of a phase transition in order to construct efficient algorithms for computing quantities associated with the system.  This can be seen as making the classical theory of phase transitions in statistical physics algorithmic.\n\n(iv) Dynamics of spin systems.  A spin system consists of a collection of sites located in space, each of which is assigned a random spin value that depends on the spins of its neighboring sites.  Spin systems were originally developed to model various physical systems, but more recently they have also become widely used in other areas, such as AI and Machine Learning (where they are often called Markov random fields or graphical models).  A fundamental question about spin systems is the rate at which they evolve to equilibrium under some natural dynamics, i.e., a process that repeatedly updates sets of spins according to the current spins at their neighbors.  Our research has developed new mathematical tools for analyzing various types of dynamics, including local dynamics (where just one spin is updated at each step), non-local dynamics (where many spins are updated), and systematic scan dynamics (where spins are updated in a specific sequence, rather than in random order).  We have also established new connections between dynamics and phase transitions (as discussed above).\n\n(v) Solutions for constraint satisfaction problems.  Many problems in engineering, mathematics and artificial intelligence call for finding a solution that simultaneously satisfies a large number of constraints: such problems are called constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).  A famous mathematical result from 1975, called the Lov&aacute;sz Local Lemma, gives conditions under which a CSP has a solution (though it gives no clue as to how to find one).  Recent breakthroughs have turned this condition into an algorithm for actually finding a solution.  As part of this project, we have extended this work to derive algorithms that find not only one solution, but potentially many solutions, under a slightly stronger condition.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alistair Sinclair"
