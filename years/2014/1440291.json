The goal of this project is to create a system for software stewardship in geosciences that will empower scientists to manage their software as valuable scientific assets. Scientific software stewardship requires a combination of cyberinfrastructure, social infrastructure, and professional development infrastructure. The  framework will result in an open transparent and broader access to scientific software to other scientists, software professionals, students, and decision makers. It will significantly improve the adoption of open data and open software initiatives, improve reproducibility, and advance scientific scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will advance knowledge and understanding of scientific software as a valuable community asset that is worth sharing, curating, cataloging, validating, reusing, and maintaining.\r\n 1) Facilitating software publication through TurboSoft, a personal assistant (analogous to TurboTax) that guides a user through best practices. Users will choose the degree of investment they are willing to make in componentizing, describing, licensing, and maintaining their software. The system will encourage open source publication, the formation of communities around the software, and set up mechanisms for software citation and credit. \r\n2) Enabling broad software dissemination through GeoSoft, a \"software commons\" for geosciences that will support software contributions (prepared through TurboSoft or otherwise), software discovery through multi-faceted search, and foster social interactions through dynamic formation of communities of interest. GeoSoft will interoperate with existing software repositories and modeling frameworks in geosciences. \r\n3) Providing just-in-time training materials through GeoCamp, an annotated collection of educational units ranging from basic education to professional training on all aspects of software stewardship. GeoCamp will be seamlessly integrated with TurboSoft and GeoSoft, and present a wide range of options for learning in the context of a user?s context of interaction with the framework or independently.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGeosciences software embodies important scientific knowledge that should be explicitly captured, curated, managed, and disseminated.  Recurring issues of provenance and uncertainty in the context of data could be better addressed with improved treatment of geoscience software: it is easy to see that nothing describes data more precisely than the software that generates or uses the data.  Software is implicitly linked to its documentation, datasets it uses or produces, publications, and ultimately scientific theories.  Scientists recognize the value of sharing software to avoid replicating effort or to reproduce results from others.  However, the stewardship of software in geosciences must be greatly improved.  First, while modeling frameworks have dramatically improved software sharing, there are orders of magnitude more codes devoted to preparing data for input to a model (what we could call \"pre-model software\") and preparing data that results from a model (\"post-model\" software). Studies show that scientists spend between 60%-80% of a project?s effort collecting and preparing data before doing new science. This would indicate a significant overhead in developing pre-model software for data preparation is only rarely shared and rarely reused, particularly across disciplines.  While the loss of \"dark data\" in science is well recognized, we see an analogous problem in the pervasive loss of \"dark software\".  It leads to wasted investments, particularly for younger researchers that are often charged with such tasks, which often go unnoticed.  Second, the inaccessibility of software as an explicit science product that, like data, should be shared and reused leads to barriers for those who cannot afford such investments, and to barriers for software experts that could otherwise become involved in supporting software efforts.  Finally, the education of future scientists crucially depends on the ability to actively explore problems by experimenting with science-grade data and software.  This will not be possible unless science software is captured and properly disseminated.  In summary, although geoscientists program a lot of code to analyze their data, that important software is often not shared and rarely preserved.\n\nThe goal of the GeoSoft project is to enable the creation of a germinal ecosystem for software stewardship in geosciences that will empower scientists to manage their software as valuable scientific assets in an open transparent mode that enables broader access to that software by other scientists, software professionals, students, and decision makers. \n\nThe OntoSoft project will result in a germinal social site for EarthCube, where scientists can discover alternative approaches to release free software, use intelligent interfaces to explain how their software works, and form productive communities around software projects.\n\nThis research has the potential to fundamentally transform geosciences by making scientific software readily available to researchers and citizen scientists for efficient data analysis.\n\nWe are using ontosoft as vehicle for sharing \"CZO ready\" software to the community for modeling watershed hydrology, landscape evolution, biogeochemical reactive transport at CZO research sites.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Duffy"
