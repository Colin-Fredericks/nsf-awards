 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-Performance and Distributed Computing (HPDC) has made significant impact in simulation and modeling of many domains, ranging from understanding\r\nfundamental physical processes to designing new and functional materials. With the growing richness of capabilities, increased ease of access and availability of high-performance and distributed computing resources, the opportunity to employ such resources to novel problems types and domains arises. The aim of the proposed workshop is to bring the HPDC and the Polar Science communities together to collectively explore, examine and identify the opportunities and barriers in the use of high performing computing techniques and resources for polar science studies. The workshop has the potential to bring advantages to both fields, where NSF has been investing considerable resources over the past years. Outcomes from the workshop will benefit science and society through the laying of the foundation for collaborative efforts aiming at improving the understanding of the variability of the polar regions at different timescales, and their connection to climate and other Earth systems. Moreover, it will contribute to the building of a polar cyberinfrastructure, one of the goals of the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program at the National Science Foundation. \r\nThe workshop will be held at the Rutgers Climate Institute and will host approximately 40 participants, lasting two and a half days, at the end of October or early November. A broad group of scientists from the polar science and HPDC communities, both broadly defined, will be engaged as members of the organizing committee to identify major challenges, opportunities and questions such as: What HPDC/CI support is already available to the Polar Science community? What HPDC/CI capabilities are missing? Unsatisfactory? Insufficient or Incomplete? What are the cyberinfrastructure barriers beyond availability that limits further advancing Polar Science? The workshop participants will be also asked to create a ranked list of scientific challenges that the community aims to tackle on a 1-year, 5-year and a decadal time frame. The final outcome of the workshop will be a report that defines and conveys a community-based vision for the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program at the National Science Foundation.",
