 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although engineering is commonly understood as a \"technical\" enterprise -- many associate it with electronic devices, high performance materials, and modern infrastructure, for example -- equally important is an understanding of the many social contexts in which engineering is practiced, and the related social impacts. This project engages students (both undergraduate and graduate) and faculty in deep experiences in which they directly consider social, ethical, and global issues (SEGIs) as essential aspects of their educational, research, and career development activities. As a result, it empowers participating students and faculty to function in novel and non-traditional settings and roles, using a combination of traditional and non-traditional skills and sensitivities. Example outcomes include: an undergraduate student choosing a service-learning elective to enhance her engineering design project; a graduate who works as a professional engineer playing the role of honest broker to mediate between a community and a large developer; a graduating student founding a non-profit organization to create new technologies for use in a \"developing country\" a researcher deploying his or her knowledge and skills to design a research project that addresses a specific social, regional, or community need. In these and other ways, this project engages traditionally under-represented populations and marginalized communities, particularly from Puerto Rico, Haiti, and several other countries from Latin America. And, reflecting this international orientation, this project deploys four languages: Spanish, English, French, and Haitian Creole.\r\n\r\nThe concept of Responsible Wellbeing (RW), particularly as articulated by Robert Chambers, combines with a virtue approach to ethics to unify, philosophically and normatively, this project's activities. Essentially, this approach holds that both personal happiness and societal wellbeing converge at a point between scarcity/poverty and the extreme/unlimited pursuit of material and monetary wealth. Reaching such a point requires exercising self-imposed moderation. In the context of engineering it can be realized through making conscious choices in engineering design and research applications while drawing on key principles such as Appropriate Technology (AT), Value Sensitive Design (VSD), and Human Capabilities (HC). The four activities sponsored by this project integrate RW throughout the educational and research missions of the College of Engineering through (1) development of new teaching materials, case studies, and strategies for intermediate and capstone courses in the College of Engineering; (2) delivery of a series of seminars, workshops, and conferences that introduce participants to the principles of RW, AT, VSD, and HC, all of which are encapsulated in a general reader made available to all participants; (3) support of several independent research projects that respond to a specific societal or community context, and embed the concepts of RW, AT, VSD, and/or HC, together with alternative career fairs that assist participants with their pursuit of opportunities that meaningfully engage with SEGIs; and (4) execution of an innovative developmental assessment plan that guides and tracks overall project progress, using a framework of five stages: awareness, evaluation, integration, anticipation, and value realization. The PIs are collectively experienced with several prior projects in engineering ethics, engineering education, and appropriate technology upon which this project builds.",

Wellbeing.&nbsp; While Appropriate Technology offers artifacts, tools, and designs that respond to the relevant socio-technical surroundings, Responsible Wellbeing provides normative guidelines to the design and implementation of Appropriate Technology. &nbsp;Setting forth wellbeing as the end of STEM practice and research resonates with the personal motivation of students, researchers, and practitioners, who have chosen their course of study in order to design careers that allow them to flourish as individuals.&nbsp; Responsible wellbeing moderates self-centered pursuits while opening students, researchers, and practitioners to aligning their own flourishing with that of others as well as the local and global communities in which they live and work.&nbsp; Responsible Wellbeing functions morally as a \"visible hand\" that guides professionals as they design their personal careers toward broader social, ethical, and global ends.&nbsp; As such, it is the cornerstone of an ethical culture in which practical and intellectual dispositions, habits, beliefs, attitudes, and even virtues can thrive.</p>\n<p>This project demonstrated that progress can be made to adopt this sense of responsibility, using a scale of five levels of moral development within the engineering design space: (1) Ethical Awareness, (2) Assessment, (3) Prevention of Harm, (4) Integration of Ethical Considerations, and (5) Value Realization.&nbsp; These levels correspond to ascending levels in Bloom's Taxonomy (Figure 1).&nbsp; Examination of student reflections and proposed solutions to situations involving an ethical question (within an engineering context) showed that as the course progressed, students moved from a basic state of Awareness of ethical concerns to incorporating Prevention of harms.&nbsp; This is not surprising, given the emphasis of \"health, safety, and welfare\" in the engineering ethics codes.&nbsp; Yet, as the codes tend to emphasize compliance, rather than aspiration, activities such as re-imagining codes and considering projects inspired by values, led to measurable gains in student expression beyond the mindset of Prevention to seek Integration and Value Realization, in which the engineer can anticipate ethical concerns <em>a priori</em> and even use engineering work as an expression of ethical values.&nbsp; A lasting outcome of this project is the reform of the Engineering Ethics course at UPRM to include aspirational, morally imaginative activities that can lead to a cultural shift in how engineers approach their work.</p>\n<p>Within research and graduate education, a course Responsible Research in Appropriate Technology was developed in which students map their research within a socio-technical framework, employing the various frameworks presented above, and ultimately integrated into the final thesis.&nbsp; Numerous and varied projects were completed using this framework, including: measurement of energy content of charcoal derived from bamboo, with applications for Haitian charcoal maker communities; engineering analysis of damage to a cable-stayed bridge in Puerto Rico, coupled with critique of the socio-political evolution of the bridge's design and impact on the community; integration of principles of feminism in the design of public spaces; a pilot study to measure the degree of \"techno-centric\" attitudes among STEM students, such as the assumption that technological innovation leads to wellbeing and progress; developing community workshops to construct DIY solutions for disaster recovery, such as hand washing stations and manual washing machines for clothes; empathy and co-design in developing more comfortable baskets for local coffee farmers in Puerto Rico, linked to a course on workflow management; documenting characteristics that enable community-level, off-grid utility cooperatives, demonstrating a socio-technical complex (Figure 2); measuring factors that influence STEM graduates' decisions to seek and accept employment; a study of bamboo as a construction material, with recognition as a socially important resource; and the development of a theoretical model to maximize consumer satisfaction (wellbeing) while minimizing consumption of electric power, in correspondence with the \"threshold hypothesis\" that holds that over consumption of resources negatively impacts wellbeing (Figure 3); and a proposal for micro-grid energy installation in Puerto Rico that prioritizes the most vulnerable populations.</p>\n<p>Though the applications are many and diverse, the common thread tying them together is Responsible Wellbeing, in which the commitment of the engineer to incorporate values leads to the wellbeing and flourishing of the self and others.&nbsp; As a coda to this work, the evolution of the team has been to further embrace the concept of \"community co-design\", in which those who are traditionally labeled as \"beneficiaries in need of help\" are seen as \"partners in design to achieve objectives\".&nbsp; The last major function of this project was a virtual \"Co-creating\" symposium held in Summer 2020, and brought together 42 people from 11 communities in Puerto Rico, ages 12-69, along with a team of mentors, to learn and apply Design Thinking to identify community objectives and ideate and prototype solutions around the topics of off-grid energy, personal hygiene, and contact tracing.&nbsp; Many of these projects are currently in progress through additional resources and commitment of members of the team (Figures 4-6).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/13/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;Papadopoulos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div

Numerous and varied projects were completed using this framework, including: measurement of energy content of charcoal derived from bamboo, with applications for Haitian charcoal maker communities; engineering analysis of damage to a cable-stayed bridge in Puerto Rico, coupled with critique of the socio-political evolution of the bridge's design and impact on the community; integration of principles of feminism in the design of public spaces; a pilot study to measure the degree of \"techno-centric\" attitudes among STEM students, such as the assumption that technological innovation leads to wellbeing and progress; developing community workshops to construct DIY solutions for disaster recovery, such as hand washing stations and manual washing machines for clothes; empathy and co-design in developing more comfortable baskets for local coffee farmers in Puerto Rico, linked to a course on workflow management; documenting characteristics that enable community-level, off-grid utility cooperatives, demonstrating a socio-technical complex (Figure 2); measuring factors that influence STEM graduates' decisions to seek and accept employment; a study of bamboo as a construction material, with recognition as a socially important resource; and the development of a theoretical model to maximize consumer satisfaction (wellbeing) while minimizing consumption of electric power, in correspondence with the \"threshold hypothesis\" that holds that over consumption of resources negatively impacts wellbeing (Figure 3); and a proposal for micro-grid energy installation in Puerto Rico that prioritizes the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThough the applications are many and diverse, the common thread tying them together is Responsible Wellbeing, in which the commitment of the engineer to incorporate values leads to the wellbeing and flourishing of the self and others.  As a coda to this work, the evolution of the team has been to further embrace the concept of \"community co-design\", in which those who are traditionally labeled as \"beneficiaries in need of help\" are seen as \"partners in design to achieve objectives\".  The last major function of this project was a virtual \"Co-creating\" symposium held in Summer 2020, and brought together 42 people from 11 communities in Puerto Rico, ages 12-69, along with a team of mentors, to learn and apply Design Thinking to identify community objectives and ideate and prototype solutions around the topics of off-grid energy, personal hygiene, and contact tracing.  Many of these projects are currently in progress through additional resources and commitment of members of the team (Figures 4-6).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Papadopoulos"
