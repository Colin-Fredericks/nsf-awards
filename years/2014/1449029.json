However, the recent acceleration in the development of new algorithmic techniques in both fields and new hardware in robotics provide many opportunities for high-impact collaborations.  The PIs are requesting funds to take advantage of this opportunity by holding the first of what is expected to be a series of meetings to encourage collaboration between these two communities.  The first meeting will be held at the most important AI conference, AAAI-2015, in Austin TX.  There will be events that bring some of the most accomplished researchers from Robotics to AAAI and also events that will be exciting school children and undergraduate students.",
