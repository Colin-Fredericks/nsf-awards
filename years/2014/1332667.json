 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: Over the last decade, a growing international research effort has focused attention on the physical state of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), including its climatically-vital transports of heat, mass and tracers, and the causes and consequences of its variability. Begun in 2004, the Line W program - moored and shipboard measurements of the equatorward-flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) and poleward-flowing Gulf Stream along an altimeter track between New England and Bermuda has acquired a remarkable 10-year time series of this component of the AMOC. The goals of this project are to conduct a final Line W cruise to recover the current meter array presently in the water and reoccupy the hydrographic section, to process the recovered sensor data to final form and refurbish the sea-going equipment, and to complete the scientific analysis of the Line W data set in conjunction with fellow AMOC investigators.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Property and transport time series generated by several AMOC programs are now approaching or exceeding a decade in length and are starting to provide truly unprecedented views of the AMOC's structure, strength and variability. Synthesizing these results and combining them with state estimate models will undoubtedly result in improved understanding of the mechanics, dynamics and impacts of AMOC variability. Key foci of this project's analysis effort include careful quantification of the local variability at Line W, estimating variations in net (coast-to-coast) meridional transport of selected water masses by combining Line W observations with interior-ocean data and via models, and investigating the meridional coherence of water property anomalies and AMOC fluctuations by comparing Line-W observations with water property observations and AMOC estimates at other latitudes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A graduate student in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program will be funded to complete her Ph.D. thesis that will be based on Line W. As in past years, several students and/or postdocs will be involved in the final Line W cruise to gain hands-on experience with hydrographic sampling procedures and physical oceanographic mooring work. In this analysis and synthesis project, the original Line W investigators are entraining a new junior scientist into the research effort. This will introduce the investigator to new observational practices and associated data reduction and analysis procedures while bringing new expertise and viewpoints to the study. It is absolutely critical to observational physical oceanography that young investigators become fully versed in modern observational methods. The project's investigators will additionally continue to showcase Line W in public outreach events as a demonstration of ocean science and climate variation studies. Beyond these human elements, the Line W program is continuing to serve as a testbed for several emerging ocean measurement technologies and associated data processing procedures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Line W research program was conceived to observe and characterize the time-averaged structure and intensity of the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) and Gulf Stream, and to investigate the nature and causes of their variability.  These two oppositely-directed flows: the Gulf Stream carrying warm water northwards and the DWBC transporting cold water equatorward, are major contributors to the so-called Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.   A long-term community research goal is to develop better understanding of the role of these time-varying circulations in earth?s climate system. The Line W study's approach centered around a sustained observational program that spanned the continental slope on a line running approximately from Woods Hole towards Bermuda.  The field program, that employed moored instruments, repeated ship-based sampling and analyses of remote sensing data, produced a 10-year-long time series of boundary current data that were (and continue to be be) used together with companion programs at other latitudes in the Atlantic to characterize the Meridional Overturning Circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean.  The field program ended in May 2014; the present grant supported the processing of the final set of recovered data and continued scientific analysis of the full 10 years of observations.  Highlights of the latter (reported in peer-reviewed journal articles) include quantifying the time averaged fluxes of water carried by the Gulf Stream and DWBC and a suggestion that these flows weakened by approximately 30% over the measurement period.  It is not known at this time if this finding reflects a decadal timescale oscillation that was not fully resolved by the 10-year observational program or manifests a sustained climate change.  In addition to the scientific research, the entire Line W program supported three (female) graduate students through to successful doctoral dissertation defenses, hosted many 10s of students and junior support staff on research cruises to gain sea going experience, and provided a testbed for several oceanographic sensors and measurement systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/20/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John M Toole"
