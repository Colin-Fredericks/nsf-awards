The symposium will provide a discussion forum for Separation Science and Technology (SST). This symposium is a follow-up to an NSF co-funded symposium held at the 2012 Fall ACS Meeting entitled ?Ensuring the Sustainability of Critical Materials and Alternatives?.\r\n\r\nThe overall objectives of the currently proposed symposium are to:\r\n1. Bring into focus crosscutting research and education needs in SST associated with the sustainable recovery and recycling of critical materials and (e.g. metals) and resources (e.g. phosphorous) from liquid and solid wastes including impaired water (e.g. seawater, brackish water, brines and domestic/industrial wastewater), mine tailings and electronic wastes.\r\n2. Communicate these research and education needs to the broader SST community of scientists, engineers, policy makers, business leaders and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe symposium will contribute to the advancement of separation science and engineering (SSE) and its application to the sustainable supply of the critical materials and resources to build the sustainable products, processes, technologies, farms and industries of the future by inspiring a new generation of scientists, engineers and students to enter this field.\r\n\r\nAIChE will develop and maintain a website that will be neutrally branded and dedicated to the subject of critical materials. It will serve as a repository for relevant materials from this symposium and potential future symposia. The website can link to other sites with pertinent information. The AIChE will permanently have the workshop materials maintained for dissemination. This website will not only make materials available to the research community but also serve to inspire and engage the next generation scientists, engineers and policymakers.",
