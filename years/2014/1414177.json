 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the global Internet expands to satisfy the demands and expectations of an ever-increasing fraction of the world's population, profound changes are occurring in its interconnection structure, traffic dynamics, and the economic and political power of different players in the ecosystem.  These changes not only impact network engineering and operations, but also present broader challenges for technology investment, future network design, public policy, and scientific study of the Internet itself.  And yet, from both scientific and policy perspectives, the evolving ecosystem is largely uncharted territory.  Two related transformations of the Internet ecosystem motivate this project: the emergence of Internet exchanges (IXes) as anchor points in the mesh of interconnection, and content providers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) as major sources of traffic flowing into the Internet.  By some accounts over half the traffic volume in North America now comes from just two content distributors (Youtube and Netflix).  This shift constitutes the rise of a new kind of hierarchy in the ecosystem, bringing new constraints on existing players who need to manage traffic on their networks to minimize congestion, resulting in tussles among commercial players as well as between the private sector and regulatory bodies, at the expense of users suffering degraded quality of experience.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to characterize the changing nature of the Internet's topology and traffic dynamics, and to investigate the implications of these changes on network science, architecture, operations, and public policy.  The first task is to construct a new type of semantically rich Internet map, which will elucidate the role of IXes in facilitating robust and geographically diverse but complex interdomain connectivity.  This map will guide the second task: a measurement study of traffic congestion dynamics induced by evolving peering and traffic management practices of CDNs and ISPs, including methods to detect and localize the congestion to specific points in the network.  Data used will include measurements gathered using CAIDA's global active measurement infrastructure Archipelago (Ark), as well as data contributed by industry players for use in validation and refinement of methods.  This project will advance the scientific community's understanding of the evolving Internet by developing and applying a more sophisticated model of the physical Internet topology. The inquiry is structured to pursue new methods of analysis and insights into the interaction between CDN dynamics, interconnection at IXes, and network performance.  Results, including the sharing of collected and curated data sets, will also inform related fields, including traffic modeling, infrastructure resiliency and protection, network economics, industrial organization, and future network architecture design.  Results will be disseminated via publications, conferences, industry meetings, online lectures, web pages. CAIDA and CSAIL will jointly host annual international interdisciplinary workshops to close the loop between empirical research results, theoretical modeling activities, and policymaking.  By providing unbiased data about the evolving Internet ecosystem, the proposed research has the potential to be of great value to Internet users, network operators, and governments.",

In this project we developed, deployed, and validated a lightweight active measurement method and system to enable a third party to measure evidence of congestion on thousands of interconnection links between broadband access ISPs and major interconnecting parties, including directly connected content providers. Our original motivation for this work was an increase in heated peering disputes between powerful players in the U.S., which raised questions about intentional degradation of performance as a business strategy to obtain (or avoid) interconnection fees.<br /><br />This work required us to tackle the tedious and long-unsolved problem of automatically and correctly inferring network boundaries in traceroute data. Lack of progress on this problem has impeded a wide range of research and development efforts for decades.&nbsp; We developed and validated a method that uses targeted traceroutes, knowledge of traceroute idiosyncrasies, and codification of topological constraints in a structured set of heuristics, to correctly identify interdomain links (i.e., between independently operated networks) at the granularity of individual border routers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our initial algorithm focused on the newtork boundaries we have most confidence we can accurately infer in the presence of sampling bias: interdomain links attached to the network launching the traceroute. This method formed the cornerstone of the platform we built to map interconnection performance.&nbsp; In the final year of the project, we undertook a collaboration to extend and generalize this algorithm to make boundary inferences beyond the immediately upstream network.</p>\n<p>The mapping, measurement, and analysis platform took us three years to build, but the investment was worth it: we were able to address a decades-long gap in a third-party's ability to study peering disputes in an open, objective, scientifically validated way.

Especially in today's deregulatory political climate, such measurement is the most promising strategy for incentivizing trans- parent and accountable ISP behavior.</p>\n<p>The science of Internet cartography is still young, and its measurement tools rudimentary.
