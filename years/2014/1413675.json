Activities will include student summer seminar talks  that will reach other STEM students, and parents.  \r\n\r\nThe program will utilize spectra of low metallicity HII galaxies from the Sloan digital Sky Survey, together with an integrated, self-consistent model for HII region emission.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes  \n\nThe main scientific result of this project, the primordial helium abundance, is a key prediction of the big bang model.  Three minutes after the big bang, the universe had cooled sufficiently to fuse protons and neutrons into light elements&mdash;deuterium, helium, and lithium&mdash;in a process called big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).  Using the measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), standard BBN (i.e., based on our standard models of particle physics and cosmology), predicts that 24.7% of the mass of normal matter in the early universe was helium.  Due to fusion in stars, the helium abundance has increased slightly over time, but most of the helium in the universe is primordial, and hydrogen and helium combined account for over 97% of the elemental composition of the universe.  \n\nThis project used spectroscopic observations of emission nebulae (H II regions) in blue compact dwarf galaxies to directly determine the primordial helium abundance.  Because stars also produce helium, that increase must be corrected for.  That is accomplished by also measuring the oxygen abundance.  Oxygen is not primordial, and thus by measuring helium (Y) and oxygen abundances (O/H) from a set of galaxies, linear regression back to zero oxygen abundance returns the primordial helium abundance (Yp), as shown in the attached image.  \n\nThe primordial abundances provide a unique window into the content and interactions of the early universe.  Correspondingly, the main impact of this project comes from comparisons of observational determinations of the primordial helium abundance with the predicted value.  Deviations between these values signal the possibility of new physics beyond our standard models, as well as potential systematic errors in our models (for spectroscopic helium abundances or BBN), their atomic data, or our measurements.  In particular, measurements of the primordial helium abundance place the strongest constraints on the number of relativistic species of particles in the early universe (in the Standard Model, 3 neutrino species).  \n\nThis work utilized public data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), to select appropriate galaxies and calculate the primordial helium abundance.  The result, 23.95% &plusmn; 1.11%, agrees well with the CMB prediction (24.7%), and supports standard BBN.  Correspondingly, it places valuable constraints on extensions to the Standard Model, such as proposing an additional light, weakly interacting particle.  \n\nFurthermore, a key motivation of this project was to advance methods for improving primordial helium abundance determinations.  First, the SDSS offers a very large dataset of observations that can be employed&mdash;separately or combined with previous observations of blue compact dwarf galaxies&mdash;to better constrain the regression parameters through the use of more regression points.  Second, previous helium abundance determinations have relied on measurements of six (or less) helium emission lines.  This work incorporated a seventh, He &lambda;5015, to better determine the helium abundance for each galaxy.  \n\nThird, this project investigated removing the effects of underlying stellar absorption from emission line measurements.  This systematic effect, due to absorption in stellar atmospheres along the line of sight, causes a decrease in emission line measurements, which must be estimated and corrected in our models.  If, instead, its effects could be removed from the initial spectral measurements, the uncertainty on our helium abundance calculations would be significantly reduced.  However, our investigations showed that higher resolution spectra will be required to successfully fit and remove the effects of underlying absorption.  \n\nIn addition to its scientific merit, advancing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education and career training was a key goal of this project.  This work was primarily conducted as an 11-week undergraduate stude..."
