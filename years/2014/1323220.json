Specifically, the research evaluates variation in grassroots reconstruction efforts across 78 post-conflict villages in the rural municipality of San Carlos, Colombia. For nearly a decade, these villages were caught on the front lines of the civil conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and three paramilitary groups. Despite their proximity, villages experienced different types of armed occupation and violence wielded against civilians. Since the conflict subsided in this region, villages have also revealed stark variation in their reconstruction patterns. In some villages, residents have worked together to de-mine public spaces and rebuild destroyed infrastructure while other villages have not organized around reconstruction. This project seeks to delineate the causes of this variation by tracing the relationship between local conflict dynamics and subsequent local peace-building. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project seeks to identify the key factors behind successful peace-building and hypothesizes that dynamics during conflict are integral to post-conflict peace-building success or failure. Despite a rich body of literature on civil wars, social scientific studies have seldom focused on post-conflict settings. Extant research on post-conflict settings has failed to consider the theoretical link between conflict dynamics and post-conflict phenomena and the factors that facilitate peace. By focusing on local reconstruction activities across villages in Colombia, and implementing a comparative, theoretically driven study of the relationship between these outcomes and local conflict dynamics, this project will delineate how conflict dynamics affect reconstruction efforts through their impact on village institutional stability and social networks.\r\n\r\nThe project includes an original database compiled from archival sources and a resident survey to determine the distinct conflict dynamics in each of the 78 communities. Using the database and survey responses, quantitative analysis will uncover the relationship between the conflict dynamics and the reconstruction outcomes such as de-mining activities, exhumation of bodies, and re-integration of ex-combatants. An in-depth qualitative study of four village cases, using semi-structured interviews and historical research, will advance the understanding of reconstruction activities and trace their relationship with conflict dynamics, such as patterns of violence and forced migration. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: By identifying the local factors that are critical to post-conflict reconstruction and stability, this research will help to improve future peace-building efforts. Numerous international missions have failed to establish sustainable peace because they have ignored local dynamics, both in transitions from war and in post-war environments. Understanding the roots of successful reconstruction is of strategic importance to U.S. economic and security interests in Colombia, and more broadly. The United States shares a free-trade agreement with Colombia, and Colombia is a strong partner in South America, whereas other countries are openly hostile to the United States. Therefore, the United States would like to ensure Colombia's stability and understand its internal dynamics. Additionally, political insurgencies and criminal groups have wielded similar strategies during the Colombian conflict, suggesting that insights concerning subsequent grassroots reconstruction efforts are applicable in a variety of conflict settings and countries where stability is important to U.S. national security. Project results will be shared with both policymakers and academic audiences and eventually include a book-length manuscript and several articles. The archival dataset, semi-structured interviews, and surveys will all be made freely available online.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the aftermath of a civil war, why do some communities organize around peacebuilding activities - independent of government or international assistance - while other communities do not?\n\nThis doctoral project addresses this puzzle by studying the grassroots peacebuilding efforts across 182 post-conflict villages in Eastern Antioquia, Colombia.  For nearly a decade, these villages were caught on the frontlines of the civil conflict between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), paramilitary groups, and the Colombian Army.  Despite their proximity, villages experienced different types of armed occupation and violence wielded against civilians.  While massacres and massive displacement left some villages abandoned, in other villages inhabitants remained and lived under armed occupation.  After the conflict subsided in this region, the villages revealed variation in their grassroots peacebuilding patterns.  In some cases communities worked together to de-mine public spaces and rebuild destroyed infrastructure, while in others, communities did not organize around peacebuilding activities. \n\nThis project studied the causes of this variation by tracing the relationship between local conflict dynamics and subsequent village reconstruction activities as part of local peacebuilding.  Specifically, this project had three objectives: 1) to develop and test a theory of grassroots peacebuilding, 2) to develop a usable framework to measure peacebuilding activities across geographic and historical contexts, and 3) to determine whether there is a relationship between the dynamics of war in a specific locale and that same locale\u00c6s subsequent path to peace (or continued violence). \n\nTo accomplish these objectives, I spent nine months conducting fieldwork in Colombia, primarily in three municipalities in Eastern Antioquia where levels of violence and displacement during the Colombian conflict reached their peak in the late 1990s.  While in the field I collected qualitative and quantitative data and compiled an database of local conflict dynamics (1996-2006) and peacebuilding trends (since 2006) across 182 villages.  Information about the conflict was collected through mapping exercises with community members, a human rights database, the national press archives, and in-depth interviews with civilians who survived the conflict.  Information about community efforts to rebuild in the aftermath of war was collected through an original survey with the elected leaders of 182 villages.  The survey identified grassroots peacebuilding activities &ndash; for example, rebuilding a school, de-mining public land, or re-paving a road &ndash; in the absence of the Colombian state or international intervention. \n\nUsing the database, I estimated several statistical models to test hypotheses about the relationship between the local conflict dynamics and the tendency for a community to organize and rebuild after the violence subsided.  Findings reveal a correlation between the level of control by an armed group and patterns of violence during a conflict, and a village\u00c6s propensity to rebuild once the conflict ended.  Villages where more than one armed group battled for control experienced more violence, higher levels of displacement, and a lower likelihood of community organization around peacebuilding.  Conversely, in areas where only one armed group was present, violence and displacement were lower and communities were more likely to engage in peacebuilding activities after the conflict subsided.\n\nResults from over 100 in-depth interviews with community members help to explain statistical correlations.  Interviewees explained that in areas where more than one armed group battled for territory, higher levels of violence had undermined trust between civilians and broken down social capital, while forced displacement fractured social networks.  This made it much more difficult for communities to organize around rebu..."
