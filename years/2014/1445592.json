This project is funded in response to a Dear Colleague Letter request for research in the Promoting Innovation in Measurement and Evaluation program focused on developing research and tools to advance the nation's capability to measure these indicators. The researchers in this project will address Indicator 1: Number of, and enrollment in, different types of STEM schools and programs in each district. STEM-focused schools are a rising phenomenon in education, and there are multiple variations in which such schools manifest. In addition, there are multiple types of STEM-focused programs whose distribution and opportunity for participation present serious equity issues for underrepresented minorities. \r\n\r\nResearch activities will be carried out in three phases. In phase one, the research team will review the literature to identify the ways in which STEM schools and programs are characterized and the tools and resources that have been developed by states and districts. The project will convene a set of working sessions with other researchers and important stakeholders to establish a set of operational definitions and a framework to inform the development of a set of indicators of STEM schools and programs. Finally, the project will convene a larger workshop to validate the framework and identify the next steps that will be needed for the development of measures.",

With this comes a need to develop shared language that will enable us to communicate with one another about what STEM schools and programs are. In addition to helping us collaborate and learn from one another, common language will enable us to better measure and monitor progress towards achieving desired outcomes and develop knowledge about what is working, for whom, and under what conditions.</p>\n<p>Following the publication of &ldquo;Successful K-12 STEM Education: Identifying Effective Approaches in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics,&rdquo; in 2011, Congress asked the National Science Foundation (NSF) &nbsp;to create ways to track progress toward the report recommendations. This led to a second report, &ldquo;Monitoring Progress Toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: A Nation Advancing?&rdquo; (NRC, 2013) in which the NRC identified 14 indicators of successful STEM education. In an effort to move towards such a system, NSF funded a number of groups to conduct exploratory work to lay the foundation for the development of indicator measures. This project addresses the first of those Indicators: <em><strong>Number of, and enrollment in, STEM-focused schools and programs in each district.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>The Project:</strong> We began with the three fundamental assertions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is not, nor should there be,      a single definition of a STEM school or program;</li>\n<li>All schools should offer quality      STEM education. Having this does not mean a school has a STEM program or      that it is a STEM school. STEM schools and programs have more; and</li>\n<li>A STEM school must      require&nbsp;all&nbsp;students to participate in its STEM components. If      it doesn&rsquo;t, it might possibly have a STEM program&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;a      school, but the school is not a STEM school.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Building from these, we created two &ldquo;taxonomies&rdquo;&mdash;one for STEM schools, and one for STEM programs. Our first step was to look at existing research literature as well as district-, state-, or network-level rubrics that describe STEM school characteristics. From this review, we derived a number of categories representing STEM school &ldquo;components&rdquo; that were common across the different sources. Using these categories, we created our criteria for distinguishing STEM schools from other schools and for differentiating different kinds of STEM schools from one another. Similarly, we created criteria for STEM programs as well as approaches for describing and differentiating STEM programs from one another.</p>\n<p>Once the taxonomies were drafted, we engaged in a process we refer to as &ldquo;groundtruthing,&rdquo; which entailed reaching out to STEM school stakeholders (i.e. STEM school leaders, district and state leaders, and researchers) to solicit comments and questions. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews over the course of several months and incorporated feedback from these interviews into each taxonomy revision. This process culminated with a day-long in-person Stakeholder Meeting to discuss the merits, issues, and uses of the taxonomies with STEM policy-makers, practitioners, and researchers.</p>\n<p>The main project outcome is a website: What is a STEM School?: A Resource for Identifying and Measuring STEM Schools and Programs. It shares the two &ldquo;taxonomies,&rdquo; and provides specific definitions for the taxonomy components. It also has an &ldquo;FAQ and Other Issues&rdquo; page that provides explanations of our thinking, answers frequently asked questions, and offers ideas for consideration.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The website and taxonomy provide a foundation for researchers to specifically and systematically identify the components of STEM schools and programs and the relationships those components have (individually or in combination) to desired outcomes. It aims to address a persistent problem in education research - lack of shared language and conceptual understanding. The products produced by this project provide clear descriptions of STEM school and program components that provide a sound foundation for future work developing measures of these components.&nbsp;Researchers can use the taxonomies to &ldquo;map&rdquo; their work, to find points of intersection with others, and to better accumulate knowledge across studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> School, district, and state leaders can use these resources to reflect on their own goals and progress, to articulate their specific criteria for STEM schools and programs, and to facilitate local conversations seeking to achieve consensus about STEM school and program design and associated outcomes. Those of us who work in the area of STEM schools know that they are wide ranging, with extremely varied goals. Some STEM schools selectively target students and seek to prepare them for elite careers in STEM fields. Other schools take an inclusive approach and focus on preparing students for a more general college experience or for STEM and STEM-related careers. This work will provide STEM schools with a way to identify where they reside in the highly varied STEM school field; the parts of their schools that distinguish them and their theory of action from others; and determine the extent to which each part of their strategy is successful.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/23/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeanne&nbsp;Century</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653524560_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.55.18PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653524560_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.55.18PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Home Page of Website\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653524560_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.55.18PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Home Page of Website\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">What is a STEM School: A Resource for Identifying and Measuring STEM Schools and Programs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Home Page of Website</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653617559_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.56.47PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653617559_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.56.47PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM School Taxonomy Web Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653617559_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.56.47PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM School Taxonomy Web Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM School Taxonomy Web Page</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM School Taxonomy Web Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653683011_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.56.31PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653683011_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.56.31PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Program Taxonomy Web Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653683011_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.56.31PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Program Taxonomy Web Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM Program Taxonomy Web Page</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM Program Taxonomy Web Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653970518_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.55.55PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653970518_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.55.55PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM School Taxonomy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1445592/1445592_10332144_1474653970518_ScreenShot2016-09-23at12.55.55PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM School Taxonomy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM School Taxonomy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeanne&nbsp;Century</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM School Taxonomy</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
