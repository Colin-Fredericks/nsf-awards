 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to identifying the attribution of East Asian (EA) precipitation changes to anthropogenic and natural drivers and the effects of climate variability on the ecosystem and water resources. The Tibetan Plateau is the source of major Asian river systems that support more than a billion people downstream. The results from this study will provide useful information for surface hydrology and agriculture, critical for a populous and economically vibrant part of the world. The tools for this EA study can be used for global and other regional studies and the state-of-the-art models developed in this project will be released to the research community. This project will also contribute to a number of educational outreach activities. \r\n\r\nA fully-coupled Atmospheric/Ocean GCM/biophysical and biogeochemical models/dynamic vegetation model to: examine the improvements in predictions of EA climate variability and change due to surface-induced forcings, including land use and land cover change (LULCC) and dust and black carbon effects and their two-way interactions in reference to predictions in which one or more of those processes and interactions are neglected; to evaluate and attribute the role played in the EA climate variability by these factors and mechanisms; to examine the effects of those processes on future projections of that regional climate; and to estimate uncertainty through a set of experiments. \r\n\r\nData from different sources, especially from observations in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), will be applied to evaluate model predictions. In addition, a regional climate model  with high resolution will be applied to assess the regional details of effects of surface-atmosphere interactions on the climate and ecosystem of EA, the TP in particular. Through the representation of key non-linear feedback processes in the EaSM, this project has the potential to substantially improve predictive capabilities and to further explain how different Earth processes and human activities have contributed to EA climate variability and changes over much of the last century.",

Since this year, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) has agreed to change the \"Land-Atmosphere interaction session\", which the PI had organized once every two years in the AMS Annual meeting since the year 2000, to \"Land-Atmosphere and Land-Ocean Interaction session\".\n\n \n\nThis project has also indicated the significant impact of spatial patterns of decadal temperature and precipitation variability and its intensity due to LULCC after we introduced a latest more realistic annual global LULCC map.  Our LULCC research based on 1950-2015 simulations show an overall land surface temperature increase by 0.47 K in the degraded regions and a decrease by 0.22 K outside the degraded regions.

Using an offline biophysical-dynamic vegetation model (SSiB4/TRIFFID), our study, for the first time, reveals that many parts of the world, before and after the 1980s, had different variabilities and trends.  While 12% and 19% of land has consistently positive leaf area index (LAI) and global primary productivity (GPP) trends since the 1950s, respectively; 17% and 20% of land, saw LAI and GPP trends, respectively, reverse during the 1980s.

The future projection for 2015-2050 have also suggested such trends will continue in the next a few decades (Liu and Xue, 2020, Scientific Reports).\n\n \n\n            The Tibetan Plateau has been considered to have significant impact on the Asian monsoon variability.  This project has successfully transferred the methodology and approach that had been developed for the North American study on the relation between spring surface and subsurface temperature anomalies (LST/SUBT) over the Rocky Mountains and the droughts/floods in downstream regions to the Tibetan Plateau and East Asian region and test it validity.  The results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau\u2019s spring LST effect is probably as important as sea surface temperature in producing East Asian summer drought/flood events (Xue et al., 2018, JGR).   Because of this work, GEWEX has supported a new initiative \"Impact of initialized land surface temperature and snowpack on subseasonal to seasonal prediction (LS4P)\".  About 50 institutions worldwide have participated in LS4P. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yongkang Xue"
