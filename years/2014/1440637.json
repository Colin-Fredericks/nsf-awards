 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data are now woven into every sector and function in our society. Texas State researchers are pioneering in solving some of the most pressing challenges using big data in the fields of Biochemistry, Biology, Geography, Computer Science, Finance and Economics, Mathematics, and Information Systems. Nonetheless, the current Texas State cyberinfrastructure and connectivity capacity present obstacles to the research projects involving big data and the collaborations among multiple institutions sharing massive amounts of data. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a high-speed campus network infrastructure to enable and improve data-driven research at Texas State. It enables immediate 10Gb capability and 100Gb in the future, and creates a Science DMZ on the campus network dedicated to research data to allow researchers to exchange large datasets with their peers over the network at a much faster speed. The infrastructure enhances and better facilitates big data research across a wide range of disciplines at Texas State with notable societal benefits, enables all other Texas State University System member institutions to establish similar environments to accommodate their research and education needs, advances the integration of research and education, promotes cross-institutional collaborations, and will significantly enhance the current big data research and teaching capabilities at Texas State and beyond.",
