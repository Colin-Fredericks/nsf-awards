 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is a critical linkage among many ecosystem services that sustain our society and life on Earth. It is the primary food source for microbes and the principal storehouse of water necessary for plant growth. SOM also stores nutrients for plants and absorbs pollutants that otherwise could contaminate food and water supplies. Soils also help regulate climate by storing carbon that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. This project investigates processes in the soil that protect SOM from being completely consumed by microbes and conversely, processes that could increase its sensitivity  to environmental changes.  The researchers will also study how climate change and changes in how land is managed affect the amount and stability of SOM. The project involves a large number of researchers and laboratories in conducting a wide range of SOM analyses. It takes advantage of soil samples already collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a major NSF investment in environmental monitoring that covers the entire United States. The samples will be preserved and the data that results from this project made fully public via the web.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of a new paradigm, where the primary controls on SOM dynamics are less dependent on molecular structure than on other soil and ecosystem properties, has created a knowledge gap in our ability to predict the response of SOM to environmental change. The relationships among shifting controls over different SOM stabilization mechanisms, ranging from distal factors operating at broad spatial scales (e.g., climate) to proximal controls operating at finer spatial scales (e.g., soil physicochemical properties), are poorly defined. Investigators will test the emerging paradigm by quantifying relationships between the dominant mechanisms of SOM stabilization and the scale of the ecosystem controls (i.e., fine-scale, proximal vs. broad-scale, distal) across a continental-scale system of soil types and ecological domains, utilizing soil samples collected during the construction of NEON. This project will be the first continental-scale assessment of SOM vulnerability and will yield new, predictive insights into controls on SOM stability across soil types, land-use types and environmental gradients. The results will significantly improve our understanding of SOM dynamics, a fundamental scientific advancement in its own right, while also enabling better representation of soils in ecosystem and coupled carbon-climate models. The project represents a new standard in open, community-oriented research, supporting participation by researchers from universities, government and non-government agencies. It will facilitate collaboration through major scientific networks that are increasingly necessary to conduct science at the scale needed to address the complex issues facing society. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in state-of-the-science methods of soil science by participating in this research, and insights derived from it will inform decisions by policymakers and resource managers concerned with carbon sequestration and ecosystem services.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe wanted to know what environmental factors, ranging from large-scale ecosystem properties like climate and vegetation to small-scale phenomena like the molecular composition of soil clays and organic matter, controlled the quantity, age, and vulnerability of soil carbon.  This is important because soil carbon is the largest actively cycled pool of carbon in the earth system and small changes in this pool can have significant impacts on our climate.  To develop this understanding, we collected soils from multiple depths across 40 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  We analyzed these soils and ecosystems for over 400 different properties with the goal of developing predictive relationships between the observable properties that exist today and how we might expect these carbon pools to respond to future environmental change.  One of our major findings was that the mechanisms that control carbon dynamics vary dramatically from one place to another, including between the surface and subsurface even within the same place.  Of course, this variability makes the prediction of future change very challenging.  To address this, we uncovered a meaningful way to subdivide the natural world that allowed for more successful predictions with each subsystem.  The two subsystems correspond to arid and humid climate regimes, and also relate to the predominant soil surface chemistry characteristic of these climates.  Some of our most exciting findings are that the climate sensitivity of soil carbon loss increases as you move further into arid environments (characterized by an abundance of calcium and magnesium) or further into humid environments (characterized by an abundance of iron and aluminum).  But, those systems that exist in the middle, seem less responsive to warmer or wetter conditions.  What was also interesting was that the arid systems seem to respond more significantly to changes in moisture and the humid systems seem to respond more significantly to warming.  These findings provide a framework that we can now use across the entire US to predict areas sensitive to carbon loss under potential future climate shifts.  In addition, these findings provide important perspectives on how we might be able to manage landscapes to sequester or preserve soil carbon.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian D Strahm"
