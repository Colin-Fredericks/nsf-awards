This will be achieved by improving weak gravitational lensing shape measurement algorithms and data calibration techniques.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, and sharing of lensing computer codes through the GalSim project.   The work will contribute to the future success of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).",
