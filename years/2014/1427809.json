 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric vehicles (EVs) require highly efficient electric drive systems that can minimize power loss and utilize renewable energy sources such as solar power. This presents important engineering challenges including design and development of converter systems, integration and implementation of electric motors, control systems, and chargers for storing the energy in battery storage systems. Furthermore, the thermal profile of the heat sources such as battery packs are critical to the efficiency of the overall EV system.  Implementation of the proposed project will enhance the development of highly efficient drive systems for the next generation electric vehicles that can use hybrid energy and solar power with an optimized thermal profile. The acquired equipment will be used to contribute to the realization of low cost energy efficient transportation vehicles across the nation. The simulation models that will be developed as part of this multidisciplinary research project will greatly facilitate the analysis and implementation of improved methods for development of components for electrical vehicles (EVs). The acquired equipment will facilitate teaching and learning in several electrical and mechanical engineering courses, and play an important role in fostering undergraduate and graduate research and enriching senior design projects.  The equipment also has the potential of being utilized for project-based courses to enhance learning and it should facilitate training of engineering students to help meet the demand for a skilled work force in Northeast Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project, we propose to develop high efficient drive systems for electrical hybrid vehicles that use solar power as a supplemental energy source instead of conventional electrical vehicle hybrid technology that uses fossil based sources with the acquired equipment. The instrumentation platform is chosen specifically to enhance the research activities currently conducted in the field of four quadrant converter topologies that can operate under dynamic load conditions with variable output current and voltage for regenerative operation. The acquired equipment will contribute to research efforts in advanced control systems for improved efficiency, and to investigation of thermal profiles of the physical models associated with heat transfer and thermodynamics of the heat sources such as lithium-ion and LiFePO4 battery packs in EVs. The project also aims to use existing knowledge and equipment to build the first prototype electrical hybrid vehicle and test it at Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW). Under this project, we propose to establish solar charge stations using fixed solar panels across the IPFW campus to charge our vehicles. These stations will be able to provide power back to the main power grid and contribute to energy demands of the university. The proposed project is important as it contributes significantly to the advancement of the technology for efficient electric drive systems using bi-directional dc-dc converters for next generation hybrid EVs which can operate on solar energy.",
