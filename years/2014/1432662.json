 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed support for an astronomy education partnership between Carthage College and the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), with the support of Dartmouth College and Rock Point School. The partners will deliver hands-on astronomy and nature education and outreach programs that engage the public, train mentors and docents, and provide experiential learning opportunities for high school and college students. Under the first two years of prior NSF NSF support, Carthage College and the AMC provided astronomy and nature education programming to nearly 3,000 participants in year 1, and 5,000 in year 2. The AMC hosts over 500,000 visitors annually, over half of whom are lower-to-middle-class in income, and approximately 20% are non-white. With renewed NSF funding, the partnership will expand training opportunities, and deliver their programming to an even wider audience.",
