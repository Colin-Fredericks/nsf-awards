 "awd_abstract_narration": "The WSSSPE 2 workshop is part of a community driven effort to address the many new challenges facing development, deployment and maintenance of reusable software for academic research and education. These challenges include the software development process, the support and maintenance of software, governance and business models particularly for sustainability, the role of software in building science communities, the need for software to lead to science which is verifiable and reproducible, policy issues such as how to measure software impact, choose licensing, or assign software credit, and the education and nurturing of early stage researchers in scientific software. \r\nThe workshop is building upon a successful WSSSPE 1 meeting at SC13 in Denver in November 2013; the organizers expect over 60 submitted papers and around 150 attendees at the WSSSPE 2 meeting that is anticipated to be held at SC14 in New Orleans in November 2014. As with WSSSPE 1, WSSSPE 2 will provide an open and dynamic forum for the community to discuss experiences and approaches in the areas listed above. This proposal requests funds to support attendance at WSSSPE 2 for US based researchers, particularly targeted at encouraging attendance by early stage researchers with attention to diversity.",
