 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of a low-cost and real-time heavy metal ion detection technology, derived from Water Equipment and Policy (WEP) I/UCRC expertise and discoveries in graphene-based water sensing.  The technology has the following market-valued features: rapid response and high sensitivity to heavy metal ions in water, and capable of inline continuous detection to provide early-warning for heavy metal contamination in public and private water supplies.  When compared to the leading competing methods, spectroscopic and electrochemical, in this market space, these features provide the following advantages: in-situ and real-time detection (an unmet need), low cost, and miniaturization.  The real-time electronic heavy metal ion detection technology is important because it enables the continuous water quality monitoring for heavy metal ion contamination, mitigates health risks, and ensures a clean and safe water supply. Students and postdoctoral fellows will gain entrepreneurial and technology translation experience through hands-on training on the sensor prototyping innovation platform and a number of existing entrepreneurship resources such as Student Startup Challenge and Design Entrepreneur Showcase programs.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  There is a strong need for accurate and accessible detection technologies to ensure continuous water quality control and early warning capabilities to avoid public safety catastrophes.  Current detection methods for aqueous heavy metal ions are often too expensive or unsuitable for in-situ and real-time detection. The proposed novel, inline micro-sized electronic sensor outperforms existing water testing methods and is simple to implement, eliminating many of the disadvantages associated with current practices.  The project aims to demonstrate fully-functioning prototypes of water meters, water purifiers, and handheld devices integrated with real-time sensors for heavy metal ions in water using a graphene-based platform. \r\n\r\nThe innovation ecosystem that will be created includes A. O. Smith, Badger Meter, and NanoAffix Science LLC.  These research partners and third-party investors will help integrate the new sensor into their existing products (water purifiers and water meters) and new handheld devices, and explore sensor manufacturing issues to bring the technology to the market place.  The potential economic impact is expected to be more commercial competitiveness, expanded market space, increased market share, more profits for partner companies, new job creation, and enhanced economic growth in the next three to five years.",

Many Americans are worried about the quality of drinking water at their homes, with good reason.  First, water can get contaminated with toxic heavy metals along the distribution line, despite water utilities? rigorous and regular monitoring of water quality at the water supply intake and the treatment plant.  Second, many pipes in U.S. water supply systems are near or even past their operational life, and replacing the aging water infrastructure would take years and cost trillions of dollars. If these pipes are not replaced in time, the public health may be jeopardized due to water contamination associated with aging distribution infrastructure. Third, water catastrophes have occurred, with some of them on a large scale.  For instance, the Flint Water Crisis, partly caused by the corrosion of aging, lead-containing water pipes, has resulted in severe health issues for ~8,000 children.  To safeguard water quality and public health, it is crucial to monitor toxic heavy metals and other water contaminants throughout the water supply system and particularly at the point of use.  Current quantitative detection methods for aqueous heavy metal ions are often laboratory-based and accurate down to parts per billion (ppb) levels.  However, these methods are costly and require days for sample analysis to be completed, making them unsuitable for regular on-site detection.  Qualitative detection methods are suitable for the field, relatively inexpensive, and quick, but they are unreliable and provide inadequate sensitivity. \n\n \n\nWe have developed a sensitive, selective, and cost-effective micro-sized sensor chip for quantitative, real-time, in situ detection of heavy metal ions in drinking water.  The sensor chip is built upon a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-gold nanoparticle (NP) sensing platform that can be used for detecting a wide range of analytes such as heavy metal ions, bacteria, and nutrients in water.  The sensor chip works as a field-effect transistor (FET) with rGO as the sensing channel.  The combination of unique electronic properties of rGO and its low cost makes this technology a truly transformative one for the water industry.  Target analytes can be detected by measuring the sensor resistance change, since rGO?s conductivity varies with the binding of analytes to the probes pre-anchored on the gold NPs.  Top highlights of our sensor are: (1) Fast &ndash; Rapid response for real-time monitoring (detection time in seconds); (2) Miniaturized &ndash; The micron-sized sensor can be integrated into existing water equipment; (3) Highly sensitive &ndash; Lower detection limit on the order of &micro;g/L or below; (4) Scalable &ndash; Fabrication can be scaled up with good reproducibility/high electrical stability; (5) Inline continuous detection &ndash; Sensors can be placed directly in the flowing water system; (6) Wireless communication compatible &ndash; Ready for integration with wireless communication.  This breakthrough technology allows for real-time detection of contaminants with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity in field settings for single point testing with a handheld device as well as for continuous monitoring through deployment in existing water equipment. \n\n \n\nA prototype of the handheld device, consisting of the sensor chip housed in a test cell and attached to a digital meter, showed promising performance for rapid and selective detection of lead ions in drinking water.  The breakthrough technology and prototype were recently featured by the NSF Science Nation Video (https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_nation/leadiondetector.jsp).  The device was able to measure lead well below the level required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the laboratory and in point-of-use field settings.

Overall, our novel, in-line micro-sized electronic sensor outperforms the existing water testing methods and is simple to implement, eliminating many disadvantages associated with current practices.  And we are ready to translate such a scientific discovery into the commercial reality through further R&amp;D efforts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Deyang Qu"
