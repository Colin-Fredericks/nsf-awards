 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade substantial advances have occurred in the area of statistical physics, both in the conceptual and analytical framework and its applications. The three-day workshop \"Statistical Mechanics Foundations of Complexity - Where Do We Stand?\" hosted by the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) on May 8-10, 2014 will bring together researchers from physics, computational science, biology, and network theory to discuss foundations, recent methodological developments and applications in the field of statistical physics. The aim is to bring together people with experience in a variety of novel mathematical methods with people with insights in specific complex systems. The central question of the workshop will be to critically assess the achieved theoretical progress, and to discuss the validity of the new technology in real-world applications of non-equilibrium physical, biological, etc. processes. The development of new statistical methods has an impact on problems including mathematical understanding of collective economic behavior, herding, opinion formation, financial markets, evolution, and the dynamics of innovation. The workshop is also an opportunity to encourage people outside physics to familiarize themselves with the new theoretical developments and potential applications. It will be an excellent educational opportunity for student and postdoctoral fellow participants to experience cross-disciplinary collaborations. The mixed composition of the participants will stimulate new research ideas.",

(See attached workshop agenda and participant list.)\n\nThematically the workshop centered around three mayor topics\n\nNew developments in the field of generalized statistical mechanics and its use for the understanding of complex systems. This included the newly introduced class of (c,d) entropies, superstatistics, large deviation theory.\nApplications of statistical mechanics tools and information theoretical approaches to understand biological, social and ecological data. Several attempts to bridge different notions of physics and IT have been made which helped to reduce misunderstandings between the disciplinary boundaries.\nNew developments in machine learning in both theory and applications. This section contained new ideas for uses of epsilon machines for new ways of the understanding the interface of information, and thermodynamics.\n\n\nFundamental questions on the applicability of generalized statistical mechanics to important model systems of complex systems. This included maybe first examples of real physical (superconducting) systems that could fully described by such a formalism.\n\nOne central set of questions discussed was which conditions have to be fulfilled to be able to talk about a true success of generalized statistical mechanics.  A subset of these fundamental questions - many related to the maximum entropy principle and its generalizations -  that were raised in this context, were summarized in the following way\n\nWhen does the dynamics of a system optimize entropy (or anything else)?\nDoes kinetics maximize entropy even out of equilibrium? \nDoes the system maximize entropy or do WE maximize it? \nIs maximum entropy the right prior for inference? \nIs maximum entropy restricted to asymptotic combinatorics, counting equally likely microstates? can we do without phase space volume and Liouville?\nHow can we avoid mistakes of the past such as uncritically claiming that self-organized criticality is behind every power law?\n\n\nThere was broad consensus that these questions need to be answered (maybe on a system-by-system basis) before a deep understanding of the applicability and usefulness of generalized statistical mechanics can be reached.\n\nOne recurrent topic of the workshop was the question to what extent generalized statistical mechanics can be considered as \"the\" theory behind specific models such as unimodal maps, the Hamiltonian mean-field model, the Kuramoto model, or Pasta-Ulam like models.

In other words, is the dynamics of the logistic map at ..."
