The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future. This fellowship to Emily A. Kane funds a research and training plan to address how interactions between swimming and feeding during prey capture in fishes affect the ability to survive in different environments, using guppies as the model organism.  The host institution for this fellowship is Colorado State University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Cameron Ghalambor. Educational activities include building upon an effort to supplement local northern Colorado elementary and middle school classes at schools primarily serving under-represented students with hands-on natural-selection experiments using guppies. The fellowship facilitates training in research techniques and approaches, communication, mentoring, and teaching.\r\n\r\nOrganisms survive by adapting as their environments change, but integration among traits means that changes in a trait can have consequences on organismal performance and survival across environments. Fishes are a model system for understanding interactions among performance traits, as there is likely a tradeoff between feeding and locomotor performance.  Suction as a mechanism for capturing prey is only effective over limited distances, thus necessitating integration of locomotion with feeding to position the predator accurately relative to the prey.  Functional tradeoffs between locomotion and feeding and the effects of performance integration on the ability to survive across environments with divergent selection regimes have not been directly tested.  Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are a model system for understanding adaptive evolution in natural populations.  A combination of descriptive studies of escape and feeding performance in wild individuals and experimental studies of hybrid survival in laboratory selection experiments are being used to test the trade-off and survival hypotheses.  The research is important for establishing the significance of performance integration in shaping ecological and evolutionary trajectories in organisms.",

For example, fishes have to swim using their tail and fins to approach a prey item, while also capturing it using their mouth and head. However, this ability could be compromised if an organism is faced with a new challenge that require adaptation of those parts. Differences in swimming and feeding across fishes demonstrates the ability to adapt one or both of systems to varying environments, but the results of these changes on the ability to integrate systems is unknown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My work used locally adapted populations of Trinidadian guppies to test how changes in locomotion and feeding affect the ability to integrate systems during prey capture. I hypothesized that populations would be alternately specialized for either feeding or escape from predators (locomotion), and that locomotor-specialized populations would be less integrated due to competing demands for swimming. To test this hypothesis, I filmed guppies from each type of population, from two replicate stream systems, as they captured live plankton prey. My results suggest that differences in specialization of feeding may be weak in guppies, despite differences in specialization of locomotion. But the suction behavior induced by the plankton prey is only one possible way for guppies to capture their prey, and other methods may show differences. However, the relationship between locomotor and feeding variables supports my hypothesis, and suggests that populations of guppies that are not exposed to predators repeatedly show tight integration during prey capture but that guppies with competing demands show weak integration. Interestingly, these results also suggest that guppies evolve integration as they invade predator-free environments, leading to new questions on whether this pattern of integration is learned or inherited, and what fitness advantages it might incur.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work will result in several peer-reviewed publications, one of which will include undergraduates as co-authors. This project has allowed me to mentor 5 undergraduates, and I have worked closely with a collaborative group including 6 graduate students and 3 faculty from diverse backgrounds including underrepresented groups. Not only have I expanded on my expertise in the area of evolutionary biology, but I have also helped others to learn about biomechanics. The work completed in this project is significant because it bridges several major disciplines, including functional morphology, biomechanics, ecology, and evolutionary biology, in a way that provides a more integrative understanding of both guppy biology as well as complex integrated phenotypes. This work establishes that functional integration of performance traits may be a novel mechanism of local adaptation to competing selective regimes, and advances the concept of organismal function into a more integrative and holistic approach. Further, this work establishes novel hypotheses of the mechanism and importance of integration to organisms. This innovative and transformative work has helped me reach my goal of obtaining a faculty position and overseeing my own research lab.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A primary outcome of this work is a project that extends the use of guppies into elementary and high school classrooms to aid in teaching the scientific method and evolution by natural selection. &ldquo;Guppy kits&rdquo; were developed in collaboration with the CSU Education and Outreach Center (EOC) that utilize live animals and an inquiry approach to engage students and overcome pre-conceived bias. These kits include materials necessary for observing differences in color pattern across populations, including recording and interpreting data. The activities are designed for students to discover the concepts of variation, inheritance, and selection, as well as how these processes interact over time. Through collaboration with the EOC, we have developed a program that can be utilized by teachers throughout Northern Colorado, at many grade levels, for an indefinite length of time.
