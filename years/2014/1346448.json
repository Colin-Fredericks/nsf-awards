 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate a student centered adaptive learning engine that is focused on improving learning outcomes using data collected from new and existing educational technology projects combined with advanced technology to automatically generate adaptive capabilities, thus creating ready-to-go intelligent tutoring systems.  Providing adaptive instruction to students has been shown to be an effective way to improve student performance, yet very little educational software takes advantage of adaptive instruction due to high cost of creating adaptive content. This data-driven engine will significantly reduce the cost of adaptive learning by creating new methods of deriving intelligent tutoring capabilities from collected student data. Unlike pure machine learning solutions, this engine will allow for human input to maximize improvements through refinement over time. By using large datasets previously collected from existing tutors, these objectives can be tested and validated. The combination of human input with machine learning has the potential to make important gains in understanding student modeling. Finally, the engine will include new visualizations providing researchers, developers, and educators the tools to explore student data in ways that will allow for new insights into how students learn.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of an adaptive learning engine includes the ability to connect to educational software providing a service to software companies thereby, improving and extending their new and/or existing software to adapt to individual students and maximize learning. Adding adaptive instruction to existing software has traditionally been difficult due to the high costs of creating adaptive instruction. This engine reduces the cost of offering adaptive instruction capabilities by providing connections to existing and new software. Existing software can add capabilities without complete redevelopment, creating whole new markets for existing educational software companies, while bringing intelligent tutors mainstream. The Engine will provide educators new tools to understand how students learn with software systems. Key software providers in the K-12, Higher Ed, and Corporate/Government educational markets will enhance the learning of their students while maintaining existing training and tutoring tools. Companies and organizations are looking for effective online teaching and training solutions that are flexible to meet varying learning needs and preferences of users to maximize learning efficiency. This engine will connect existing expertise and research with the innovative vision to expand the capabilities of intelligent tutoring systems to reach to a variety of markets using a human-centered, data-driven approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Overview\n\nTutorGen\u00c6s Student Centered Adaptive Learning Engine (SCALE) project centered around the development and validation of new machine learning techniques that automatically provide adaptive capabilities to any new or existing computer-based training product.  SCALE is a back-end software system that connects seamlessly to existing educational technologies and, by using the novel algorithms we have developed, transforms a static, one-size-fits-all system into an adaptive and intelligent tutor.  SCALE creates this adaptivity based directly on the recorded experiences and interactions of students who have previously used the software.  \n\nThe SCALE system provides a set of software tools that vastly decrease the high costs of developing true intelligent tutoring systems.  By providing adaptive capabilities automatically and in a cost-effective manner, SCALE enables more educational technologies to provide more personalized learning across a wider range of domains.  Adaptive, rather than static, instruction for students has been shown to be a highly effective way to improve student performance, as well as to deliver quality instruction in less time.  Yet currently very few developers take advantage of adaptive instruction, due to the historically high costs of creating adaptive content.  Our data-driven engine significantly reduces these costs, deriving intelligent tutoring capabilities from previously collected student data.  Further, unlike pure machine learning solutions, SCALE facilitates the contributions of human expertise, in both pedagogical and domain-specialized contexts, maximizing improvements and refinements over time.  The combination of human input with machine learning inherent in SCALE also has the potential to make important advances in our understanding of pedagogy and learner modeling. \n\nSCALE is not limited to a particular domain or market sector.  The SCALE engine can be connected to most edtech learning systems currently used in K-12 Education, Higher Education, and Corporate/Government Training.  Educational technology providers and content developers have significant investments in their current software.  SCALE allows this software to be reused without complete redevelopment, creating whole new markets for existing educational companies, and bringing intelligent tutors mainstream.  Companies and other organizations are constantly looking for teaching and training solutions that are flexible enough to meet varying learning needs and adapt to the preferences of users.  Thus SCALE will connect existing expertise and cutting-edge research with an innovative vision to expand the capabilities of intelligent tutoring systems, using our human-centered, data-driven approach. \n\nProject Outcomes Summary\n\nThe core technology of SCALE has been rigorously tested with data in academic settings from a variety of domains.  For this project, we conducted experiments that proved we could effectively create adaptive capabilities from data in multiple domains.  The technical techniques and algorithms tested in our experiments validate the ability of SCALE to automate adaptive capabilities by using data.  By performing knowledge tracing and building skill and learner models, SCALE can perform adaptive problem selection and track student knowledge.  With an extended implementation of the Hint Factory, SCALE provides just-in-time hints based on the best practices of successful students using the data already collected by the learning systems.  Further, we identified and designed visualization components for the product to assist the developers in validating the learning by students using their systems and the mapping of skills and knowledge components to problems.  SCALE also has designs for visualization components for teachers and administrators of SCALE-enabled educational systems to view learner progress and track student learning, both as a whole and individually.  These visualizations will provide researcher..."
