 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the large-impact natural hazards to affect humans on a decadal time scale are highly explosive Plinian volcanic eruptions, whose dynamics are thought to be intimately linked to the manner by which magmatic gases, such as water and carbon dioxide, escape from the erupting magma. Magma degassing begins with the nucleation of bubbles, which are preserved as vesicles in the erupted volcanic rock fragments. It is thought that the number and size of bubbles in a given volume of volcanic rock provide records of the forces that drive bubble nucleation and, by inference, the dynamics of the eruption. Specifically, the speed at which magma rises to the surface, thereby undergoing decompression, and the rate at which bubbles nucleate are thought to be correlated and affect the explosive intensity of an eruption. About one million bubbles may nucleate within a cubic millimeter of magma over fractions of a second to a few seconds. This transformation from dissolved gases to gaseous bubbles under high pressure is a key mechanism for explosive eruptions. Current models for the rate of bubble nucleation during explosive eruptions are based on Classical Nucleation Theory. A preliminary analysis of laboratory experiments of bubble nucleation in magmas, where conditions (pressure, rate of decompression, composition, content of dissolved gases, temperature) are well known and controlled, has shown that this classical theory fails to predict the rate at which bubbles nucleate across a wide range of conditions. A fundamental issue in this regard is the requirement for decompression rates that may be higher than physically attainable during an eruption, thus over-predicting rates of magma ascent.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to obtain a new formulation for the rate bubble nucleation, which will be applicable across a wide range of conditions of relevance to explosive volcanic eruptions. This will be accomplished through an integrated study that is comprised of laboratory experiments of bubble nucleation in silicate melts and detailed numerical modeling of these experiments. The result of this study, that is a new formulation for bubble nucleation in silicate melts, will be incorporated into numerical models of explosive volcanic eruptions, thereby enhancing their predictive capabilities. These models, in turn, will be used to resolve the question of what the precise relationship between magma decompression rate and the number of bubbles that nucleate within a given volume of magma is, thereby allowing a more robust integration of observationally based studies with quantitative predictions through numerical modeling and hazard assessment. Moreover, nucleation theory is of importance in a wide range of disciplines, such as for example chemical engineering and material science. Because this project will integrate recent advances in other fields where Classical Nucleation Theory has been found inadequate, it will advance the state-of-the-art and also have the potential to impact other disciplines.",

The most important of these processes is the degassing of magmatic volatiles, in particular water, which can be dissolved at significant concentration in the magma prior to eruption, because water solubility increases with pressure. Magma degassing is of importance for volcanic eruptions, in part because the low density of the supercritical aqueous fluid phase inside bubbles imparts buoyancy to the magma, and also because the fluid is highly compressible, thus bearing the potential to expand at high rates during magma ascent.

Bubble nucleation is the necessary first step during magma degassing and therefore of fundamental importance. The project has involved laboratory experiments wherein magma that was first saturated at magma-chamber equivalent pressures and temperatures. Upon decompression at know rates bubbles nucleate inside the experimental charge to produce a highly vesicular magma. Although the nucleation process is inaccessible to direct observation, due to the high pressures and temperatures, upon quenching of the sample the resultant vesicular glass can be analyzed under optical and scanning electron microscopes, or through advanced cat-scan techniques.

It has thus provided new insights into magma degassing during volcanic eruptions. For example, it was discovered that in some experiments bubbles nucleated at relatively constant rates for the entire duration of the experiment, whereas in other experiments nucleation peaked sharply and almost all bubbles nucleated within fractions of a second. It is hypothesized that continuous nucleation may play a role during effusive volcanic eruptions, whereas the latter is expected to occur during intense explosive eruptions.</span></p>\n<p><span>The project has also advanced our knowledge about the process by water may escape from the erupting magma, which has the potential to modulate the eruption itself by reducing gas pressure and magma porosity. The aforementioned experiments also yielded data on the coalescence of bubbles, which takes place during and after bubble nucleation, as magma pressure decreases during eruptive ascent toward the Earth's surface. As a consequence of bubble coalescence a network of interconnected bubbles forms within the highly viscous magma, which renders the magma permeable and allows the gas inside bubbles to flow through the magma. These coalescence data were augmented by laboratory experiments wherein pumice collected from a relatively recent volcanic eruption in northern California was heated to magmatic temperatures and deformed, forcing the air inside bubbles to flow out of the sample, thereby reducing porosity. Sample permeability, the parameter that quantifies the ease with which pore fluid flows through a porous material, was measured before and after sample deformation. These data, in combination with data from the bubble nucleation experiments and additional data from natural samples, provides new constraints on the conditions that govern the escape of magmatic gases during volcanic eruptions. These, in turn, can be used to improve numerical models, and thus advance predictive capabilities of numerical simulations.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/03/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Helge&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gonnermann</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1348072/1348072_10294029_1522790320673_Figure_6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1348072/1348072_10294029_1522790320673_Figure_6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Compaction of Plinian pumice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1348072/1348072_10294029_1522790320673_Figure_6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Compaction of Plinian pumice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Laboratory experiments of compaction of pumice samples.
