 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrestrially-derived dust is an important source of the micronutrient iron (Fe) to nutrient-depleted regions of the oceans.  The Fe from aeolian inputs is predominantly in the form of ferric oxyhydroxide which because of its strong affinity for phosphorus (P) have significant amounts of this nutrient associated with it.  Together these nutrients can impact primary production.  \r\n\r\nOnce dust is introduced to sunlit surface waters, the ferric oxyhydroxide particles are subject to photoreductive dissolution which enhances bioavailable Fe but the impact of this process on the associated P is unknown.  Researchers at the University of Hawaii plan to carry out a series of laboratory experiments using synthetic ferric oxyhydroxides and natural dust samples to determine the fate of P associated with these particles once they are photochemically reduced.  Results from this study will establish whether Fe-rich dust is a source to the existing bioavailable pool of P or a sink due to removal via sorptive scavenging as a consequence of repetitive photochemical dissolution/re-precipitation cycles of ferric oxyhydroxides in the marine environment.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Besides providing new insights on the phosphorus cycle, this research would support and train one graduate student of Hawaiian descent.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project was to assess the impact of photoreductive dissolution of ferric iron oxyhydroxides (Feox) on bioavailable pools of dissolved Iron (Fe) and Phosphorus (P) in the surface ocean through laboratory experiments on synthetically-prepared Feox and natural dust samples.  The significance of this work lies in characterizing a process by which essential nutrients (Fe and P) may be supplied to photosynthetic primary producers (phytoplankton) in regions that are severly impoverished in nutrients, the oligotrophic oceanic gyre regions.  Phytoplankton are microscopic floating plants that form the base of the marine food web, and the rate at which phytoplankton biomass production occurs thus controls the rate and extent of carbon uptake from the dissolved state into solid phase organic matter.  Transport of particulate organic matter to the deep ocean after phytoplankton death represents a carbon sink from the surface ocean-atmosphere system, and is thus of significance for questions of Carbon cycling, Atmospheric CO2levels, and thus Climate, owing to the fact that atmospheric CO2acts as a greenhouse gas, and contributes to global warming.  \n\n \n\nThe only significant source of external Fe and P to the oligotrophic oceans, the oceanic regions most distal from the continents, is wind-borne dust.  Any process which converts mineral associated Fe and P in dust to dissolved forms of Fe and P will contribute bioavailable (dissolved) Fe and P to surface waters, and thus stimulate more primary production. Photoreduction is the process by which sunlight stimulates reduction of Fe from the oxidized, ferric (Fe3+) to the reduced, ferrous (Fe2+) valance.  While ferric-Fe is insoluble, ferrous-Fe is soluble. Thus, photoreduction of the Fe(3+) in iron minerals in dust will contribute bioavailable Fe to oceanic surface waters.  As the dust particles originate from terrestrial soils, these Fe-phases have associated with them P in the form of adsorbed or co-precipitated P.  Thus, photoreductive dissolution of Fe-phases in dust may contribute bioavailable P, as well as Fe, to surface waters.  As primary production in the oligotrophic regions of the oceans tends to be limited by Fe and P, this process could be an important mechanism for enhancing supply of bioavailable Fe and P to these systems.  \n\n \n\nIn order to ascertain the rate and quantity of Fe and P that may be released to seawater from dust associated Fe-minerals via the photoreduction process, experiments on synthetic Fe minerals, analogues to those associated with naturally-occurring dust, were performed using a solar simulator to supply light of intensity and spectral characteristics that mimic natural sunlight.  Use of laboratory synthesized Fe-minerals in filtered seawater positions us to conduct experiments under controlled conditions, and to examine the relative differences in susceptability to photoreduction of different, commonly occuring Fe-minerals.  The most reactive of these minerals is ferrihydrite, an amorphous ferric iron oxyhydroxide.  Ferrihydrite was used with all initial experiments.  Subsequent experiments using different Fe-minerals that are common in soils (goethite, lepidocrocite, akaganeite, hematite), will be assessed in future work.  Initial trial experiments were also completed with ferrihydrite to which phosphate had been adsorbed, to test the fate of minieral-associated P during photoreductive dissolution of the Fe-mineral substrate.\n\n \n\nOne of the biggest challenges we faced in this work was to reduce Fe contamination of experimental solutions so that we could (a) detect changes in dissolved Fe above baseline, and (b) reduce noise in the Fe-data that resulted from random Fe-contamination, so that we could identify statistically significant trends.  In order to address (a), numerous experiments were conducted to test different contamination sources.  One source of Fe-contamination originated in the reagents used, and so trials were conducted to assess the minimum quantity of reagents necessary to promote photoreduction, and to analyze the experimental solutions post-photoreduction.  Results of this work not only provided insight into contaminiation sources, which permitted adjustment of protocols to minimize contamination, but also served to remove random variations that previously had prevented attainment of high-precision data. Once final experimental and analytical conditions were determined, high-quality data were generated.  The criteria used to affirm the high quality of the data were (i) reproducible standard curves for ferrous- and total-Fe dissolved in experimental solutions, with acceptably low blanks; (ii) results of photoreduction experiments in which Fe concentrations in samples exposed to light could be confidently distinguished from dark controls; and (iii) experimental results in which concentrations Fe2+ could be separately, precisely, and reproducibly quantified, in addition to total-Fe concentrations (Fe3+ can then be calculated by difference). Successful achievement of both of these types of results are shown graphically in the attached figures.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathleen C Ruttenberg"
