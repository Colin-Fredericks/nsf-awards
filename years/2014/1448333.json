 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Micron Automata Processor is a reconfigurable non-Von Neumann co-processor which can be used to simultaneously execute multiple Non-deterministic Finite Automata over one or more input data streams. The technology supports an algorithmic model and a programming abstraction that is radically different from any processor or co-processor that is in existence today. The goal of this exploratory project is to conduct early-concept research on the Automata Processor so that the research community has access to techniques and tools for utilizing the technology. \r\nThe project is developing algorithmic building blocks, programming techniques, and libraries for enabling researchers and developers to take advantage of this new architectural paradigm, and designing automata-based algorithms to solve path problems in graphs as a step towards exploring general purpose use of this architecture. The project will lead to fundamental research on how to solve problems using a new computational model. Research results will be shared through publications and release of automata libraries, to enable rapid adoption of this new technology by the computing community.",
