 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to data from 2008, nearly 5 million Americans age 50 or older suffer from moderate to severe dry eye syndrome (DES). Symptoms include discomfort and reduced visual function. The dynamics of the tear film is thought to be critical in the development of DES; rapid evaporation and/or insufficient tears are thought to cause chronic irritation leading to DES. Both of these mechanisms can lead to elevated saltiness (osmolarity), which is believed to be a key variable in understanding the irritation to the eye surface. The results from this project will yield quantitative insight into tear film flows and osmolarity dynamics that may impact how ocular scientists interpret their data.  The team, which is based at the University of Delaware and the Rochester Institute of Technology, will work closely with leading optometrists to achieve this goal. The investigators will train mathematical scientists with advanced knowledge of and experience with physical and biomedical modeling, advanced computation, and physiological application. These trainees include five undergraduate and two graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow. All trainees will participate extensively in dissemination of results to the applied mathematical and biomedical communities, via publication and travel to scientific meetings. New information discovered as part of the activity will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate training through lectures, discussion in group seminars at the participating universities, and future research projects.\r\n\r\nInvestigators based at the University of Delaware and the Rochester Institute of Technology will collaborate to study the dynamics of the tear film on the human eye in an effort to understand its function and to help clarify causes and consequences of dry eye syndrome (DES). The results will help explain and visualize the complex tear motion during blinking and to quantify the variability of critical quantities such as tear saltiness (osmolarity). To do so, new tear film models consisting of nonlinear coupled high-order partial differential equations on moving, two-dimensional eye-shaped domains will be formulated using a variety of methods from applied mathematics and mechanics. The team will then develop two new computational techniques to solve the models.  Current tear film models will be advanced by incorporating increasingly challenging effects of evaporation and lipid layer motion on complex moving domains. The project will draw upon the thin liquid film literature and from close consultation with experimental optometrists to make informed decisions about mathematical modeling, comparison with in vivo experimental data, and sensible interpretation of the results.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences is co-funded by the Fluid Dynamics Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe tear film is a multilayer film that covers the ocular surface and plays an important role in the health and function of the eye.  The blink facilitates the constant refreshing of the tear film.  Any disturbance in the blink can result in a breakdown of tear stability, optical clarity, and visual function causing a possible loss of homeostasis of the tear film and the onset of dry eye, a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface.\n\nIn this work, a hierarchy of mathematical models and a computational tool were created to study the influence of the blink on the tear film stability.  These tools have the advantage of probing aspects of the tear film dynamics not yet explored or measured in vivo with experimental instrumentation.  The work focused on exploring the influence of (i) the presence of a lipid reservoir at the lids, (ii) the aqueous tear film surface velocity, and (iii) spatial and temporal distributions of aqueous tear supply on the tear film dynamics during a realistic blink.  \n\nIn the first class of models, a more sophisticated, coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations were analyzed.  The system of equations described the evolution of the thickness, the pressure, and the lipid concentration of the tear film along a single line running down the center of the exposed eye from the upper lid to the lower lid. The influence of potential lipid reservoirs at the lid margins on the tear film formation was explored.  In the second class, a less sophisticated, coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations were studied.  The system characterized the evolution of the thickness and the pressure of the tear film on a two-dimensional realistic blinking eye-shaped domain.  The dependence of tear influxes on the stability of tear film was studied.  \n\nThere were numerical challenges in approximating the evolution of the tear film on a two-dimensional realistic blinking domain.  To overcome these challenges, a computational tool was developed in a framework called Overture.  A moving overset grid method was implemented to approximate the solution of the system of partial differential equations.  The time-dependent domain, mimicking a realistic blink, was described by a time-dependent Fourier series fit to the lid margin in a series of images capturing a partial blink.   The eye-shape domain was discretized by overset grids, where a boundary-fitted grid captured the moving lids, and this grid overlapped with a stationary background Cartesian grid.  The system of equations was approximated using a curvilinear finite-difference based method of lines approach where time was integrated by backward differentiation formulas.  \n\nWith the first class of models, the influence of the lipid reservoir on the deposited tear film during the upstroke was studied.  Experimental evidence suggests the existence of a lipid reservoir at the upper and lower lids, and it is unclear the role the lipid reservoir plays in the tear formation during a blink.  Different levels of lipid reservoir responsiveness were probed.  As the lipid reservoir became more responsive, the advection of the lipid concentration changed from the surface velocity carrying the lipid concentration into the upper half of the exposed eye surface to a very localized region of a non-zero surface velocity confined to the upper meniscus region where the lipid concentration was locally advected at the speed of the upper lid. The tear formation was found to be more stable with an unresponsive lipid reservoir as the tear film was less susceptible to rupture.  \n\nWith the second class of models and the newly developed computational framework, the influence of the location of influxes of the aqueous tear fluid, and the influence of the aqueous surface velocity on the tear film formation during a realistic blink were studied.  Experimentally, it is challenging to observe and measure the tear film dynamics near the lid margins as the upstroke is completed in approximately 0.2 seconds and the eyelids can obstruct the view.  Through a series of simulations, the lipid layer (and thus surface velocity) was found to be important in tear film deposition without rupture.  As the lipid layer became less active, larger tear fluid influxes at the boundary were required to establish a stable tear film. This dependence of the surface velocity on the tear film formation was consistent with the lipid reservoir study.  A stable tear film for a given lipid layer behavior was only found when the tear influxes during the upstroke were proportional to the lid motion.  This suggests the tear fluid under the lids plays an important role in the tear formation.\n\nTwo Master's students and one undergraduate student supported the research efforts and were trained in the areas of mathematical modeling and scientific computing. Through outreach events, hundreds of K-12 students were exposed to the connection between mathematical modeling and scientific discovery through this work.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kara Maki"
