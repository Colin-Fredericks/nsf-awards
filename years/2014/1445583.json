 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on indicators outlined in the National Research Council report Monitoring Progress Toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: Indicator 4, regarding instructional materials that embody the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM), and Indicator 5, classroom coverage of content and practices as specified in the CCSSM. This project seeks to clarify these ideas and develop mechanisms to measure both the alignment of instructional materials and classroom instruction with key elements of the CCSSM. The project will accomplish its work through three types of activities: 1) meetings convened with STEM educators to work towards developing a consensus around the identification of appropriate concepts and their operational definitions; 2) a thorough review, evaluation, and synthesis of the current evidence base for such indicators; and 3) the drafting of specific recommendations towards the implementation of the measurement of such indicators. This project builds on and extends the knowledge and expertise gained from previous NSF-funded projects including the Survey of Mathematics and Science Opportunities (SMSO) that resulted in the indicators and instrumentation used in the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Promoting Rigorous Outcomes in Mathematics/Science Education (PROMSE) MSP.\r\n\r\nRecent work has highlighted ambiguity in teachers' understandings of the CCSSM mathematics practices along with some differences in interpretation among mathematics educators. Effort is needed to secure greater consensus on these fundamental definitions before reasonable operational definitions for any indicator may be developed. The discourse methodology developed in the SMSO work in which informed experts wrestle together with appropriate data to develop consensus will be employed in multiple meetings with appropriate mathematics educators to make progress towards these important fundamental and operational definitions. Similar meetings to review and evaluate the current database on instructional materials (textbooks) and teachers' classroom practices will be held in order to move towards a synthesis of the data and a consensus around which indicators may be developed. Finally, based on these two efforts, experts in indicator measurement and development will be brought together with mathematics educators to draft recommendations towards the creation and feasible measurement of such indicators.",
