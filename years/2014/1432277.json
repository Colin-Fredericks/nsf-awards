 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was chartered in 1990 to test the effects of increased temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth, species composition and ecosystem function.  Since 2007, the ITEX-Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) has continued and expanded on the ITEX program across a latitudinal transect of five sites in Alaska and Greenland, collecting core ITEX data specifically designed to address the current needs outlined in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Implementation Report.  The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland.  Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.  Data from this project are freely available on the ACADIS website.  The project will continue extensive outreach activities established in the initial phase, including strong relationships between the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (FTBG) and the GVSU Regional Math and Science Center and school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids, and El Paso.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis 13-month renewal maintained the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the International Tundra Experiment Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) in Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska.  The core datasets include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots and repeat measurements of the vegetation plots on the 1 km2 ARCSS grids.  Linked to these data sets are mobile sensor platform imagery and vegetation surface properties that provide high-frequency, low-effort automated measures.  Frequent medium-scale aerial imagery by kite aerial photography (KAP) are also available throughout the growing season and provide the opportunity to scale the manual and automated measurements to the regional level.  These data are being used to document and understand the impacts of changing tundra vegetation on the interactions between the land and the atmosphere for the Arctic and the Global System, including carbon and water fluxes and energy balance.\n\nHigher latitudes have experienced significant climate change over the past three decades with no area changing faster than the Arctic.  The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was chartered in 1990 to test the effects of increased temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth, species composition and ecosystem function.  The ITEX network has provided tremendous value for detecting changes in these factors in response to experimental warming and to background changes across a range of sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  The sites in Barrow and Atqasuk began in 1994 and are ideally suited to document long term change.  In order to apply the manual measurements to ecosystem properties and scale them to a larger spatial area, automated mobile sensor platforms for detection of a suite of vegetation surface properties were implemented to provide near-daily frequency of measurements and capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation driven by the short growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements.  The medium-scale KAP imagery allows us to scale up to the km2 level and generate estimates of surface properties, including digital elevation models.  Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points toward the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years.  Only now are samples sizes approaching levels sufficient to enable evaluation of long-term trends and comprehensive analysis of carry-over effects.\n\nThe GVSU (Grand Valley State University) component of this project provided training for 4 master?s students and 4 undergrad students.  Data from this project are freely available on the Arctic Data Center website.  The expandability of the sensor platforms also allows for the placement of new sensors by interested parties.  The data, spectra, and imagery gathered from this project not only have value for ongoing research but will provide a baseline for future work not currently envisioned.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert D Hollister"
