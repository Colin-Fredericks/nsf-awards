 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant is to uncover physical mechanisms governing the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials for hierarchical structures where struts and joints are complex. Nanoporous metals can be thought of as a three-dimensional interconnected network of struts and joints with typical size in the range 10-100 nm. These materials possess high surface-to-volume ratios, electrical conductivity, catalytic activity, and strength. They have shown great promise in many applications, for example as high-performance catalysts or electrodes for fuel cells and batteries. The ability to design nanoporous metals with enhanced mechanical properties is crucial for all applications, yet fundamental understanding of how their internal structure influences macroscopic properties is still lacking, especially for hierarchical structures where struts and joints are themselves complex (e.g. are nanocrystalline). This project aims to uncover physical mechanisms governing the mechanical properties of such structures. This will be achieved through a comprehensive experimental campaign utilizing in-situ deformation experiments across different scales. The effects of the nanoporous metal geometrical structure will be investigated with the aid of analytical and numerical models, as well as by conducting experiments on scaled-up structures.\r\n\r\nThe project will generate crucial insights into the deformation mechanisms governing mechanical properties of hierarchical nanoporous metals, thus providing a basic scientific knowledge necessary for controlling and optimizing their properties and bringing closer wider adaptation of this class of materials. Research activities are closely integrated with education and outreach efforts: both graduate and undergraduate students will work on the project, thus gaining cutting-edge skills and expertise in nanotechnology and science; the PI will work with high school teachers and students in the Atlanta area through Georgia Intern Fellowship for Teachers program and through Georgia Tech's Women in Engineering summer camps; some of the results will be introduced in engineering courses at Georgia Tech as case studies; the PI will participate in Tech to Teaching program that inspires students to choose a teaching career.",
