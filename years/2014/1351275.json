 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to investigate the fundamental effect of bone microstructural components on its machining responses. In particular, the research will test the hypothesis that age/bone-type related variations seen in the microstructural components of bone have an influence on its critical machining responses such as surface integrity, cutting forces, tool-wear and chip morphology. The experimental studies will be aimed at linking the properties of bone microstructural phases to its machining responses. The microstructure-based finite element modeling study will be aimed at identifying age/bone-type-specific failure mechanisms encountered during machining. The educational objective of this CAREER award is to recruit, educate and develop the next generation of manufacturing professionals in the upstate New York region. The educational thrust areas include: 1) Developing a Lego-based, hands-on module to expose 6th-12th graders to micro-manufacturing technologies; 2) Developing an advanced manufacturing curriculum that promotes manufacturing education and careers to high-school girls; and 3) Enhancing the manufacturing education efforts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\r\n\r\nThe research findings will have implications for surgical procedures involving any form of bone machining. In particular, for total joint replacement surgeries the findings are likely to reduce patient recovery times and the probability of revision surgeries, both of which currently place a heavy economic burden on the healthcare system in the United States. This research will also result in product innovations in the multi-billion dollar market pertaining to bone surgery instrumentation and surgeon training platforms. The educational activities are geared towards addressing the current human resource crisis facing the nation in the area of advanced manufacturing. The educational module and curriculum being developed for the 6th-12th grade students, especially high school girls, has the potential to funnel K-12 students to manufacturing-related educational fields and careers.",
