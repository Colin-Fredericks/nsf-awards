This planning project will adapt a structured computing curriculum to be integrated into the K-5 core curriculum in 14 diverse elementary schools and measure the effect of the interventions on achievement in literacy, mathematics and science. The planning project will develop plans for gathering longitudinal data as students matriculate to middle school.",
