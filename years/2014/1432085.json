 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry courses are critical junctures and often are points of attrition in the academic pursuits for many undergraduate STEM majors.  Research and development of pedagogical reforms and instructional interventions that improve student learning and success in these courses can contribute to increasing the number of STEM graduates in fields important to the economic health and security of the nation.  This project will build upon prior work that has demonstrated success by utilizing Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) in General Chemistry I and will develop, implement and evaluate a reform pedagogy for instruction in General Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry I that blends PLTL with a so-called \"flipped\" classroom structure.  In a flipped classroom arrangement, lecture content is provided via relatively brief online videos that students watch outside of class.  The time made available during class by diminishing the time devoted to lecturing can be used for implementing active learning activities such as small group problem-solving and PLTL.  As General Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry I enroll large numbers of students at the University of South Florida, research outcomes from this project will be of value to inform similar endeavors at other institutions that also offer undergraduate STEM courses with large enrollments.\r\n\r\nThe chief elements of this project entail the development of the blended pedagogical approach, creation of video lectures, training of peer leaders and faculty professional development.  As this project will extend work begun in General Chemistry I to the subsequent courses of General Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry I, the investigators will study the impact of the reform pedagogy on persistence in a disciplinary course sequence, on transferrable skills between courses, and ultimately on degree attainment in STEM disciplines. Research on the effectiveness of the intervention will involve comparisons of students in classes in which the novel pedagogical strategy has been implemented and those students in classes receiving instruction without the reform pedagogy.  Specific instruments and data sources that will be utilized to measure project outcomes include administering standardized final examinations from the American Chemical Society Examinations Institute in General Chemistry II and Organic Chemistry I, conducting student interviews to elicit their approaches to problem-solving and institutional records of student performance in the targeted courses and graduation rates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has resulted in the design, implementation, evaluation and dissemination of a novel teaching approach designed for large classes (over one hundred students) that are common in first-year science courses at universities.  The approach combined peer-led team learning and the flipped class approach to replace lecture-time with active learning where students engage in problem solving related to the course content.  Peer leaders, students who previously successfully completed the targeted course, were recruited and trained to support the active learning component in the classes.  Peer leaders were tasked with serving as a resource for students who were struggling, challenging successful students and providing timely feedback for all students.  The use of multiple peer leaders in each class enabled a workable student to peer leader ratio resulting in a teaching approach that can be scaled to large class sizes.  To ensure content coverage was maintained, a series of more than forty instructional videos, averaging five and a half minutes each, were created.  Each week, videos relevant to the current content were posted online with brief quizzes implemented to promote students viewing the videos.\n\nThe evaluation of the instructional approach compared classes with this approach to classes that enacted lecture-based instruction, each with class sizes over 200 students. Both approaches took common tests at a common time and it was found that classes with the active instructional approach outperformed the lecture-based approach consistently across every test with differences ranging from one-third to one-half of a standard deviation.  These findings indicate that the active learning approach promoted student learning while maintaining content coverage as shown by the common tests, within a large class environment.\n\nThe instructional approach has been implemented in fourteen classes of second semester general chemistry across seven semesters with current plans to maintain the approach in coming semesters.  Combined over 3,500 general chemistry students have experienced the instructional approach and over 150 students were trained as peer leaders receiving leadership and instructional experience.  Dissemination of this project includes a publication that details the implementation and evaluation of the instructional approach.  Following this publication, five workshops were conducted that provided hands-on experience in enacting the active learning approach.  These workshops were attended by a total of 79 college faculty members from 14 different institutions.  Additional products that resulted from this work include publications on novel research projects on the experiences of students who enter general chemistry with lower scores on math aptitude tests, the role of affect in student success in general chemistry and organic chemistry and a meta-analysis examining the research literature on active learning practices in chemistry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott E Lewis"
