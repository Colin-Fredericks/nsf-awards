The workshop is part of a program on Information Theory which will take place from January 13 to May 15, 2015. The intellectual roots of the workshop include deep results in algebra and combinatorics that yield efficient codes, new paradigms for securely storing, distributing, sharing and compressing data in distributed systems, and technological considerations related to mobile devices, deep space probes and low power computing.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will enhance communication among the mathematics, computer science and engineering communities. It will be open to all potential participants and the workshop findings (including videotapes of presentations) will be distributed to the public for comments and engagement. We will support students to attend the workshop, and will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to contribute to a wide range of application",
