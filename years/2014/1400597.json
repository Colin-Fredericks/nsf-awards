 "awd_abstract_narration": "SAGE (Sustainable Agriculture and Green Energy) is a two-year Advanced Technology Education project that is laying the foundation for focused rural technician education and training in sustainability fields that include agriculture and renewable energy/energy efficiency  under an umbrella of sustainable green education.  Greenfield Community College (GCC) is innovating in technical education for rural students in the Western Massachusetts region through enhanced curriculum and infrastructure that support its Farm and Food Systems (FFS) and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency (RE/EE) degree option programs. These enhancements, along with the many existing relationships between GCC and regional agricultural and energy employers, are serving as a fulcrum for improving technical education and for solidifying sustainability career pathways.  SAGE is serving as the foundation for bridging the traditional separation of vocational training and academic learning in STEM-based sustainability education.  A new 4-credit Greenhouse Management course and curricular revisions across STEM course offerings are impacting students in both the Farm and Food Systems (FFS) and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency (RE/EE) degree options. New curricula feature hands-on learning opportunities utilizing innovative infrastructure, including Greenhouse External and Internal Solar Thermal Collection Units, Permaculture Rainwater Harvesting System, and a standalone 500W Photovoltaic System.  A robust internship experience links GCC students with regional employers in agriculture and renewable energy/energy efficiency for workplace-based skill attainment that lead to employment opportunities. Ongoing engagement with secondary and four-year institutions through 2 + 2 + 2 articulations is helping to improve student preparation in the technical education pipeline.",
