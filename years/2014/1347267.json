 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site is housed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Venture Mentoring Service (VMS). MIT has a track record of transitioning activities from research laboratories into inventions and discoveries with broad economic and societal impact. This new NSF I-Corps Site at the MIT VMS will build upon existing resources and expertise to increase the successful transition of university research to commercialization and diffusion. This project enables VMS to reach and influence more researchers, and underrepresented participants in particular, from across the MIT campus to explore getting their inventions and discoveries to the marketplace. VMS is expanding its existing entrepreneurial and education services to increase support specifically for early stage research-based ideas including: customer exploration, development and validation as well as understanding the stakeholders, relationships and dynamics in the targeted marketplaces. VMS employs a Team Mentoring approach that may potentially be transformative by increasing the rates of learning and progress of Sites team participants. \r\n\r\nMIT's activities are likely to have broad impact including: encouraging entrepreneurial aspirations and providing researchers with training and activities to understand the entrepreneurial process allowing them to greatly increase their future prospects while still within the academic environment; attracting and supporting a greater number of students, faculty and other researchers to actively explore the possibilities of translating their research into future commercial applications, ensuring the supply needed to fuel the continuous flow of innovations needed by society;  and, encouraging more women and other underrepresented participants to become engaged and reach successful outcomes,  serving as visible role models to accelerate the participation of others. Finally, through its existing and active Outreach Program, MIT VMS will disseminate both the knowledge and practical techniques to its large and growing network of universities that have launched mentoring programs based upon the VMS model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nProject Outcomes\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was awarded an NSF I-Corps Site grant in June 2014.  The MIT I-Corps Site was housed in the Office of the Provost, enabling access to all schools, departments and centers at the Institute.  The major goals of this project were:\n\nTo accelerate the translation of new technologies, products and processes emerging from MIT research activities to the marketplace.\nTo train and support MIT researchers (including faculty, postdocs, and PhD students) as they explore the commercialization potential of their research-derived technologies.\nPrepare local MIT I-Corps Site teams for participation in the NSF I-Corps Teams program.\nTo enable MIT researchers to continue to accelerate their progress toward commercialization by successfully engaging with additional resources such as other accelerator programs, funding sources, entrepreneurship competitions, and SBIR programs.\nTo encourage greater interaction and increased collaboration between MIT researchers and industry.\nTo add to the local entrepreneurial ecosystem, to strengthen the innovation capacity of MIT and to contribute to the NSF's National Innovation Network.\n\n\nThe MIT I-Corps Site developed both a short 3-week long cohort-based training program as well as one for independent study with a flexible timeline.  Both followed the same curriculum derived from the NSF National I-Corps Teams program and were designed to ensure teams qualified for application to the T-Corps Teams program.  Over 30 individuals are involved as instructors for these Site programs. More than half of the MIT I-Corps instructors are women or underrepresented minorities and about 30% of the participants can be identified as part of an underrepresented group. The MIT Site went from an in-person training model to all-virtual in March of 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.   \n\nSince its inception, 521 teams have participated in the MIT I-Corps Site program. Of these, over 60 teams have completed, or been accepted into, the national I-Corps Teams program.  More than 90 companies have been formed, over 30 of them have received SBIR or STTR awards and at least 20 young companies have reached initial commercialization.  The 90 startup companies have raised over $360 million in early stage investment, grants and awards and have created over 380 new jobs.\n\nThis $360 million will be spent primarily locally and will have direct economic impact. This will include payment of rent, purchase of equipment and supplies, professional services, and other economic relationships within their communities. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe broader impacts of the training and ongoing support provided by the MIT I-Corps Site in this project include broadening participation in innovation and entrepreneurship, creating new pathways and opportunities for researchers to translate technological discoveries from the lab to practical use, and the creation of new companies that strengthen our country's technological and economic base while promising to improve societal well-being. The outcomes are more than just about creating startups. I-Corps is also about learning new skills that aid in professional and career growth within academia as well as in industry.\n\nThe $360 million raised by the new ventures will be spent primarily locally and will have direct economic impact. This will include payment of rent, purchase of equipment and supplies, professional services, and other economic relationships within their communities. In particular, these companies have created over 380 new jobs that did not exist before.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roman Lubynsky"
