The project studies the role of the growth conditions, lattice strains, annealing, oxygen stoichiometry, and impurities on the physical and multiferroic properties of polycrystalline and epitaxial RFe2O4 thin films deposited by a reactive electron-beam deposition method. The principal investigator and undergraduate students at Buffalo State College investigate the optical and dielectric properties, spin-charge-lattice couplings, and structure-property relationship in the RFe2O4 thin films using optical and dielectric spectroscopy. The objective is to offer new insight into the magnetoelectric coupling of RFe2O4. In particular, the research focuses on improving the quality of thin films and understanding the role of lattice strains and external stimuli on the physical properties of multiferroic thin films. The results will be important to advancing the multiferroic thin film research. The project supports 6 to 9 summer research students with a substantial fraction of students coming from underrepresented minorities and women. The research provides the students with a valuable research experience and will also prepare them for jobs and the graduate studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this NSF RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) project, we investigated the RFe2O4 (R = Y, Yb, Ho, and Lu) and RFeO3 (R = Yb, Ho, and Lu) oxide families, which belongs to a new class of materials having both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. The principal investigator and undergraduate students synthesized the compounds and deposited thin films onto single crystal substrates using Electron-Beam Deposition and Magnetron Sputtering techniques. We have developed the appropriate growth conditions to deposit good quality RFe2O4 and RFeO3 thin films. To get insight into the ferroelectric and magnetic properties of the system, we investigated RFe2O4 and RFeO3 thin films by various experimental methods, such as x-ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy, dielectric spectroscopy, electrical transport measurements, and vibrating sample magnetometry. \n\nOur research reveals that these oxides display a wide range of interesting physical properties. The optical spectra of these compounds display an insulating character with the electronic structures dominated by Fe2+ d to d on-site excitations below 2.5 eV and oxygen to iron and rare-earth ions charge-transfer excitations above 3.5 eV. The temperature dependence of the electronic excitations of YbFe2O4 and LuFe2O4 thin films show an anomaly at ~190 K, possibly due to a structural distortion. In addition, we have discovered the electric-field-induced changes in the optical properties, also known as electro-optical effects, of the RFe2O4 thin films in the photon energy range of 1-3 eV, with YbFe2O4 showing the strongest effects up to 14 %. In addition to thin films, we also investigated polycrystals of LuFe2O4 and YbFe2O4. We measured the negative magnetoresistance effects up to 6% in 8 Tesla fields in the ferrimagnetic state of the compounds and such magnetoresistance effects in the RFe2O4 family have not been reported in the literature.
