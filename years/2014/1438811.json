The conference will be held October 23-25, 2014 on the campus of the Mississippi State University. The website for this conference is http://www.ccs.msstate.edu/deconf/de2014.\r\n \r\nThe conference is a collaborative endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), a High Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPCC) member center, at Mississippi State University. The majority of the grant funds will be used to provide travel support to graduate students and recent doctoral recipients. The conference will provide these future research leaders an opportunity to present their work, to meet and collaborate with other researchers, educators, and practitioners, and to learn about recent developments in this interdisciplinary field.",
