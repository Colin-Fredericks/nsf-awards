 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational data science is at a turning point in its history. Never before has there been such a challenge to meet the growing demands of digital computing, to fund infrastructure and attract diverse, trained personnel to the field. The methods and technologies that define this evolving field are central to modern science. In fact, advanced methods of computational and data-enabled discovery have become so pervasive that they are referred to as paradigm shifts in the conduct of science. A goal of this Project is to increase digital science literacy and raise awareness about the Centrality of Advanced Digitally ENabled Science (CADENS) in the discovery process. Digitally enabled scientific investigations often result in a treasure trove of data used for analysis. This project leverages these valuable resources to generate insightful visualizations that provide the core of a series of science education outreach programs targeted to the broad public, educational and professional communities. From the deep well of discoveries generated at the frontiers of advanced digitally enabled scientific investigation, this project will produce and disseminate a body of data visualizations and scalable media products that demonstrate advanced scientific methods. In the process, these outreach programs will give audiences a whole new look at the world around them. The project calls for the production and evaluation of two principal initiatives. The first initiative, HR (high-resolution) Science, centers on the production and distribution of three ultra-high-resolution digital films to be premiered at giant screen full-dome theaters; these programs will be scaled for wide distribution to smaller theaters and include supplemental educator guides. The second initiative, Virtual Universe, includes a series of nine high-definition (HD) documentary programs. Both initiatives will produce and feature data visualizations and the CADENS narratives to support an integrated set of digital media products. The packaged outreach programs will be promoted and made available to millions through established global distribution channels. Expanding access to data visualization is an essential component of the Project. Through a call for participation (CFP), the Project provides new opportunities for researchers to work with the project team and technical staff for the purpose of creating and broadly distributing large-scale data visualizations in various formats and resolutions. The project will feature these compelling, informative visualizations in the outreach programs described above. A Science Advisory Committee will participate in the CFP science selections and advise the Project team. The project calls for an independent Program Evaluation and Assessment Plan (PEAP) to iteratively review visualizations and the outreach programs that will target broad, diverse audiences. \r\n\r\nThe project launches an expansive outreach effort to increase digital science literacy and to convey forefront scientific research while expanding researchers access to data visualization. The project leverages and integrates disparate visualization efforts to create a new optimized large-scale workflow for high-resolution museum displays and broad public venues. The PEAP evaluations will measure progress toward project goals and will reveal new information about visualization's effectiveness to move a field forward and to develop effective outreach models. The project specifically targets broad audiences in places where they seek high-quality encounters with science: at museums, universities, K-16 schools, and the web. This distribution effort includes creating and widely disseminating the project outreach programs and supplemental educator guides. The project visualizations, program components, HD documentaries, educational and evaluation materials will be promoted, distributed and made freely available for academic, educational and promotional use. Dissemination strategies include proactively distributing to rural portable theaters, 4K television, professional associations, educators, decision-makers, and conferences. To help address the critical challenge of attracting women and underrepresented minorities to STEM fields, the Project will support a Broadening Participation in Visualization workshop and will leverage successful XSEDE/Blue Waters mechanisms to recruit under-represented faculty and students at minority-serving and majority-serving institutions and to disseminate the Project programs and materials among diverse institutions and communities.",

The CADENS team collaborated with a variety of science teams to analyze data and render production-quality, time-evolving high-resolution data visualizations. These are key to help audiences understand computational modelling across a variety of science domains, from astrophysics to biophysics. CADENS external evaluators performed formative and summative studies to inform creators of the giant screen documentaries to be screened in fulldome Museums and Science Centers around the world<em>. &nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.spitzcreativemedia.com/shows/solar-superstorms/\"><em>Solar Superstorms</em></a> narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch and <a href=\"https://www.spitzcreativemedia.com/shows/birth-of-planet-earth/\"><em>Birth of Planet Earth</em></a> narrated by Richard Dormer, are available in multiple languages including French, Czech, Mandarin, and Japanese. These award-winning fulldome versions, written for general audiences, include supplemental teacher guides, and are re-formatted to play at smaller venues such as University and College theaters. Derivative flat screen 4K documentaries play internationally on broadcast and streaming television. This expands the reach of these fulldome documentaries. Science topics include earth science, space weather, photosynthesis, cosmology, atmospheric science, and more. The second CADENS initiative produced five flat screen 4K documentaries specifically created for adult audiences in a longer format with an expanded level of technical information.</p>\n<p>The award-winning <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Beginning-Time-Thomas-Lucas/dp/B072NZ8WBF\"><em>Seeing the Beginning of Time</em></a><em>, </em>a 54 min documentary, has been subtitled in multiple languages, focuses on the use of supercomputing and computational science in astronomical studies, telescopes, and survey science.&nbsp; CADENS <a href=\"https://sc17.supercomputing.org/program/scientific-visualization-showcase/\">award-winning scientific visualizations</a> support this documentary. CADENS collaborators generated <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/assets/img/CurriculumSBTLessonsHS-MidSchool.pdf\">new curriculum for teacher middle-high schools</a>.

This 44 minute documentary, is available on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SuperTornado-Anatomy-Megadisaster-Thomas-Lucas/dp/B01GUE7ZVG/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475862545&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=supertornado\">Amazon Prime</a> and freely distributed on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bom7UlgW40Q\">YouTube</a>. CADENS developed visualizations of the thunderstorms, tornadoes and data visualizations of the tornadic disaster in Joplin, Missouri. CADENS has supplemented the above long-format titles with short-form <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/vis/cadens/making_of\">Making of, behind-the-scenes mini-featurettes</a>. CADENS interviewed collaborating scientists who shared personal as well as technical perspectives; and discussed CADENS data visualizations. The \"Making Of\" supplemental featurettes are qualitatively different from the fulldome or broadcast documentaries and have become popular supportive educational material.</p>\n<p>Another important primary goal of CADENS is to develop customized, insightful, and time-evolving visualizations in collaboration with scientists, professional writers, producers, and evaluators for integration within the documentaries. In 2014-16, the CADENS team conducted two broad calls for participation to scientists to participate in the CADENS project and expanded opportunities for scientists to gain access to visualization. As these data visualizations were developed, they affected script content. CADENS developed over 27 high-resolution and fulldome data visualizations featured in a series of fulldome, derivative flat screen documentaries, mini-featurettes, and educational materials. These CADENS visualizations are streamed and available for download at the CADENS website and <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/vis/cadens\">are free for academic use</a>. Six still frames from documentaries are shown here as attachments to this Project Outcomes Report.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the period of this Project, CADENS strategized and partnered with professional producers and distributors to leverage CADENS NSF funding and enable greater production value by external investment. This strategy has expanded reach to global audiences and quality of products. These professional partnerships provided investments in celebrity narrators, original music, and other professional resources. CADENS supported development of developing data visualizations and software, external evaluations, two Broadening Participation in Visualization workshops and audience testing. CADENS efforts in tandem with professional partner investments have been integral to the success of these award-winning documentaries and data visualizations.</p>\n<p>CADENS has been extraordinarily successful in reaching millions of people around the world with fulldome and other documentaries of science. Indicators of this success have been the widespread viewing and adoption of these shows and associated videos. External evaluators discovered in testing selected fulldome show attendees that general audiences increased their understanding of computational and domain science.&nbsp;The typical lifespan of successful fulldome documentary is a decade due, in part, to repeat family viewings. CADENS recognition, adoption, and awards indicate a long life for these fulldome documentaries. The CADENS <a href=\"http://avl.ncsa.illinois.edu/\">Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL)</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/\">National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</a> has benefited from collaborating with scientists, external evaluators, professional partners, NSF and members of the distinguished Science Advisory Committee on this effort to raise awareness of computational science and to help broadly increase digital literacy across diverse audiences.

CADENS efforts in tandem with professional partner investments have been integral to the success of these award-winning documentaries and data visualizations.\n\nCADENS has been extraordinarily successful in reaching millions of people around the world with fulldome and other documentaries of science. Indicators of this success have been the widespread viewing and adoption of these shows and associated videos. External evaluators discovered in testing selected fulldome show attendees that general audiences increased their understanding of computational and domain science. The typical lifespan of successful fulldome documentary is a decade due, in part, to repeat family viewings. CADENS recognition, adoption, and awards indicate a long life for these fulldome documentaries. The CADENS Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL) at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) has benefited from collaborating with scientists, external evaluators, professional partners, NSF and members of the distinguished Science Advisory Committee on this effort to raise awareness of computational science and to help broadly increase digital literacy across diverse audiences. Through publications, conference presentations, websites and continued visualization efforts, AVL is sharing valuable lessons-learned and applying this knowledge to on-going scientific visualization research and documentary projects.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donna J Cox"
