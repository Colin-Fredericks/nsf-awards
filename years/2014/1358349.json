The problems in this area are of interdisciplinary nature, spanning engineering and biology.  Understanding the effect of mechanical inputs to biological systems has significant ramifications in several areas of biomedical science and engineering, including, but not limited to, cell biology, cellular and tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.  The 2014 Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference will catalyze developments in this field by bringing together leading academics with interests in experimental and theoretical aspects of multi-scale mechanobiology, and by enabling and encouraging the exchange of ideas and interactions among young and established investigators and among scientists with complementary interests and expertise.",

Our expanding understanding of the role that mechanical perturbations play in every aspect of life, from morphogenesis to chromatin remodeling, motivated the mission of this conference. We planned a conference integrating both engineers and biologists to encourage sharing of ideas toward these common goals, and the conference addressed the key problem of understanding how mechanical perturbations translate to changes in cellular activity, from the organismal to nuclear level. \n\nIntellectual Merit: This conference fulfilled its mission of executing the second ever CMBE Conference, and presented a 4-day conference with sessions focused on the theme of Multi-Scale Mechanobiology.  This meeting brought together the best thinkers in the field of CMBE to discuss these topics, and fostered much discussion and debate.  This funding also allowed for 19 trainees and/or young investigators to attend the meeting through travel awards and rising star designations.  \n\nBroader Impacts: This conference drew in 140 attendees (up from 120 in 2014), including 11 funded students/postdocs, 8 Rising Stars, and 5 Keynote Speakers.   Importantly, ~70% were first time attendees, and 76% were BMES members, demonstrating the important role that BMES is playing supporting attendance at this conference.  Furthermore, 92% of attendees indicated that their expectations had been met and 96% said that that they would recommend the CMBE meeting to colleagues. The awarded NSF funds were used to support travel awards for the 8 Rising Star investigators and 11 students and trainees as well as 2 of the Keynote speakers. \n\nGraduate students/postdoctoral fellows who were selected by the organizing committee to receive Student/Fellow Awards presented short talks that were integrated into the general sessions. In addition, the junior independent investigators who were selected as \u00e6Rising Stars\u00c6 presented their work during a special session that took place on the first day of the meeting in order to showcase their work. The Rising Star session was followed by a \u00e6Lunches with Leaders\u00c6 where recipients of both award types had an informal lunch established invited speakers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Mauck"
