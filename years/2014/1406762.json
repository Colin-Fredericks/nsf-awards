 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many genes control organismal traits and these genes interact in complex ways. This project focuses on two types of gene interactions - physical and epistatic (gene-by-gene) - and how their contribution shapes biological diversity. First, genes are physically located along chromosomes so that the action of genetic recombination, mutation and selection on a focal gene affects expressed variation at nearby genes. Second, genes may interact with one another through common genetic pathways. We will evolve experimental populations of yeast in the laboratory under different environmental conditions, and then genetically sequence the populations to test a prevailing model of genetic evolution. We will also use computer simulation models of evolving genetic networks to identify how epistatic interactions affect adaptation to changing environmental pressures. Lastly, we will examine the joint effect of these two types of interactions on genetic diversity in the experimental yeast system.\r\n\r\nThis research will train a graduate student in genomics and experimental evolution, with mentorship toward a research career. Furthermore, we will create an educational webpage available to the public, aimed at high school biology students, that will interactively show how the complex interaction of various genetic and environmental processes shape biological diversity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we investigated the role of genetic interactions in evolutionary adaptation from two perspectives.  First, genes exist not as isolated entities, but rather linked together on chromosomes.  As a result, natural selection acting on one gene can have strong effects on others in the chromosomal neighborhood, which can have profound consequences for the patterns of genetic variation and evolution.  We focused on the case of two populations evolving in different environments, thus facing divergent selection pressures, but exchanging migrants between them.  A common prediction in this case is that the chromosomal neighborhoods around genes under selection will show higher levels of genetic differentiation between the two populations, a pattern called a \"genomic island of divergence.\"  We developed an experimental system using laboratory populations of yeast in which we could control the factors of selection, migration, population size, and rate of sexual reproduction in a replicated experimental design, and apply next-generation DNA sequencing to study the resulting genetic patterns.  We confirmed that genomic islands of divergence can form under experimental conditions, and that as expected they depend on other factors like rate of migration between populations.  Surprisingly, we found a high level of stochasticity -- random variation in the patterns of genetic differences between populations -- in the cases when sexual reproduction took place, compared to solely asexual populations.  Our results highlight the importance of migration and sexual reproduction for creating new combinations of genetic variants, and the complex consequences of this genetic re-sorting for adaptation to environmental conditions.\n\nSecond, we examined another type of interaction between genes -- the regulation of gene expression, or the amount of protein that is produced.  We built a simple network model of gene regulation, with just two genes, each of which may be influenced by the other.  We used simulation modeling to study the effect of this simple regulatory network on adaptation and found several surprising results.  First, we discovered a tortoise-hare pattern in which some populations exhibited an initial jump toward a selective optimum but then stalled, while other populations marched more slowly but steadily toward the optimum, eventually outperforming the others.  This pattern resulted from the different types of mutations that can occur in the simple network model, and the consequences of these mutations for future adaptation.  Second, we found that even with two populations evolving under identical conditions, populations can randomly end up on different adaptive paths that result in reproductive isolation between populations.  Thus even simple genetic networks may play a key role in the process of speciation.\n\nThis project provided mentorship and training to a graduate student, who successfully defended his Ph.D. during the course of the grant and has moved on to a postdoctoral research position.
