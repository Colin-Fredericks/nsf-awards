 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award support a workshop on Computational Challenges in Future Mobile Health (mHealth) Systems and Applications.  Recent advances in mobile technology have opened up enormous opportunities for scientific advances and new tools that may improve patients' health and well-being. mHealth technologies offer real-time monitoring and detection of changes in health status, support the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, provide rapid diagnosis of health conditions, and facilitate the implementation of interventions ranging from promoting patient self-care to providing remote healthcare services. To realize the potential of mHealth, however, significant innovations in computing are needed. These innovations, however, must be closely integrated and informed by close collaboration with health researchers for them to contribute to improving human health. Due to the rich and unique challenges inherent in mHealth, there is an opportunity to advance computing methods in the process of advancing mHealth. A systematic discussion is needed among mHealth thought leaders to outline a grand vision for computing research in mHealth and identify the major hurdles and opportunities for advancing mHealth.  The content of workshop presentations, speeches, and discussions will be made available on the web so they may be shared freely, with the expectation that the use of these materials in published work will credit the original author/source. It is anticipated that, by providing a forum that facilitates crosstalk among thought leaders from the range of stakeholders interested in mHealth, a signature contribution towards NSF?s interests in this broader scientific agenda will be made.",
