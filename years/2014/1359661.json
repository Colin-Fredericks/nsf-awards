 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prehistoric empires in common with multiple countries in the world today face the problem of how to integrate \"outlying\" communities often of varying ethnicity into a functioning effective social system. From the reverse perspective \"outlying\" communities can function most successfully if they can determine how best to take advantage of their incorporation into a broader social system. Archaeological research has the potential to examine such interactions over extended periods of time and such is the goal of this research project. Under the guidance of  Dr. Marc Bermann, Francisco Garrido will explore two factors underlying the success of the ancient Inca empire: its imperial infrastructure (the famous road system), and its impact at household and local levels in subject territories.  Taking a \"bottom up\" perspective on the effects of Inca conquest on mining in the Atacama desert of Chile, the research will investigate localized responses to articulation with the imperial system. This research will address this topic through investigation of the relationship between the Inca Road, and a recently discovered, non-Inca, mining camp, isolated in the Atacama Desert. Preliminary research suggests that this camp could not have existed without use of the nearby Inca road, leading to two, inter-related, research objectives: (1) evaluating the extent to which the Inca Road functioned as an unrecognized growth factor, stimulating local craft industry; and (2) assessing whether the Inca Road served as a linear entrepot or exchange nexus, rather than simply as a highway servicing Inca imperial needs. A one-year project of survey, surface collection, and excavation will document: the nature of mining at Chinchilla and the use of a nearby section of the Inca Road. In the past, just as today, a major road can serve as an powerful economic stimulus or magnet, making possible economic enterprises along it that were not feasible previously.  \r\n\r\nBy connecting local Atacama populations to a much wider socioeconomic world, the research will be addressing issues of \"globalization,\" albeit, using this prehistoric case study.  One area of investigation is to document how people chose to use a new and foreign infrastructure (even one that represented imperial hegemony) to their own ends.  Part-time, supplemental, or seasonal mining as a small scale kin-based activity with low capital investment is still common in many parts of the world today, including South America, and its organization and goals can be very similar to prehispanic examples.  A better understanding of the history and dynamics of small scale mining in the Atacama remains relevant today, where there is still a juxtaposition of large, profit-driven, multinational mining operations and community based, risk minimizing, community-level mining.  The theoretical issues addressed in this research thus parallel contemporary issues discussed in Chile today about mining and household and community autonomy, resource access and utilization, and economic coping strategies.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include documenting understudied components of the archaeological heritage in the Atacama Desert - increasingly a tourist destination.  Chilean students from several universities will participate in the fieldwork, and receive training in current survey and excavation techniques.  Collections will be stored at the Regional Museum of Atacama, and available, with complete documentation, to other students and scholars.  An important component of the research will be working with existing museum collections and with unpublished reports, bringing data from these hidden sources to public light.  The project will result in Mr. Garrido's dissertation, and the findings will be disseminated through the Center for Comparative Archaeology electronic data base, conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe Inca Road was the largest infrastructure component of the Inca Empire of the prehispanic Andes.  Until now, scholars have understood and depicted the Road as used exclusively by the Inca state in furthering its political and economic aims.  However, the discovery of a non-Inca mining occupation not far from a stretch of the Road deep in the Atacama desert, suggested an alternative; that the Road may have been used extensively by local peoples, and even stimulated roadside economic activity.  Building from comparative study of imperial and colonial road systems, this archaeological research tested the Atacama findings against two models for the Inca Road as: (1) an imperial turnpike used for point-to-point movement for state purposes and minimal contact with local populations; versus (2) a linear \"entrepot,\" stimulating local people to set up economic activities based on the traffic and logistical advantages of the road.\n\nThis year-long survey and excavation project explored the relationships (chronological, functional, and social) among the Chinchilla mining sites (4 - 8 km from the road) and sites directly alongside an adjacent section of the Road itself (including an Inca style tambo or official waystation).  The local Chinchilla mining occupation consisted of a system of small, somewhat specialized, occupations where households engaged in low technology craft production of copper ore beads, iron oxide red pigment, shell items and stone tools.  Nearly two dozen of these sites were discovered and investigated.  This craft production had begun prior to the Inca Conquest of the Atacama area, but increased and re-organized with the establishment of the nearby Road.  Changes included establishing larger mining camps in closer proximity to the road.  Survey and surface collections investigated 14 sites directly along the road, revealing a significant amount of \"non-Inca\" occupation. Products of this craft production were found at multiple points along the road.  The tambo was not one of the major points where these finished goods entered the Road, indicating a separation of the local economic activity from official, Inca state functions.  While the Inca Road no doubt functioned as part of Inca imperial infrastructure, the project findings support a local use, \"entrepot\" construct for the Inca Road.\n\nThe coexistence of the both uses of the road, for Inca state rule and to facilitate local craft production, highlights the complexity of relationships between the Inca empire and local groups in marginal territories, where tolerance of local activities may have been a less costly way to avoid conflict and promote cooperation.  More broadly, beyond adding to our knowledge of Inca hegemony, the results of the research aids in understanding the unplanned consequences of imperial domination. \n\nThe digital data sets of this research, including maps and collection units, will be posted online in the website of the Center for Comparative Archaeology, from the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/20/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc P Bermann"
