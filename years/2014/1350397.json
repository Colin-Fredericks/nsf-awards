 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award aims to further our understanding of quantum information theory and quantum communication. All of the work proposed is theoretical in nature, but some of the threads are practical and may find future application in quantum communication systems. At the same time, there is a strong educational component to this award in line with the vision of the PI to establish Louisiana State University as a leading center for quantum information research and study.\r\n\r\nThis award first seeks to sharpen our understanding of the limitations on communication using quantum-mechanical systems as the carriers of information. The PI will do so by proving so-called \"strong converse\" theorems for various communication capacities of quantum channels. The quantum information community now understands the communication capacities of several channels well, but what is lacking in some cases is a strong converse theorem. These theorems are conceptually rich, and they also find application in proving the security of particular models of cryptography. The PI will also investigate areas such as lossy quantum data compression theory and quantum communication over networked systems. Both topics are foundational in the subject and will likely underly future quantum technologies. The important theoretical questions in these respective fields are still left unanswered and the research conducted on behalf of this award will offer several ways of addressing them. The PI also will consider new exciting communication capacity questions to consider, such as the \"locking capacity\" of a quantum channel for sending data securely. The PI also seeks to improve the understanding of the practically relevant class of optical communication channels, which underly free-space or fiber-optic communication technologies.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this award is in line with the NSF Mission \"to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes.\" Indeed, research at the intersection of physics, information theory, computer science, and mathematics has advanced science in remarkable ways, pushing the limits of what is possible experimentally and what is possible in principle. Research in quantum communication is critical to national defense as well, given the important application of quantum secured communication. The PI will be advising and teaching several graduate students in the quantum science and technologies group at Louisiana State University.",
