 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for several international activities directed by the International Council for Science that are closely aligned with the strategic goals of the US Global Change Research Program (USCCSP) and with several NSF programs on Global Change Research.  This award will help support US leadership in international science activities and to enable collaborations that are mutually beneficial for US science and international partners in areas of global strategic importance.  These activities will principally focus on two global environmental research activities Future Earth and Integrated Research on Disaster Risk.  Future Earth is a ten year research program to provide the knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change and for supporting transformation towards global sustainability in the coming decades. It has developed out of the current ICSU-sponsored Global EnvironmentalChange (GEC) programs following a series of reviews and foresight exercises.  Integrated Research on Disaster Risk is a ten-year global undertaking that seeks to address the challenges caused by natural hazard events, mitigate their impacts, and improve related policy-making mechanisms.",
