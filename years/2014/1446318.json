Attending will be faculty instructors and administrators from an equal number of 2-year and 4-year HSI institutions.  The focus is on successful approaches that have worked for Hispanic students.  The conference is covering emerging topics of particular interest to HSIs, including data about outcomes of new approaches that is being disseminated for the first time.  The workshop will focus in particular on around high-context educational activities (e.g. internships, co-ops, and research experiences with faculty members as mentors) that students from Hispanic origins find particularly empowering and motivating.",
