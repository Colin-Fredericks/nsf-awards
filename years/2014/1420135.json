 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forensic DNA testing has freed hundreds of innocent people in the U.S. and approximately 75% of these convictions involved mistaken eyewitness identification. The need to identify reliable ways to sort between accurate and mistaken identifications is readily apparent. Theory and data from laboratory-simulation experiments indicate that accurate and mistaken identifications differ in measurable ways (e.g., identification speed, confidence, witness verbalizations). Lab research also shows that lineup biases (e.g., innocent suspect stands out or administrator unintentionally steers the witness) can inflate mistaken identifications. Lab simulation participants, however, know that the crime is not real and fail to capture potentially important dynamics of actual witnesses (e.g., fear, justice motivations, concern for consequences). \r\n\r\nThe researchers have unique materials from actual cases involving 855 photo-lineups where only one person in each lineup was a suspect. The other lineup members were known-innocent fillers. Filler identifications, which constitute mistaken identifications, comprise 34% of all identifications. Software provided by the researchers made audio recordings of witnesses' verbalizations, speed of identifications, and other relevant information for each lineup. A majority of the lineups were administered double-blind; thus, lineup administrators were unaware of which was the suspect's photo and hence could not steer the witness. Four studies were conducted. Study 1 tests whether lineup bias predicts mistaken identifications. Study 2 tests whether witness verbalizations predict mistakes. Study 3 tests whether mistakes are slower and made with less certainty than suspect identifications. Study 4 tests whether double-blind lineup procedures evidence less steering by the lineup administrators. Data analyses involve hierarchical, mixed model log-linear analyses or ANOVAs. This work can help translate lab simulation findings to actual cases and thereby help the justice system sort between mistaken and accurate identifications. Results will be shared broadly with scientists, police and prosecutors. Undergraduate students, including first-generation and those of color at a small undergraduate college, will receive research training in this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe identification of criminal perpetrators by eyewitnesses is a staple form of evidence in courts of law.  Scientific psychology?s understanding of eyewitness identification accuracy is based almost exclusively on controlled laboratory studies that simulate eyewitness experiences. Although lab studies are powerful for isolating and controlling variables, they are limited in their ability to capture the dynamics of actual cases with real eyewitnesses.  In striking contrast to the vast published lab literature, there are a mere 11 published studies of police identification lineup performance by actual eyewitnesses to crimes. The data from one of these studies (Wells, Steblay, &amp; Dysart, 2015) offers a rare opportunity to examine the identification decisions of real eyewitnesses from properly-conducted police lineup procedures.   These data are the centerpiece of the current research project.\n\nThe objective was to test hypotheses derived from lab studies, now using materials and data from real eyewitnesses and lineups. The findings address the relevance of lab findings to field lineups.  \n\nStudy 1 evaluated the fairness of lineup structure (whether the suspect stood out from the fillers) and examined the association between lineup structure and eyewitness decisions for 190 real lineups.  The mock-witness procedure used has been commonly employed to evaluate lineup fairness. Lab participants are given the description of the perpetrator provided by the real eyewitness and are then asked to speculate about which lineup member is the suspect. These mock-witnesses (who did not see the crime) should not be able to select the police suspect at a rate greater than chance (1 in 6 for a fair lineup of six members).  The proportion of mock-witnesses who pick the suspect is an indicator of lineup fairness/bias.   \n\nThe mock-witness measures revealed substantial variability in lineup structure quality:  43% of the 190 lineups were fairly constructed, 33% were biased toward the suspect (mock-witnesses were able to select the police suspect at a rate significantly higher than chance) and 24% were biased away from the suspect toward a filler.  Just as with lab-based identifications, the quality of lineup structure matters for real lineups.  A suspect that stood out from fillers was significantly at risk for being selected by mock-witnesses who had zero memory of the crime.   \n\nThere is some lab-based evidence that structural bias has less impact for a lineup presented sequentially (one photo at a time) than for a lineup presented simultaneously (all photos at the same time).  This is the first test of that hypothesis with actual witnesses. As predicted, suspect identifications from simultaneous lineups were made significantly more often from suspect-biased lineups (48% of suspect IDs) than were suspect identifications made from sequential lineups (24% of suspect IDs). It is important to note that the number of suspect identifications from the two lineup formats were equal; the difference was in the level of bias in lineups from which suspect identifications were made.

Furthermore, existing measures of lineup fairness are not well-equipped to detect lineup bias when an eyewitness?s description of the offender is absent from police records, very generic (race, gender), or different from the suspect?s appearance.  A more effective approach that addresses the complexities of field lineups is required.\n\nStudy 2 examined the audiotaped verbalizations of eyewitnesses during the identification procedure.  Theoretical accounts have suggested that accurate identifications result from automatic decision processes that are largely non-verbal and holistic (the face just \"popped out\") whereas mistaken identifications tend to involve more deliberative processes of comparison and elimination of lineup members and focus on single facial features (\"this guy?s chin&hellip;\").  As predicted, witnesses who verbalized automatic decisions produced significantly fewer known errors (29% filler selections) than did witnesses who verbalized deliberative processes (43%).   Holistic face identification was associated with greater accuracy than feature-based processing, and deliberative verbalizations of relative judgment (\"closest to my memory\") and comparative judgement were associated with less accuracy.\n\nThese findings from real cases lend support to lab-derived notions of an automatic versus deliberative continuum of witness decision-making that is related to decision accuracy.  These processes can be accessed via eyewitness comments during the lineup procedure.  The practical implication is that police be required to video/audiotape eyewitness identification procedures as a means to assist investigators and triers-of-fact. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy Steblay"
