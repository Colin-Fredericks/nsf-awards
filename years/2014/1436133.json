 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historically the microelectronics industry has been driving integrated circuit technology development, shrinking silicon transistor sizes, reducing their power consumption and lowering their cost.  For strategic electronic applications like satellite technologies, advanced materials development is essential. Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes have emerged as an important material candidate for these applications.  The industry believes that electronic devices fabricated using nanotubes may eventually replace silicon-based devices for logic applications; but it is also well known that nanotube-based radiofrequency transistors are important as high-performance analog components in wireless systems.  Key to the advance of high performance is the availability of aligned films of semiconducting nanotubes with high purity (>99.999 percent semiconducting nanotubes) at the wafer scale.  Scaling-up electronic purification of nanotubes is the key challenge.  Recently the Illinois team developed a path to purification for grown aligned nanotubes at levels that meet these daunting requirements.  This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award will support the work needed to scale this purification process to the wafer-scale, and integrate it into the process of record for nanotube field effect transistors in collaboration with Northrup Grumman Corporation.  This work will have a great societal benefit, impacting power consumption and performance in wireless technologies, and will serve as one of the first scalable nanomanufacturing development efforts in the area.  The work will provide a training platform for future engineers in this new manufacturing paradigm.  Moreover this interdisciplinary effort will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the research through use of the Summer Research Programs at Illinois and Northrup Grumman Corporation. \r\n\r\nAligned sub-monolayer films of single walled carbon nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition represent a promising materials platform for high-performance electronic applications. However, film electronic purity is a critical issue.  Recently the Illinois team developed a path to purification for as-grown aligned materials based on utilization of a thermal resist which serves as an etch barrier for semiconducting nanotubes during processing.  The process uses nanoscale thermocapillary flows in thin organic films as a processing strategy for complete, selective removal of metallic nanotubes from aligned arrays of single walled nanotubes.  Compatibility with current microelectronics fabrication tools suggests it can serve as a scalable technique for nanotube substrate purification.  Microwave excitation leads to efficient, selective removal of metallic tubes via this process, enabling 100 percent purity.  The research team will scale-up thermocapillary purification methods for wafer-scale manufacture and will introduce them into the transistor processing workflow at Northrup Grumman.  A high volume microwave reactor will be designed, assembled, and developed. Ultimately high-performance, low-power, low noise linear carbon nanotube amplifiers will be fabricated at the wafer-scale.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary research goal of this project was to utilize thermocapillary purification methods to electronically purify carbon nanotube substrate arrays for further processing into high-performance electronic devices.  As part of this effort a technology platform will be transfered to Northrup Grumman (NG).  First, CNT grown by the Northrup Grumman Corporation will be purified by the Illinois team to insure development of a purification paradigm compatible with their current protocols.  A secondary goal is to help support efforts at Northrup Grumman to characterize nanotube purity and to access processes designed to selectively grow electronically in-riched aligned CNT substrates. As the program evolved the secondary goal became much more important to the longterm goal, development of a scalable processes for wafer scale manufacture and with their introduction into the transistor processing workflow at Northrup Grumman.\n\nIn later program years we focused on helping NG evolve their CNT processing issues by modifying our activities to develop characterization paradigms help them improve their attempts to grow electronically enriched CNT arrays.  We developed efficient and accurate characterization protocols for the CNT array products and CNT seed growth substrates.  This work was captured in two high profile publications, and described is several invited talks.  In fact, the lead student, upon completing his PhD was hired as a staff engineer to continue the characterization work at NG. NG will continue to advance the use electronically purified CNT seeds as a path to grow enriched CNT arrays for advanced devices.  As noted, to support this effort we needed to characterize both the CNT seeds and seeded growth substrates, moreover the growth product needs to be characterized to define the degree of enrichment.  We showed how one can use scanning probe microwave reflectivity to detail the electronic character of CNT arrays at the nanoscale.  More detailed work revealed that while nanoscale scanning probe microwave reflectivity worked extremely well characterizing modestly dense arrays of nanotubes (5-7 NT/sq microns).  At lower densities the error bars on nanotube capacitance became significant.   NG's new enriched growth approaches are in an early stage generating very sparse arrays of CNT, making both characterization and purification difficult.  Throughout the program the team at NG focused in improving density, we focused on evolving our characterization techniques to function accurately on sparse samples.\n\nAs is well known Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are 1-dimensional nanomaterials with unique electronic properties that make them excellent candidates for next generation device technologies.  While nanotube growth and processing methods have progressed steadily, significant opportunities remain in development of advanced methods for their characterization, inspection, and metrology.  In this program, we showed for the first time that Microwave near-field imaging offers an extremely versatile \"nondestructive\" tool for nanomaterials characterization.  First, reported the application of nanoscale microwave reflectivity to study SWNT electronic properties.  Using Microwave Impedance Microscopy (MIM) combined with a novel Microwave Impedance Modulation Microscopy (MIM2) approach, we imaged horizontal SWNT arrays showing the microwave reflectivity from individual nanotubes is extremely sensitive to their electronic properties and dependent on the nanotube quantum capacitance under proper experimental conditions. It is shown experimentally that MIM can be a direct probe of the nanotube free carrier density and the details of their electronic band structure.  We demonstrated spatial mapping of local SWNT impedance (MIM), the Density of States (MIM2), and the nanotube structural morphology (AFM) simultaneously and with lateral resolution down to &lt;50nm. Nanoscale microwave reflectivity is having tremendous impact, enabling optimization of enriched growth processes and post-growth purification of SWNT arrays, while aiding in the analysis of the quantum physics of these important 1D materials.  Key to the success of optimizing SNR with this approach was the addition of a \"removable\" high K overlayer to enhance the capacitance signal directly from the nanotubes.  With sparse sample arrays this approach is much less reproducible.  Seeds are not well conformably coated resulting is large signal errors. To solve this approach we've embarked on a strategy for MIM imaging which uses the natural water layer always present in any scanning probe measurement in ambient conditions as that high dielectric overlayer.  This requires us imaging via a \"capacitave gradient\" mode where the cantilever capacatance characteristics are mapped on approach from just above the CNT surface imaging until submerged in the few molecular layers of water.  The capacitive jumps are a direct measure of the \"quantum capacitance\" of the CNT seeds and allow complete characterization of the samples.  This new technique greatly enhances the utility of these nanoscale techniques and allows mapping both the capacitive and resistive responses.  We have modeled this new dynamic strategy and have gathered a wide array of data showing its power as a nanoscale characterization tool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William L Wilson"
