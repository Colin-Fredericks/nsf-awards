 "awd_abstract_narration": "Floating-point arithmetic enables computers to smoothly and\r\nefficiently handle widely varying magnitudes such as the diameter of\r\nan atom or that of a star, and fit these measures within computer\r\nwords that come in standard widths.  Unfortunately,\r\nwhen calculations are performed on floating numbers, round-off errors\r\nare introduced, often causing real-world disasters, such as errant\r\nmissile launches. While employing large computer word widths can\r\nminimize these errors, it also slows down computations, increases\r\ntheir memory, and energy needs. This project could have a broad impact\r\nby providing much needed debug support for scientific programmers to \r\ndevelop more reliable floating point programs.\r\n\r\nThis project develops novel ways to estimate round-off errors, thus\r\nhelping programmers arrive at efficient floating-point computer codes.\r\nSpecial emphasis is placed on handling tricky cases such as squaring\r\nnumbers and taking their trigonometric values where prior research had\r\nnot sufficiently advanced. By developing powerful and automated tools\r\nfor precision estimation, it allows programmers to tune their codes\r\nand pick word widths parsimoniously while not losing accuracy.  \r\nThe investigators use these tools to develop pedagogical material and best\r\npractices based on hands-on experience that helps inform students who\r\ntypically are not taught the pitfalls of floating-point arithmetic.",
