 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers involved in the Empirical Studies of Conflict Project are engaging in intellectual arbitrage, applying methods with a long history of succes in analyzing non-violent social and political interactions to environments suffering violent interactions.  A variety of theoretic models are used to generate predictions, which are then tested in a variety of ways.  With regards to theoretical perspecitves, the researchers encompass those who use game theory, agent base modelling, sociological, and psychological approaches.  With regards to methodological approaches, the researchers use econometric approaches using observational data, randomized-controlled trials, including lab and field experiments, and indepth case studies.  By interacting with scholars from a variety of backgrounds as well as policy-makers, these researchers are able to push the frontier of their respective fields and challenge common \"wisdom\" in this area.  For example, they were able to show that modest, targeted aid projects in Irag were more effective in reducing violence than larger programs.  Likewise, they have shown that poor individuals in certain countries tend to be more negative towards non-state groups than their middle-class peers.  This workshop will allow for continued innovations in this area.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will addresses issues that are central to national policies on terrorism, insurgency, political instability, and international development.  By addressing both the causes of these factors as well as examining the success or failure of current policies, the researchers will provide key input to policy-makeers who spend billions of tax dollars on aid interventions, military assistance, and military interventions.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in substate conflict demonstrate the value of applying advanced theoretical and empirical methods of political economy to this area of study.  During the two-day workshop economists and political scientists who possess these skills will review preliminary findings, discuss methodological challenges, and share best practices.  In addition, these junior and senior scholars will interact with promising graduate students as well experts from the U.S. military, USAID, World Bank, NGO's, and the tech-industry.  This interdisciplinary, cross-boundary meeting will spark collaborative projects, bridge different research methods, expose students to new research, train emerging scholars, and expose practioners to research-based techniques.  This will allow researchers and others to provide policy-makers with prescriptions in dealing with conflict in fragile states.",
