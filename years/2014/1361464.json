 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project \"Boston University/Keio University Workshops,\" funded for June 2014 - June 2017, consists of three annual workshops at Boston University in areas of mathematical research common to Boston University and Keio University, Japan.  The workshop subjects are dynamical systems and applications, geometry and mathematical physics, and algebraic geometry.  These five-day workshops will consist of lectures by experts aimed at the graduate student level, as well as talks by advanced graduate students. Funds will be used to provide partial support for US graduate students from outside the Boston area. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Boston University/Keio University workshops is to expose graduate students to areas of strong current research interest in pure and applied mathematics and statistics.  These workshops extend the previous smaller scale BU/Keio workshops, which graduate students found very beneficial. Each workshop is anticipated to host a total of 30-50 participants. Graduate students will hear lectures from leading experts in these fields, have the chance to present their own research results in a professional setting, and network with their peers and faculty members.  A website devoted to these workshops will make lecture notes available to a wide audience:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bu.edu/math/special-programs/bu-keiou-workshops/",
