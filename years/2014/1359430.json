 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis REU site, based in the Physics Department of the University of Missouri, Columbia, will train 10 undergraduate student interns per summer in the area of materials experiments and modeling, broadly defined.  The program will be targeted at junior and senior undergraduate students with Physics Majors, with the aim of introducing them to cutting-edge scientific research by engaging them in active and established research groups and motivating them to pursue a career in the sciences.  Student research topics may be chosen from a broad area of materials physics (theoretical, experimental, or computational).  Some examples are: theory of electronic structure in solids, spin-orbit interaction in oxide interfaces, simulation of RNA folding, tunable single electron memory, study of membrane proteins with atomic force microscopy, charge transport in transistors, neutron and x-ray scattering in solids, quantum spin ice systems, graphene and beyond-graphene materials, etc.  While each student will work on a sharply focused area of research, they will gain a broader perspective of materials research from weekly discussions and presentations by their peers.  In addition to their research, students will participate in weekly group meetings, attend weekly lectures in popular science as well as in general education topics such as scientific writing, ethics, and career opportunities in science and technology.  Other planned activities include a visit to an industrial research and development facility.  All students will be required to present their results as oral presentations at the MU Undergraduate Summer Research Day held each August and will be encouraged to participate in journal publications.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nStudents who complete this program will experience the reality of cutting-edge research in materials physics and engineering.  This will enable them to understand their own level of aptitude and interest in a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) and give them the tools to prepare for the next stage in their education and career development.  A diverse population of students will be recruited from the community colleges and undergraduate institutions in Missouri as well as nationally.  The emphasis will be on students who might otherwise have limited access to research work and who in the absence of this experience might not pursue higher education or STEM careers.",
