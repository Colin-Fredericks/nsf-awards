One essential aspect is to be able to differentiate between possible intrinsic toxicity of NPs from the toxicity of their soluble ions. The investigators propose an interdisciplinary approach that combines isotope tracing with NP aging, RNA sequencing technology, and dynamic modeling to study mechanisms of nanoparticle bioavailability in sediment water. The isotopic tracing will use stable isotope tracer techniques, which will enable the investigators to better identify whether the toxicity is due to the NPs themselves or to dissolved Zn ions. The study of nanoparticle aging and aging conditions is an important aspect in nanotoxicology research, as is the ability to differentiate between the effect of the nanoparticles and their soluble ions, which is critical in understanding the fate and transport of these particles in the environment. The PIs have a record of strong commitment to outreach and education of students and will continue their activities, such as making a permanent exhibition of NP interactions with the environment and the human body at the Kentucky Science Center, in Louisville, KY.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to characterize NP partitioning between the water column and sediments, to describe how particle aging influences these processes, and to understand the consequences of this partitioning for sediment dwelling organisms.  Specifically, the PI will investigate ZnO nanoparticles and their interaction with sediments, addressing several key parameters in understanding long term NP effects in the environment. Differentiation between the effect of the nanoparticles and their soluble ions is critical in understanding the fate and transport of these particles in the environment. They lay out several hypotheses to test, e.g., that decreasing NP solubility will result in decreased uptake of Zn++ by _Hyalella Azteca_ , a species of amphipod crustacean and that NP uptake will occur primarily at the sediment surface, while Zn++ ion uptake will occur primarily through water column exposure. The investigators call this approach Environmental Transformation, Exposure from Sediments, and Toxicity (E-TEST). These studies and approach will introduce new techniques in an integrated way for nanoparticle assessment. The experiments are well thought-out and it is likely that excellent information will come from the study. This is an excellent collaboration between two investigators that approach the problem from different perspectives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\nThe unique properties of nano-scale materials make them attractive for a wide range of applications and their incorporation into consumer products has grown exponentially over the last two decades.  Nanomaterials composed of Zinc oxide, or ZnO NPs, are used in variety of consumer products including health and beauty products, paints, and electronics.   Although their use in these products has many benefits including more efficient electronics and sensors and UV protection, these uses pose potential risks when they are released into the environment.  The most common route of environmental release is through waste water treatment plants.  When these particles enter the aquatic environment, they may accumulate on the sediment surface in aquatic environments.  Therefore, sediment dwelling organisms, including the crustacean Hyalella azteca, are at particular risk from engineered nanomaterials.  In fact, H. azteca is one of the most sensitive organisms to ZnO NPs that has been tested to date.  ZnO NPs undergo complex transformations in the environment, including pH dependent changes in speciation and solubility and transformations into phosphates, sulfides and carbonates.  To gain insight into how environmentally realistic exposures to ZnO NPs affect sensitive sediment invertebrates, we conducted a series of experiments to explore the toxicity and uptake mechanisms of transformed ZnO NPs on H. azteca.  We also designed laboratory exercises for undergraduate students to teach them about NPs and how NPs are different from the bulk materials they are made from.\n\n \n\nMajor Results and Outcomes:\n\n 1. This is one of the first studies to compare and demonstrate differences in the toxicity of environmentally transformed ZnO nanoparticles. H. azteca are particularly sensitive to phosphate-transformed ZnO nanoparticles, which form in wastewater treatment plants and aquatic environments with enriched phosphate.  However, both phosphate and sulfide- transformed ZnO nanoparticles accumulate in H. azteca, thus providing a route for particles to enter the food web. \n\n 2. Gene expression changes reveal that there are a lot of similarities in the toxicity mechanisms of environmentally transformed ZnO NPs and Zn ions. This suggests that although ZnO NPs are more toxic than Zn ions, the mechanism is likely related to increased uptake of the NPs and not a distinct mechanism of toxicity. \n\n 3.  Uptake studies confirmed that ZnO NPs are taken up faster and to a greater extent than Zn ions.  This explains why the NPs are more toxic and also suggested the potential for higher trophic transfer of NPs to fish compared with ions.\n\n 4.  Laboratory exercises were successful at teaching students about the differences between ZnO NPs and Zn ions.  Students also gained valuable skills in conducting toxicity tests and performing statistics.  These skills directly assisted at least 25% of the students in getting a research position or being accepted into graduate school after graduation.  The laboratory module is also available for free to other interested instructors. \n\n 5.  This project assisted two female students in acquiring their Ph.D.s., and a one veteran undergraduate student complete a senior honors thesis. \n\n Main conclusions:\n\nAs NPs enter the aquatic environment, they behave differently and are taken up differently than the bulk materials and ions that we are more familiar with studying.  For ZnO NPs, this means they have a higher probably of causing toxicity to sediment organisms and accumulating up the food chain.  These differences in toxicity and bioaccumulation need to be considered in the regulation and environmental release of NPs.  However, there may be opportunities to exploit the unique properties and transformations of NPs to reduce their toxicity.  For example, anaerobic digestion appears to lower the toxicity of ZnO NPs through sulfide-transformation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Helen C Poynton"
