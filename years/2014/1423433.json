 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in technology have made it possible to accommodate an increasing number of \r\ntransistors on a die, enabling Multicore Accelerators like Graphics Processing Units\r\n(GPUs)  by integrating diverse components on a single chip. GPUs have recently gained \r\nattention as a cost-effective approach for data parallel architectures, and the fast scaling of \r\nthe GPUs increases the importance of designing an ideal on-chip interconnection network, \r\nwhich significantly impacts the overall system performance.\r\nIn this project, we propose to develop a framework for high-performance and\r\nenergy-efficient on-chip network mechanisms in synergy with Multicore Accelerator \r\narchitectures. The desirable properties of a target on-chip network include re-usability\r\nacross a wide range of Multicore Accelerator architectures, maximization of the use of\r\nrouting resources, and support for reliable and energy-efficient data transfer.\r\nThis project will make significant advances in understanding the interplay between \r\nMulticore Accelerator and Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, which leads us to\r\nscalable solutions for performance, area and energy.\r\n\r\nWhile the major communication of Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) systems is core-to-core\r\nfor shared caches, major traffic of Multicore Accelerators is core-to-memory, which \r\nmakes the memory controllers hot spots. Since Multicore Accelerators execute many\r\nthreads in order to hide memory latency, it is critical for the underlying NoC to provide high bandwidth.\r\nThe key contributions expected from the project are: (1) building a \r\nsimulation testbed and analyzing the behavior of on-chip traffic workloads in Multicore\r\nAccelerators; (2) proposing mechanisms for a high-performance and energy-efficient \r\nNoC by utilizing emerging memory and NoC technologies in addition to novel topologies\r\nand routing mechanisms; (3) developing methodologies at the NoC level that will \r\nsupport data prefetching mechanisms in the Multicore Accelerators; and (4) providing\r\nmulticast support and packet coalescing in the on-chip network to guarantee better\r\nsystem throughput. The results from this project are likely to foster new research directions in several\r\nareas of Computer Architecture and Parallel Computing. Also, high-performance and \r\nenergy-aware computing and communication research is applicable to other areas,\r\nsuch as Embedded Systems and Cloud Computing. We will develop web-based tutorials to \r\npresent and disseminate the results of this project, including tools and techniques, to a broad audience.",
