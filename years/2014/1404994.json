 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract:\r\nThis award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research to the University of Virginia supports neutron scattering studies of novel superconductors to investigate the intricate interaction of disorder and superconductivity, and to probe the nature of the microscopic interactions at the smallest scale possible. Superconductivity is the state of matter characterized by zero electrical resistance. Materials carrying this property can potentially mitigate some of the world's energy challenges and transportation demands in the future. Since its initial discovery about 100 years ago, many superconductors have been synthesized in the laboratory leading to discoveries of very complex phenomena. In 1957, Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer developed a theory that explains adequately the mechanism that leads to superconductivity in simple metals. Nowadays, superconductivity has been found in materials that are far from simple metals and the objective of this project is to provide data to help with theoretical understanding of their unconventional properties and mechanisms. The broader impact is to train future generation of scientists who, using sophisticated characterization techniques, will contribute to important areas of physics.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\nThis award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research supports the University of Virginia on a collaborative study of new classes of superconductors, based on BiS2 building blocks. These materials exhibit strong coupling of the structure to superconducting transition temperature. The investigators manipulate the crystal chemistry of the materials to tune the ground state between insulating, semiconducting or metallic, non-magnetic or magnetic states. Scattering techniques (neutrons) including pair density function (PDF) techniques are used to study the structural and magnetic properties. The investigators have complementary expertise in local atomic structure, phonon and magnetic dynamics characterization.  The objective of this comprehensive approach is to shed light on pairing mechanisms, and generate phonon/magnetic excitations data for theoretical simulations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nDisorder and superconductivity:\n\nA new class of phonon-mediated superconductors based on BiS? layers  recently discovered was the second focus of this project.  This system was chosen because of the intricate relation of superconductivity to disorder.  Their superconducting transition reached a maximum of &sim;10 K, under high pressure synthesis, that coincidentaly also introduce disorder into the crystal lattice.  A central issue to the electron-phonon coupling mechanism is a lattice instability that potentially fosters competing ferroelectric and charge density wave states.  The quasi two-dimensional crystal structure with the superconducting BiS? bi-layers sandwiched between insulating  layers is reminiscent of the cuprate and iron based superconductors. The Bi atoms form square pyramidal units with in-plane and apical sulfur atoms.  First-principles, band structure and spin polarization calculations suggested that a phonon instability breaks the nominal tetragonal symmetry, P4/nmm, and potentially leads to several lower symmetry options such.  Such a change in the crystal symmetry will have significant implications on the band structure thus an experimental verification is necessary.  Our work provided this verification.\n\nOur neutron powder diffraction measurements showed that indeed sulfur is displaced from its equilibrium position, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggesting that it could possibly lead to charge fluctuations, similar to the parent compound of another phonon superconductor, BaBiO?.\n\nHowever, to obtain the three-dimensional arrangement of the atomic distortions and possible symmetry breaking conditions, high-resolution single crystal diffraction was clearly needed.  To this end, synchrotron X-ray and neutron experiments were carried out on single crystals which revealed a superstructure because of distortions in the superconducting planes.  The sulfur mode that can explain the single crystal results is ferro-distortive in nature, and must be responsible for the large electron-phonon coupling. This mode must bring significant changes in the electronic structure around the Fermi level. Fluctuations of the bond lengths in the superconducting crystal indicate that charge fluctuations persist and are most likely significant in the mechanism of superconductivity. Thus the electronic pairing and the form of superconductivity present in this system is sensitive to the precise nature of the crystal structure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Despina Louca"
