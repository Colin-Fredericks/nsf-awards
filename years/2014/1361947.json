 "awd_abstract_narration": "The I/UCRC for Electrochemical Processes and Technology plans to advance the fundamentals of electrochemical science and engineering to enhance production and manufacturing applications. CEProTECH will combine four research thrusts: (1) multiscale-modeling (from materials to electrochemical systems), economics and life cycle analysis, (2) in-situ electrochemical spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, (3) prototyping and scale-up, and (4) rapid transfer of technology to industry (technology roadmap based on industry member needs).\r\n\r\nThe proposed I/UCRC will seek to sustain a holistic portfolio of novel, advanced and industrially applicable research. This research agenda will be executed by a multi-disciplinary team, including a significant percent of underrepresented groups of faculty, research scientists, and numerous undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-docs.  Student researchers at the Center will receive important experience that will help contribute to the creation of an educated and contextually trained new-generation workforce. The Center plans to encourage a broad dissemination of learning through its continuing education activities to assist engineers in industry, as well as engineering students, in acquiring knowledge of electrochemical processes to better prepare them for career advancements.\r\n",
