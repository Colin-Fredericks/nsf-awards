 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of North Carolina Charlotte, located in Charlotte,\r\nNC, will support the training of 10 students in a 10-week program during the summers of\r\n2015-2017. The REU program is open to all undergraduate students who are citizens,\r\nnationals or permanent residents of the United States. Students trained in the program\r\nwill gain skills in lab research, develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills,\r\nunderstand the process of science, and be able to communicate their research results to\r\ntheir peers and the general public. Students will have an opportunity to present their\r\nresults at a national conference. The REU program provides an experience to students\r\nthat is typically not available to them at their home institutions. Students from schools\r\nwith limited opportunities for research and from underrepresented groups are encouraged\r\nto apply.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site program will focus on research in biology and biotechnology in a\r\ntraditional research experience while conveying how basic biotechnology research leads\r\nto business creation and industrial development. Example projects include bioinformatics\r\nand whole genome analyses to understand drought resistance of potato crops, generation\r\nand study of transgenic soybeans for agricultural use, study of microbial populations for\r\nbiofuel development or water treatment, use of nanoparticles in bioavailability or\r\nenvironmental impact studies. During the 10-week program, students will participate in\r\nactivities including workshops on Research Ethics, Applying to Graduate School, Career\r\nOpportunities, Biotechnology Innovation and Start-Ups, and a program at NC Research\r\nCampus and David Murdock Research Institute featuring research and employment\r\nopportunities. At the end of the program, students will present their research in a poster\r\nand/or oral presentation at the UNC Charlotte Summer Research Symposium.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division\r\nof Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to\r\ndetermine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked\r\nafter the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting\r\nsystem. More information is available by contacting the PI (Dr. Christine Richardson at\r\nC.Richardson@uncc.edu) or co-PI (Dr. Sharon Bullock at sbulloc8@uncc.edu).",
