 "awd_abstract_narration": "Provision of Log Data Reduction and Database Services for Scientific Ocean Drilling\r\nThe results and discoveries of scientific ocean drilling have broad relevance to a wide range of societal, educational, and public interests. One of the most important aspects of scientific ocean drilling is storing and making accessible well log data obtained during expeditions. The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) has been involved in scientific ocean drilling with the NSF from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) through the current International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). To date, more than 570 scientific drilling holes have been uploaded into the database, LogDB, including data for more than 33 km of drilled intervals, with more than 37,000 website visits for 2013 for data download. For the proposed work, LDEO will continue to provide scientists with quality-controlled well log data sets from future scientific expeditions and will also maintain historic well log data access. In addition, LDEO will collaborate with key database groups to enable LogDB and its associated scientific product to be broadly disseminated. This will broaden the use and impact of scientific ocean drilling data by connecting LogDB to other NSF-supported databases and facilities, increasing the accessibility of IODP log data to the broader scientific community. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The goals of this proposal are to provide scientists with quality-controlled well log data sets from future scientific expeditions and to maintain historic log data access. To accomplish this, log data will be transferred from the U.S. drillship, JOIDES Resolution, to shore for data reduction and QA/QC, with the resulting standard and image files transferred back to the ship for use during each expedition. At the end of each cruise, this dataset will be uploaded to the database, LogDB, for post-cruise, password-protected access for specific the scientific community. LDEO will continue to maintain LogDB, which provides a web-enabled database to safely store, search, and retrieve log data collected by DSDP, ODP, and IODP. LogDB has four components: secure storage of original and reduced log data files in a secure file system; a relational database containing log metadata for indexing and data queries; a web interface providing data search and retrieval, as well as access to documentation on data reduction and QA/QC steps; and a set of ReST-based web services, which provide an interface for third party data tools to interact directly with the database. The LDEO Borehole Research Group (BRG) will collaborate with logging operation groups in Europe and Japan to insure that log data collected and distributed by IODP are consistent across all platforms. In this effort, BRG will provide high quality log data access in as seamless a manner as possible for scientists onboard the JOIDES Resolution and to the international community. LDEO procedures have been designed to be operationally efficient and cost effective for the U.S. ship operator, Texas A&M University (TAMU), and to enhance LogDB user experiences with state-of-the-art database technology.",
