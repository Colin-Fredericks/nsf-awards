Three PIs and their 34 graduate students will benefit from the planned acquisition of a 4 node, 16 CPU per node Linux-OS cluster each with 256 GB RAM and a 36 TB RAID mass store system.  The compute cluster will support computational intensive analysis of seismic observations to constrain the geodynamics of the lithosphere and upper mantle through observations of shear wave splitting, particularly in extensional settings, finite element forward modeling of fracture development within reservoir rocks, and modeling investigations of rock mechanical implications of liquefied CO2 subsurface injections, to name a few.  Students trained will be well positioned for future careers in academia as well as the extractive industries.\r\n\r\n***",
