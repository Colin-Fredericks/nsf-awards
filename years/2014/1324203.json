 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Houston Emperical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM) Summer Training Institute facilitates a rigorous and productive dialogue between theoretical and empirical analysis in political science. While many political scientists are skilled at developing intricate theoretical models of important political phenomena, insufficient attention to the manner in which such efforts can inform empirical work can limit the relevance of this research to important social phenomena. On the other hand, scholars armed with a dataset and a statistics package, but bereft of precise and logically coherent theory, may be unable to provide credible accounts of cause and effect. The EITM research approach is based on the premise that attention to the logical relationships between theoretical models and empirical work can produce improvements in both. Such approaches are inherently more advanced than the courses most departments currently staff. The University of Houston EITM Summer Training Institute provides participants with unique opportunities to learn and pursue innovative research practices. \r\n\r\nTraining at the institute includes significant teaching and research components, providing students a high degree of individualized interaction with a far wider and deeper array of EITM mentors than are available at any individual institution. Students develop bonds with other students and mentors that will facilitate their development in graduate school, their research, and their academic or non-academic careers. Together, the institute will create a direct positive impact for graduate students who may not have these opportunities in their graduate programs.  This could increase the intellectual capital of the scholarly community as a whole. Other benefits include the dissemination of improved research and internet-based course materials such as EITM syllabi, lecture notes, homework exercises, demonstrations, replication datasets, and working papers, which are made available to the public as soon as they are released to the students. Such activities can increase the social relevance of scientific research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMotivation and Intellectual Merit\n\nOn July 9th and 10th, 2001 the Political Science Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) convened a workshop seeking ways to improve technical-analytical proficiency in Political Science.[1] This workshop, termed the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (hereafter EITM) Workshop, suggested constructive approaches so the NSF Political Science Program could develop linkages and a dialogue &ndash; both methodological and interpersonal &ndash; between formal and empirical modeling.  The participants in the workshop &ndash; with diverse methodological backgrounds &ndash; were senior scholars with research experience in various technical-analytical areas and proven track records in activities that have improved the technical-analytical expertise in various social sciences.  Participants were primarily from political science, but economics and mathematics were represented as well.\n\nAt its most elementary level EITM is a framework to unify formal and empirical analysis.  This type of methodological unification is not new in the social sciences.  It can be traced back to the accomplishments of the Cowles Commission.    At least four scientific issues motivated the creation of EITM at NSF.  \n\nThe first issue is that the ultimate focus of a model and test should be to support a cumulative scientific process geared toward finding causal mechanisms.  Specifying a model that links both formal and empirical approaches alerts researchers to outcomes when specific conditions are in place &ndash; and it is also one of the best ways to determine an identified causal relation. \n\n A second issue is that the status quo in political and social sciences is the methodological isolation of fields and sub-fields.  Among the consequences of this isolation is the schism between formal and empirical modeling and the concomitant weaknesses in how social science researchers specify and test their models. \n\nThe third issue follows the second: not only are the various fields in political and social sciences isolated methodologically, but also substantively. EITM-type collaborations in education, knowledge dissemination, and research organized around specific issues (e.g., climate change, energy, inequality) can promote interdisciplinary interactions and improve the quality and depth of knowledge in each field.  The EITM framework is inspired by the original work of the Cowles Commission in the field of economics but it is meant to strengthen and advance research in all social science disciplines.\n\nFourth, despite a focus by numerous social science disciplines on interactions between agent behavior and public policies, the current research practices can fail to develop formal models of such behavior. If one were to strictly adhere to the Cowles Commission approach we would, for example, forego the chance of modeling new uncertainty created by shifts in behavioral traits (e.g., public tastes, attitudes, expectations, and learning).  EITM places emphasis on finding ways to model human behavior and action and, thereby, aids in creating realistic representations that improve upon simple socio-economic categorization.   \nWith these factors in mind, the NSF Political Science Program has supported various EITM workshops to address these challenges.  In prior deliberations within NSF and in planning workshops with the academic community, it was determined that EITM workshops were an effective mechanism for reform.  EITM workshops around the United States have evolved in their design, not only in duration but also in content.  Our prior experience and evaluation of the various workshops led us to focus on a strictly student centered emphasis with extensive feedback and interaction with faculty and students.   In addition, we believed a best practice was to have students spend their time at the workshop not only learning the various tools needed to do EITM research but to understand how faculty tackle their research questions using an EITM approach.  Finally, it was believed that EITM was a social and policy science initiative so a multidisciplinary faculty team led the workshop.  Breaking disciplinary silos and introducing students to new ways of conducting EITM resesarch was a priority. \n \n\n\nBroader Impact\n\nEITM-inspired efforts that lead to greater cooperation between the various sciences can enhance policy acumen and aid society.  The old way of conducting policy research, where integration between the social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering is rare, can lead to inaccurate predictions and policy failure.  Ignoring behavioral responses will have negative ramifications for public policies regarding energy (i.e., the smart grid), education, health, and many other policy areas where human response is involved.  Indeed, among the most important broader impacts of EITM --- and one with the most lasting consequence --- will be simply raising awareness of the complexities and challenges to modeling and testing human response.    \n\n \n\n\n\n[1] The 2001 NSF EITM Workshop was recorded and transcribed.  The written transcript is available on the NSF Political Science Program Web Site: www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/polisci/reports/eitm709.pdf and\n\nwww.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/polisci/reports/eitm710.pdf.
