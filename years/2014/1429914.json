As such, they have generated national and regional contestations over science, water, and livelihoods. Under the supervision of Prof. Stephan Helmreich, Ph.D. student Caterina Scaramelli will conduct ethnographic and archival research on two coastal wetland sites in order to better understand the role of conservation science in wetland monitoring and management.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to producing a dissertation, the co-PI will share her findings by creating an online platform for hosting research data and video production. This aspect of the project promises to add innovative tools for research, communication, and public dissemination.",
