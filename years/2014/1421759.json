 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common problem arising in science and engineering is that a dataset may only be partially measured.   Often the complete dataset is naturally expressed as a matrix - for example, traffic flows in a city, gene expression across a set of treatments, or ratings of movies for users.   Recently, a new solution strategy has emerged for the problem of inferring the missing entries in such datasets, but the power and limits of this new \"structural\" approach are not fully understood as yet.  This project will develop a better understanding of this structural approach and apply that understanding to a number of important problems.  In addition, the project will develop new course materials for data science education, and train both graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe matrix completion problem seeks to infer the missing entries of a matrix, under a low-rank assumption.  To date, most matrix completion methods do not actually check whether the known entries contain sufficient information to complete the matrix.  Recently, however, a new and very different class of \"structural\" methods have emerged, which analyze the information content of the visible matrix entries, and so can determine whether accurate completion is possible.    From a data mining standpoint, the implications of structural matrix completion methods are largely unexplored.  This project will investigate how to leverage structural matrix completion methods to attack a host of data analysis problems, including developing new methods for active matrix completion, new approaches to cross-validating matrix completion results, and new strategies for general matrix completion.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project are to develop new data mining methods.   The methods are specifically directed to the situation in which data takes a tabular (ie, matrix) form, which furthermore has some entries missing.   This missing-data situation occurs quite commonly in science.  Matrix entries can be missing because they are hard to collect, because of experimental or measurement drawbacks, or because they have been lost for some reason.   For example, in the common case of a recommendation system such as used by an online video service, the matrix may consist of ratings for movies (in the columns) given by users (on the rows).    Then, each user may rate only certain movies, and so most entries in the matrix are missing.   The problem therefore arises of trying to estimate or recover the missing entries.  This \"matrix completion\" problem lies at the heart of many data mining problems, and arises in contexts as diverse as biology, signal processing, and social media.\n\nThis project has as its goals development of new methods for matrix completion. In order for it to be possible to perform matrix completion, the underlying matrix must have some particular structure that gives leverage on the prediction problem.   This project considered two cases:  low-rank matrix completion, and positive-definite matrix completion.\n\nIn the first case (low-rank matrix completion) the project developed new methods for a number of specific cases.   First, in many cases one may be able to \"query\" missing entries in the matrix, albeit at some cost.   For example, one may be able to ask a specific user to rate a specific movie.   Then, the question is: in what order should entries be queried, so that a few queries as possible are performed, while solving the overall matrix completion problem adequately?   This project was one of the first to examine this question closely.  The project developed a novel algorithm, based on graph theory and linear algebra, that outperformed all alternative methods known to date for this problem.   The attached figure shows snapshots of how data is recovered as entries are queried for a standard method (top row) versus the new methods we developed (bottom row).\n\nA related question tackled on this project was: what if only a portion of the overall matrix is low-rank?   Can that portion be identified, and then completed?     Identifying a low-rank submatrix is a difficult problem since only a subset of matrix entries are visible.  This project developed methods (and identified when they can be expected to work) that solved this problem, meaning that matrix completion methods can now be extended to a larger class of datasets. The second case corresponds to positive-definite matrices.   These are a special class of matrices that often arise in statistics and signal processing.   For example, a covariance matrix is a positive-definite or positive-semidefinite matrix.   Here again we considered the case in which queries can be performed to help the completion process.  Using methods from graph theory and linear algebra, we showed how best to order the missing entries of a positive-definite matrix to allow reconstruction with good statistical properties.\n\nBeyond these goals, the foundational work in matrix completion supported by this project led to new insights in related areas where incomplete matrices often arise.   As already mentioned, recommendation systems are typically approached via matrix completion.  Accordingly, this project extended its scope towards a number of problems related to recommendation systems, online ratings, and opinion formation.   In this context the project studied polarization issues in social media and social networks, developing novel and effective methods for reducing polarization in both contexts.    The project also developed new methods to effectively explain the outputs of recommendation systems, and published a number of studies designed to understand the interaction between recommendation systems and opinion formation.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark E Crovella"
