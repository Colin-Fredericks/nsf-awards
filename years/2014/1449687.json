 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund the Association of Women in Science (AWIS) to conduct a series of three annual workshops for grant awardees from the ADVANCE and Research on Gender in Science and Engineering programs. This will be the first time these two communities will be brought together. Their research has much in common and the two groups will learn much from each other. Overlapping areas of interest include: examination of the causes and strategies to alleviate under-representation of girls and women in STEM, the use of theory-based intervention models to redress under-representation, and the design and carrying out of evaluation of the impact of their programs. The cross-fertilization between the two communities will generate better ideas that can be tested, and mechanisms to evaluate the resulting strategies to learn why they are effective and in what context. This series of workshops is expected to have a broad impact on the entire community of researchers interested in the field of broadening participation, as presentations and poster sessions presented at the meeting will be posted on the AWIS website. In addition, AWIS is planning to innovate the use of social media to more broadly disseminate workshop findings.",
