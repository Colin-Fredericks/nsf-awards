The conference will be organized by students with faculty acting as advisors. There will be 6 keynote talks given by invited professors, while 21 talks will be given by students. The conference will have 3 focus areas: numerical optimization and applications, mathematical modeling and algorithms in imaging, and mathematical biology and modeling. The conference will showcase the latest computational techniques in the fields of optimization and imaging, as well as state-of-the art models in biomathematics. Students will have the opportunity to meet experts in their own and related fields, and will be able to network with other students in the focus areas of the conference. The student organizers of the conference will develop organizational skills, and skills in interacting and communicating with other researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference will help students from the three interrelated fields of numerical optimization, imaging sciences, and mathematical biology achieve a broader view of their research and their field as they learn from and interact with researchers who work in application fields such as medical imaging technology and disease modeling and treatment. The conference will plant the seeds for future research projects. By networking with other students, a foundation for future collaborations will be established. The abstracts of the presented papers will be publicly available on the conference web site.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  siam.math.ufl.edu/conference/",
