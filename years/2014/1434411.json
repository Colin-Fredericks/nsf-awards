 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project develops methodologies and algorithms to reduce surface shape variation, enabling cost-effective high-precision machining by integrating process physics with multi-resolution surface data for quality diagnosis and monitoring. The integration of the process physics model and multi-resolution data will improve surface data modeling, variation prediction accuracy, and interpretability. Based on the improved data model, a cost-effective surface measurement strategy and monitoring scheme will be developed by which abnormal process variations can be detected and identified with reduced false alarm rates. The model will also improve surface variation diagnosis. By combining the modeling and monitoring approaches, a two-level surface variation control methodology is established to improve surface quality for multistage machining processes. The PI and co-PIs will collaborate with major US automakers and/or powertrain system suppliers for data acquisition, experiments, algorithm verification and validation, and technology transfer.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this research provides new insights into surface variations in multistage machining processes and will transform in-plant quality control practice from dimensional variation reduction to surface shape variation control. If successful, this project will enhance US manufacturing competitiveness by improving powertrain machining precision and quality. The surface modeling and control framework established in this research focuses on face milling and can potentially benefit other surface machining applications. In addition, the methodology of surface variation control established in this research will contribute to development of a novel optical surface measurement system that can intelligently select metrology resolution and determine defective surface regions. The surface variation monitoring scheme can also be extended to quality control for micro manufacturing processes by reducing the measurement time of high-definition metrology such as atomic force microscopy and 3D profilometry.",

The outcomes and findings from this project can be summarized as follows, i.e.,</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit:</p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;The project discovered a number of new surface shape problems using high-definition metrology systems and identified the root cause (Fig. 1). The discovery leads to new engineering&nbsp;knowledge on the surface variation generation mechanism and quality control methods.</p>\n<p>2. The project delivers a modeling method and demonstrates that fusing the surface quality data measured in in-plant with the engineering process knowledge as learned from high-definition data can significantly improve surface quality prediction with high precision without having to increase measurement efforts. The outcome helps powertrain plants establish cost-effective quality control of high-precision surface machining.</p>\n<p>3. The project delivers a knowledge-sharing and transferring method to help improve the monitoring of surface process variations given limited historical data. This outcome will help a new manufacturing plant to efficiently build a statistical baseline to monitor the process repeatability, and stability with very limited historical data are available.</p>\n<p>4. The project develops a new spatial data monitoring method not only to detect abnormal surfaces but locate the problem on surfaces with sufficient statistical confidence. The results published on IIE Transactions is recognized as a featured article and received the best application award at IISE Annual Conference in 2017.</p>\n<p>5. Based on the surface model and discovered engineering knowledge about surface variations,&nbsp;a cost-effective surface variation control method is developed for improving machined surface quality.

The progressive measurement and monitoring strategy for spatial data developed in this project reduce the measurement time of high-definition metrology. As such, it has great potential applications for improving measurement efficiency of high-resolution metrology system in micro and nanomanufacturing such as micro/nano 3D profilometry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c. The data fusion modeling methodology for spatial data was applied to other applications including solar panel PV data forecasting and electricity load forecasting for the smart city.

Three undergraduate students (including one African American from Florida A&amp;M University- a historically black college/university) received the training in developing data acquisition systems and machining experiments (Fig. 3).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>d.
