 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although biogeographers and conservation biologists know that deforestation, responsible for 95% of the world's endangered species, is a serious threat to species conservation, the impacts of this land use change is still ignored in terms of its effects on the elevational ranges of species. Preliminary observations suggest that lowland deforestation affects the ranges of species in the forest above when compared to forests with intact lowlands. Understanding the distribution of species along natural and altered altitudinal gradients is important for the design of current conservation strategies, and could be instrumental in predicting future distributions of species in the face of climate change. Preliminary observations suggest that lowland deforestation affects the ranges of species in the forest above when compared to forests with intact lowlands. Understanding the distribution of species along natural and altered altitudinal gradients is important for the design of current conservation strategies, and can be instrumental in predicting future distributions of species in the face of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe biologically richest hotspot is the northern Andes of South America. Colombia has more bird species than any other country - approximately 1900 - and a rate of discovery of one new bird species per year. Within Colombia, the highest concentrations of endemic and small-range birds are in the Western Andes, peaking at 46 species. The diversity of non-endemic birds, and other taxa, is also exceptional. The western slope of the Western Andes is mostly covered by intact forest, but the eastern slope has suffered severe deforestation due to road access and human settlement. To achieve the goals of understanding elevational range changes, the investigators will sample three pairs of altitudinal transects (2000-2900m) in which one will be completely covered by mature forest, while the other will lack forest in the lowlands. In the Mesenia-Paramillo Reserve in the northern part of the Western Andes, the project will describe species richness and the variation of abundance for each species along these transects. Employing observations and mist-netting, and aided by a team of local staff and biologists-in-training, the investigators will identify the effects of lowland deforestation on species ranges using statistical models. Expected results from this project include current bird distribution information and 3D maps, and the establishment of permanent banding stations along the altitudinal transects which will be sampled periodically after this project concludes. These results will inform a global understanding of how deforestation and climate change affects species and so aid those who manage them.",
