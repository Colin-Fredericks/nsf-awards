 "awd_abstract_narration": "The STEM Pathways Program at the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) provides scholarships for academically talented students in financial need who are pursing bachelor's degrees in STEM disciplines at MCLA. The scholarship program supports full-time students majoring in biology, physics, chemistry, environmental studies, computer science, or mathematics. The program awards annual scholarships to students who meet financial need and academic merit criteria.  A total of 32 scholarships are planned over a five-year period in The STEM Pathways Program. The STEM Pathways Program allows MCLA to offer scholarships to directly address an area of national concern: the shortage of US graduates trained in STEM related fields. Scholarships for academically strong STEM students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, have an impact on the number of STEM graduates prepared to help national, regional, and local companies.  Talented STEM graduates help US industries to compete and innovate in a global economy. \r\n\r\nThe STEM Pathways Program builds on resources available at the Center for Science and Innovation at MCLA.  The Center includes an incubator laboratory providing opportunities for students to achieve experience working with local life science companies. The STEM Pathways Program recruits applicants through open house events, activities for accepted students, partnerships with regional schools, and collaborations with admissions counselors.  The STEM Pathways Program includes a range of program activities intended to insure that scholarship recipients complete their STEM degree programs and are able to succeed in joining the STEM workforce.  Scholarship awardees are co-located within the dorms during their first year, allowing them to build a strong support network from the beginning of their college experience.  STEM faculty host an introductory meeting at the start of each semester to welcome students back and announce program opportunities. Students meet monthly with a peer mentor to discuss program challenges, strategies, and opportunities. STEM departments host a social event on the last Friday of each month allowing STEM faculty to interact informally with students.  STEM student support includes tutors and interaction with associates in the Writing Center trained to assist with technical writing assignments and reports.  STEM students at MCLA have optional research opportunities supervised by MCLA faculty, and the possibility of internships with regional industries.",
