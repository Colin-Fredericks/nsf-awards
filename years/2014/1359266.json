The REU Site recruits eight undergraduate students, for a ten-week summer experience, who undertake challenging problems with their mentors, in different research sub-fields of computer science (e.g., Graph Theory, Network Reliability, Cryptography, Network Security, Wireless Ad-hoc, Sensor Networks, and Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation) that require parallel processing programming techniques to be solved. Selected students develop competency in scientific research, improve oral presentations and writing skills. The program is aimed to help students produce significant research results which are written up in a format acceptable for publication in either a conference or journal.\r\n\r\nStudents are recruited from colleges and universities that offer limited or no STEM research opportunities, such as historically minority colleges and universities. Emphasis is placed on attracting minority and female students. Research and technical activities are integrated with group activities which include site visits to state-of-the art research facilities in the New York metropolitan area, seminars conducted by faculty, and social activities to enhance the diversity of the group. Seminars in career development, ethical issues in computer science, literature search, technical writing, and graduate school advisement, are integral parts of the program. The program is expected to draw students into research and provide them with the intellectual and motivational tools to engage them in graduate studies and pursue research careers in computer science or related fields.",
