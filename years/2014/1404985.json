 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical: This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to State University of New York at Stony Brook is to study membranes of living cells composed of lipids (specialized fat molecules) and proteins. Membranes control the uptake of food stuffs into cells and the communication between cells and their environment. Cell membranes are very complex, consisting of thousands of types of different proteins and lipids. Artificial membrane vesicles, composed of membrane lipids and proteins which are forming an envelope similar to a cell membrane, are important tools in understanding how membranes function. Natural membranes have two layers of membrane lipids, and they are asymmetric with different types of lipids in each layer. A key limitation in the utility of artificial membranes has been their lack of lipid asymmetry. Investigators of this award earlier discovered a method to prepare asymmetric artificial membranes. The proposed research on artificial membranes is expected to greatly expand the scientific knowledge on membranes. Additionally, this project will also have a broad impact on career development of future scientists, including minority students, by training both graduate and undergraduate students (including via contacts with other local institutions) in the conduct of research, experimental principles, and experimental techniques used in membrane research.  Students will also be trained in proper conduct of scientific studies, scientific writing and speaking, which will prepare them for careers in research, teaching, or allied fields.\r\n\r\nTechnical: Lipid asymmetry, a difference in the lipid composition in the inner and outer leaflets (monolayers) of a biological membrane, is a crucial property of the lipid bilayer in many cell membranes. Artificial vesicles (liposomes) containing lipid bilayers are biomaterials that have proven invaluable models of biological membranes, but the lack of methods to prepare asymmetric vesicles has limited their utility. With this grant, the first goal will be to prepare vesicles with inside-out asymmetry (cytosolic lipids facing outwards); to prepare vesicles containing a wide variety of outer leaflet lipids; and to prepare artificial asymmetric fungal membranes and bacterial outer membranes. The second goal will be to incorporate membrane proteins into asymmetric vesicles.  The third goal will be to use asymmetric vesicles to tackle the biologically important issue of coupling between inner and outer leaflet physical properties.  Such coupling has been proposed to contribute to signal transduction across biomembranes. To better understand the coupling between the outer and inner layers and signal transactions between them, fluorescent and neutron scattering studies will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Additionally, this project will have a broad educational impact on career development of future scientists, including minority students, by training both graduate and undergraduate students (including via contacts with other local institutions). Students will receive specialized training in a variety of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques used in this study of membrane proteins and lipids, including unique methods developed in this investigator's laboratory. Students will also be trained in proper conduct of scientific studies, and writing and speaking skills, preparing them for careers in field of biological/biophysical sciences and/or teaching. Finally, by developing improved model for membrane systems, this project should broadly impact the field of membrane biology, including drug delivery and nanomaterial applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCells are surrounded by thin membranes composed of a double layer of lipids just two lipid molecules thick, in which membrane proteins are embedded.  The goal of this project was to extend the cyclodextrin-based lipid exchange technology our lab developed to prepare artificial lipid membranes that mimic those in cells in that they have lipid asymmetry, a difference in lipid composition in the inwards facing and outwards facing lipid layers of cell-surrounding membranes.   Improvements were made in the technology by changing the type of cyclodextrin used.  This allowed preparation of vesicles with \"inside-out\" lipid asymmetry, in which the lipids normally inside the cell face the outside of the artificial membranes.    A method to improve efficiency while not perturbing membrane cholesterol was also devised, allowing development of a modified protocol to use cyclodextrins to change the other lipids in the outer layer of living cells.   This has great promise for future studies of how membrane lipid composition influences the function of membrane proteins in living cells.   Lipid exchange was also used to see the degree to which lipids can transmit information across membranes by direct contact between lipids in the outer and inner layer.  Another study revealed important details about how the membrane lipid sphingomyelin in the outer layer can transmit information about its physical state to the lipids in the inner layer, forcing inner leaflet lipids to take on a similar physical state as the lipids in the outer layers.  This may be a mechanism by which information is transferred from the outside to the inside of the cell, which is an important aspect of cell function.  The details of how lipid structure controls this coupling of physical state are an important target for future studies.  Additional studies investigated how lipids and proteins flip between the inner and outer layer, and how proteins influence the flipping of lipids.  These studies had important implications on how lipid asymmetry is maintained, and how protein movements might control membrane protein behavior in cells.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erwin London"
