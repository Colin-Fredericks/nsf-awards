 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel. The vessel is owned by the Navy and operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  \r\nBecause of the unique SWATH design, the Kilo Moana is a very stable and comfortable platform from which to conduct oceanographic research. The ship was designed as a multi-purpose oceanographic research vessel with extensive equipment for geophysical (2 multibeam echo-sounders, sub-bottom profiler, gravimeter and magnetometer), physical oceanographic (Doppler current profilers, CTDs, pCO2); meteorological and radioisotope research. Over 2500 sq. ft. of space is provided in 8 different laboratories and over 4000 sq. ft. of exterior working space is available on the aft main deck and the forward 01 deck. The Kilo Moana was built in 2001 and commissioned in 2002. The vessel operates out of Honolulu, Hawaii, and works throughout the Pacific. In 2013, the vessel completed 241 days. Of these, 167 days (69%) were for NSF. In 2014, she is scheduled to sail 260 days of which 165 (63%) are funded by NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\t1) Underway CTD\t$106,245 \r\n\t2) C-NAV3050 DGNSS Receiver\r\n3) 10m MOCNESS Upgrade\t$  10,021\r\n$  45,811\r\n\t\t$162,077 \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
