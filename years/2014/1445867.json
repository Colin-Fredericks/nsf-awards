 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teams are ubiquitous in today's organizations. Yet, we still struggle with how to manage them in many ways. One issue may be that they are all unique, not only in the tasks they are assembled to perform but also in the skills members have available to compose and facilitate specific team processes. In previous literature, team member skills are typically characterized as either task-related (often assumed to be functional expertise) or interpersonal skills. While all of these skills are important they do not completely describe, nor adequately define, the variety of skills that a member can apply to the team's task and processes. Identifying what these other skills are is far more difficult than identifying what they are not. For the purposes of this proposal, we characterize them as skills, because it is the term most often used to describe what team members bring to the team. More specifically, we label them operational skills because in team operations comprise a myriad of processes that convert inputs into outputs and applying different operations results in different team outputs. Just as team members have unique task-related skills they bring to the team, they may also possess different operational skills that can be applied to the team's task. As such, team task results may be dependent upon which member's skills are applied to what team processes. The purpose of this proposed research, therefore, is to develop and test a taxonomy of team member operational skills that facilitates forward progress on the team's task. In particular, this project's objectives are to (1) determine the operational skills needed in a team domain, (2) determine whether operational skills can be useful in configuring teams, and (3) examine whether an explicit focus on aligning operational skills and task activities facilitates more effective team processes and performance. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed project represents a rigorous, systemic approach to develop a taxonomy of operational skills that team members need to successfully complete their projects. Operational skills refer to team members' abilities to organize, synthesize, and decide in the team context. Scholarly and trade publications allude to the need for these types of meso-level skills (e.g., problem solving skills, decision making skills, management skills) but do not clearly describe or define them. To ensure a comprehensive examination of these skills, input will be extracted from the field in at least two significantly different sectors (e.g., healthcare and shipbuilding) and from controlled environments (i.e., gaming and laboratory). The results of this study will have a transformative impact in that they will (1) provide a theoretical basis for examining how operational skills are used to configure teams, assign tasks, and enhance performance and (2) formalize the incorporation of operational skills into team planning activities.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Successful completion of the proposed research will provide clear explication of an additional set of necessary skills team members possess in the form of a taxonomy of operational skills. This taxonomy will enhance future research efforts by, for example, the inclusion of heretofore overlooked, or poorly specified, skills in studies of teams, more comprehensive examinations of the broad array of skills team members possess, and questionnaire scales grounded in this systematic research. Practice may also reap benefit from the results of this research through an introduction to a more nuanced approach to team staffing, as well as new opportunities for recruiting individuals with these skills and training programs that help employees enhance these skills. In the long term, the proposed research has the potential to be the foundation of a new paradigm for considering how teams are configured and task work is assigned, thereby transforming collaborative processes in teams and improving their performance. The proposed study will include students, particularly women and minority students, on the research team.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTeams are ubiquitous in today?s organizations.  The members are selected based on the technical skills they bring to the team?s assigned task and all members are expected to have some basic interpersonal skills to facilitate effective collaboration.  While these skills are important, they may not adequately represent the complement of skills team members need.  The purpose of this project was to examine operational skills, as additional team member skills that are task neutral (like interpersonal skills) and distributed among team members (like technical skills).   These operational skills facilitate task progression by, for example, keeping the team organized, connecting it to the organization, and developing innovative ways to think about and solve the issues they face.  Traditionally, these skills are rarely, if ever, explicitly considered when teams are constructed. \n\n \n\nOur results suggest that operational skills are relevant and critical, not only to team construction, but also for orchestrating work over the team?s life cycle.  First, individuals with team experience from the advertising, healthcare, and industrial sectors all report that operational skills are present during team functioning and need to be considered as staffing decisions are made.  Second, operational skills do impact staffing decisions even if they are not explicitly recognized as part of the process.  Third, the task complexity faced by the team influences which operational skills are most important.  For instance, all operational skills help teams effectively tackle complex tasks with many moving parts; those members with skill in organizing, getting things done, and keeping the team spirit alive are most useful when the team?s environment is prone to frequent changes.  Finally, those team members who can organize activities and have innovative ideas are more useful early in the team?s life cycle, whereas those who know how to get things done are more necessary later in the team?s life cycle. \n\n \n\nThe broader impact of these results represents a paradigm shift for considering team staffing and member engagement beyond consideration of their technical expertise.  For researchers, the evidence strongly suggests that explicitly considering team member technical, interpersonal, and operational skills may provide more comprehensive investigations of team staffing and actions throughout the team?s life cycle.  For practitioners, this paradigm shift may result in a more nuanced approach to team staffing, as well as new opportunities for recruiting individuals with honed operational skills and training programs that help employees enhance these skills.  Through this research project, two graduate students, both minority and one female, were actively involved in all aspects of the research process.  Their involvement honed their research acumen and broadened their perspectives about how to conduct rigorous, effective research projects.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sara A Mccomb"
