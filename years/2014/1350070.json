 "awd_abstract_narration": "The immune system is important for health and survival in all organisms, including humans. The proposed research seeks to answer the question, \"What are the costs of immunity?\"  This is a central question in the field of ecological immunology. A simplifying assumption is often made that a greater or longer-lasting immune response is advantageous.  However, the costs of a more robust immune response may negatively affect other energy intensive processes such as reproduction. Currently, much of immunology research focuses on specific, isolated cellular components of the immune system. Although this level of understanding is important, it is also critical to comprehend how an overall immune response can affect the condition of an individual, including other vital physiological systems. Furthermore, it is presently unclear how individual measures, such as immunity, affect population changes over time. Understanding the link between individuals and populations will allow us to monitor more effectively the health and viability of natural populations, many of which are susceptible to an ever-changing landscape and climate. To address these knowledge gaps the proposed work will test (1) the energetic costs of immunity; (2) the effects of the immune system on other key physiological processes, notably reproduction; and (3) the links between individual immunity and natural populations.  Finally, embedded within the research program is a research-based training initiative for future educators, which will incorporate those educators into the proposed scientific research. By providing opportunities for future educators to ?do science,? this research will enhance the educational experiences and understanding of the scientific process for educators and for their students. The impacts of this educational program even in its initial stages will be broad, because there is an inherent multiplier effect. In sum, the proposed research and educational program has the capability to transform the principles underlying immunological research and to enhance the science education curriculum both for future instructors and for their students.",
