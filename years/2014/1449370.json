 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the critical roles played by technical professionals in serving the public and addressing grand\r\nchallenges, many formal courses and programs have been created to promote professional responsibility\r\nand ethical integrity among engineering graduates. Other interventions (e.g., service learning programs)\r\nhave been developed to more broadly challenge engineering and technology students to see themselves as\r\nengaged citizens and community members. Yet there has been a lack of research on foundational\r\nunderstandings of social and ethical responsibility among such students, including how these\r\nunderstandings change over time and through participation in specific types of learning experiences.\r\nAdditional empirical evidence is needed to guide ongoing efforts to cultivate enhanced social and ethical\r\nresponsibility among future engineers, including by identifying and promoting specific interventions that\r\nhave the biggest positive impacts on students.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study responds to these gaps in the existing scholarship by asking the following research\r\nquestions: 1) What do engineering students perceive as responsible (and irresponsible) professional\r\nconduct, and what do they perceive as socially just (and unjust) technical practices?, and 2) How do\r\nfoundational measures and understandings of social and ethical responsibility change during a four-year\r\nengineering degree program, both in general and in relation to specific kinds of learning experiences? To\r\ninvestigate these questions, a longitudinal mixed-method study design will collect and analyze\r\nquantitative and qualitative data from undergraduate engineering students at four universities. To improve\r\ntransferability of results, these schools will represent a variety of institution types. Each collaborating\r\nschool also has large numbers of students in programs of interest, e.g., service-learning and intensified\r\nethics instruction. Further, the study will give priority to investigating differences in perceptions and\r\nexperiences among underrepresented student populations.",
