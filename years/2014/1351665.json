 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent investments in sustainable energy resource integration with the energy infrastructure are invariably resulting in the adoption of additional solid-state converters in the power grid. These converters have short operational lifespans compared to other power grid components, but they possess attractive unrealized capabilities for the smart grid concept, including real-time diagnosis and self-healing, which is a long-term research plan of U.S. energy sectors. Thus, basic research to (i) advance reliability and availability of sustainable energy conversion systems and (ii) realize real-time diagnosis and self-healing features are timely topics. Meanwhile, as the power grid begins to adopt more solid-state converters, the nexus between power electronics and power system classes in power engineering curriculum is desired to address the power industry's urgent need for a highly educated workforce.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this CAREER proposal are to: (i) create intelligent-reconfigurable grid-interactive solid-state converters as smart elements for the smart grid concept, (ii) advance availability and reliability of solid-state converters in wind and solar energy conversion systems, and (iii) impart required knowledge and skills of practical problems of sustainable energy systems to the next generation of U.S. power engineers.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research includes the filling of crucial gaps in the literature regarding smart grid-interactive converters for wind and solar energy systems. This work offers the following advantages: (i) the formation of an innovate family of solid-state-based power converters with diagnostic, healing, and lifetime prognostic features, (ii) the improvement of grid-interactive converter reliability by preventing catastrophic failures and mitigating stress on vulnerable components, (iii) the reduction of overall system downtime and maintenance costs, and (iv) the facilitation of movement toward the next generation of power grid (smart grid). The broader impacts of this research include: (i) the provision of quality-integrated education, research, and engineering to adequately equip the emerging workforce and the U.S. energy industry needs, and (ii) research findings that are readily extendable to other critical technologies, such as flexible power transmission lines, electric hybrid vehicles, mechatronics, robotics, etc.",

The power generation from these intermittent energy resources requires solid-state converters as the interface between these sources and the power grid. These converters typically contain multiple stages, including an inverter as the grid-side stage, playing a significant role in forming smart power grids. This project advanced the smart inverter concept by developing novel reconfigurable technologies to enhance the availability, stability, and reliability of inverters for smart grids. The knowledge gained in this project has been utilized to modernize the power laboratory at Kansas State University to train students in electrical engineering to impart the required knowledge and skills of practical problems of sustainable energy systems to the next generation of U.S. power engineers. The modernized power laboratory for undergraduate students covers traditional and modern concepts on power electronics, electrical machine design, and control-in-the-loop techniques. The outcome of this research effort filled some crucial gaps in the literature regarding grid-interactive smart inverters. The PI and his graduate students developed many innovative ideas including an adaptive scheme, called adaptive pulse-width modulation, for inverters to normally operate even in the presence of time-varying input sources, a method for internal fault detection, isolation, and verification, enabling open-circuit faults to be quickly and accurately identified in inverters, &nbsp;a technique to enable continued operation of inverters in the event of external anomalies, providing corrective actions and ancillary services for the power grid. The team also extended its collaboration with other teams, including an internationally known group in Denmark, working on the stability analysis of grid-interactive inverters. The team also developed a control strategy called virtual inductance scheme to enhance the stability of inverters in weak grids. The research findings have been reported in more than five thesis and dissertations, thirty-five journals and international conferences, and six invited talks and tutorials. The research findings on smart inverters have been extended to electric powertrain technologies for all-electric and hybrid vehicles and aircraft. The PI also applied the knowledge gained in this project toward self-learning smart inverters for more secure power grids. It should be emphasized that the efficacy of all developed techniques in this project has been verified using laboratory test setups. In summary, the research goal of this project was to advance the productivity of grid-interactive converters, and its educational goal was to help the needs of the nation's energy industry by training a skilled workforce in applications of power electronics in power and energy systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Behrooz&nbsp;Mirafzal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587061685966_SmartInverters--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587061685966_SmartInverters--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Smart Inverters\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587061685966_SmartInverters--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Inverters\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Toward grid-interactive smart inverters</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Behrooz Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behrooz&nbsp;Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Smart Inverters</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587052022071_LabWork--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587052022071_LabWork--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Group Work\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587052022071_LabWork--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Group Work\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students building a multilevel converter to test their theory and developed techniques toward smart converters</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Behrooz Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behrooz&nbsp;Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Group Work</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587068024597_group--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587068024597_group--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Power electronics group\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1587068024597_group--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Power electronics group\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extended power electronics group at Kansas State University in 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Behrooz Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behrooz&nbsp;Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Power electronics group</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1589300694851_Students--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1589300694851_Students--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Power electronics students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351665/1351665_10289670_1589300694851_Students--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Power electronics students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduate students working on the project in 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Behrooz Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behrooz&nbsp;Mirafzal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Power electronics students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
