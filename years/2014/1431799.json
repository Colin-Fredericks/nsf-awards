The main theme of this interdisciplinary symposium is the study and application of biomaterials that interface with biological systems, especially neural cells and tissues.  Session topics will highlight the latest efforts to achieve safe and effective strategies to communicate with neurons.  As such, the scientific content and timing of the symposium are both appropriate.  The list of confirmed invited speakers includes prominent investigators in their respective areas of research.  \r\n\r\nNeural prostheses are critical in treating or assisting people with disabilities of neural function. In spite of recent advances in neural interface technology, engineering stable and reliable electronic-neural tissue interfaces for long-term functionality remains a critical issue.  The challenge for material science is to design and develop advanced multifunctional biomaterials to safely integrate with neural tissue with minimal biological response. Furthermore, the implant should match the mechanical properties of surrounding tissue to prevent injury due to micromotion and allow for adequate exchange of nutrients and waste so that the surrounding tissue remains healthy. This symposium will focus on the latest advances in biomaterials to control/engineer neuron-electronic interfaces to produce stable and functional implants with greater longevity than what is possible today.",
