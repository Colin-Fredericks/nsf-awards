 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the planning for a scientific software Institute in the area of computational chemistry.  Molecular simulation is an integral part of contemporary chemistry due to its broad adoption by academic researchers and industries that use molecular mechanics and dynamics methodology to advance their science.  The major molecular software programs have been downloaded by every major research university and biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and their wide usage is well exemplified by the ~30% of awarded cycles on the NSF compute platforms.  However, development, testing, and validation of biomolecular simulation software, and the realization of high-throughput production runs made available on various hardware architectures, is something that the user community wants and requires, but is not something that has been adequately supported in a sustained way in the academic environment.\r\n\r\nThe planning meetings  will enable invaluable graduate training by inviting local graduate students in the computational sciences and provide them an opportunity to understand the landscape of research opportunities at the interface of cyberinfrastructure and biomolecular sciences. The second workshop will examine education, outreach and training opportunities that an Institute of such scale and scope provides. The blueprint for the Institute will highlight multiple inter-disciplinary research problems and agenda; collectively, this will contribute to the training of the next-generation computational scientists and application-oriented cyberinfrastructure experts.",

This effort was successful.  In particular:\n\n1) Three workshops were held in key areas of Theoretical Chemistry, including Quantum Mechanics, Biology, and Materials.  These subject areas reflect the key areas classically in theoretical chemistry as well as key new areas of growth.  These communities are fairly disparate and so this grant was critical to bringing researchers together.\n\n2) The community got together to propose ways to address key needs in the field.  Key areas include the need for better standards for interoperability, the need for open source tools to bridge key missing areas, as well as potential growth areas, such as the intersection of theoretical chemistry and machine learning.\n\n3) These proposals were incorporated to a proposal for an NSF Center which was ultimately funded, reflecting the ideal outcome for this project.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the project is the identification of the key areas of future work in theoretical chemistry very broadly.  The broader impacts rest largely in the formation of the center itself as well the ability to bring disparate researchers together. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vijay S Pande"
