 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Craig M. Anderson of the Chemistry Department at Bard College will investigate the synthesis of transition cyclometalated complexes.  The study of these complexes may advance the understanding of fundamental catalytic reactions and eventually contribute in areas with energy implications, as cyclometalated complexes are well known in the study of artificial photosynthetic devices.  Another very important aspect of this work is that it will involve undergraduates at all levels from first-year to senior students.  It will also allow students to gain experience in many diverse skills and techniques such as synthesis, characterization, and analysis of results.  The students will become well trained in order to continue further scientific studies, disseminate their work through written publications and oral presentations, and develop new hypotheses for testing.\r\n\r\nCyclometalated transition metal complexes are a very versatile group of compounds whose varied applications include acting as catalysts, sensors, artificial photosynthetic devices, and bio-organometallic agents. The effect that ligand architecture exerts on selectivity and reactivity of cyclometalated complexes is important to understand, as the coordination environment determines both reaction functionality and efficacy.  First, the physical and chemical properties of these cyclometalated compounds will be tuned to maximize their benefits, which include catalysis and anti-cancer agents.  Second, studying the regiochemistry of C-H and C-X bond activation will be examined in the area of synthetic chemistry.  Third, several multi-heteronuclear species will be synthesized and their interaction with biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA will be examined",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMetal compounds containing ligands, that bind to the central metal atom with more than one atom, were synthesized and their reactions were studied.  First, most catalytic cycles involve a number of reactions that occur at the metal center and are often regulated as a function of the groups bonded to it.  Catalysts allow a reaction to proceed at milder conditions that might otherwise be needed thus avoiding high pressures or temperatures and hopefully causing less decomposition and using less energy.  We have studied the fundamental mechanisms of oxidative addition and reductive elimination that are observed in many important catalytic cycles.  Understanding the selectivity of these fundamental reactions is of paramount importance when trying to optimize a system.  We examined selective C-C bond formation from platinum compounds which is often necessary in the synthesis of complex target molecules.  Second, we have examined the interaction of light with some of our newly synthesized compounds.  Studying luminescent material is important in the area of sensors and artificial photosynthetic devices.  Specifically, we have examined palladium compounds, which are better known for their catalytic properties and are less studied in the area of photophysics than related platinum compounds.  Third, we have studied our compounds as potential chemotherapeutic agents by examining their interactions with the biomolecules, DNA, RNA, and proteins. In this case, we have utilized multi-metal species examining a possible synergistic effect of the two combined metal centers.  Once again, we are looking into the selectivity of such interactions and how binding affects biochemical processes.  Several manuscripts have been written and published in recent years and thus our results have been disseminated to the scientific community.  Furthermore, numerous undergraduate students have been trained in the field of scientific research and chemical synthesis and reactivity.  These undergraduate students have acquired many laboratory skills and techniques.  This training and education has allowed our students to work in chemical industry and/or attend graduate schools to further their education and training. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig Anderson"
