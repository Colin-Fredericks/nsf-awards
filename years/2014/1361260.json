 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ken Feldman of The Pennsylvania State University is developing efficient methods to prepare human hormone receptor binding agents to serve as potential drug candidates.  This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation.  These methods are based upon preliminary discoveries in Dr. Feldman's laboratory involving new approaches to stitch together small pieces of molecules in order to form larger chemical structures with control over molecular shape.  These product molecules will aid in understanding the structural features that contribute to selective association with one hormone receptor over another. The funded research also includes studies on marine water remediation techniques, and the broader impacts of this latter work might include improvements in the quality of husbandry for marine ornamentals.\r\n\t\r\nThe chemistry features a new approach to forming indolidenes, reactive indole-derived species that engage in bond formation to append either five-membered rings or seven-membered rings onto the indole framework.  Since indoles with appended rings constitute important targets for drug discovery, this chemistry may impact several areas of pharmaceutical science.  More specifically, preliminary reports ascribe a remarkable selectivity for activating the human progesterone receptor over other hormone receptors by a five-membered ring appended indole called lecanindole D, a naturally occurring fungal-derived material.  The investigation of the structural basis for this selectivity is a major thrust of the funded research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ability to access chemical structures featuring indole cores with attached complex, functionalized rings can contribute to the identification of new medicinal chemistry leads.  In particular, indoles with cyclopentanoid and cycloheptanoid rings attached at C(2)/C(3) of the indole core are challenging targets with current synthesis methodology, despite the fact that several such structures have promising biological activities.  The research executed under CHE-1361360 was designed to impact on this problem by introducing new methods to prepare these types of structures in an efficient manner from relatively simple precursors.  The cyclopentanoid-indoles could be prepared in a single step via a cascade cyclization/cycloaddition sequence of an allenyl azide precursor with a pendant alkene, passing through a transient indolidene intermediate.  The net result is the formation of one new C&ndash;N bond and two new C&ndash;C bonds in a single operation, with good control of selectivity issues.  The derived polycyclic structures map closely into the indolosesquiterpenoid family of naturally occurring alkaloids.  In conceptually related chemistry, cycloheptanoid-indole species can be formed by a cyclocondensation of an intermediate indolidenium cation with an electron-rich diene.  In this sequence, two new C&ndash;C bonds are formed.  The derived products are relevant to the synthesis of members of the ambiguine family of indolocycloheptanoid alkaloids.  The concise formation of these types of cyclopentanoid- and cycloheptanoid-indole compounds should permit this chemistry to serve as an entry point for the total synthesis of cognate alkaloids and analogues of medicinal interest.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ken S Feldman"
