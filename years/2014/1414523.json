 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex plasmas, also known as dusty plasmas, consist of ions, electrons and charged dust, tiny solid particles much smaller than the width of a human hair. Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community, due to the fact that dust and ionized gas are found in most space environments, including the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings, and noctilucent clouds in the earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also present on Earth in applied settings. They are formed in the chemically active gases used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield. Dust contamination within fusion devices is also an issue, since dust produced through erosion of the containment walls raises both safety (operating instabilities) and health (long-term contamination) concerns. The formation of dust crystals, clusters and strings in laboratory plasmas has also proven to be a capable analog for atomic and molecular systems.  \r\n\r\nCharging of dust grains is a unique and important aspect of dusty plasmas. Understanding the physics behind this charging and subsequent formation of dust structures immersed within plasma has proven to require nuanced details. The charge acquired by the dust grains is determined by the plasma environment, but the charged particles in turn influence this environment. Local variations in the charge, either over the surface of a single dust grain or the multiple dust grains comprising a larger structure, can affect both the grain's local dynamics and the evolution of the overall system. Many situations introduce asymmetries into this problem, making the charge difficult to describe analytically. Complicating factors include variations in space (due to geometry of the dust structure or of the plasma environment) as well as variations in time (due to the response of the plasma to the moving dust grains or stochastic charging processes). The dust charge is also extremely difficult to determine in experiments. Thus, the primary objective of this research is to determine how variations in charge in both time and space influence and respond to the dynamics and configuration of dust particles in plasma environments.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this goal, numerical modeling techniques will be combined with laboratory experiments to provide a proper understanding of the processes governing the system behavior.  Numerical models will be used to model temporal and spatial charge variation over the dust structures, including stochastic effects to resolve the variations in time due to the discrete nature of the plasma particles.  The charging will also be linked to numerical models of the plasma environment which define the response of the plasma to boundary conditions and the dust itself.  Simultaneously, laboratory experiments will employ state-of-the-art techniques to control and confine the dust within dust clouds, strings, clusters, and aggregates in order to use them as in situ probes to measure the local plasma environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDusty plasmas consist of ions, electrons and charged solid particles, commonly referred to as dust, ranging in size from a few tens of nanometers to several tens of micrometers.  One of the interesting features of dusty plasmas is the ability of the dust particles to \"self-organize\" into a wide variety of structures such as dust crystals and helical strings.\n\nDusty plasmas are of interest in the astrophysics community, due to the fact that dust and ionized gas are found almost everywhere in space.  Dusty plasmas make up the clouds from which stars and planets form, cometary tails, planetary rings, and the glowing noctilucent clouds which are seen high in the earth's ionosphere.\n\nThe goal of this project is to use laboratory experiments and computer simulations to determine how dust particles charge in response to the plasma environment, and how the charge on the dust influences the behavior of the charged particles in the plasma (Image 1).  This interplay between plasma and dust determines in large part the formation of dust structures.  The structure and dynamics of the charged dust, which can be viewed with a video camera, can be used as an analog for atomic and molecular systems, which are not easy to view directly due to their small size.  The structure of the dust can also be used as analogs for larger systems, such as the \"lunar swirls\" which are patterns of dust seen on the moon (Image 6).\n\nAs part of this project, experimental techniques were developed to allow dust particles ten times smaller than the width of a human hair to be used as probes to learn about the plasma environment.  Video images were analyzed to determine the velocity and acceleration of the dust, and from this to reconstruct the electric and magnetic forces which push on the dust particles. \n\nNew techniques were also developed to analyze the very small thermal motion, or \"jitter\", of the dust particles once they are \"trapped\" in stable dust structures.

It was found that the fluctuating charge on a grain (which occurs due to collection of ions and electrons at random times) changes the growth process of dust aggregates (larger collections of dust particles), creating \"fluffier\" dust structures (Image 3).  This finding may shed light on the way that planets form from gas and dust.  It may also help explain the growth of the fine-grained rims observed on chondrules, providing a second astrophysical application of this research.  Chondrules are millimeter-sized inclusions found in some meteorites.  The rims around chondrules are thought to have formed in the protoplanetary disk as planets are forming.  Numerical simulations of rim growth from charged and uncharged dust can be compared with laboratory measurements taken on meteorite samples (Image 4).  This can help us understand the conditions that were present which led to the formation of our solar system.\n\nA final outgrowth of the study of the variations in the particle charge and its effect on the overall dust structure was an interdisciplinary effort to study the transport properties within a two-dimensional system.
