The research program involves synthesis of GaAs-based thin films with dilute nitride-bismide incorporation.  The ultimate goal is to understand the film growth mechanisms and correlate them with materials properties. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students benefit from working together in an interdisciplinary scientific learning environment across disciplines of chemistry, physics, and engineering. The established collaboration constitutes an advantageous approach, benefitting from the complementary expertise of investigators covering experiment and theory. The new knowledge gained is broadly disseminated through publications and presentations, and curriculum development. Outreach activities emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: This project aims for greater understanding and better control of the incorporation of N and Bi into GaAs-based superlattices and heterostructures, over length-scales ranging from sub-nanometer, to tens of nanometers to micrometers. A primary goal of the project is to develop new understanding of epitaxial growth, solute incorporation, carrier compensation, and thermal stability of GaAsNBi alloys and heterostructures. Specifically, strain-balanced GaAsN/GaAsBi heterostructures and superlattices, and GaAsNBi alloys are synthesized using plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy, with various dopants, group V sources, and vicinal substrates. The nanoscale structural characteristics are determined using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The composition-dependence of band offsets in GaAsN/GaAsBi heterojunctions and superlattices is explored. The experimental work is complemented by a set of computational studies, including continuum and effective-mass based calculations. The project at the University of Michigan involves collaborations with scientists at the University of Notre Dame, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Wroclaw University (Poland), the University of College Cork, and the Tyndall Institute (Ireland).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit \n\nDue to their significant energy band gap bowing, dilute nitride-bismide semiconductor alloys are promising for various optoelectronic applications including long-wavelength light-emitters and detectors, high-performance electronic devices, and high efficiency solar cells. For example, there have been many reports of tailoring the bandgap of InGaAsN (and related alloys) by varying the In and N fraction while maintaining near lattice-matching to Ge or GaAs.  However, to achieve low threshold current lasers and high efficiency solar cells, N-related defects that trap carriers need to be mitigated by high temperature rapid-thermal annealing.  Alternatively, GaAsNBi is predicted to provide bandgap reductions similar to those of InGaAsN using substantially lower N fractions, with corresponding lower concentrations of N-related defects.  In addition, the temperature-insensitivity of the refractive index and energy bandgap of GaAsNBi is attractive for long-wavelength light-emitters.   Furthermore, the dependence of valence band spin-orbit splitting on Bi fraction is expected to enable highly selective spin valves.  Finally, since the conduction band minimum (CBM) of GaAsBi and the valence band minimum (VBM) of GaAsN are approximately aligned with the CBM and VBM of GaAs, with corresponding significant valence and conduction band-offsets, GaAsBi/GaAsN is predicted to exhibit a 'staggered' Type II bandoffset.  The resulting spatial separation of charge and optical absorption at wavelengths smaller than the fundamental bandgap, on either side of the junction, is promising for both infrared detectors and solar cells.  Prior to our project, very few groups had successfully grown GaAsNBi alloys.   Building upon our expertise in the growth of GaAsN and GaAsBi alloys, we examined their combination in alloys, with an eye towards engineering lattice-matched structures for optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and electronics.  During the course of the project, our team made several important contributions to understanding epitaxial growth, solute incorporation, carrier compensation, and thermal stability of GaAsNBi alloys, including the following:\n\nRevealed the influence of Bi on N incorporation in GaAsNBi alloys\nDiscovered a new magic ratio for lattice-matching of GaAsNBi alloys to GaAs\nDeveloped a new map of the composition-bandgap relationship for GaAsNBi alloys\nIdentified the Bi impurity state in GaAsNBi\nIdentified the role of incorporating surfactants on chemical ordering in GaAsN:Bi\nDiscovered the influence of arsenic species on the growth and electronic properties of GaAsBiN alloys\nProgressed toward GaAsN/GaAsBi band offset measurements\nIdentified the dominant interstitial complex in GaAsN alloys \nDiscovered the role of surface reconstruction on dopant incorporation in GaAsBi alloys\nDiscovered new approach to measure the effective mass in dilute nitride alloys \n\n\nBroader Impact\n\nDuring the 5-years of the project, 9 graduate, 16 undergraduate, and 5 high school students participated in the research, leading to 11 archival publications, 41 student conference talks, and 24 PI/co-PI invited talks.   The cohort included 11 female students including 2 female graduate students, 5 female undergraduate students, and 4 female high school students.  In addition, the cohort included 2 URM graduate students, both partially supported by AGEP supplements, and 1 URM high school student, supported by the MRSEC.  All of the students learned about novel semiconducting alloys and their importance for electronic and optoelectronic device applications.  In addition, the students learned various technical skills including ultra-high vacuum techniques, AutoCad design, and Mathematica programming.  Due to the experimental emphasis of our research, the students have several opportunities to work in a team.  In addition, both undergraduate and graduate students attend weekly group meetings, which often consist of a presentation from one of the students.  A significant percentage of the undergraduate students who have participated in this project have enrolled in graduate school following their graduation.
