 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a fast, refreshing holographic 3D display in reflection geometry using highly sensitive photorefractive (PR) polymers. Currently available refreshable PR 3D display uses transmission geometry with refreshing time slower than that required for many display applications. The PI proposes a transformative approach that uses carrier multiplying sensitizers to develop fast refreshing reflection holograms.  Efficient charge transfer and excellent miscibility with other PR components will be achieved by suitably functionalizing the sensitizer. Transient four-wave mixing measurements will be used to determine the PR properties of the samples. \r\n\t\r\nIntellectual Merits: The proposed work will provide new insights into carrier generation, multiplication and separation when inorganic and graphene quantum dot sensitizers are used in PR polymer. The proposed approach of carrier multiplication is appropriate for PR polymers since an external electric field capable of rapidly separating the charges is typically required for its operation. In addition, holographic 3D display in reflection geometry developed using this highly optimized sample will provide fast refreshing time, many perspectives of the image and wide viewing angles. \r\nBroader Impact: A holographic reflection 3D display will be very attractive for several applications including entertainment, product development and urban planning. Furthermore, enhancement of carrier generation and separation using the proposed sensitizers will have a significant impact on improving the quantum efficiency in many other optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices as well. In addition, the theoretical and experimental insight gained from the subject area will be integrated into a polymer photonics course.",
