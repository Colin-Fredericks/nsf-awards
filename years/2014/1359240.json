 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program at Texas A & M University aims to attract undergraduates to careers in social science research and to increase the participation of talented individuals from under-represented groups (e.g., African Americans and Latinos). The Departments of Sociology (SOCI) and Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning (LAUP) collaborate to host this REU Site that brings undergraduate students majoring in sociology, planning, and related disciplines to participate in an eight-week Summer Institute focusing on Studies of Inequality and Social Vulnerability. The primary student activities are participating in a faculty-supervised research project leading to a research paper and presentation at a professional conference, while upporting activities include a seminar providing grounding in theory, data, and methods relevant for research projects; two research field trips; and workshops on opportunities for graduate education and research careers. The site theme \"Studies of Social Inequality and Social Vulnerability\" reflects the expertise of the researcher mentors from SOCI & LAUP and is proven effective in attracting applications from African American and Latino students. The eight research mentors have strong research and mentoring credentials and prior experience in overseeing successful NSF REU and SBE programs. \r\n\r\nStudents are incorporated into the ongoing research programs of the mentors and assigned individual research projects. Selected examples include: documenting disparities in socioeconomic, residential, and health outcomes by race and poverty-income status; assessing differential vulnerability of social groups to natural and technical hazards; assessing how hazards (e.g., hurricanes and floods) differentially impact ethnic minority, low income, and other vulnerable populations; investigating correlates, causes, and consequences of residential segregation by race and income; conducting historical case studies of the evolution of residential segregation over time in selected cities; and assessing variation in recovery from the impact of hazards. Diversity goals will be served by practices used in prior successful REU Sites. These include working closely with faculty at minority serving universities that have limited STEM student research opportunities to identify promising, motivated students with interests in graduate education and research careers. The proposed REU Site draws on the faculty expertise and institutional resources of two nationally prominent doctoral departments to provide students intensive research experiences based on participating in ongoing research projects, some funded by NSF, relating to social inequality and social vulnerability. Students undertake individual projects directed by faculty mentors and designed to be feasible over the summer institute and within the capabilities of advanced undergraduates. Although the mmediate contributions of student projects to science could be modest, the larger intellectual merit is enhancing student research capabilities, understanding of and interest in research, and odds of going on to graduate education and research careers.",

Students additionally participated in related activities including: daily seminar meetings reviewing topics of theory development, research design, data acquisition and management, and methods of data analysis relevant for the research projects; field trips oriented to research methods and professional development; and research related workshops and presentations meeting with professionals in the field to discuss opportunities for graduate education and research careers.\n\nStudents were recruited from around the country and were selected into the program based on their prior academic accomplishments and the encouragement of a ?home campus mentor? who recommended them for the program and provided mentoring when the student returned to their home institution.  In all 28 students participated over the three years of summer institutes.  The site theme, Studies of Social Inequality and Social Vulnerability, reflected the expertise of the researcher mentors from SOCI &amp; LAUP.  In all thirteen TAMU faculty researchers served as mentors to REU students and another six graduate students served as assistants working closely with the REU students. \n\nThe REU students conducted a wide range of individual research projects.  Selected examples include: documenting disparities in socioeconomic, residential, and health outcomes by race and poverty-income status; assessing differential vulnerability of social groups to natural and technical hazards; assessing how hazards (e.g., hurricanes and floods) differentially impact ethnic minority, low income, and other vulnerable populations; investigating correlates, causes, and consequences of residential segregation by race and income; conducting historical case studies of the evolution of residential segregation over time in selected cities; investigating using new research tools, such as Google Street View for gathering pre-disaster data on housing and infrastructure; investigating health impacts of pollution; investigating the impact of changes in public transportation in urban areas; investigating the factors contributing to disparities in educational attainment; and assessing variation in recovery from the impact of hazards.\n\nEach student presented their research at an end-of-program research symposium.  They received feedback on their work and used it to refine and revise their research.  They then presented their research at a professional conference where they were able to meet with scholars and researchers in the fields of sociology and urban planning and receive additional feedback on their research.  While attending conferences students also had opportunities to attend workshops on graduate training options and potential careers in sociology and urban planning.  Most students who participated in the program later applied to graduate programs in sociology or urban planning to continue pursuing their interests in their chosen field.\n\nIntellectual Merit: The REU Site drew on the faculty expertise and institutional resources of nationally prominent doctoral departments in Sociology and Urban Planning to provide undergraduate students an intensive research experience based on participating in ongoing research projects relating to social inequality and social vulnerability.  In addition to the results produced by their research projects, the larger intellectual merit of the program is that it enhanced student research capabilities, expanded their understanding of and interest in research, and for those who were interested supported their goals of going on to graduate education and research careers.\n\nBroader Impacts: The program helped talented undergraduate students, including many members of under-represented groups, pursue their interests in pursuing relevant advance training and careers in research in sociology and planning by imparting skills and experiences and professional mentoring to enhance students? prospects for success in graduate education and research careers. Students who participated in the program gained insights into how basic science research is conducted, how scientists work with community-level practitioners and stakeholders, and also how scientific findings can be translated into effective practices in communities.  Through field trips they also gained appreciation of how disadvantaged and vulnerable communities can benefit from program practices based on meeting with program directors, clients, and other stakeholders.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Fossett"
