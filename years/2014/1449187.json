 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes a research study and a workshop, both aimed at bringing together theory, practice, and evidence-driven discussion. It will be guided by two objectives: (1) understanding faculty engagement, and (2) strengthening faculty engagement. These will be considered in relation to institutional environment support and the capacity for transformative research. Key activities will include an integrated analysis of faculty and institutional data within the context of a self-determination theory of motivation, and a holistic envisioning of academic research careers by experts and stakeholders.  A distinctive exploratory aspect of the research study is the use of  statistical modeling to investigate questions that have not been addressed before in large-scale surveys related to faculty satisfaction and retention.  \r\n\r\nThe study will include a focus on career-life balance to better understand faculty engagement and persistence in academic STEM careers.  The study team will plan and convene a workshop to synthesize recent work encompassing career life balance and broader impacts (BI) infrastructure, share and stimulate promising practices, and develop recommendations for institutional action. The project will influence institutional opportunities to enhance faculty engagement, career life balance, gender equality in STEM careers, and BI infrastructure. The use of COACHE data may inform cross-institutional policies and practices to support faculty and potentially benefit hundreds of colleges and universities. Open access to research and workshop results will be provided using Iowa State's Digital Repository.",
