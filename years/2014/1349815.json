 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Aditi S. Bhaskar has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at the United States Geological Survey.  Novel forms of urban development aim to engineer systems that replicate natural hydrologic functioning.  This includes preservation of near-natural groundwater recharge through infiltration of stormwater close to impervious surfaces where stormwater is generated.  A small watershed in the Piedmont province of Maryland, USA is one of the first instrumented watersheds that was recently developed entirely with novel, distributed stormwater management techniques and is used as a case study for the work.  This study seeks to understand how these alterations to the natural landscape impact subsurface flow systems and groundwater - surface water interactions.  A network of field observations will be used, including measurements of streamflow, precipitation, hydraulic head, infiltration from and specifications of stormwater control measures, and hydraulic conductivity.  The field data will inform the application of a three-dimensional, distributed hydrologic model, building on experience applying the same modeling system to other urban areas.  \r\n\r\nThe work will advance our understanding of how urban development alters hydrologic functioning.  Mitigation strategies, such as distributed stormwater management, may transform the water cycle in previously unseen ways.  Distributed infiltration of stormwater may result in groundwater recharge above pre-development levels.  This means that water that might have evaporated or been transpired by plants in a natural system, or generated stormflow in a conventionally developed urban system, is instead redirected to groundwater pathways.  The implications of these potentially major water cycle alterations are as yet unknown but may include significant changes to riparian ecology and biogeochemical cycling in ways that are not well understood.  Understanding the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies in mimicking natural hydrologic functioning will provide a window into both the drivers of the natural hydrologic system and the landscape changes to which the natural system is most sensitive.  Dr. Bhaskar will work with student researchers and will carry out education outreach to high schools in the area of the developed watershed for hands-on presentations about earth science, hydrology, groundwater, and connections to this research project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn an urbanizing world, the importance of quantifying the alterations and mitigation of hydrologic functioning of urban areas has become critical. This project focused on a watershed in the Piedmont province of Maryland, USA, which is one of the first instrumented watersheds developed entirely with distributed, infiltration-focused stormwater management techniques, also called Low Impact Development (LID) or green infrastructure. \n\nStream base flow in the study watershed was found to have increased during urbanization, relative to two nearby control watersheds.  Furthermore, total stream flow also increased during urbanization relative to the control watersheds.  These changes in flow could be the result of the combined effects of decreasing evapotranspiration, with increasing impervious surface cover, and greater recharge from infiltration-focused stormwater management as the watershed urbanizes.  These observations of changes to flow in the study watershed highlight the importance of considering both recharge and evapotranspiration of stormwater in order to mimic natural hydrologic functioning using novel stormwater management.\n\nAnother part of this project was the development of a framework to predict the effects of urbanization on stream base flow in diverse urban, climatological, and physiographic settings.  Stream base flow responds variably to urbanization according to the diverse processes of urban development and pre-development drivers of base flow.  The ecological effects of changing the stream base flow regime were summarized, and the factors that may be used to predict the direction of change were included in a decision framework that could be applied to areas undergoing urbanization. \n\nAs part of this project, the postdoctoral fellow contributed to training undergraduate and graduate students and conducted outreach to high school Environmental Science classrooms in the vicinity of the study watershed.  Also, a web-mapping application was developed using aerial imagery of the region before, during, and after development so that the rapid change in land use and land cover was visible to the general public. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aditi S Bhaskar"
