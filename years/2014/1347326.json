 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conference to be held at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, June 16-20, 2014. The topic is Quantum Spin Systems. The distinguished lecturer will be Professor Bruno Nachtergaele from UC Davis. The lectures will address foundations, but also recent developments such as Lieb-Robinson bounds and their applications to statistical mechanics and quantum information theory.\r\n\r\nThe NSF/CBMS program focuses on important and timely research, with 10 lectures delivered by a leading researcher. We will fund approximately 30 participants, especially including graduate students and young researchers. A critical aspect of the NSF/CBMS conference is the production of a monograph by the distinguished lecturer. Bruno Nachtergaele's notes on quantum spin systems will be very welcome both by students and practitioners in the field. One of the applications of the mathematical topic is quantum information theory, including quantum computation.",
