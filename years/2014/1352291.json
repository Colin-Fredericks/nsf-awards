 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study the existence and distribution of rational points on algebraic surfaces defined over global fields.  The proposed research has two mayor component projects. The first focuses on K3 surfaces: building on earlier work of the PI and his collaborators, and with a view towards arithmetic applications, the PI will pursue systematic, conceptual and practical methods to explicitly construct unramified Azumaya algebras representing transcendental Brauer classes on K3 surfaces. The second project focuses on del Pezzo surfaces:  proving new cases of a conjecture of Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Sansuc that Brauer-Manin obstructions suffice to explain failures on local-to-global phenomena for del Pezzo surfaces, efficient computation of these obstructions on low-degree surfaces, and statistics on failures of the Hasse principle.\r\n\r\nAn overarching theme in arithmetic geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations in many variables, with the constraint that the coordinates of the solutions be rational numbers or integers (for example, 11/17, or -9). When no such solutions exist, one tries to understand the phenomena behind the absence of solutions. The geometry associated to a system of polynomials bears on the possible obstructions to the existence of solutions, and this project seeks to make such an intuition precise in some cases when a system of polynomial equations defines a surface. Although this project studies fundamental questions from a theoretical point of view, the structure of solutions to certain kinds of polynomial equations has well-documented applications (for example, in establishing secure protocols for the transmission of information between two parties that have never met). In addition to research activities, the PI will run a two-week program each summer for the duration of the grant. The goal of the program is to foster enrollment and persistence rates in STEM majors at the college level. The target demographic consists of rising 8th and 9th graders from the Houston Independent School District, including students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The content of the program is foundational material in the study of rational solutions to polynomial equations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project addressed foundational questions on Diophantine equations.  Perhaps the most famous such equation is the one associated to Fermat's Last Theorem: xn + yn = zn.  For any fixed exponent, this is a polynomial in three variables, of the kind one learns about in middle school.  The simplicity is deceiving: showing that for any n greater than two the equation has only \"silly solutions\", where at least one coordinate is zero, involves some of the deepest Mathematics humans have invented.\nThe results of this award put us on a path to develop algorithms that take as input certain Diophantine equations, and output YES or NO, according to whether the equations have a solution or not.  It has been known since the 1970s that a universal algorithm to do this for all Diophantine equations cannot exist.  But an algorithm might exist if one is willing to restrict the class of Diophantine equations considered.\nDiophantine equations have geometric avatars: spaces whose points correspond to solutions of the original equations.  The geometry of an equation's space bears dramatically on the kind of solutions to the equation one might expect.  The PI performed a systematic study of Diophantine equations whose geometric avatars are surfaces. He used the geometric classification of surfaces to guide the choice of Diophantine equations studied.  Given the spectacular advances on the geometry of K3 surfaces going back to the 1980s, the study of Diophantine equations whose geometric spaces are K3 surfaces was timely.\nThe PI found that one could use ideas discovered during this project to construct ways of encoding information that build a modest amount of redundancy into data so that small loses of data can be \"repaired\".  This has important applications in large-scale storage systems, like cloud storage.  \n In a more theoretical direction, an important contribution of this project is a conjecture on a universal bound for the structure of symmetries attached to a K3 surface known as its Brauer group.  Several project outcomes furnish a body of evidence for this conjecture:\n(1) The PI and Bianca Viray proved the existence of universal bounds on Brauer groups of K3 surfaces for specific classes of 1-parameter families of surfaces.\n(2) The PI and Dan Abramovich showed how conjectures of Lang and Vojta imply similar universal bounds for torsion structures on Abelian Varieties, which are spiritual cousins of K3 surfaces.\n(3) The PI and Sho Tanimoto determined that the geometry of certain spaces parametrizing symmetries of a K3 surface are themselves very negatively curved, suggesting these symmetries become constrained as the complexity of the corresponding K3 surface increases.\nDividends of the above investigations included:\n(4) The PI, together with Nicolas Addinton, Brendan Hassett and Yuri Tschinkel produced the first new examples of rational cubic fourfolds in 20 years.  Such fourfolds are expected to be exceedingly rare.\n(5) Together with Alexander Barg, Everett Howe, Kathryn Haymaker, and Gretchen Matthews, the PI constructed locally recoverable codes from curves and surfaces with good properties for use in large-scale storage systems.\nThe project funded several activities with direct societal impact:\n(6) A two-week Math summer program for ten middle school students from the Houston Independent School District, called \"Patterns, Math &amp; You\", hosted four times at Rice's campus.  The goal of the program was to teach middle school students enough college-level number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA cryptosystem.  The program was wildly successful.  Attached you can see students from the 2015 and 2018 programs.\n(7) The PI advised nine PhD students (Olivia del Guercio, Austen James, Alexis Johnson, Isaiah Mindich, Masahiro Nakahara, Jack Petok, Zac Spaulding, Stephen Wolff, and Ken Zheng), and mentored eight post-doctoral scholars (Jennifer Berg, John Calabrese, Anastassia Etropoloski, Sarah Frei, Daniel Hast, Ye Luo, Richard Shadrach, and Sho Tanimoto).  \nFive of the PIs students graduated; the remaining four will soon.  Nakahara is completing a post-doctoral position at the University of Washington. Johnson has since turned her focus to industry with a focus on data science. Petok is completing a post-doctoral position at Dartmouth College.  James took on a data science position at FlexPort in the Seattle area, and Wolff is now looking for employment in cybersecurity.\nThe post-doctoral fellows have gone on to a spectrum of careers.  Calabrese, Etropolski, and Shadrach have begun careers in software engineering or data science; Berg is an Assistant Professor at Bucknell University; Tanimoto is an Associate Professor at Nagoya (Japan); Luo and Hast went on to do further post-doctoral work.  Frei is now doing a second postdoc at Dartmouth.  \n(9) The PI was also involved in the American Mathematical Society, as an elected member-at-large of the society's council, and as a member of the Committee on Science Policy.  He visited Capitol Hill on multiple occasions to advocate for federal funding of scientific enterprises.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Varilly-Alvarado"
