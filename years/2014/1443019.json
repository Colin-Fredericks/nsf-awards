 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing number of cyber attacks on the Internet and other critical infrastructure has led to an increased sense of urgency in developing a better understanding of the motivation and methods behind such incursions. This project develops a research infrastructure for the Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) community comprised of experts across the computer, information, and social sciences. \r\n\r\nThe infrastructure consists of online archives and analysis tools. The archives contain a wide array of open source data including: discussions in online forums run by hackers, data from botnet command and control servers used to stage computer attacks, video streams and tweets and news summaries from economically and politically unstable states and regions. The analysis tools developed for this project support a range of research investigations. The social network analysis tool allows researchers to study how organizations form and how people interact with one another both virtually and in person. The data visualization tools are important for helping researchers pick out important patterns and trends in large sets of data of different types and from disparate sources. A new tool for adversarial data mining and deception detection allows researchers to deepen their enquiries and analysis of the intentions behind cyber-attacks. \r\n\r\nIntegrating these divergent data sources allows the security research community to more easily collaborate with other members of the community, rapidly test hypotheses, evaluate detection techniques, track down malicious actors, and identify weaknesses in a cyberinfrastructure network.",
