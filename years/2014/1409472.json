 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF ADVANCE program aims to increase and promote the advancement of women in academic STEM.  The University of Delaware (UD) contributes to broadening the participation of women in the academy through a series of initiatives that focus on leadership development, promotion of mid-career women in STEM, development of transparent policies for faculty recruitment, retention and promotion as well as enhanced data collection on faculty and a focus on improving the climate for women faculty from underrepresented groups. Women Faculty To Leadership, the W2L program reframes campus leadership training to the top -  the Office of the Provost with faculty.  Campus leaders will partner with women faculty to develop strategies to lower the barriers to advancement.  The data collection, through system climate studies and faculty exit interviews, will enhance the institutional knowledge of the issues that faculty encounter, particularly STEM women of color, so that the institution may develop plans for improvement.\r\n\r\nThe University of Delaware proposes a clear analytical framework that, in its simplicity, may have tremendous impact on future thinking and action.  They propose a multi-level approach, the hourglass, that shows how to link the upper level administrative strategies with grassroots strategies proposed by faculty.  The middle area is a space where department chairs may connect the upper and lower portions to create more balance in the system.  This is the underlying rationale for the programming that composes the W2L activity and other aspects of the project.  Prior research on sources of barriers for advancing women in STEM identifies department chairs and heads as key players in shaping the work climate, specifically the microclimate of the department, at colleges and universities that may slow women's progress.  Another example is that UD will create a mentoring academy for department chairs to share current research on how to improve departmental climate.  W2L's regional conference will help to disseminate to a national audience findings from this project related to broadening participation of women in academic STEM. The resulting a partnership of women faculty of color and university leadership will serve as a model for academia in general to become a more inclusive environment.",

The goals were to be accomplished via four objectives (see below). This report overviews example key project outcomes by objective and assesses the goals. Referenced&nbsp;resources are posted at www.udel.edu/advance.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 1: Improve departmental microclimates for women faculty, especially women of color.</strong>&nbsp;This work involved identifying issues that contributed to negative departmental climates and partnering with administrators to address them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One outcome is a series of \"talking points\" -- data-driven information and best practices related to faculty diversity at UD and nationally, designed to encourage positive changes. Data provided by UD's Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness (OIRE) were invaluable in achieving this outcome. Talking points were updated on a regular basis, posted online, and communicated to provosts, deans, and chairs in meetings and workshops and in brochures and other products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another outcome is a longitudinal survey study of faculty members' satisfaction&nbsp;with several dimensions of their work at UD. UD ADVANCE developed the survey in 2014 and collected and analyzed data in 2014, 2016, and 2018. In 2020 UD joined a national survey (Harvard's COACHE) that allowed benchmarking of results against those of other participating institutions. Results from all years' surveys are available online. Several improvements resulted from the surveys, for example, stronger faculty mentoring policies for assistant professors and instructors, a protocol for dual-career hiring, resources to support faculty through promotion and tenure, and mentoring focused on associate professors. A separate, complementary interview study of women faculty of color resulted in recommendations for improving departmental climate with accompanying workshops for department chairs.</p>\n<p>A third outcome is three Women of Color Roundtables for UD administrators featuring national and local panelists, leaders in their academic disciplines and institutions, who spoke about their experiences as faculty of color and facilitated discussions. Recommendations for improving departmental and institutional climate resulting from these events have been distributed to chairs and deans and are posted online.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 2. Educate, mentor, and support women STEM faculty, especially women post-tenure and women of color.</strong>&nbsp;For this objective the ADVANCE team worked more directly with faculty. Outcomes include several themed panels and networking events per year, many aimed at STEM faculty. Example topics include recommendations from colleagues on achieving tenure and promotion, work-life balance, and what to do when your grant is rejected. Notes from many sessions are posted online. Another outcome was a favorably reviewed leadership retreat for 18 women faculty through a partnership with UD's business school. A third outcome was a series of mini-grants awarded to women faculty aimed at supporting women to leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 3. Increase transparency of policies, procedure, and practices that affect faculty careers and enhance institutional data gathering, analysis, and presentation.</strong>&nbsp;Work under this objective was in partnership with OIRE, the administration, the Faculty Senate, and the Faculty Union. One outcome is a brochure that consolidates and communicates UD's family-friendly policies for faculty that is posted online and distributed to faculty candidates. Another is diversity dashboards on the OIRE website that provide detailed data on faculty diversity at UD. Other outcomes include the creation or revision of policies, such as the use of student evaluations of teaching, dual-career services for faculty, and policies for fair evaluation of faculty that consider the COVID-19 pandemic (UD won third place in the 2021 NSF COVID STEM Challenge for work surrounding COVID policies for faculty).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 4. Coordinate and draw attention to actions and discussions of diversity around campus.</strong>&nbsp;The UD ADVANCE Institute hosted numerous events aimed to highlight faculty diversity and foster discussion. A significant outcome was a 2016 national research conference entitled \"Women of Color in the Academy: What's Next?\", which brought over 175 participants from 50 institutions to UD. Another outcome was a series of talks delivered at UD by nationally known experts on faculty diversity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Goals.</strong>&nbsp;Of 36 UD STEM and SBS departments, all but five saw an increase in percentage of tenured/tenure-track women faculty between 2014 and 2021. (Of the five, three were majority women throughout this time.) Regarding STEM women faculty in leadership, between 2014 and 2021, the number of women tenured full professors in STEM increased from 44 to 55. The number of women STEM department heads increased from 5 to 7. Notably, the number of women named professors in STEM increased from 7 to 19.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Summary.</strong>&nbsp;To a large degree, the project goals were accomplished. Moreover, research under this project has resulted in numerous peer-reviewed conference presentations and publications and scholarly journal articles.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Heather&nbsp;Doty</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1409472/1409472_10331784_1663778954977_UDADVANCEBrochure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1409472/1409472_10331784_1663778954977_UDADVANCEBrochure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UD ADVANCE Photos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1409472/1409472_10331784_1663778954977_UDADVANCEBrochure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UD ADVANCE Photos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image is an excerpt from an information brochure about UD ADVANCE programming.
