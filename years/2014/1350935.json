 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of reproductive isolation is central to both the process of how new species arise and the origin of biodiversity on the planet. One important criterion for classifying two organisms as separate species is their inability to interbreed. However, little is known about the particular genes that prevent different species from forming viable offspring. The goal of this research is to identify the genes that cause hybrid sterility between two closely related species of the model plant Mimulus (monkeyflowers), a genus of wildflowers native to western North America. With innovative crossing designs and field experiments, this work will determine which genes maintain species, as well as characterize the molecular functions and evolutionary dynamics of these genes in nature. \r\n\r\nThis project represents a significant contribution toward understanding the molecular, genetic, and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the origin of species. This research will generate valuable plant collections and genome sequence data that will add to the general utility of the Mimulus model system. In addition, this proposal details a plan for engaging a broad audience in evolutionary genetics research, including local high school teachers who will develop hands-on Mimulus lab activities for use in their own classrooms. The proposal also includes a plan to reform undergraduate biology education by integrating research into the learning experiences of a diverse student population. In collaboration with a team of education specialists, the principal investigator will develop a Mimulus undergraduate research project for use in the University of Georgia's large enrollment introductory biology course series with the long-term goal of improving student learning and retention in the sciences.",
