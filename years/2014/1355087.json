 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to maintain an internal environment that is separated and distinct from the external environment is fundamental to the survival of all organisms. This function is performed in animals by epithelial tissues, which form or synthesize barriers that are essential for structural integrity, defense against infection, and internal homeostasis. In insects and other invertebrates, epithelia perform their barrier function in part by synthesizing extracellular structures such as the cuticle, eggshell, and peritrophic matrix: durable, cross-linked matrices composed of protein, chitin, lipid, and other small molecules. This award will support research into a novel genetic pathway that is critical to the formation of epithelial barriers in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The specific conservation of drd among insects strongly suggests that the results of the planned studies will be of broad interest to insect biologists and could be relevant in controlling insect-borne disease and developing novel insect control strategies.\r\n\r\nThe gene drop-dead (drd) encodes an integral membrane protein and has traditionally been considered a neurodegeneration gene, due to the short adult lifespan and profound neurodegeneration displayed by drd mutant flies. However, data indicate a defect in the development of multiple epithelial barrier structures in drd mutants. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that drd is required for the formation or stabilization of extracellular epithelial barrier structures. The proposed experiments will use histologic, genetic, and biochemical approaches to characterize the pathways by which the drd gene product regulates barrier formation.  Because insect barrier synthesis is not well understood and because drd was not previously recognized as essential to this process, these experiments will break new ground in our understanding of basic epithelial biology.    The award will support training for 9 undergraduates, including at least three members of underrepresented minority (URM) groups recruited in collaboration with the Educational Opportunity Program at Marquette University. Research results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and at regional or national scientific meetings.  Any fly stocks that are of widespread interest will be donated to the Bloomington stock center (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/) for maintenance and distribution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe survival of any organism depends upon its ability to protect itself from, and to maintain an internal composition distinct from, its environment.  To these ends, all organisms create specialized structures that form the barrier between the environment and the interior of the organism.  Knowledge of how such structures are formed and regulated is critical for an understanding of how different species interact with, and adapt to, their environment.  The focus of this project was on the formation of barrier structures in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster and on the role of the gene Drop-dead, which is required for the formation and proper function of several such barriers.\n\nWe investigated three particular barrier structures during this project: the eggshell that protects the developing embryo, the peritrophic matrix that forms inside of the gut and surrounds ingested food, and the cuticle that lines both the outside of the fly and the inside of its respiratory tract.  In the eggshell, it was previously known that Drop-dead was required for linking of eggshell components into a durable network.  In this project, we found that Drop-dead was not responsible for the actual linking but instead was required to make the eggshell proteins competent to be linked to each other.  We also identified additional genes that are required for eggshell formation.  In the gut, we found that Drop-dead is required for the formation of the peritrophic matrix.  By creating a fly strain that allowed us to visualize the pattern of Drop-dead gene expression, we found that Drop-dead is expressed in the cells of the gut that are responsible for peritrophic matrix synthesis.  We were able to reduce Drop-dead expression and create flies that lacked a peritrophic matrix, and surprisingly these flies survived normally, raising questions about the function of the peritrophic matrix in the adult fly.  Finally, we found that an absence of Drop-dead gene expression in the respiratory system leads to delays in the growth of fly larvae in a manner similar to a lack of oxygen, suggesting a role for Drop-dead in respiratory function.\n\nThis project provided mentored research experiences for 22 undergraduate students, the majority of whom are now pursuing careers in research, healthcare, and education.  Results of the work were disseminated through 11 presentations at national, international, and regional conferences.  Fly strains created during this project, most notably the Drop-dead reporter line described above, have been made available for use by the broader scientific community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward M Blumenthal"
