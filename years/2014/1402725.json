 "awd_abstract_narration": "The western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus, is an important vector of diseases between wildlife and humans in the West, transmitting both Lyme disease and anaplasmosis.  The ecology of these ticks is complicated and poorly understood, with many animal hosts that may serve as intermediaries in the spread of the diseases.  Using next generation DNA sequence data from both ticks and the animal hosts from which they were collected, as well as cutting-edge spatial genetic statistical methods, the researchers investigate (1) whether ticks collected from different host species are more genetically differentiated than would be expected given their geographic separation, and (2) whether the relatedness between host individuals of the same species predicts the relatedness of the ticks that infest them.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to observe the spread of vectors and pathogens in nature, but a grasp of the dynamics that govern the distribution of a disease and its vectors can be of crucial epidemiological or economic importance.  In this study, researchers will use genetic data to uncover critical clues about the natural history and ecology of an important vector of human diseases, as well as valuable insights into the ecology of the diseases themselves.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs environmental conditions change over time, populations that are locally adapted must either adapt to novel conditions or move to track their optimal climatic envelope.  Understanding how these populations respond to environmental change is crucial to predicting the effect of habitat alteration, but it is difficult to learn how populations have responded in the past from occurrence or observational data alone.  Genetic data harvested from museum specimens provides a way forward: the genetic information in a transect across space and time contains the record of how individuals have moved and bred in response to changing conditions.\n\nThe deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, is an excellent system in which to study the effects of changing environmental conditions.  It is an abundant species that adapts readily to local conditions, and it lives in relatively natural habitat (outside of cities and generally far from human structures).  In addition, it is well-represented in museum collections, with dense sampling across many spatial locations throughout North America over the last 100 years.  Many of the areas within its range have experience rapid environmental change in that time, so the museum specimens available offer a direct glimpse into how populations respond and adapt to changing environments.\n\nWith the funds in this grand, I developed a protocol for extracting DNA from historical deer mice specimens and sequencing all of their coding DNA - that is, all the DNA that encodes for the proteins that are the building blocks of the animal.  I then extracted DNA from 180 individual specimens (preserved as skins in a museum's collections), and am in the process of generating DNA sequence data for them.  These data, collected from deer mice in California near Yosemite Valley over the past 100 years, will allow me to reconstruct the history of deer mouse populations in the area.  By comparing the observed change in the genetic makeup of this population to ways in which the environment has changed at its location through time, I will be able to determine how this population has responded to its changing habitat.\n\nThe results of this study will better our understanding of how deer mice have resonded to a changing environment, but will also prove useful for the broader scientific community and for the public as well.  This work demonstrates a method for studying how populations respond to changing environmental conditions, and will therefore serve as a template for other researchers studying the same phenomena.  In addition, the research carried out under this grant showcases in a new way the utility of museum specimens and the light they can shed on the history of species or regions.\n\nAs environmental change continues to shape the world around us, it has become increasingly ecologically and economically urgent to understand how species and populations respond to novel conditions.  By leveraging the information that already exists in museum collections, we can gain a direct glimpse of the processes by which populations respond to, and are affected by, this change.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gideon S Bradburd"
