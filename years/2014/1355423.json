The BioSNTR will use imaging and molecular biology to map the biochemical architecture of plant and animal cells. Technologies to improve crop yields will be developed by applying new knowledge about the ways that molecular circuits signal plant cells to grow and function. Results from BioSNTR activities are likely to have positive economic outcomes for South Dakota's agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe project involves all of the colleges and universities in South Dakota, and is broadening the participation of women, Native Americans and persons with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The BioSNTR will develop a skilled, diverse technical workforce with expertise in bioscience and informatics. South Dakota students will gain entrepreneurial and industrial experience through internship opportunities. BioSNTR is implementing a new PhD program in biochemistry at South Dakota State University and strengthening the computational science programs in several South Dakota universities.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe South Dakota Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) is creating the Biochemical Spatiotemporal NeTwork Resource (BioSNTR), a transdisciplinary, multi-institutional program for systems bioscience research and education.  BioSNTR advances imaging and molecular biology to investigate the sophisticated molecular circuit involved in cell signaling.  Understanding this process is essential for rational manipulation of the cell-biomaterial interface in plant and animal systems.  The vision of BioSNTR is to map the biochemical architecture of this molecular circuit with sufficient resolution that quantitative predictions can be made for effective control and manipulation of cell function. Technological advances from BioSNTR will lead to improvements in crop yields, animal welfare, and human health. Through BioSNTR, South Dakota EPSCoR is improving the state?s physical infrastructure and human workforce in the areas of bioscience and informatics, two scientific growth fields for South Dakota and the nation.",
