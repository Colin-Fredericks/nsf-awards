 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many questions remain about what causes organisms to occur where they do. Answers to those questions are gradually being solved for for plants and animals but little is known about the distribution patterns of microbes. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are beneficial microbes that help plants obtain nutrients, resist diseases, and tolerate drought. This project will study the biodiversity and biogeography of ectomycorrhizal fungi in economically important trees in southern South America such as Nothofagus (southern beech). The main goals of this work are to document the evolutionary history of Nothofagus-associated fungi from South America, determine how environmental variables affect fungal diversity, and understand more about how fungi disperse around the globe. Fungi will be documented by DNA sequencing from environmental samples and via collections of fungal specimens (e.g. mushrooms).\r\n\r\nThis project is an international collaboration that will include research, education, and cultural exchange among biologists, students, and citizen scientists from the USA, Chile, and Argentina. In addition to scientific publications on fungal biodiversity, fungal evolution, and fungi that are new to science, this project will also produce a free, bilingual, online e-book detailing the common and charismatic fungi from Nothofagus forests in Chile and Argentina. This work will increase scientific literacy about fungi in South America and data from the project will enhance native Nothofagus forestry and will inform conservation decision-making for Nothofagus.",

Despite the importance of fungi in shaping the biosphere (especially in their interactions with trees and in forests), very little is still known about the global distribution and evolutionary patterns of fungi. The main aim of this project was to study the biogeography, diversity, and evolutionary history of fungi in southern South America. We focused on this region because the patterns in plants and animals are very distinct but there are minimal data on fungi. This work focused primarily on the extensive fungal diversity in the vast Patagonian Nothofagaceae (Southern Beech) forests because this biome is ecologically important and dominant across a wide area. Nothofagaceae forests in South America stretch &gt;3000 miles from 33&deg;S (near Santiago, Chile) to 55&deg;S (Tierra Del Fuego) at the southern tip of South America.</p>\n<p>The project had many important accomplishments. Our team contributed to an important new field guide for southern South American fungi that was published in 2018 (Guia De Campo Hongos De Chile Vol. 2 by Giuliana Furci), led to the publication of &gt;15 new fungi species, and has resulted in &gt;20 peer reviewed papers (with additional new taxa and manuscripts under peer review for future publication). Our work has also documented southern South American fungal communities using next-generation DNA sequencing from soil and roots and has also yielded a database of &gt;2750 archived and publically available fungal herbarium specimens that can be studied in the future. In addition to the specimens themselves, we generated &gt;1700 fungal DNA barcode sequences (ITS rDNA) from individual specimens and we have deposited representative DNA sequence data from &gt;650 species of South American fungi in public DNA databases (GenBank). Our work overwhelmingly showed that the majority of fungi in southern South American Nothofagaceae forests are close relatives of fungi from Australasia, particularly New Zealand and Australia. This is not completely surprising since Australasia was connected long ago to South America via Antarctica. However, this is an important finding because it shows that the forest fungi that we studied followed similar patterns to plants and animals from the same region. It also suggests that biogeographical factors that influence the distribution patterns of plants and animals also have similar impacts on forest fungi.</p>\n<p>In addition to the important scientific findings of this work it is also important to note the broader impacts that this research had on a wider audience of citizens. This work was conducted with an international team that included Chilean and Argentinian researchers and we conducted both research and outreach activities that took place in both countries. Despite historical animosities between the two neighboring countires, our team was highly collaborative and the project yielded ongoing publication efforts and scientific interactions between researchers from Chile, Argentina and the USA. Important outreach activities included two research symposia in Bariloche, Argentina where scientists and students shared research results, capacity building with the Foundacion Fungi (an organization with focuses on conservation, education, and awareness about fungi in Chile &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.ffungi.org/\">http://www.ffungi.org/</a>), participation on a project at the University of Magallanes on the &lsquo;Diversity and use of edible mushrooms by local communities in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Aysen province&rsquo; which included field excursions with locals and 2 educational workshops for Middle school students. The project also attracted outside funding from other international sources which allowed three South American scientists to visit the USA for extended research visits and facilitated field and laboratory collaboration with two European experts on fungal biodiversity. Perhaps most importantly, this project actively trained &gt;10 citizen scientists, advanced high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students from Chile, Argentina, and the USA on the methods to further explore fungal diversity, biogeography, and ecology in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;E&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354802/1354802_10293305_1538077783974_GiulianawithBoletusLoyo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354802/1354802_10293305_1538077783974_GiulianawithBoletusLoyo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Happy researcher with Butyriboletus loyo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354802/1354802_10293305_1538077783974_GiulianawithBoletusLoyo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Happy researcher with Butyriboletus loyo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Giuliana Furci, Executive Director and Founder of the collaborating non-profit group Fundacion Fungi, displays a fresh collection of Butyriboletus loyo, one of the most important wild edible fungi from Chilean Nothofagus forests.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew E.
