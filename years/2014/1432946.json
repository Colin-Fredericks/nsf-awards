 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes to create a distributed, multi-user social computing environment that will develop the capabilities of human Electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze users engagement with digitally based experiences. For this project, users will wear non-invasive, EEG headsets while navigating a shared virtual world. Beginning with a handful of EEG systems, the team will scale up over the course of the project to gather signals from dozens of users, providing a basis for larger scale studies. By comparing the EEG signals with each participants activities in virtual world, and with the brain activity and the activities of other users, a model of human brain activity will be developed for different types of behavior profiles and subjective states. This will allow significant improvement for the development of neural markers of human perceptual, cognitive and affective states, the parsing of EEG signals, the applicability of EEG interfaces to new types of experiences, all of which can enhance distance learning, collaborative distributed work, improved mobile computing interfaces and health care applications. The project will advance the capabilities for determining an individuals cognitive state by the creation of new computing methods utilizing comparative EEG analysis and data analysis of event states in a digital simulation. Bringing methods of large scale data analysis to articulate patterns across many users in the situated milieu of the online virtual world will create a new method to utilize EEG analysis to infer human subjective experience. The necessity of conducting this analysis in real-time, with data gathered from distributed, wireless EEG instruments will provide the impetus for utilizing accelerated hybrid multi-core techniques to bear on this domain.\r\n\r\nThe results from the project will be applicable for a variety of digital environments including computer aided learning and training, digitally mediated collaborative work environments, visualization of complex data sets, and digitally based entertainment experiences such as virtual worlds and computer games. The project will improve the functionality and outcomes of these digital media environments, better adjusting them to the cognitive states of the users. The PIs will train and employ a diverse body of participants to be involved in these activities. As part of an internship program at the Preuss School, a nationally recognized middle and high school on the campus of UCSD, UCSD faculty and staff mentor high school seniors to provide these students valuable experiences in a research laboratory. In addition, UMBC operates the very successful Meyerhoff program for minority students, primarily African-American, for which over 90% of a yearly entrance number of more than fifty go on to graduate school in science or engineering. Many of these students are computer science majors that have had the elective graduate course of Service Oriented Computing for Scientists and Engineers.",
