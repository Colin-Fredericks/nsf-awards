 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will take a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the response of Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland to climate change in the past. Petermann Glacier drains a significant fraction of the northern Greenland ice sheet and terminates in a large floating ice shelf that is sensitive to ice-ocean interactions. Ice retreat over the last decade opens access to the fjord and presents an opportunity to understand sedimentation processes under the area previously covered by ice shelf and to calibrate reconstructions of past ice shelf variations. Using a variety of technologies and approaches on land, ice, and at sea, the investigators will map the bottom of the fjord in front of and under the ice shelf; reconstruct ocean conditions and their role in ice shelf variations through time; reconstruct the past extent of the glacier on land and the floating ice shelf; and reconstruct local relative sea level. Together these efforts will create a comprehensive picture of the climate conditions and response of the Petermann Glacier to these conditions over the last 10,000 years.\r\n\r\nOf key interest will be the timing, extent, rates of change, and variability (on land and in the sea) during the early Holocene when local relative sea level was over 100 meters higher than today (due to lagging isostatic rebound of the crust in response to deglaciation), but the inland ice sheet was still large relative to today. The investigators will address dynamic responses to multiple interacting variables over a range of response times (from tens to thousands of years) relevant to potential future impacts. Specific research questions include: 1) How sensitive is Petermann ice shelf extent to documented climate changes within the Holocene? 2) Is shelf response independent of, or linked to, variations in the grounded Petermann Glacier, ocean thermal conditions, or relative sea level (i.e., sill depth)? 3) What are the rates of change and variability of these systems in response to early Holocene warming, Neoglacial cooling, and recent warming? The project will support several young investigators and will provide them with both ship and land-based training experiences. The project includes significant international collaborations, with substantial in-kind contributions from non-U.S. sources that add value to the project. Planned outreach includes teacher participation in the field program and meaningful classroom involvement at several levels.",

Complete melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet alone, would raise global sea level by approximately 7 m (23 feet), a level that would impact hundreds of millions of people globally. &nbsp;While warming will inevitably melt ice and slowly raise sea level, we have also seen in the recent past, massive, near instantaneous, break-ups of large sections of the floating extensions of glaciers called ice shelves.&nbsp; These ice shelves stabilize the glacial ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica, protecting them from direct interaction with the ocean.&nbsp; If the ice shelves are destroyed, however, the glacial ice sheet can flow directly into the ocean leading to an accelerated delivery of ice into the ocean and a much more rapid rise in sea level. This is happening now as ice shelves in Greenland and Antarctica are currently breaking up, but we have limited understanding of how and why.&nbsp; This limited understanding of the processes by which ice shelves break up and allow the acceleration of ice flow into the ocean is a major source of uncertainty in our prediction of future sea level rise and is the focus of our research. To look at this problem we participated in a U.S/Swedish collaborative program to Petermann Glacier, the largest of the outlet glaciers in northwest Greenland (Figure 1). Petermann Glacier has a long floating ice shelf that has been actively breaking up over the last decade but, the ice shelf is still large enough to prevent accelerated ice flow from the glacier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The expedition, on the Swedish Icebreaker ODEN (Figure 2), used high-resolution sea floor mapping and visualization techniques, combined with sea floor and land-based sampling to put together a history of the ice shelf and ice sheet over the last 20,000 years.&nbsp; We can derive this information from \"reading\" the maps of the seafloor that show evidence of the advance and retreat of the ice sheet (Figure 3) and combine that information with the analysis of samples that allow us to determine the timing of these events.&nbsp; Our results show that as the last ice age ended (about 20,000 years ago) Petermann Glacier, which at the peak of the ice age covered the entire region, retreated to a position at the mouth of the fjord.&nbsp; It stayed in this position for more than 1000 years but then very rapidly retreated more than 100 km (62 miles) to its current position.&nbsp; The ice shelf in front of the glacier has come and gone over the past 10,000 years with the current ice shelf being a feature of regional cooling about 1000 years ago.&nbsp; During warmer periods, the ice shelf was not present, indicating that continued modern warming could lead to the complete break-up of the ice shelf by mid-21<sup>st</sup> Century with important ramifications for sea level rise.&nbsp; The insights gained from this study will not only allow us to better predict the behavior of this important glacier system, but also allow us to extrapolate these results to other outlet glaciers and thus better inform long-term predictions of potential sea level rise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An unexpected outcome of our work was the discovery that our echo-sounders were also able to image scattering layers in the water column that appear to be related to the different water masses that circulate in the region (Figure 4 and Figure 5).&nbsp;
