 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation program (CRIF),  the University of Wyoming will acquire a time of flight mass spectrometer with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization technology and a liquid chromatograph (MALDI-TOF-LCMS).  In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices.  A laser impinging on the inert matrix embedded with the sample, vaporizes and ionizes the sample.  The ions pass into the mass spectrometer where the masses of the parent ion and its fragment ions are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they are mass analyzed.  The acquisition will strengthen the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. High school, undergraduate and graduate students from rural areas, including Native Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, women, and first-generation college students in Wyoming and surrounding Frontier states will benefit from training with this modern analytical technique. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing analytical methodologies for the rapid and precise analysis of biological and synthetic samples; (b) deciphering of protein folding dynamics and anti-freeze protein function; (c) developing photocatalytic organic materials; (d) developing glycosylated proteins; (e) elucidating cell messaging pathways; (f) studying fundamentals of evolutionary cell biology; and (g) developing clean energy sources.",

Specifically, in the Organic Synthetic Chemistry area the instrumentation acquired through this NSF-MRI grant enabled the characterization of synthetic intermediates and 2-dimmensional polymeric materials, it provided accurate mass measurement capabilities of many synthetic compounds for structure confirmation.  In the area of Analytical Chemistry, the acquired MALDI-ToF/ToF-MS system allowed the characterization of unique protein biomarkers in antibiotic resistant bacteria, while new methodology was developed to increase the signal intensity of peptides and thus the number of proteins identified in a single bottom-up proteomic experiment.  In addition, a novel protocol for the identification of proteins directly from tissue sections is being enabled with the technology acquired through this NSF-MRI award.  Specifically, it is now possible to routinely acquire high spatial and mass resolution molecular images of biological samples (part of a NSF-CMI grant), with plans to extend these analyses to geological samples (NSF-EPSCoR Track 1).\n\nAdvances were also enabled in Molecular Biology &amp; Ecology by measurements made possible thorugh this instrument acquisition.

For example, preliminary data has been obtained with this MS system to characterize the total lipid profiles of bees in support of investigations to decipher the effects of climate change on the survival rates of bees from different geographical origins.  This is a highly significant study as bees are an important pollinator and of great importance to the US economy and human food supply.\n\nLastly, the educational impact of the acquired instrument at the University of Wyoming has been tremendous.  Many students, undergraduate and graduate level, in addition to postdoctoral personnel have benefit from being able to learn this new technology and use it for their research.  The relatively simple technology allows for hands-on work by many students, thus enhancing their educational experience.
