 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical\r\nThis project will take a group of six students each summer (eighteen students in total) to perform research within the A2 collaboration at the MAMI accelerator of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany.  The A2 collaboration uses the continuous wave, up to 1.6 GeV  MAMI electron beam, in combination with the Glasgow Photon Tagging Spectrometer to produce a quasi-monochromatic photon beam.   The experiments performed with this photon beam in the course of this project will investigate the nucleon resonance spectrum by analyzing single and multiple meson photoproduction on the neutron and provide exciting new information on the nucleon polarizabilities through analyses of single and doubly polarized Compton Scattering measurements.  \r\nThe students will be involved in the simulation of reaction channels, analysis techniques and new detectors.  Some will be involved in the development and tests of the new Active Polarized Target, involving tests of material and read-out techniques in a cryogenic atmosphere.  Some will work on programming FPGA chips for uses in an upgraded data acquisition system.  All students will gain experience taking data, monitoring data quality as it is collected and debugging any problems which occur during running, thereby gaining experience in many of the areas of modern nuclear physics.\r\nTo ensure the quality of the experience for the student cohort, to investigate how best to serve the educational needs of students during international research experience and to evaluate the benefits of the program,  the program will be examined using best-practice physics education research-based  techniques.  The students will receive preparatory instruction and training before leaving for Germany and upon return to the US, their projects will continue until they reach conclusion and final reporting.   The results of the nuclear physics and PER components of the program will be published in the relevant journals, with the students receiving full credit, where appropriate.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical\r\nThis project is designed to take a group of six students (eighteen in total) to Mainz, Germany to work on activities within the A2 collaboration at the MAMI accelerator during the summer. The students will have the opportunity to become involved in this collaboration of ca. 100 physicists, as part of the research groups of Professors Downie & Briscoe of the George Washington University (GW).  They will be involved in hardware and software development for the investigation of the structure and dynamics of the nucleon (neutrons and protons). Before the summer, the students will undergo a preparatory phase at GW, where they will learn about the physics background of their planned project, become familiar with the software suites they will use, and begin dialogue with their foreign supervisor using web-conferencing tools.  At the Institut fuer Kernphysik, of the Johnannes Gutenberg university, Mainz, researchers will work with the IRES students on a variety of projects from hardware development and tests for the Active Polarized Target and new trigger detectors, to analysis of experimental data to search for rare meson decays, and simulation studies to plan for future experiments. The students will also have the chance to acquire modern technological skills of wider application, such as FPGA programming.\r\nUpon their return to the US, the IRES cohort will continue their research projects, producing a final report and a presentation which will take place at a special symposium to showcase the students? work.  The students will also be encouraged to apply for the CEU fellowships to present their work in a wider circle.  Throughout the course of the IRES program, the educational benefit to and progress of each student will be monitored by Prof. Teodorescu of GW, with entrance, mid-term, and exit interviews.  Professors Briscoe, Downie and Teodorescu will work together to formulate an educational framework for mentoring students in international research through the study of the ongoing IRES program, and the results of this effort will be published in appropriate physics education research journals.",
