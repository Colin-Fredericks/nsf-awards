 "awd_abstract_narration": "Places of worship are among the most prevalent and visible institutions in communities across the United States. This visibility, though, means that churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other religious congregations are often targets for street crime and ethnic- or even religiously-motivated hate crime. Indeed, it is easy to find hundreds of news reports each year about a religious congregation being victimized by vandalism, theft, arson, or some other crime. Yet, the victimization of religious congregations has received little attention by social scientists. Our research will contribute to the testing and extension of theories of crime and its relationship to community contexts, as well as theories of ethnic conflict and religious persecution.\r\n\r\nThis project will gather nationally representative survey data on the prevalence, pattern, and predictors of victimization of religious congregations along with in-depth interview data with congregational leaders and their experiences with crime. We will compare and contrast the factors that predict street crime victimization with those that predict religiously-motivated hate crime victimization. These data will not only allow social scientists to test theories of crime, ethnic conflict, and religious persecution, but they will also provide the foundation for law enforcement, community, and congregational leaders to prevent and respond to the victimization of places of worship.",

These predominantly affect Jewish and especially Muslim congregations.  By contrast, overall and property crime was predominantly affected by criminal opportunity/routine activities factors; congregation affluence, access to items, and the types of activities hosted by congregations.  Congregations located in areas of high disadvantage (poverty, unemployment, low education) were at greater risk of overall and especially property crime.  The findings suggest that victimization of congregations differs substantially depending on the type of crime.  Bias related crime was strongly related to particular religious traditions--threats of violence were directed predominantly toward Muslim and Jewish congregations.  Religious tradition was largely irrelevant to property crime.   In addition, 37% of Jewish congregations that experienced a violent incident or threat reported it to be religiously biased, and 14% reported it to be ethnically biased, and 17% of Muslim congregations that experienced a violent incident or threat reported that incident to be religiously or racially/ethnically biased.  Thus, not only do Jewish and Muslim congregations report experiencing violent incidents more often, but these congregations perceive those violent incidents to be religiously or racially/ethnically biased a greater rates than the other religious traditions.    \n\nThe survey we conducted will be useful in future research efforts by others who may replicate and extend our study.
