  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original goals of this NSF fellowship were to use manifold learning techniques to generate a framework for data fusion from multiple modalities, even in situations where there is no point to point correspondence between the data structures.  The fellowship also had the goal of applications of such frameworks to medical imaging and cancer research.  More broadly, the goal was to use this fellowship to drive interdepartmental collaboration and incorporate undergraduates into the research.\n\n\nThis fellowship was very successful in a number of the outcomes originally set forth by the proposal, as well as bringing forward new questions and solutions that complement the proposal in ways that were unforeseen in its original formulation.  The main mathematical goal of the proposal, namely a framework for fusion of multiple modalities, was steadily addressed by answering a variety of specific questions.  We addressed the question of building high-dimensional distances between non-registered data sets by creating a novel anisotropic maximum mean discrepancy statistic that determines the regions of maximal difference, and is in the form of an optimization scheme that can be minimized in order to register two datasets together [``Two-sample Statistics Based on Anisotropic Kernels'', 2017].  We also used the same manifold learning framework to establish embeddings that are independent of the algorithmic parameters used to analyze the individual data set [``Bigeometric Organization of Deep Nets'', 2015; ``Diffusion Nets'', 2015].  Finally, we used a fast pairwise data adaptive earth movers distance to characterize the distance between a large number of non-registered datasets, specifically survey data [``People Mover's Distance:...'', 2017].\n\n\nThe second goal of the original proposal, forming interdepartmental collaborations with the medical field, was also incredibly productive.  During my time at Yale, we formed a successful collaborative group with the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) in the Yale Medical School, which led to a number of significant results.  We examined the fusion of a large number of conflicting quality measurements of hospitals to generate a joint map that summarized distances between any two hospitals [``Describing the performance of US hospitals by applying big data analytics'', 2017].  We also used our fusion framework to create unsupervised clustering algorithms for determining whether a patient has one of several types of blood cancers, based off of an existing medical test known as flow cytometry [``Two-sample Statistics ...'', 2017].  This same approach can be used for a similar clustering in diffusion MRI of brains to determine inter-group similarities and differences [``Two-sample Statistics ...'', 2017].  \nThe broader goals of this grant were achieved as well.  We formed successful and ongoing collaborations with researchers at CORE, as well as collaborators at NIH, Brigham and Women?s Hospital, and Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center.  The grant also led to an undergraduate research project that has culminated in a well-cited paper, where the undergraduate was a lead author [``Deep survival: A deep cox proportional hazards network'', 2016].\n\n\nThe opportunity to complete this fellowship at Yale led to several additional lines of research that were not outlined in the original proposal, but have been equally important in my career development.  Discussions and collaborations with CORE led to the development of a supervised manifold learning perspective for determining individualized treatment effectiveness of drugs [``Function Driven Diffusion for Personalized Counterfactual Inference'', 2016].  The chance to work with Professor Coifman and his research group has also led to studying the types of function classes that can be efficiently learned by deep neural networks [``Provable approximation properties for deep neural networks'', 2016], novel manifold learning kernels [``Spectral echolocation via the wave embedding'', 2016], and even advances in computation number theory [``On suprema of autoconvolutions with an application to Sidon sets'', 2016].\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Cloninger"
