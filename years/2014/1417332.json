 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and test an education partnership model focusing on climate change (The Climate Lab) that features inquiry-oriented and place-based learning.  Curriculum development will begin with a prototype program pioneered by the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, and a design-based implementation research (DBIR) approach will be used to develop a curriculum that is aligned with key elements of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  The project partnership includes scientists at three research centers, education researchers, and middle school teachers.  The completed curriculum will provide opportunities for middle school students and teachers to compare their locally collected data with historic data to create unique and powerful learning opportunities.  The collaboration between scientists and schools introduces middle school students to local, community citizen science endeavors with multiple stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe project is innovative in linking direct exploration of current, local conditions with archived data to examine long-term changes in natural phenomena that cannot be directly perceived.  Components of the model being developed will include: a) a standards-aligned curriculum; b) field and lab activities that engage students in collecting and analyzing data on local biotic and abiotic indicators of climate change; c) integration with a current climate science research program; d) support materials for teachers and scientists (print and electronic) and a digital teacher professional development program; and e) a project Website.  During development of these curricular components, barriers to implementation of this learning strategy will be identified and studied.  The findings of this project have the potential to broadly impact middle school science education practices by introducing a curricular model that links direct data collection with analysis of archived data to study long-term environmental changes that are not directly perceived.",

Our model used scientists and data from a migratory bird research station as training tools and inspiration for teachers to guide their students in developing their own long-term research studies on environmental indicators within walking distance of their schools. Collaborators TERC (Cambridge, MA) and Manomet Inc. (Plymouth, MA) worked together to create a suite of middle school curricula and supplemental materials that adhere to the Next Generation Science Standards. These materials focused on teaching students the fundamentals of long-term research and taught key concepts regarding climate science, environmental indicators, and environmental monitoring. Student lessons culminated in data collection on environmental indicators (e.g. spring leaf emergence) at green spaces near their school grounds. Throughout the three years of this project we developed a core of dedicated middle school teachers in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern Maine that have their students collecting and contributing data to a long-term climate change study. We have also trained over 25 teachers and administrators and taught over 1500 middle school students the valuable lesson that sound science can be conducted by anybody.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Resource development</span></strong></p>\n<p>A key component of our research was to determine what materials best facilitated student learning, teacher buy-in and consistent participation.
