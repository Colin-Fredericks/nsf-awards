This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming languages and methods/verification. The focus of this year's school is \"Types, Logics, Semantics, and Verification\". The students who attend are from a large number of countries. The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. The broader impacts include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers.",
