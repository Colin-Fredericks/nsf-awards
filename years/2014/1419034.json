 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will develop operator related function theory and its interaction with algebraic varieties.  The main theme is that multi-variable polynomials whose zero sets have a natural relationship to the torus or the polydisk in complex euclidean space offer an interesting setting for the study of complex analysis and operator theory.  The goal is to better understand \"stable\" polynomials (those without zeros on a specified domain), because of their frequent appearance in function theory (as in rational inner functions and interpolation problems), mathematical physics, and engineering, as well as to view algebraic varieties as domains on which to study function theory and operator theory.  Function theory on varieties can enrich one variable function theory and while shining light on difficult problems in function theory in several variables.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work has its intellectual roots in the works of Norbert Wiener, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Arne Beurling (to name just a few) on areas of probability theory and mathematical analysis that formed the mathematical underpinnings of signals analysis (or communications), control theory (as in automatic pilots), and time series analysis (the study of sequential data like stock prices).  This project will continue in this long and fruitful tradition by developing and generalizing the underlying mathematics further (most notably by emphasizing relations to algebraic topics).  The project should have connections to areas of scientific endeavor with multidimensional data (e.g. an image) as opposed to the previous examples that feature primarily one dimensional data (the one dimension being time).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Operator related function theory and algebraic varieties\" is about combining insights from two different fields: operator theory and classical algebraic geometry.  Operator theory, a branch of analysis, is the study of transformations of infinite dimensional spaces and has its roots in the study of problems from physics, while algebraic geometry is the study of curves, surfaces, and higher dimensional objects given by polynomial equation.  The simplest examples of these are typically learned in high school: parabolas, ellipses, spheres, et cetera.  These subjects of analysis and algebra interact in a meaningful way when positivity enters the picture.  \n\nA general and useful question to study in mathematics is when is a positive object a sum of squares of related objects? For instance, a positive integer cannot always be written as a single square of an integer but it can be written as a square of a real number or by a famous theorem of Lagrange it is a sum of four or fewer squares.  It is possible to characterize which positive integers are a sum of two squares.  Hilbert\u00c6s seventeenth problem, solved by Artin, asks to prove that every non-negative polynomial is a sum of squares of ratios of polynomials.  There are many variations on this problem that continue to fascinate mathematicians. \n\nThis project addresses non-negative or positive trigonometric polynomials as well as polynomials, called stable polynomials, which do not vanish in a specified region.  One of the main results of this research is a characterization of which positive bivariate trigonometric polynomials can be factored as a single square of a polynomial possessing additional stability properties.  This characterization has applications to understanding a broader class of polynomials called hyperbolic polynomials which are important in partial differential equations, combinatorics, and probability.  \n\nA different but related side of this project is to use sums of squares decompositions to understand bounded analytic functions in two or more variables.  Analytic functions can essentially be thought of as polynomials with infinitely many terms and one of the achievements of this research is to reduce questions about them to questions about the stable polynomials alluded to above.  \n\nParts of this research has concrete aspects in which undergraduates were recruited to help search for important examples and counterexamples.  Indeed, it is known through theory that there is a fundamental difference between bounded analytic functions in two variables versus three or more variables, yet it is difficult to construct specific examples that demonstrate these differences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Knese"
