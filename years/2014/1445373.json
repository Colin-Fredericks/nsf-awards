A sampling of the topical foci of the 2014 event is given by the following: the Elliott program for the classification of  C*-algebras; applications of operator algebras to mathematical physics; noncommutative geometry; the Baum-Connes conjecture; free probability and its applications; subfactors and their invariants. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
