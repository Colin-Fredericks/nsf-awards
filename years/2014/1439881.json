 "awd_abstract_narration": "Husky Teach is a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Phase I project that will recruit, prepare, and support a diverse and talented group of professionals to become science and math teachers in high-needs settings.  This Phase 1 project combines research activity by marine scientists with best teacher preparation practices.  The project leverages local expertise to prepare post-graduates and career changers so they excel during their initial years in teaching positions in high-need schools.  The project will advance understandings about integrating STEM subject matter mentoring into the goal of preparing teachers for high-need schools. Combining expertise from marine scientists with coursework emphasizing access and equity to STEM careers is unique to this project, the outcomes of which would inform similar practices in at other science teacher preparation sites. \r\n\r\nBest teacher preparation practices combined with the marine research programs at the Avery Point campus provide a seedbed of science learning opportunities for future science teachers. The HuskyTeach project aligns with other strategic investments by the University of Connecticut and the State. Noyce recipients will progress through the established program with the addition of iteratively working with STEM Mentors. The goals of the HuskyTeach project include: 1) recruiting 24 high-quality STEM professionals for science teaching careers, 2) integrating STEM content with education training to prepare future science teachers, 3) providing experiences and resources to prepare science teachers to work in high-needs schools, 4) increasing the diversity of the science teaching workforce, and 5) using multiple data sources to inform the improvements to STEM teacher preparation. Participants will integrate content acquired from marine science research into curriculum modules developed in association with education coursework. Key evaluation and assessment measurements of this project will chart attitudinal shifts and dispositions over time, with particular focus on data-informed decisions with respect to teaching science in high-needs schools.",
