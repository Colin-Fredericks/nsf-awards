 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the 19th Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) Conference, to be held July 17-19, 2014 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A central goal of the LFG framework is to create a model of grammar which is sufficiently sophisticated for theoretical linguists to formulate a model of natural language, but which can also be used in theoretical and applied areas of computational linguistics and natural language processing. Because of its formal rigor, LFG has been used as the theoretical basis of various machine translation tools, for example, AppTek's TranSphere, and the Julietta Research Group's Lekta. The annual conference is the largest annual LFG meeting, offering a venue for the exchange of ideas, and fostering cooperation for theoretical and computational linguists. It has a truly international outreach, with participants coming from Europe, Asia, Australia, and America. This will be the first LFG conference held in the USA since 2007. \r\n\r\nThe leitmotif of the 2014 conference is \"Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory.\" It will provide a platform for the discussion of the role of linguistic theories (LFG and other generative models, e.g. Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) and the Minimalist Program) in language documentation and descriptive linguistic research. The possibility of using theoretically motivated computational environments (e.g. Finite State Morphologies or syntactic parsers) for ongoing efforts in the domain of under-resourced and endangered languages research is highly relevant in the context of many projects seeking to document and maintain endangered languages. The conference will be followed by a one-day ParGram workshop, and a one-day workshop on unbounded dependencies in LFG.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF grant award number 1362098 supported the organization of the biannual Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) conference which took place in Ann Arbor, MI, July 17-20, 2014,  on the premises of the University of Michigan, and was organized in collaboration between Eastern Michigan University and the University of Michigan. LFG is a linguistic framework developed since the 1970s for the description of, mainly, syntax, semantics, and morphology (e.g. Bresnan 2001, Dalrymple 2001). The framework,  apart from being interesting from the theoretical linguistic perspective, over the years has proven instrumental in bridging the linguistic theory with practical applications, in particular, it was used for the development of computational linguistic models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, among others by XEROX. Additionally, the leitmotif of the 2014 conference was \"Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory,\" addressing yet another aspect of the framework, namely its use in the generation of grammars and NLP tools for endangered and under-resourced languages. It was combined with a one-day workshop The Syntax and Information Structure of Unbounded Dependencies, organized by Alex Alsina of Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain (sponsored by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&oacute;n, Gobierno de Espa&ntilde;a). \n \nThe conference attracted approximately 40 researchers &ndash; key figures in the LFG research from leading universities and companies from the field of language technologies, but also graduate students who work on LFG, and local linguists and students of linguistics from the University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University. Participants came from both US and abroad, among others from the UK, Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Australia. Financial support was offered to graduate student presenters to promote the participation of young researchers. During the 3-day conference, 21 talks were presented addressing different aspects of the theory and its application; further the conference hosted a poster session for 10 presenters, and a discussion panel on LFG in language documentation with two invited panelists, Aaron Broadwell, University of Albany, working on American Indian languages, and Rachel Nordlinger of the University of Melbourne, whose focus lies in Australia's indigenous languages. The Proceedings of LFG14 are available online at the following url: http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/LFG/19/lfg14.html\n \nFor linguists representing different frameworks and approaches - not only LFG - the meeting has provided an opportunity for the discussion about the role of linguistic theories (LFG and other generative models, e.g. HPSG and Minimalist Program (MP)) in language documentation and descriptive linguistic research. The LFG conference is organized annually by the International Lexical-Functional Grammar Association and local organizers. In the early years of the LFG conference the meeting took place nearly every other year in the US but this was not the case recently - the 2014 conference was the first LFG event in the USA since 2007.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Damir Cavar"
