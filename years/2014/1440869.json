 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research consistently shows that children who have opportunities to actively investigate natural settings and engage in problem-based learning greatly benefit from the experiences.  They gain skills, interests, knowledge, aspirations, and motivation to learn more.  But how can we provide these rich opportunities in densely populated urban areas where resources and access to natural areas are limited?  This project will develop and test a model of curriculum and community enterprise to address that issue within the nation's largest urban school system.  Middle school students will study New York harbor and the extensive watershed that empties into it, and they will conduct field research in support of restoring native oyster habitats.  The project builds on the existing Billion Oyster Project, and will be implemented by a broad partnership of institutions and community resources, including Pace University, the New York City Department of Education, the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the New York Academy of Sciences, the New York Harbor Foundation, the New York Aquarium, and others.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on an important concept in the geological, environmental, and biological sciences that typically receives inadequate attention in schools: watersheds.  This project builds on and extends the Billion Oyster Project of the New York Harbor School.  The project model includes five interrelated components:  A teacher education curriculum, a student learning curriculum, a digital platform for project resources, an aquarium exhibit, and an afterschool STEM mentoring program.  The project targets middle-school students in low-income neighborhoods with high populations of English language learners and students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields and education pathways.  The project will directly involve over forthy schools, eighty teachers, and 8,640 students over a period of three years.  A quasi-experimental, mixed-methods research plan will be used to assess the individual and collective effectiveness of the five project components.  Regression analyses will be used to identify effective program aspects and assess the individual effectiveness of participation in various combinations of the five program components.  Social network mapping will be used to further asses the overall \"curriculum plus community\" model.",

Thus, for the average New York City public school teacher, enabling students to learn or carry out inquiry-based research in the natural world is a logistical and physical challenge too difficult to overcome independently.\n\nThe BOP CCERS model and methodology described herein offers a practical approach to begin overcoming systematic inequities within and between our nation?s school systems. The model is premised on the belief that authentic environmental problem solving?in the form of species and habitat restoration?engages students? interest thereby motivating them to learn more; and also that teachers must be equipped with a fully developed curriculum, training, and other relevant resources in order to successfully carry out restoration-based STEM+C teaching, and facilitate student learning across multiple community and field-based settings. Thus, the CCERS integrated methodology has been developed to generate significant increases in student and teacher engagement with STEM + Computing principles and content.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lauren Birney"
