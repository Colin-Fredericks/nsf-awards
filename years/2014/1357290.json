 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: This study will provide essential knowledge required for management of coastal resources. This study addresses near shore cross-shore larval transport processes that operate over wide geographic areas in open coast settings, namely larval transport by wave circulation / Stokes drift, and by internal tidal bores. Larval transport by wave circulation / Stokes drift is a ubiquitous process that has not been studied observationally, and it is not known how internal tidal bores deliver larvae to intertidal habitats. This project will examine near shore (region between 20 m depth and intertidal) physical and biological processes that account for the delivery of larvae to adult habitats. The study system in Southern California shares similarities with most other temperate areas and we will study marine taxa that are widely distributed and successful in a variety of environments.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Recent studies suggest that larval transport in the near shore zone plays a central role in larval dispersal and connectivity of shallow water species. These recent advances, however, have not been matched with process-oriented studies addressing circulation and behavioral processes at the appropriate temporal and spatial scales, and only a few larval transport mechanisms have been considered for near shore open coastlines. Recent advances in our understanding of hydrodynamic processes driving cross-shore flows and growing awareness of the importance of the processes to larval transport, however, make this study timely. The investigators hypothesize that a series of physical and biological events results in the delivery of invertebrate larvae to the intertidal habitat. These events include physical transport due to wave circulation / Stokes drift near the surface and internal tide circulation near the bottom, alteration of behavior for terminal larval stages, and larval use of \"adaptive\" behavioral responses to exploit event-dependent flows. Further, they suggest that the predominance of wave circulation / Stokes drift and internal tide circulation varies seasonally, with internal tidal bores important in spring/summer, when the water column is well-stratified, and wave circulation / Stokes drift more pervasive in fall/winter, coinciding with winter storms. The hypotheses in this study will be tested with estimates of physical transport, larval supply and settlement. These measurements will be combined with use of adaptive sampling to test the dependence of larval vertical distribution on changes in hydrodynamic conditions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Results from this study will have important ecological implications as wave circulation / Stokes drift and internal motions may represent critical and regular transport mechanisms for larvae of marine organisms that must return to near shore habitats to complete their life cycle, thereby impacting population connectivity and management strategies used by coastal planners (e.g., ecosystem-based fisheries management, placement of Marine Protected Areas). The investigators will disseminate their results to the public through lectures and the development of a website. Furthermore, this project has a strong educational component, involving undergraduate and/or graduate students from two institutions (WHOI and University of San Diego). The research will be integrated into courses taught by all co-PIs at their respective institutions, but an integral component of this research is to enhance student experiential learning with cutting-edge research experiences at USD (a liberal-arts university). Sampling as part of this project will be incorporated into a field-based Marine Community Ecology course for upper-division undergraduates and students will be required to participate in at least one research cruise. The investigators also plan to offer competitive undergraduate student stipends for summer research at USD. To disseminate results, participants will be required to participate in the annual Undergraduate Research Conference, highlighting student-faculty interactions held at USD.",
