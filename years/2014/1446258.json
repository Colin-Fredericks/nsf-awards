 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program, this project addresses the Nation's growing need to better prepare undergraduate biologists with the quantitative and computational skills needed to be successful in the workplace or in graduate school.  The full integration of mathematical reasoning skills into undergraduate biology classrooms has been challenging, in part, because of the rapid pace of change in many biological disciplines and an academic reward system that often overlooks pedagogical development and research.\r\n\r\nThe Supporting Faculty in Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES) project involves five interdependent initiatives that promote the integration of quantitative and computational skills across the biological sciences curriculum. The project is building on the investments of existing communities by coordinating the efforts and resources of diverse groups that are already involved in quantitative biology education reform. This approach allows QUBES to amplify the strengths of organizations like professional societies and specialized curriculum projects while streamlining the communications and coordination required to grow broader community of reform-minded faculty educators in quantitative biology (QB). Mentoring networks will be used to support faculty understanding and classroom implementation of specific quantitative biology concepts and teaching strategies. These mentoring networks will be led by teams containing both quantitative and pedagogical expertise and will serve spatially distributed groups of instructors who share a common interest in reforming their current teaching practices. Participating instructors will disseminate resources within their own institutions, organize new mentoring networks, and take leadership roles in their professional societies. The products from these collaborations will be captured as part of the QUBES Hub, a virtual environment providing professional support activities and access to curriculum resources for all QB educators. In order to address the challenges of documenting teaching scholarship, the QUBES project is also piloting a system for describing and tracking faculty contributions to the QB education community. This high-risk, but potentially transformative, initiative to develop meaningful metrics of teaching scholarship could have a long term impact on academic reward systems across diverse institution types. By strengthening QB research and development tools, the project is enriching the discipline and catalyzing long-term academic cultural change across STEM education. Finally, the collaborative is studying and disseminating what they learn about the effectiveness of this educational reform effort. This research will take a systems approach to characterize effective interventions and barriers to change within the complex landscape of factors influencing the success of educational reform.\r\n \r\nThe efficient execution and management of a project with this level of complexity requires thorough and ongoing evaluation. The project team is embedding data collection systems throughout project activities as a means to track progress in near real time, manage resources effectively, and maintain clear communication across connected project components. The QUBES approach to implementation, research, and development promises to have a significant impact on QB education across the nation and, more generally, to inform systemic STEM education reform efforts.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/",

Automatic assignment of attribution for derivative products, minting of permanent DOIs (digital object identifier), and the tracking of use metrics make the QUBES OER Library an important professional outlet to document one?s scholarship around teaching and learning. Because those publications are also tied to the Partner Project groups that shared them, they also provide a richly contextualized record of a project?s products.  \n\n \n \nThe intellectual merit of the QUBES project lies in accelerating the adoption of evidence-based teaching practices to improve educational experiences, and advancing the scholarship of teaching. The QUBES platform has been used to support a wide range of professional scholarly opportunities for faculty including: Faculty Mentoring Networks, Incubators, and Working Groups. Each of these models focus on peer groups exploring key issues in quantitative biology education and producing resources to be shared with the broader community. Because these communities meet online and are available free of charge they significantly reduce barriers to participation by faculty with heavy teaching loads and limited institutional resources for professional development. QUBES creates broader impacts in teaching through its emphasis on inclusive and accessible teaching practices. QUBES has worked with education project leaders to promote equity, diversity, and inclusive practices in the development of new materials, and support the incorporation of these ideas in QUBES based professional development experiences.  \n\n \n \nQUBES is a collaboration between four academic institutions (the University of Pittsburgh, College of William and Mary, Radford University, and Bates College) and a non-profit education organization (The BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium) and arose from an NSF Ideas Lab in 2014. The QUBES project reflects the Science Gateway model in which a specialized cyberinfrastructure is designed to support the activities of a user community, such as researchers, educators, or students. Gateways provide convenient access to tools, applications, and data that is relevant to the community?s activities. The QUBES platform is a customization of HubZero which has been modified extensively to better serve the needs of a teaching faculty community.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael D Lamar"
