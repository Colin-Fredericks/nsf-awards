ACM CCS is the flagship event of ACM Special Interest Group of Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC).  Its acceptance rate is around 15-20%, which makes it a highly selective conference.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides support for 20 students to attend ACM CCS and associated workshops.  Preference will be given to undergraduate students participating in the poster session, and students with papers in the conference or workshop who do not have other support.  Participation by women and underrepresented groups will also be encouraged.",
