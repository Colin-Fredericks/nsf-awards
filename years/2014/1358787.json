 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Drs. Oswalt and Holberg will undertake a study of widely separated \"fragile binary stars\" that contain normal lower mass main sequence stars with distant noninteracting white dwarf companions. As stars evolve to the white dwarf stage, most lose well over half their original mass.  This initial-to-final mass relation is one of the weakest links in our understanding of stellar evolution and how matter is recycled into the interstellar medium. It is also of special importance to a number of different areas in astrophysics such as age and distance determinations of globular clusters, studying the chemical evolution of galaxies, and also for understanding the history of star formation as recorded by the Galaxy's remnant white dwarfs. \r\n\r\nFor several decades it has been known that stellar chromospheric activity declines with age in Solar-type stars.  Dr. Oswalt and collaborators have recently shown evidence that this trend is valid to nearly the expected age of the Galactic disk.  Other work has demonstrated stellar ages can be determined by isochrone fitting in color magnitude diagrams or via stellar rotation rates obtained from simple photometric observations.  These techniques will be applied here, where appropriate, to determine the ages of a sample of wide separation binaries with white dwarfs. The ages of the white dwarfs themselves, which span the entire history of the Solar neighborhood, can be determined from their observed temperatures. And by subtracting the ages of the white dwarf companions from the total age of the binary yields its progenitor main sequence lifetime and initial mass.  In this way, they will empirically calibrate the initial-to-final mass relation for white dwarf stars to at least the age of the Sun.   \r\n\r\nThe Florida Tech Department of Physics & Space Sciences is home to one of the largest astronomy-related undergraduate programs in the U.S.  In autumn 2007 it enrolled 142 majors. About half are women and/or minorities.  Undergraduates will be involved in all aspects of the project, from data acquisition with the Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) 0.9m and Florida Tech 0.8m telescopes, to presenting our results to the scientific community. Two graduate students will also conduct dissertation projects directly related to this project.  A postdoctoral research fellow will work closely with Drs. Oswalt and Holberg and the students to derive an independent age determination for each of the wide binaries via the isochrone technique.  Co-PI Holberg will lead the effort to incorporate the physical data on the white dwarf components of wide binaries obtained by this project into the University of Arizona White Dwarf Database, which is a widely used by the international astronomical community and general public.  Results of this project will be brought into astronomy courses and to the public via the Florida Institute of Technology Observatory Astronomy/Astrophysics Lecture Series, AAS Shapley Lectures, and other media.  It is also anticipated that K-12 students will participate in the data acquisition phase of the project via the Global Hands-On Universe project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhite dwarfs are the final stage of stellar evolution for the vast majority of all stars, including the Sun.  Because they take eons to cool, remnants of even the first generation of stars to form in our Galaxy are still detectible.  Thus, they record the entire history of our Galaxy and their physical properties constrain planetary, stellar and galactic evolution models.  However, the fundamental theoretical relations governing their masses, radii and recycling to the interstellar medium are very poorly constrained by observations.  Using observations made at national observatories of a sample of widely separated non-interacting \"fragile\" binary stars with ages determined from rotation rates and/or \"star spot\" activity, we have investigated: (1) the mass-radius relation and (2) the initial-to-final mass relation for white dwarf stars. \n\nIntellectual Merit:  The mass-radius relation is implicitly assumed when estimating white dwarf masses from spectra and it explicitly influences the initial-final mass relation, i.e. the mass a star recycles to the interstellar medium at the end of its hydrogen burning phase.  Neither of these fundamental relations have been robustly validated because of the limited precision of the observational data.  A white dwarf with a distant non-interacting Sun-like companion provides a unique opportunity.  The observed difference in apparent radial velocity of a pair yields the white dwarf's gravitational redshift, providing an independent test of the mass-radius relation for white dwarf stars.  The difference between a binary\u00c6s total age implied by a main sequence companion's rotation or activity and the cooling age of a white dwarf companion implied by its spectrum yields the latter\u00c6s initial mass (thus also the fraction recycled back into space) from standard evolutionary theory.\n\nBroader Impacts:  These fundamental relations are essential to understanding the history of the Galaxy\u00c6s oldest stellar populations.  As remnants of all prior generations of stars, white dwarfs encode information on star/planet formation and death rates, mass recycling and the Galaxy\u00c6s chemical evolution and age.  They also constrain the masses (thus, luminosity range) of supernova SNIa progenitors, \"standard candles\" used to gauge the expansion/acceleration of the Universe.\n\nIn autumn 2015 the Department was home to 34 engineering physics graduate students and 159 undergraduate students pursuing B.S. degrees in engineering physics (103), space physics (21) and our new astronomy &amp; astrophysics (35) program, which was launched in the final year of this project. According to the PI\u00c6s survey of the incoming class, one of the main reasons students chose our program is our variety of space-related undergraduate research opportunities.  The proposed project contributed to our Department\u00c6s recruiting/retention efforts, especially our new astronomy and astrophysics program, and it directly engaged several undergraduate students.  In January 2014 we moved into a new 140,000 ft2 building, over half of which is allocated to our Department.

Locally, the results of this project were brought into the courses the PI teaches and to the public via events such as the ERAU Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Public Lecture Series which was originally implemented by the PI.
