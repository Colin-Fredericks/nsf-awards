 "awd_abstract_narration": "The open availability and wide accessibility of scientific articles, data sets, and other digital resources is becoming the norm for 21st century science. Growing numbers of repositories of scientific resources enable researchers to discover, understand, and build upon previous work at greater scales than was previously possible. Many interrelationships exist between research articles, data, software, and other services used to produce scientific findings. Repositories for these resources, however, typically only supporting one particular kind of resource, or at most will support a couple of resource types, such as data and software. This has led to the siloing of information in a vast number of repositories. Producers and users of scientific resources would benefit from repositories with different specializations and user communities working together at a technical and process level to provide greater services than any one repository can provide. Through developing common workflows and information exchange protocols, this project will demonstrate how repository interconnections can be built in ways that establish connections between related resources (e.g. data, software, services, etc.). \r\n\r\nThis project will provide a model for how multiple repositories of diverse resources can exchange\r\nand connect related information via complementary workflows and metadata sharing. The project\r\nwill consider two different cases: 1) connecting resources that are already hosted by repositories,\r\nand 2) connecting resources as they are newly deposited into repositories. These are common\r\ncases among data, articles, and software repositories. Case #1 looks backward in time, and\r\ncase #2 looks forward in time. This project will produce a pilot implementation of repository cross-linking, using two repositories provided and managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) / National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) as the development bed: 1) the OpenSky repository, which hosts and provides access to the record of scholarship produced by UCAR and NCAR staff, and is the platform for publishing the NCAR Technical Notes series, and 2) is the Earth System Grid (ESG), which is a NCAR-hosted infrastructure for the distribution and access of climate models, data, and software. Building connections between repositories increases public access to geosciences information and data by increasing the visibility of data and information across previously unconnected systems, thereby increasing discoverability, and by increasing the utility of data through explicitly linking data to important documentation. Theproject outcomes will be shared and explored with the relevant stakeholders communities through a workshop, and with the communities brought together through EarthCube, namely, the geosciences, informatics experts, scientific publishers, and data repositories.",
