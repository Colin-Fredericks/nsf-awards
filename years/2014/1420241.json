 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to improve science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM) learning, it is crucial to better understand the informal experiences that young children have that prepare them for formal science education.  Young children are naturally curious about the world around them, and research in developmental psychology shows that families often support children in exploring and seeking explanations for scientific phenomena.  It is less clear how to link children's natural curiosity and everyday parent-child interaction with more formal STEM learning.  This collaborative project will team researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, the University of Texas, and Brown University with informal learning practitioners at the Children's Discovery Museum, The Thinkery, and the Providence Children's Museum in order to investigate how family interaction relates to children's causal learning, as well as how modifications to museum exhibit design and facilitation by museum staff influence families' styles of interaction and increase children's causal learning. This project is funded by the Research on Education and Learning (REAL) program which supports fundamental research by investigators from a range of disciplines in order to deepen what is known about STEM learning. \r\n\r\nThe project team will examine how ethnically and linguistically diverse samples of parents and children engage in collaborative scientific learning in three children's museums across the U.S.  The research will combine observational studies of parent-child interaction in a real-world setting with experimental measures of children's causal learning. The investigators will examine how children explore and derive explanations for museum exhibits about mechanical gear function and fluid dynamics. In this way, the researchers will investigate the relation between styles of parent-child interaction and children's causal learning. The team will also investigate novel ways of presenting material within the exhibits to facilitate exploration and explanation. They will explore how signage, conversations with museum staff, parents' attitudes towards learning in museum settings, and parents' own prior knowledge about the exhibits can influence the parent-child interaction and subsequent causal learning. The project will advance the basic research goal of advancing what is known about what affects children's science content learning. It will also advance the practice-oriented goal of developing new strategies for the design of science museum exhibits and make recommendations for how parents can better talk to their children about scientific phenomena.",

This collaborative project sought to advance the knowledge base in human STEM learning, STEM learning environments, and broadening participation in STEM. Our objective was to investigate how diverse samples of parents and children engaged in explanation and exploration of scientific concepts in three children's museums across the U.S. In addition to uncovering patterns of family explanation, exploration, and interaction, in three sets of studies we measured children's causal understanding, and have begun to build on this knowledge base to develop and test effective modifications of museum design and practice. Children's museums are ideal environments for research of this kind; they give access to everyday activity and conversations of families, and they provide a natural laboratory for testing the effectiveness of targeted strategies for enriching informal STEM learning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>. Given concerns about reduced numbers of students in STEM fields (President's Council of Advisors on Science &amp; Technology, 2012), and public opinion diverging from scientists' views on issues like evolution and climate change (Pew Research Center, 2009), there is an urgent need to improve STEM learning. In the research literature, there is a fundamental tension between pedagogical goals for students' learning of STEM concepts through direct instruction or explanation (Dean &amp; Kuhn, 2006; Klahr, Zimmerman, &amp; Jirout, 2011) and goals for children to explore, discover, and develop interest in STEM in open-ended and authentic ways through guided play (Barton &amp; Tan, 2010; Feinstein, 2011; Lehrer, Schauble, &amp; Lucas, 2008). Children's museums struggle with this tension; they attempt to engage children's interest while acknowledging the difficulty of ensuring that they also learn STEM concepts (Allen, 2004). We propose that rather than viewing pedagogical explanation and open-ended exploration as incompatible, the dynamic between exploration and explanation is essential to scientific practice and engagement. Our first study, for example, showed that children's causal thinking in follow-up tasks was predicted by how much they systematically explored a museum exhibit focused on gears with their parent. Children's causal thinking was also predicted by parent-child interaction style, with less sophisticated reasoning by children in parent-led dyads (even after controlling for age). Further, in sequential analysis of parent-child interaction at the gear exhibits, we found that parents' explaining at certain time segments predicted children's subsequent systematic exploration of the gears. Thus, while parents' explaining was not directly predicting children's understanding, more subtle indirect dynamics between explaining and exploring were apparent. This project uncovered patterns and connections in how diverse families engage in these two important STEM-related practices, and began to address how facilitation and intervention may affect families' engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>. The studies conducted as part of this grant will advance both the basic research goal of improving our understanding of children's science learning, and the educational goal of developing new strategies for introducing STEM within meaningful educational activities. In this collaboration among developmental psychology researchers and children's museum practitioners from three parts of the U.S., each partner brought their conceptual models to bear in developing and testing effectiveness of learning interventions, as suggested in Bell's (2004) views about pluralism in design-based research. The researchers span different theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of children's causal thinking including experimental, computational, and sociocultural approaches. Bridging these areas, and working with diverse populations in three cities provided opportunities to address issues of cultural diversity in parent-child conversation not possible in a single setting. Research in museums has primarily been either museum-prompted evaluation or researcher-focused experimentation. This project took the more unusual approach of a collaborative partnership, in which research goals overlap with and support museum design goals (Callanan, 2012; Sobel &amp; Jipson, 2016). We have begun to disseminate findings broadly in venues that span developmental psychology, science education, and museum learning (Legare, Sobel, &amp; Callanan, 2017; Willard et al., 2019).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cristine&nbsp;Legare</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1420241/1420241_10336819_1553949605237_3Y7A0798-1200x675-c-default--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1420241/1420241_10336819_1553949605237_3Y7A0798-1200x675-c-default--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gear Exhibit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1420241/1420241_10336819_1553949605237_3Y7A0798-1200x675-c-default--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Exhibit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Parent-child interaction at the Gear Exhibit at Thinkery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thinkery</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cristine&nbsp;Legare</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gear Exhibit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
