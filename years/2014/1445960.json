 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this NUE program, Sustainable Nanotechnology Education for Undergraduate Engineering Students, under the direction of Dr. Navid Saleh, is to develop two technical electives, a theory-based course and a laboratory course, with integrated social and ethical aspects utilizing metacognitive pedagogical strategies. In addition, a workshop involving experts experienced with real-life decision-making in nanotechnology development will support the courses three goals: introduce nanoscale concepts and sustainability principles to engineering students; integrate social and ethical aspects in the context of nanomaterial sustainability; and enhance core knowledge by infusing critical thinking with the hands-on PBL-based modules in laboratory sessions. The proposed courses and workshop will be novel in four aspects: their metacognitive teaching style; the integration of ethical and societal aspects with the technical content; the integration of sustainability with nanotechnology; and emphasis on safe and sustainable nanomaterial design.\r\n\r\nThe National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) calls for nano-education in the context of real-life implications. There is a critical need to introduce nanoscale principles to undergraduate students so that these future engineers will consider sustainability and safety of this emerging technology at the outset. Often, nanomaterial design is disconnected from its safety and sustainability concerns. Students suffer from this and extend it to real-world practice. However, educating students in nanotechnology with integrated societal components challenges traditional pedagogical structure. Problem-based learning (PBL) is one approach that can confront such challenges, where the fundamental nanoscale concepts can be taught in an inquiry-based setting. This program addresses these challenges by integrating societal and ethical aspects with technical nanoscale phenomena, utilizing an interactive PBL approach under a theme of sustainable nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis program will be a true collaboration among researchers and educators of engineering, sustainability, ethics, and communication, and the merging of these disciplines into the proposed courses will provide a novel experience for undergraduates. It is projected that 60-100 students will be impacted by the courses during the two year project.",

This project created and administered courses (a theory course and a laboratory course) that fully integrated new fundamental knowledge and hands-on design experiences of sustainable nanotechnology. The project also applied problem-based learning (PBL) in the workshop and outreach settings, which impacted students of all ages (from K-12 students to graduate students). The products of the project include active-learning course modules, laboratory experiments, workshop modules, and outreach activities that can be integrated into other courses or can be applied in future active-learning based learning. Overall, this project impacted more than 200 students through the courses, workshops, and outreach activities. The findings of the project have been disseminated via multiple conference presentations. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong></p>\n<p>In this project, two technical electives, i.e., a theory-based course (CE 377K.1: Sustainable Design of Nanomaterials) and a laboratory course (CE 377K.2: Nanotechnology Laboratory), with integrated social and ethical aspects were developed and conducted. The courses had three principal goals: (1) introduce nanoscale concepts and sustainability principles to engineering students, (2) integrate social and ethical aspects in the context of nanomaterial sustainability, and (3) enhance core knowledge by infusing critical thinking with the hands-on PBL-based modules in laboratory sessions. CE 377K.1 involved in class lectures that were completed by active-learning activities designed around multiple &lsquo;driving questions&rsquo;. Principles and concepts discussed in this course included: the perspective of scale to better capture materials at the nano-scale, classification of nanomaterials, characterization techniques, detailed discussion on synthesis of metal oxide nanocrystals, role of size in controlling properties (e.g., surface area to volume ratio), atomic structure, fate and transport fundamentals, and bacterial toxicity. The CE 377K.2 course included four laboratories that exposed them to nanomaterial synthesis, characterization, fate and transport, and nanomaterial interaction with bacteria.</p>\n<p>The formative evaluation of these courses was conducted by pre- and post-tests that asked multiple questions probing the core-knowledge and critical thinking of the students on the nano-scale principles. The results demonstrate that core knowledge grew from a perception to specific knowledge. The results also show that knowledge depth and breadth enhanced through these PBL courses. Summative evaluation conducted by an independent evaluator &ldquo;Burd&rsquo;s Eye View&rsquo; also confirmed substantial improvement in student learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project was a true collaboration among researchers and educators of engineering, sustainability, ethics, and communication. The introductory course and hands-on laboratory course were designed to address a unifying topic&frac34;sustainable nanomaterials&frac34;to facilitate the integration of these multiple disciplines. The social, ethical, and sustainability aspects were integrated with the technical content of nanoscale science and technology and allowed for a holistic learning experience in an inquiry-based setting.</p>\n<p>The project also organized two workshops (one at the University of Texas at Austin and the second at Oaxaca, Mexico) that engaged students and faculties (from other institutions) in developing ideas and &lsquo;driving questions&rsquo; for PBL based course development. The second workshop in Oaxaca, Mexico also engaged local undergraduate and high school students in PBL activities that exposed them to principles of nanotechnology for the first time.</p>\n<p>This project also impacted a large number of K-12 students by administering PBL outreach activities in a middle school and a high school in the El Paso, TX area.
