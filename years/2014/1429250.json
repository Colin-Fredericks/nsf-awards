 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non Technical Abstract:\r\nGamma rays are ionizing radiation that are particularly hazardous to biological systems. As a research tool, they are often used to damage cells for mechanistic, basic research that seeks to define cellular response pathways. Further, irradiation is a common source of gene mutagenesis, allowing for the identification of genetic targets for investigation as well as screening for enhanced properties with commercial benefits. Additionally, irradiation is used to kill living organisms and cells both therapeutically and for the sterilization of food and medical equipment. The acquisition of a X-ray Irradiator and Dosimetry System to carry out irradiation experiments will substantially impact the research capabilities of New Mexico State University, enhance the career development of faculty of several scientific fields, and provide training and educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. NMSU is a comprehensive land-grant institution dedicated to teaching, research, and service. NMSU is identified as a Hispanic-Serving Institution and women earn more than half of all undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded. Faculty members from two colleges, five departments and one inter-college program will benefit from the availability the equipment provided by this project. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThe research impacted by the acquisition of a X-ray Irradiator and Dosimetry System include the study of DNA damage and repair mechanisms, insect stress physiology, sterile insect technique, developmental biology, plant physiology, and plant breeding (including algal biofuels). Investigators include established researchers with well-funded programs and early career faculty that depend on critical research infrastructure to lay the foundation for their career development. Projects take advantage of the irradiator's ability to generate free radicals and cellular oxidative damage in a variety of model organisms. The instrument is ideal for many users due to features, such as 1) a broad dynamic radiation dose range; 2) a sample compartment large enough for a variety of applications; 3) a safe, self-contained housing; and 4) requires no infrastructure modifications.",
