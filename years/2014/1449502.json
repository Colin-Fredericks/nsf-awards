  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to build an maintain a set of educational resources for the Robot Operating System (ROS), a large collection open-source software for robotics.  ROS is quickly becoming the de facto standard software on which robotics research is being done in academia, and it being increasingly used in industry, even ending up in some commercial products.\n\n\nOne of the main goals of the project was to collect example educational material (slides, assignments, supporting software) from robotics educators around the country, and to curate this into an easily-deployable set of ROS packages that could be downloaded and run by those wishing to learn the system.  Although this material was gathered, the goal of standardizing it and delivering it in a packaged format proved to be harder than anticipated.\n\n\nROS is still a rapidly-evolving set of software; new versions, often with changes to the programming interface, come out every six months.  While most packages are upgraded when the version changes some always fall by the wayside, and drop out of the official release.  This is often because the maintainers of these packages are students who graduate and are no longer able to devote time and effort to keeping their software up to date with the latest release.  This moving target, when combined with the wide variety of platforms on which ROS is used (different operating systems, different robots, etc) made designing and maintaining a consistent set of educational resources an impossible task.  While we were able to collect these resources for a particular release of ROS, they quick fell out of date as new versions came out.  This was compounded by the fact that ROS 1 is being replaced by a new version, creatively named ROS 2, which will make many of the materials obsolete.\n\n\nHowever, a number of tangible outcomes have come out of the project.  We have a much clearer understanding of the constraints that educators using ROS are working under.  These range from issues with wireless network management on university campuses, to limits on the frequency of updates allowed, to limitations on the operating systems that can be installed in shared laboratories.  These insights have allowed us to make suggestions for design decisions for the new ROS 2 software, which is designed to replace the original ROS 1 system, that will make it much easier to use in educational environments.\n\n\nPerhaps the most significant outcome of this initial award was that it allowed us to prepare a planning proposal aimed at making improvements to the ROS infrastructure (wiki, Q&amp;A site, etc) that will materially support our goals of making it easier to learn ROS.  This proposal, which has been awarded and is currently underway, is surveying the community to confirm the constraints that we have become aware of, and to see what is missing from the infrastructure.  Armed with the information from the initial project and the planning project, we will propose a project that will provide the infrastructure needed by the ROS community to ensure the long-term success of the system, and to make it easier for a wider variety of people to more easily learn and use it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William D Smart"
