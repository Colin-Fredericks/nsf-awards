It will also help support one lecturer who will deliver some of the lectures to the graduate students.\r\n\r\nThere will be 7 internationally recognized lecturers giving expository talks on many of the recent exciting results and developments in probabilistic dynamics and applications.  Most of these techniques are not in textbook form and are only found in specialized journals in a form not readily accessible to a beginning graduate student. The school will enable the students to become familiar with main ideas and techniques of modern dynamics at a formative stage of their research career. In particular, the school will introduce recent developments in probabilistic dynamics to mathematical researchers who may go on to work in other fields that will benefit from these ideas.",
