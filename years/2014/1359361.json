 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Rochester Institute of Technology provides eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in physics, mathematics, astrophysics, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, environmental science, vision science, nano-technology, materials science, color science, computer vision and graphics, and microelectronic engineering. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have practiced a one-minute \"elevator pitch\"; given a formal presentation about their work; and prepared a conference poster and a 4-page letter style paper. The REU site will further support five students to present their work at national conferences after the summer.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics, particularly deaf or hard of hearing students and American Indian students. Steps have been taken to provide a culturally safe environment for all students. The proposed evaluation of the project seeks to answer a number of questions that will inform this project and others like it.",
