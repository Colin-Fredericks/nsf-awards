 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic and terrestrial habitats often have major ecological effects on each other. This important aspect of landscape ecology has mostly been investigated in space, between adjacent habitats that are permanently aquatic or terrestrial. This project will investigate the interaction between aquatic and terrestrial habitats in time, in a type of habitat that cycles seasonally between an aquatic and a terrestrial state. Using remnants of the once extensive system of vernal pools in the Central Valley of California, experiments will test how length of flooding and accumulation of nutrients during the aquatic period in winter influence the diversity of plants found in the terrestrial period in summer, and how the thatch these plants leave affects the diversity of aquatic plants and invertebrates in winter. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include training of undergraduate students, outreach to K-12 education, collaboration between institutions, and applications to conservation of biodiversity and endemic species. The project is based at a primarily undergraduate institution that serves  underrepresented groups and it will provide research experiences for individual students and material for undergraduate courses. Vernal pools in California are of high conservation priority, and the project will disseminate results to the state and Federal agencies that manage these natural habitats.",

However, these effects were contingent on hydroperiod length.&nbsp; Upon desiccation, plant community composition and production were also affected by the interactions between hydroperiod, thatch and nutrients.&nbsp; Thatch presence from the previous year reduced plant richness, cover, and biomass and eutrophication during the aquatic phase also reduced plant richness, cover, and biomass.

This grant supported 4 undergraduate research assistants (3 minorities, 2 women), who were trained in taxonomic identification, study design, field and laboratory sampling approaches, data management, and ecological concepts. Several other undergraduate students volunteered on this project receiving similar training. Funds were also used to support the research of a graduate student (minority female) testing the effects of predator density and diversity in vernal pool mesocosms. The PI presented 3 conference talks and an undergraduate student presented a poster based on this project at an international meeting.&nbsp; A manuscript based on this poster is currently in preparation, including the students as co-authors.&nbsp; An article and a book chapter were published with support from this grant and 2 manuscripts are currently in preparation based on this research.
