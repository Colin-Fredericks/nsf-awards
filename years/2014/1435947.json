 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) will implement a project entitled: Course Development for a 21st Century Smart Grid Workforce.  The Smart Grid courses to be developed at the certificate and the bachelor degree levels will provide students the cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills required to design, implement, deploy and manage Smart Grid technologies and fill the gaps between the utility workforce of today and the Smart Grid's workforce needs of tomorrow.  Senior engineering students will develop an educational Smart Grid Simulator with the functionality and attributes typical to renewable energy resources. This simulator will be made available to benefit other educational initiatives on Smart Grid technology.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to address the shortage of qualified workforce and Smart Grid specialists by focusing on three objectives: 1) to develop introductory to advanced Smart Grid courses and experimental resources to prepare students with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills for preparing the future Smart Grid technology workforce, 2) to develop short courses to help to address the knowledge gap of the current utility workforce, and 3) to inform citizens and educators about Smart Grid technology and its impact on society, the environment, the economy, and career opportunities. The courses will be an integral part of a renewable energy minor at UDC. The project aims to establish the University as a premier training center for the energy workforce in the area of Smart Grid technology.",

The project led to University infrastructure improvements by establishing a new power electronics lab that is being utilized by both undergraduate and graduate students.

The smart grid trainer was also showcased to engineering and non engineering students during Engineering Week at UDC. Our overarching goal has been to contribute to training a diverse workforce for the 21st Century Smart Grid.
