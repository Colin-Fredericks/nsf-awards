It brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interest is in function theoretic operator theory and related areas. A sampling of the topical foci of the 2014 event is given by the following: operator theory and complex analysis, operator theory and mathematical physics, operator algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
