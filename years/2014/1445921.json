The dates have been selected to be in advance of the bi-annual 35th International Combustion Symposium, to be held in San Francisco, August 4-8, 2014, when experts from around the world will be congregate in the Bay area.  The workshop's schedule takes advantage of the larger event resulting in cost reduction.   \r\n\r\nThe workshop's key results have the potential of gaining knowledge that would make utilization of fossil fuels in energy production cleaner and more sustainable.  The workshop also provides students a unique opportunity to be exposed to multidisciplinary science and the leading issues in sooting emission from combustion processes.  Graduate students from US educational institutions are encouraged to attend the workshop, with NSF support to defray lodging costs.",
