 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will undertake fundamental research regarding Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, which was the largest lake in the western United States during the last glacial period, and the precursor to the modern Great Salt Lake.  While the Lake Bonneville record for the past 18,000 years is reasonably well documented, the earlier period (18,000-30,000 years ago) is poorly understood because those deposits have been destroyed or overprinted by younger, rising lake waters, or subsequent erosion.  This project will apply a variety of analytical tools including ground penetrating radar, 3-dimensional digital photography, hydrodynamic modeling, and radiocarbon dating of extremely small amounts of organic material to inform our understanding of landscape dynamics that have long puzzled researchers in this poorly documented period of the Lake Bonneville record.\r\n\r\n\tLake Bonneville and its associated sediments are culturally and economically important landforms of the Intermountain Western United States.  Sands and gravels deposited by the lake form important groundwater aquifers, and provide aggregate resources to much of the region.  The time period of Lake Bonneville being studied is a critical period in Earth's climate history as it marked the transition from a very cold, dry global climate during glacial times to the warmer, interglacial climate of the modern era.  The records of landscape change at Lake Bonneville are vital for studying this climatic transition in the Great Basin province, and will provide details about rates of long-term hydrologic change within North America's largest desert.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLake Bonneville existed in the eastern portion of the Great Basin of the United States from approximately 30,000 to 13,000 years ago.  This corresponds to the time of the last ice age on Earth.  For reasons that are still not completely understood the climate of the Great Basin was much wetter and colder than the modern desert regime of this area.\n\n \n\nThe major shorelines of Lake Bonneville (from highest to lowest, named Bonneville, Provo, and Stansbury) have been recognized and studied for nearly 150 years.  However, there are a number poorly studied shorelines that have remained a mystery, mostly because they have not been correlated from one side of the basin to the other.  These shorelines formed as Lake Bonneville rose from low elevations similar to those of modern Great Salt Lake, to its highest level (the Bonneville shoreline, about 1000 feet or 300 meters higher than GSL &ndash; the \"transgressive phase\"), from about 30,000 years ago until about 18,000 years ago.\n\n \n\nWhile Lake Bonneville rose during its transgressive phase it had no river outlet, so all the water that entered the lake from rain, snow, and rivers, had to leave the lake by evaporation from the lake surface.  The balance between the inflow and outflow of water changed through time &ndash;sometimes more water entered the lake than left it, and sometimes more water left the lake than entered it &ndash; but the trend for thousands of years was for more water to enter the lake than to leave it.  The result was that the lake generally rose for 12,000 years (30,000 to 18,000 years ago), with many ups and downs of only about 150 feet (50 meters) along the way.  The poorly studied shorelines mentioned above formed during the up and down oscillations, and one of the challenges of this grant project was to study those transgressive-phase oscillations.\n\n \n\nThe sediments that accumulated on the bottom of Lake Bonneville are an archive of the lake history.  The bottom sediments have been eroded away from most of what was once the floor of the lake, but they are preserved in a few places in the basin.  Detailed sampling and analysis of those sediments can give an idea of the changes in the lake that took place during its lifetime.  Some of the things that can be analyzed for in the sediments and that give clues to changes in the lake are isotopes of strontium, the amount of calcium carbonate in the sediments, the mineralogy of the sediments (minerals such as calcite and aragonite), and isotopes of oxygen and carbon (see the figure that shows a graph of some geochemical results from bottom sediments at one location).\n\n \n\nAnother way to study lake-level changes during the transgressive phase is to investigate lake-shore sediments exposed in gravel pits.  One such exposure is shown in the figure of a gravel pit along Highway 30 in northwestern Utah.  Small snail shells of the genus Pyrgulopsis were collected from the line of boulders exposed in the pit and sent to a laboratory for radiocarbon dating.  The results helped measure the age of the lake-level oscillation that produced the boulder line.\n\n \n\nRadiocarbon dating was also useful in determining the age of the rise of the lake to its highest level, the Bonneville shoreline.  In a gravel pit near Kanosh, UT, charcoal (considered to be a better material for dating than snails) was collected from an ancient soil that was buried by about 23 feet (~7 meters) of Lake Bonneville gravel.  The radiocarbon results indicate that the lake reached its highest level after 18,400 years ago.  The highest rise of the lake was also studied at Red Rock Pass, ID, where Lake Bonneville overflowed to Snake River tributaries, and at Point of the Mountain, southern end of Salt Lake Valley, among other places.\n\n \n\nFollowing the final drop Lake Bonneville, to altitudes similar to those of modern Great Salt Lake, the lake rose about 50 feet (15 meters) in what is called the \"Gilbert episode.\"  Continued research will help us determine the cau..."
