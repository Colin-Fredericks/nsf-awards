The conference will feature several one-hour invited talks and a number of contributed talks. \r\n\r\nThe basic objective of the conference is to bring together researchers with expertise in graph theory, combinatorics and computer science in order to make advances in these areas. The conference will give both junior and senior researchers opportunities to present their own new results in combinatorics and computer science, and to work collaboratively on unsolved problems. The majority of the funds will be targeted for travel and accommodation support for students, post-docs and under-represented groups.",
