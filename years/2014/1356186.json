 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project Briar Cliff University is providing scholarship awards to entering freshmen majoring in Biology, Environmental Science, Chemistry, and Biochemistry with demonstrated high motivation, academic talent, and financial need.  In partnership with Sioux City high schools and the Iowa Governor's STEM Advisory Council, Briar Cliff is recruiting its \"STEM Pathways Scholars\" primarily from the State of Iowa and the Tri-State Region including areas of Nebraska and South Dakota. By enabling increased access to high quality STEM education, the project is enlarging the pool of well-prepared undergraduate students who can help meet pressing regional, if not also national, workforce development needs. \r\n\r\nThe technical features of this project include the use of evidence-based practices and creative strategies in addressing Briar Cliff students' identified needs for greater peer support, academic engagement, and career development. Scholars benefit from a rigorous, supported program of study that includes: a first-year STEM Living Learning Community (LLC); an advising trio, comprised of a peer mentor, faculty mentor, and retention specialist; peer-led academic coaching in gateway courses; inquiry-based research embedded in first- and second-year labs; service-learning experiences in environmental preservation and prairie restoration; field experiences; a careers in STEM speaker series, networking events, professional mentors, and optional internships; and attendance and presentation at regional science meetings.  The evaluation of the project utilizes a mixed methods approach and matched comparison cohorts to examine the effectiveness of \"STEM Pathways Scholars\" strategies, including the project's particular emphasis on experiential learning. Findings are being disseminated among Briar Cliff's partners in STEM and higher education institutions throughout Iowa and the Midwest through shared impact reports, presentations at regional science meetings, and publications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBriar Cliff University has completed its 5-year NSF S-STEM grant to establish a STEM Living Learning Community. The goal of this program is to increase the number of STEM graduates at BCU. To date, 41 students have participated in STEM, with a retention rate of approximately 61%, including two scholars who left the program due to academic performance but still graduated from BCU.\n\nThe most important outcome of this grant is that the students participating in the S-STEM program have a much higher retention than non-participants do.  Throughout the five years of our grant, our retention was much higher than both the historical baseline and Briar Cliff's contemporaneous retention rates.  this is due to two different factors:\n\n1)  The living-learning community.  The fact that the students all live together enables them to form on-campus relationships faster than many of their fellow students.  Being in close proximity to each other also fosters the formation of study groups.  These groups help scholars to succeed in difficult science courses.\n\n2)  The scholarship.  Even though many of our scholars reported working, they work less than their fellow students.  Because the grant helps to bridge the gap between the cost of attendance and their awarded scholarships, they do not need to work during the semester.\n\n Another observation that comes from this project is that many highly achieving high-school students have a strong desire to pursue a career in medicine.  It seems that this stems from a desire to help others and a lack of knowledge concerning other options, including scientific research in health issues.  One of the many comments we have heard following our visits to the Sanford Research Center is some variation of, \"I didn't know that I could research diseases, without being a doctor.\" \n\nIf the NSF is interested in increasing the number of scientists, as opposed to medical doctors, there needs to be an increase in outreach to young students, their parents, and K-12 educators.  Young students need to be made aware of the other possibilities for them to \"help others\" in the sciences.  \n\nThere were several differences between students who stayed in STEM and those who left the grant. Over the course of the STEM grant, 25 students remained and 16 left. Reasons for leaving varied: Approximately 38% transferred to another school, while approximately 18% changed majors, and approximately 44% left the grant due to low grades. Those who stayed in STEM (STEM completers) had significantly higher high school GPAs compared to those who left the program, as well as higher college GPAs. Additionally, STEM completers reported feeling more \"engaged\" with the program, attended more STEM activities (e.g., off-campus site visits); and were happier with the overall program.\n\nNo significant differences were found between STEM completers and non-completers with respect to ACT scores (composite, science, and math), gender, race/ethnicity, athletic status, or first generation college status.\n\nSTEM students were also compared to a similar cohort that were eligible to take part in STEM except they did not have the financial need. This cohort, called auxiliary students, began college wanting to major in a STEM area. Although not a true matched sample, they are the closest match in background characteristics when compared to our STEM students. For example, there were no significant differences in ACT scores, high school grades, race/ethnicity, athletic status, or first generation college status. When looking at performance in college, there were no significant differences in college GPAs.\n\nThe overall results of this project were:\n\n1)  78% (32 of 41) scholars persisted from the first to second year.  This exceeds the stated goal of 75% and is higher than the baseline of 60%\n\n2)  73% (27 of 37) scholars persisted to the second year.  This exceeds the stated goal of 67% and is higher than the baseline of 40%.\n\n3)  67% (14 of 21) scholars graduated in the sciences within four years.  This exceeds the stated goal of 58% and is higher than the baseline of 27%.\n\n4)  67% (14 of 21) scholars graduated in the sciences within five years.  This matches the stated goal and is higher than the baseline of 30%. \n\n5)  Only 8.3% (1 of 12) of scholars persisting to the senior year entered graduate school in the sciences.  58% (7 of 12) of scholars have secured employment within the sciences.  The total of scholars working or attending graduate school in the sciences is 67% (8 of 12).  This is less than the stated goal of 95% and the baseline of 75% graduate school admission rate.  The remaining four students are pursing further education in medicine.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Theodore A Bryan"
