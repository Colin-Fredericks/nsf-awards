Very few models for doing this have been implemented and studied.  This Engineering Teacher Pedagogy project implements and assesses the promise of an extended professional development model coupled with curriculum enactment to develop teacher pedagogical skills for integrating engineering design into high school biology and technology education classrooms.  Professional development is provided to twenty high school biology teachers and twenty technology education teachers in the Baltimore County Public Schools.  \r\n\r\nThe professional development consists of two five day sessions in two consecutive summers and follow up in two academic years as the teachers learn content, pedagogical content knowledge and classroom management skills.  The project investigates the teachers' learning trajectories using validated instruments.  A longitudinal study investigates teachers' change in practice and its role on student learning through classroom observations and examination of student artifacts.   The study also investigates whether the change in practice persists over time and the extent to which the change in practice transfers to other learning environments.  This study should elucidate the issues of teaching science concepts through the use of science and engineering practices.",

This proposal had the potential to advance our understanding of the concept in two distinct manners. First, the research examines the use of the same educative materials in two distinct STEM learning environments, technology education and biology.&nbsp; Making comparisons among teachers enacting the materials within and between each of these two settings provides an opportunity to identify elements that may be teacher dependent, disciplinary dependent or that may be more generalizable.

By exploring the INSPIRES lessons themselves, teachers may gain confidence in instructing new (engineering) content to their students. Those teachers that matriculated through the final year of the study have experienced the positive impact that the INSPIRES curriculum has on students. Toward the end of the three-year study, the PD model shifted toward supporting teachers in areas of their own concern (such as how to prepare lessons for a newly adopted science curriculum by the district) and encouraged continued teacher investment in the pedagogical skill-training offered by both summer and academic-year PD sessions.</p>\n<p>After three years, transfer of skills took place within the treatment teacher population, however, longer support may be needed to sustain pedagogical reform over time.
