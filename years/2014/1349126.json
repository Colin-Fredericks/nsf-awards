 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical overview:\r\nA better understanding of the modern sources and distributions of hopanoids is essential for interpreting ancient sedimentary records.  Here we will address questions of hopanoid provenance in marine settings using interdisciplinary analytical approaches, namely compound-specific multi-isotope (13C, D/H, and 14C) measurements combined with analysis of functional genes involved in hopanoid biosynthesis.  The project will make a systematic survey of hopanoid isotope measurements and DNA metagenomes. The samples will cover locations ranging from arctic to tropical, and three sets of samples will span gradients of deltaic to pelagic depositional conditions, forming mini-transects.  The samples will permit use of the established latitudinal patterns in 14C residence times and source water D/H to distinguish land-based from marine sources.  Known patterns of 13C and D/H isotopic fractionation associated with different types of microbial metabolism will be used to determine the metabolic sources of individual compounds, because autotrophic or heterotrophic metabolism is reflected in isotopic variability. The diversity of hopanoid biosynthesis genes (sqhC, hpnP, hpnR, hpnG, hpnH) will be related to hopanoid compound distributions in an independent approach to test if local production is or is not related to local deposition of lipid assemblages.  \r\n\r\nGeneral importance:\r\nOrganic molecules preserved in sedimentary rocks provide a record of Earth?s early biosphere.  They help us understand ancient Earth environments and the expansion, diversification, and maintenance of microbial communities.  Such compounds are called 'molecular fossils', and among the earliest and most abundant examples are compounds called hopanoids.  Derived primarily from bacteria, hopanoids are detectable over timescales of billions of years and have been proposed to be among the most abundantly preserved molecules on Earth.  However, to date we lack an overall picture of their environmental, physiological, and/or species origins.  This project aims to answer basic questions about the hopanoids preserved in marine sedimentary environments.  Are they primarily of marine origin, or do they come primarily from land?  Are they likely to reflect particular sub-groups of microbial taxa, or are they broadly distributed among diverse species, habitats, and lifestyles?  In this project we will use the natural distribution of the isotopes of carbon and hydrogen to help answer these questions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA better global picture of the roles of microbes in the natural environment, both past and present, is fundamental to understanding the functions of global biogeochemical cycles.  Microbial lipids represent biomarkers that have particular biosynthetic origins, and in many cases these lipids are durable &ndash; preserved in sediments and sedimentary rocks for many millions of years.  One of the challenges of interpreting past life and ecosystems, however, is how to interpret the original provenance of these compounds: When present in marine sediments, do they originate from the marine water column, from marine sediment production in situ, or are they carried in by material transported from nearby continents?  This project aimed to answer these questions for a major bacterial class of lipids known as bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs).  Comparative work also was done on a class of archaeal lipids known as glycerol dialkyl-glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs).  In both cases, the goal was to develop methods for compound-specific separation of pure materials in order to perform analyses of their stable isotope ratios.  These stable isotope ratios can be specific for types of carbon sources, metabolisms, and geographic origins &ndash; exposing information about the processes and organisms contributing the lipids to the sediments.  The project represented first steps towards an improved ability to understand the sources and distributions of BHPs and GDGTs to ancient systems.  The results may help to interpret the status of paleoecological communities, and thus the carbon cycle and the co-evolution of life and environment.\n\nSpecific outcomes of the project included a new method to resolve BHPs by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC).  Previously the diversity of BHPs in marine sediments was thought to be limited to around a dozen parent compounds, but the new UHPLC method showed that in fact each of these simple lipids has multiple structural isomers.  This vastly increases the potential for complexity of both source mixing signatures and stable isotope signatures, while it simultaneously also complicates the challenge of achieving separation of pure compounds for isotope analysis.  This was an unexpected finding and presented a significant obstacle to making further progress in the isotope analysis component of the project. A new strategy was developed to collect the different BHP isomers as fractions from the UHPLC, and then separating them by high-temperature gas chromatography (HT-GC), which enables baseline resolution of pure BHPs in a form suitable for stable carbon and stable hydrogen isotope analyses.  Current work is focused on successful adaptation of this protocol to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer.\n\nIn parallel, a different strategy to measure stable carbon isotope ratios of large lipid molecules was developed (as it was the original goal for analysis of BHPs).  Known as spooling wire microcombustion (SWiM), it has the advantage of high precision and high sample throughput.  However, instead of the original goal of applying this approach to the BHPs, which proved to be too complicated for SWiM, the method was used to analyze the sedimentary sources of archaeal GDGTs.  The results exposed some surprising patterns, including evidence that many GDGTs in shelf/slope waters (&lt; 1000 m) appear to have a partially continental source, and that there may also be a sedimentary in situ signature for GDGTs in anoxic basin environments. \n\nThe project has two papers published or in review, one from each of the above topics, and two other papers in preparation.  Multiple posters and talks were presented in conferences, and the project helped educate three post-doctoral scientists, two of them women.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ann Pearson"
