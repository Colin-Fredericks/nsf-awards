 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant provides funding for the design and development of a new class of biologically inspired liquid-repellent materials with multi-functional characteristics. The blueprints of these bio-inspired materials is based on the surface engineering principles of multiple natural species, including but not limited to the lotus leaf, butterfly, Tokay gecko, beetle, springtail, and the pitcher plant. Enabled by their surface architectures at the micro and nanometer scales, many of these natural species exhibit unique macroscopic wetting, adhesion, and optical properties. In understanding these natural surface architectures, novel biologically inspired materials engineered to have multi-functional capabilities will be developed using advanced micro- and nanomanufacturing techniques. Combinations of functions, such as directional liquid repellency, friction reduction, water harvesting, as well as switchable wetting, adhesion, and optical characteristics, are of particularly interest.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will lead to the development of a new class of multi-functional materials and surface coatings with various industrial and medical applications, including but not limited to coatings for anti-biofouling, anti-icing, friction reduction, camouflage, reversible adhesion, thermal management, and fluid collection or separation. Through a \"mix and match\" of various natural surface engineering mechanisms, these multi-functional materials will further enrich the existing library of biologically inspired materials, in which most of these materials are currently modeled after individual natural species. The research will also contribute to the development of novel multi-functional materials exhibiting interplay between wetting, adhesion, and optical properties. Ultimately, the outcomes of this research will enhance the public understanding of biologically inspired technology, as well as their importance to technological advancement.",

For example, Wong's research group has developed an ultrasensitive detection platform termed as Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SLIPSERS), which can detect chemical and biological molecules down to subfemtomolar levels. Such a detection platform could be used for environmental monitoring, national security, analytical chemistry, and medical and infectious disease diagnostics. By mimicking the structural architectures of leafhopper-produced brochosomes, Wong's research group has developed advanced nanomanufacturing method to create synthetic brochosomes, and has discovered their broadband anti-reflective optical property. These synthetic brochosomes could improve solar harvesting, optical sensing, and photocatalysis. By combining multiple natural mechanisms in plant leaves, Wong's research group has created a number of multi-functional biologically inspired materials with enhanced functions such as robust liquid and solid repellency, switchable liquid repellency, and self-repairing. Some of these materials have been applied in ambient water harvesting and anti-fouling coatings for toilet fixtures for water sustainability applications. Inspired by the molecular architectures of biological cell membranes, Wong's research group has developed a set of self-healing liquid membranes that can perform reverse filtration, allowing large particles to pass through while blocking the passage of smaller particles. These membranes could potentially be used as a surgical film that allows surgeons to perform surgery without contaminating the open wounds, or as a gas sequestration membrane in waste management system that blocks the passage of harmful gases while allows solid waste to pass through. Overall, 9 journal publications have been published including papers in <em>Nature Sustainability</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Science Advances</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, <em>Advanced Materials, ACS Nano, and ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces</em> with a total of 944 citations (Google Scholar, May 2021). Two of these papers are listed as Highly Cited Papers by Clarivate Analytics. In addition, seven US patents have been granted with 5 US patent applications pending. A number of these patents have been licensed to spotLESS Materials Inc. cofounded by Wong and his PhD alumna Birgitt Boschitsch. The Penn State spinoff has further received funding support from the NSF SBIR Phase I (1843624) and II (2026140) grants. In addition to the NSF CAREER Award, Wong has been recognized by the DARPA Young Faculty Award, the IEEE Nanotechnology Council Early Career Award in Nanotechnology, IEEE NANOMED New Innovator Award, ASME Sia Nemat-Nasser Early Career Award, Distinguished Alumni Award by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review, and a PECASE award nominated by the NSF. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impact</span></strong><strong>: </strong>Under the support of the grant, an undergraduate/graduate class in bio-inspired interfacial engineering was created (ME 497/597). Four PhD students have been graduated. In addition, Wong gave a keynote speech at the SciCafe at the American Museum of Natural History (2019) to over 500 audiences. Wong's research group has participated and showcased their NSF-sponsored research in the USA Science and Engineering Festival in Washington DC (2016, 2018) with over 300,000 attendees. Wong's work has been featured in various social media and YouTube Channels of various outlets including <em>NSF Science Nation</em> (2016) and Science Magazine (2018), with a total of over 682,544 views (May 16, 2021). The total number of article views for the 9 published journal papers is 238,678 as of May 16, 2021. The research has been featured in prominent media news outlet including BBC, CBC, The Economist, The Guardian, The Times, Le Monde, NPR, Scientific American, Science, Nature Materials, New Scientist, C&amp;EN, etc. Wong's research contributions for pitcher-plant inspired slippery coatings have been honored by an American painter, Ashley Cecil, through her featured portrait \"Protection\" which was showcased at The Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, Pittsburgh, PA. In addition, the liquid-entrenched smooth surface (LESS) coating technology has been archived by the Fisher Fine Arts Library Material Collection at the University of Pennsylvania. Wong and his students have participated in two NSF I-Corps National Programs on the LESS coating technology (1757165) and the brochosome optical coating technology (2111960) in Spring 2017 and Spring 2021, respectively.
