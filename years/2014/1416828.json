  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLiquefaction of loose, saturated sand is a significant earthquake hazard because the liquefied soil can generate large ground movements that cause severe damage to the built environment.  Our understanding of the consequences of liquefaction is hampered by the limited field data that exist regarding liquefaction-induced horizontal ground movements (e.g., lateral spreading) during previous earthquakes. \n\nThis project initiated collaborations with researchers in New Zealand regarding liquefaction-induced ground movements during the 2010 Darfield and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes.  The focus of the work was to use displacements measured from satellite imagery, along with subsurface, topographic, and geologic data, to better understand the factors that influence ground movements due to liquefaction.  The unprecedented spatial resolution of the displacement data produced by the satellite imagery over a large regional area combined with the availability of an enormous amount of subsurface data in Christchurch provide a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the characteristics that influence liquefaction-induced ground movements.  \n\nDuring the planning visit we interacted with researchers at the University of Caterbury and the engineering consulting firm Tonkin and Taylor to plan joint research activities and funding for the future.  We have subsequently obtained funding from the NSF and from New Zealand to collaborate on these activities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen M Rathje"
