 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term data provide a valuable context to understand how landscapes and species adjust to variation in climate, changing land use, and a variety of disturbances. This project extends a twenty-six year study of 14 plant species by combining experiments with models to understand the effects of local and regional variation on plant population dynamics. Field experiments will vary water and ash addition and removal, competition, and seed additions. Survival, growth, fecundity, and recruitment will be measured in both undisturbed populations and experimental treatments, and these small-scale responses will then be linked with larger-scale changes in climate and fire regimes. Long-term data and experimental results will inform models that predict how different fire and climate conditions affect key plant species. In general, this research takes advantage of long-term demographic data on multiple co-occurring plant species to reveal how plants respond across different spatial scales to environmental change.   \r\n\r\nThe research incorporates education efforts at multiple levels. It will support high school research assistants each summer and will fund post-baccalaureate interns, continuing a unique, highly productive, in-depth research experience. Graduate students will be trained through their participation in the research. The project will provide a wealth of statistical, ecological, and conservation information, contributing directly to conservation of Florida scrub, an imperiled ecosystem that is home to dozens of endangered species. Specialized workshops and continual interaction with local land managers and policy makers through collaborations and presentations will increase the practical value of the research findings. Specifically, the project will inform land managers using fire and other tools to conserve critically threatened plants. Public displays and art projects will directly convey information to the general public.",

We used long term data to develop and validate innovative modeling to assess the demographic effects of interactions between disturbances, such as fire, with microhabitat characteristics and human activity. Our long-term demographic sampling now spans 31 years and over 94,000 plants in total. These include over 1000 plants on fourteen of our fifteen study species. Our findings provide critical information to improve management and conservation of biodiversity. For example, one of our studies indicated the pivotal role of seed dormancy, dispersal and fire history on plant population dynamics, distribution and abundance. Because of the prevalence of metapopulation dynamics, we should be aware of the significance of changes in the availability and configuration of suitable habitat associated with human or non-human landscape changes. Decisions on prescribed fires (or other disturbances) will benefit from our knowledge of consequences of fire frequency, but also of location of ignition and the probability of fire spread. The results of another study demonstrate that soil microbiomes can significantly affect plant population growth and persistence and support the incorporation of soil microbiomes into conservation planning. Our long-term research has already been incorporated in regional management and restoration efforts and has been used for conservation planning. These data are the basis of new collaborations, analyses, and published papers.
