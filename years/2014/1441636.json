This process is named osseointegration (OI). OI generally takes several weeks and there is an advantage in achieving rapid and complete OI because it accelerated the rehabilitation and training of patients. Several strategies may be used to increase OI of metal implants. They have the advantage to be applied externally and be effective with brief periods of exposure (approx. 20 minutes per day). Little is known about the relative benefits of these modalities and about any potential benefits of combining these modalities. \r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\n   The goals of this research are to investigate an integrated system to promote bone ingrowth into transdermal OI implants. This includes the following aims: (1) Development and validation of a mechanical actuation system for delivery of controlled LMHF vibration with optimized strain and frequency to the pelvic limbs of rats through a pilot in vivo study in rats, (2) The comparison of the relative effectiveness of LMHF vibration (using the system developed in Objective 1) and commercial LIPUS alone and combined, through an in vivo study in rats, (3) As a secondary objective, the comparison of bone ingrowth and bone density assessment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), (4) As another secondary objective, the comparison of bone surface strains adjacent to an OI implant and acceleration of the implant, measured using an accelerometer.\r\n   The proposed research is motivated by the fact that OI is slow with some current implant designs. For example, the rehabilitation process after placement of a transfemoral OI implant by the Branemark group takes more than one year and requires two surgical procedures. This research will help evaluate the benefits of LMHF vibration and LIPUS alone and combined for implants with different designs in an in vivo rodent model. Upon successful completion, the proposed work will: (1) yield a better understanding of the bone surface strains generated through various vibration protocols, (2) lead to the development of a device allowing the local application of LMHF vibration, and (3) yield a better understanding of the relative benefit and synergy of LMHF vibration and LIPUS on bone ingrowth of threaded and textures implants. 332,000 total hip replacement and 719,000 total knee replacements are performed annually in the United States. This number is anticipated to grow in the foreseeable future. OI dental implants are a well-established medical procedure. One of the most common complications of dental implants is the lack of OI in patients with preexisting osteoporosis.  Approximately 1.7 million people live with a missing limb in the United States and an estimated 185,000 amputations are performed each year. The number of individuals experiencing amputation is predicted to increase to more than 3.6 million by 2050. Lower limb amputees commonly use socket-type prostheses. These prostheses have several limitations: optimal fit is difficult to achieve causing undesirable stresses on tissues that can lead to pressure points, soft tissue sores, and nerve damage. Prostheses fixed by OI address many of the shortcomings resulting from the use of socket prostheses and their applications will most likely grow in the future. Patients fitted with a TOP instead of a socket prosthetics can live more active and healthy lives and more efficiently contribute to society. This research will further our understanding of strategies that may benefit individuals with OI joint prostheses, with dental implants, and with transdermal OI implants. By investigating non-invasive, user-friendly strategies that promote bone ingrowth, this research will benefit all patients receiving implants with the intent of OI.",

Direct skeletal attachment of limb prostheses via skin-penetrating osseointegrated implants is a feasible alternative with numerous advantages over conventional techniques, especially for patients with a short residual bone and high soft-tissue volume. It is believed skeletal attachment of prostheses provides amputees a wider range of motion, increased postural comfort, enhanced sensory feedback through osseoperception, improved limb control, and reduced soft tissue complications. However, effective osseointegration of implants remains a major clinical challenge.</p>\n<p>Recent research has focused on device coatings and metallic porosity to promote osseointegration.&nbsp; 3D printing provides a cost-effective, alternative means to create patient-specific implants and allows for customized textures for integration with bone and other tissues.</p>\n<p>Previous studies investigating fracture healing have indicated that low-magnitude, high frequency (LMHF) whole body vibration (WBV) and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can be beneficial to bone healing through mechanisms not clearly understood. In our previous studies, an optimal amplitude of WBV for stimulating osseointegration has also been identified and used as a basis for the amplitude of locally applied vibration in this study. LIPUS was also investigated as a stimulus for bone in-growth into implants to determine if sufficient levels of the stimulus can penetrate tissues and bone to stimulate healing within the canal at the implant interface. Finally, LIPUS in conjunction with local vibration was investigated to determine if cumulative benefits exist for stimulating implant osseointegration.</p>\n<p>A four-week <em>in vivo</em> rodent study (study &lsquo;A&rsquo;) was conducted to measure early osseointegration in control, LIPUS and local vibration treatment groups in a bilateral femoral canal implant model where implants were 3D printed.. A subsequent eight-week <em>in vivo</em> study (study &lsquo;B&rsquo;) was performed to determine midterm osseointegration and combined treatment effects. Control, local vibration, LIPUS and combined treatment groups were treated bilaterally 20 minutes a day for 5 days a week during each study. Bone-implant integration was evaluated quantitatively through mechanical, radiographic (microCT) and histological evaluations. Mechanical testing included bone-implant stiffness, maximum load to bone-implant failure and energy to failure. Histological evaluations included: fluorescent labeling of new bone at two and three weeks (study &lsquo;A&rsquo;) and five and six weeks (study &lsquo;B&rsquo;) comparing bone remodeling; microCT evaluation of bone volume fraction within 250 &micro;m of the implant (BV/TV) and bone-implant contact (BIC) at both the proximal and distal ends of implants for both studies; and histomorphometric measurements of BV/TV and BIC resulting from acid fuchsine staining.</p>\n<p>Maximum pushout load increased for both LIPUS and vibration groups relative to the control group in study &lsquo;A&rsquo; [37.7% (P=0.002) and 20.2% respectively, Table 1] with the increase from vibration failing to reach statistical significance (Figure 1). Both microCT and histology stained results revealed treatment with either LIPUS or vibration increased bone around the distal end of the implant near the joint of the bone as either BV/TV or BIC relative to the control (Figure 2). No differences were noted for bone-implant stiffness, bone morphology around the proximal end of the implant at the mid-shaft of the bone, or bone remodeling.</p>\n<p>No significant differences were noted for maximum pushout load of study &lsquo;B&rsquo; (Figure 3). After eight weeks, the BV/TV gain of LIPUS seen in study &lsquo;A&rsquo; was no longer present and vibration treatment resulted in greater BV/TV than all other groups (25.7% average, P&lt;0.001, Figure 4). Vibration also increased BIC in the distal region near the joint relative to control and combine [34.8% (P=0.002) and 32.3% (P=0.004) respectively]. The combined treatment group stiffness was significantly lower than LIPUS (21.8%, P=0.003). No significant differences in bone remodeling were identified.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although vibration demonstrated improved osseointegration of titanium implants in the bone canal with increased BIC; this study establishes LIPUS as superior for accelerating early osseointegration through increased axial force to fail at the bone-implant interface. This demonstrates the potential benefit of LIPUS as a therapeutic tool for reducing amputees&rsquo; rehabilitation period. The benefits of LIPUS are no longer significant during midterm osseointegration as the native biological ingrowth process appears to catch up. However, vibration therapy continues to increase the amount of bone around the implant without affecting mechanical properties of the bone-implant interface. Interestingly, combining the treatments resulted in decreased bone-implant stiffness while maintaining axial load to failure. A lower stiffness at the bone-implant interface reduces peak impact loading by distributing the energy as the interface elastically flexes. A combination of LIPUS with locally applied vibration may be beneficial for reducing the incidence of accidental bone-implant overloading. Vibration has demonstrated its therapeutic benefits for increasing bone around an implant and can potentially decrease implant loosening preventing the need for revision artificial joint surgeries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;Weinhold</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814360973_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814360973_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814360973_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1:  Max load to failure of implants in study ?A?.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ola&nbsp;L&nbsp;Harrysson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814414623_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814414623_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814414623_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2:  % BIC per acid fucshine stained histological results for Study ?A?.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ola&nbsp;L&nbsp;Harrysson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814469019_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814469019_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814469019_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3:  Max load to failure of implants in study ?B?.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ola&nbsp;L&nbsp;Harrysson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814560933_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814560933_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490814560933_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4:  BV/TV per acid fucshine stained histological results of Study ?B'.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NC State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ola&nbsp;L&nbsp;Harrysson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490906668816_Table1-Nocolor-FinalReport--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490906668816_Table1-Nocolor-FinalReport--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Table 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1441636/1441636_10328036_1490906668816_Table1-Nocolor-FinalReport--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Table 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Table 1: Mechanical and biological parameters after surgical implantation of textured rods into rat femurs with adjunctive local vibration (Vibration), low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) or vibration and LIPUS (Combined).
