 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vision and language provide fundamental means to interpret, learn, and communicate about the world around us. A primary goal of computer vision and natural language processing research is therefore to automatically uncover and analyze the information that images and video, or text and speech, convey about the world.  Both communities are concerned with tasks that require increasingly deeper understanding, including the ability to reason with and draw inferences from this information.  Since vision and language are complementary modalities, there is now also an increasing amount of work at the interface of both fields. However, progress in multimodal analysis requires a tighter collaboration between the two communities, since each currently relies on its own set of techniques, datasets and evaluation criteria. \r\n\r\nThis community planning grant explores the need for, feasibility, and usefulness of a \"visual entailment\" corpus and associated visual entailment recognition task. In natural language, entailment recognition is the problem of determining whether a particular statement can be inferred from a text document. This project explores a novel related problem - visual entailment - where the goal is to determine whether a statement in natural language can be inferred from an image or video.  The outcomes of the project include a novel dataset and prototype research challenge, as well as increased collaboration between the vision and language communities.",

A set of possible answers is also provided, one answer that was written about the image in question, plus several answers written about other images. The computer is then evaluated on how well it can select the correct choice. Currently, the collection contains 359,001 targeted descriptions for 10,738 images on the Microsoft COCO dataset  \n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of these datasets was implemented by Mark Matten, a high school student, Sahar Kazemzadeh, an Undergraduate student, and two graduate students, Vicente Ordonez and Licheng Yu. Datasets and related concepts were also introduced in the PI's \"Language and Vision\" course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tamara Berg"
