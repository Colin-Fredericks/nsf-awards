Newark and the City College of New York.  Specific instrumentation that will be acquired includes: 1) a magnetometer; 2) borehole logging tools (e.g., gamma ray detector and magnetic susceptibility); 3) electromagnetic instrumentation; 4) a multi-channel seismograph; and 5) global positioning system (GPS) receivers.  The requested instrumentation will support studies of carbon cycling in peatlands, groundwater-surface water interactions, solute transport in various geological settings, and biodegradation of contaminants in the subsurface that will benefit from various near-surface geophysical remote sensing modalities and precise positioning capability.  The equipment will support research training and educational outreach activities at two urban academic institutions with a focus on engaging underrepresented students in geophysics, archaeological research, and applications of near surface geophysical imaging tools to urban environmental issues.\r\n \r\n***",
