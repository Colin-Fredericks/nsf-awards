 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 10th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day, directed workshop on Homology and Geometry, to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 26-30, 2014. The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate  common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology  with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related to low-dimensional geometry, topology and geometric group theory, to investigate  questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series.   The purpose of the workshop  is to investigate  common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology. Major topics of this year's workshop include, the behavior of homology invariants under coverings, minimal genus representatives of 4-manifold homology classes, and homological properties of manifolds with left-orderable fundamental groups.\r\n\r\nThe workshop website is located at http://www.hamilton.tcd.ie/events/gt/gt2014.htm",
