 "awd_abstract_narration": "The era of performance scaling by increasing the performance of\r\nindividual processors is over, having been replaced by the era of\r\nmassive parallelism via multiple cores.  Amdahl's law tells us that\r\nour ability to parallelize computation is limited by the inherently\r\nsequential portion of a computation.  This unfortunate combination\r\nof facts paints a bleak picture for the future of scalable software.\r\nThis work explores a radical new approach to parallelism with the\r\npotential to bypass Amdahl's Law. The approach used involves making\r\ninformed predictions about computation likely to happen in the\r\nfuture, proactively executing likely computations in parallel with\r\nthe actual computation, and then \"jumping forward in time\" if the\r\nactual execution stumbles upon any of the predicted computations\r\nthat have already been completed.  This research touches many areas\r\nwithin Computer Science, i.e., architecture, compilers, machine learning,\r\nsystems, and theory.  Additionally, exploiting massively parallel\r\ncomputation will produce immediate returns in multiple scientific\r\nfields that rely on computation.  The research here provides an\r\napproach to speedup on such real-world problems.\r\n\r\nThe approach used in this research views computational execution\r\nas moving a system through the enormously high dimensional space\r\nrepresented by its registers and memory of a conventional single-threaded\r\nprocessor.  It uses machine learning algorithms to observe execution\r\npatterns to make predictions about likely future states of the\r\ncomputation.  Based on these predictions, the system launches\r\npotentially large numbers of speculative threads to execute from\r\nthese likely computations, while the actual computation proceeds\r\nserially.  At strategically chosen points, the main computation\r\nqueries the speculative executions to determine if any of the\r\ncompleted computation is useful; if it is, the main thread uses the\r\nspeculative computation to immediately begin execution where the\r\nspeculative computation left off, achieving a speed-up over the\r\nserial execution.  This approach has the potential to be infinitely\r\nscalable: the more cores, memory, and communication bandwidth\r\navailable, the greater the potential for performance improvement.\r\nThe approach also scales across programs -- if the program running\r\ntoday happens upon a state encountered by a program running yesterday,\r\nthe program can reuse yesterday's computation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor three decades, computer users have enjoyed rapid and steady increase in computer performance due to the development of faster processors, via clock scaling.  Sadly, this scaling ground to a halt in 2003.  Since then, newer processors have increased compute power by increasing the number of parallel compute engines.  The implication of this transition is clear: if software is to run faster, we must leverage parallel computing hardware with current software.  Simply waiting for new, parallel versions of programs is impractical: it takes too long, and in many cases, it is not known how to parallelize today's software.\n\nThis work presents a radically new approach to the problem of parallelizing software: an architecture, the Automatically Scalable Computational Architecture (ASC), that exploits the structure inherent in computation to predict pieces of computation that might be useful in the future, proactively execute those computations (using parallel hardware resources), and then use those computations later, if the predictions turned out to be correct.
