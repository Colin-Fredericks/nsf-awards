Currently DBS is employed in a static fashion, in the sense that stimulation intensity and frequency are manually adjusted.  However, the neural circuits of the brain are highly dynamic, so major advances to DBS therapy must be \"dynamic\" systems as well, with recording and processing neural signals in real-time and modulating the applied stimulation based on the dynamic state of the brain.  The overall goal of this project is to lay the scientific and technical foundations for dynamic DBS systems that will radically increase the efficacy of DBS in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.  The proposed studies are therefore significant in terms of advancing both basic science, by enabling new and faster experiments, and clinically, by accelerating the development and implementation of DBS therapies.  As part of education and outreach activities, high school, college and graduate students will be engaged in neuroengineering education and research by (i) using an engaging module to teach high school students basics of neurobiology theory and experiment; (ii) challenging college juniors to build their own rat DBS with power and size constraints; and (iii) teaching graduate students neural signal processing using recorded neural activity.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to advance the scientific and technical foundations for dynamic DBS systems that will radically increase the efficacy of DBS in existing indications and enable rapid development for other neurological and psychiatric disorders. As an initial target for innovation, this proposal focuses on DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson's disease.  The following specific aims are proposed. 1 Use new materials to develop joint stimulation and recording electrodes. Record the activity of cortico-striatal-thalamic neurons in healthy, diseased, and DBS-stimulated states during intentional movements. 2 Develop a latent variable model of the dynamics of neural activity during intentional movement. Build a rodent-scale dynamic DBS device that implements model-based, closed-loop dynamic stimulation. 3 Evaluate the effects of long-term dynamic DBS across large cohorts of animals using an automated, high-throughput behavioral monitoring system. The proposed studies are expected to lay the foundation for novel dynamic DBS therapies; generate new conceptualizations of the neural basis of motor symptoms and STN DBS therapy in Parkinson's disease; transition computational models of DBS from the current static approaches to ones that incorporate the time-varying nature of movement-related neural activity; and help discover the neuroprotective and non-motor effects of static and dynamic DBS.",

This would provide a foundation for future human therapies while inspiring and training students to be innovators at the boundary of engineering, neuroscience, and medicine. Over the period of funding, our technological innovations can be divided into three categories. <br /><br />First, we used novel materials to allow for neural interfaces that are bidirectional &ndash; capable of both modulating the brain and recording its activity &ndash; and biocompatible &ndash; evoking minimal \"foreign body responses\" from brain tissue. We focused on carbon nanotube fibers, but other investigators found similar results using materials that are similarly microscopic, flexible, and tough. With flexible electrodes, one of the biggest challenges is that they buckle during insertion &ndash; like a piece of cooked spaghetti might if inserted into a bowl of jello. To insert them,&nbsp; most teams have resorted to using some sort of rigid needle or dissolvable stiffening coating. We invented a way of using the flow of fluid in a microfluidic device to support flexible electrodes down to the brain surface and propel them into the tissue without anything rigid entering the brain, and showed that this approach could be used with brain electrodes in vivo. Further work may develop these ideas into useful systems for therapeutic purposes.<br /><br />Second, we developed systems which interact with the brain in a \"closed-loop\" way - where on-going signals control the perturbation of the neural circuits. Our primary focus has been on electrical recording of neurons controlling electrical stimulation. By carefully simulating our system, we were able to articulate how parameter choices drive tradeoffs between the system accuracy (targeting stimulation at the right moments) and latency (between detection of the ?right moment? and stimulation delivery). As reported at scientific meetings, we have now used our closed-loop system to discover new details of how incidental memories are stored.<br /><br />A different facet of closing-the-loop is to simplify control of brain stimulation, for example&nbsp; for experimenters studying long-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinsons disease. Another important outcome was the development of a battery powered device small enough for a rat to carry that can be controlled wirelessly with a smart-phone ap. This is being used in an ongoing collaboration with a translational neuroscientist studying how DBS affects the progression of neurodegeneration in rats genetically-engineered to have similar disease processes as humans. Our low-cost, battery-powered device enables scaling experiments to large enough numbers of animals to observe key differences.<br /><br />Our systems work has not been limited to electrical brain interfaces. We developed an ultra-lightweight (&lt; 4g) microscope that a mouse can carry on their head. We have demonstrated how this microscope can be used to observe the activity of dozens of individual neurons as reported by a fluorescent protein. Critically, we designed our microscope around a high-speed sensor that allows us not only to measure slower (~1 s) dynamics associated with bursts of pulses produced by a neuron, but also potentially individual pulses (~2 ms). This faster signal is critical for closed-loop processing with subsecond latencies!<br /><br />Third, we developed novel algorithms for understanding how groups of neurons work together to communicate information. Our work has focused on unsupervised machine learning &ndash; learning to decode representations of behavior in the world without using behavior measurements for training data. We validated our algorithms by using them to decode behavior we had measured. In addition, however, we were able to show that we could also decode what was happening in the brain when animals were resting/sleeping. <br /><br />Finally, we have taken pride in sharing our work not only in scientific literature, but also as open-source hardware and software. Our lab GitHub repositories include design files and firmware for our head-mounted microscopes, battery-powered DBS systems, as well as software packages developed to facilitate neural data-processing and spectral analysis in the Python language. <br /><br />Our mission has not been limited to cutting edge research. We have also engaged with the university and broader community to develop and support students at many levels who are excited about neuroengineering. Several graduate students supported by this grant have volunteered as part of the Rice / Texas Medical Center BrainSTEM program, doing regular outreach at the high school level. In addition, we developed a mixed undergraduate/graduate course in Neural Signal Processing which has provided a critical foundation in the use of machine learning in understanding brain signals to dozens of students. As with our research, the website and assignments for this course are hosted publicly and shared with an open-source license. Finally, the NSF?s support both for Prof. Kemere and to others at Rice was instrumental in the development of a Neuroscience minor and major, as well as the recent decision to physically instantiate a focused research center, the \"Rice Neuroengineering Initiative\".<br /><br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/18/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Caleb&nbsp;T&nbsp;Kemere</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407858395_MiniFAST--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407858395_MiniFAST--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MiniFAST Mouse Microscope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407858395_MiniFAST--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MiniFAST Mouse Microscope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High resolution high speed microscope for imaging neural activity in mice</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juneau et al 2020</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Caleb&nbsp;T&nbsp;Kemere</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MiniFAST Mouse Microscope</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407971760_LatentDecoding--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407971760_LatentDecoding--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Decoding Latent States\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407971760_LatentDecoding--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Decoding Latent States\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Unsupervised learning allows neural activity to be decoded and matches actual behavior.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Maboudi et al 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Caleb&nbsp;T&nbsp;Kemere</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Decoding Latent States</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407733511_MicrofluidicInsertion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407733511_MicrofluidicInsertion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microfluidic Insertion of Electrodes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1351692/1351692_10300030_1671407733511_MicrofluidicInsertion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microfluidic Insertion of Electrodes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Innovative new system for inserting flexible electrodes uses fluid flow.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vitale et al 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Caleb&nbsp;T&nbsp;Kemere</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microfluidic Insertion of Electrodes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
