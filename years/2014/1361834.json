 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned I/UCRC for Windstorm Hazard Mitigation intends to undertake functions at the interface between basic and applied research and between private and public interests. Working with its members, the Center will focus on seeking solutions to real world problems encountered by industry members and improve their performance and competitiveness; enhancing government agencies and NGOs capabilities to prepare for and respond to future windstorms; transferring findings from federally sponsored research to products and intellectual properties that benefit researchers, university, and industry; and facilitating collaboration between Center members by developing long-term strategies for enhancing community resiliency to wind and other hazards. \r\n\r\nThe planned center aims to protect homeowners, businesses, and communities through collaborative research in windstorm mitigation and the implementation of innovations will enhance the Nation's resiliency to future disasters. Integrated in the project are several initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and collectively they contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce and business environment. Meanwhile, the planning activities provide a unique opportunity for students to interact with the industry, improve their communication skills, and enhance their employment potentials. The project helps develop students with strong problem solving, marketable capabilities. The project also helps train Center faculty on how to work with the industry.",

The objective of the planning grant awarded by the NSF was to organize meetings between potential members and participating faculty to agree on the initial research agenda and secure financial commitment.\n\nTwo planning meetings were held in 2014 and 2016, participanted by 55 people, including 24 from industry and government agencies. Feedbacks were gathered from perspective members and used for refine project proposals, time line, and Center agreement. \n\n\n\n\n\nStudents were supported to travel to the 1st planning meeting, interacting with practitioners from industry and government agencies and learning about their needs.
