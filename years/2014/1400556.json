 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is investigating how emissions from forests and plants might react on the surfaces of the small particles in the atmosphere to change their optical properties. These changes can alter the extent to which the particles absorb or scatter solar radiation, and influence their impact on climate. The research takes place at an undergraduate institution and the experiments are being performed by an undergraduate team of researchers and one local high school science teacher under the guidance of the Principal Investigator.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research are to: (1) Measure the reactive uptake of biogenic VOCs on mineral substrates; (2) Quantify the impact of ?atmospheric processing? on BVOC uptake by mineral interfaces; (3) Investigate the heterogeneous oxidation of surface adsorbed BVOCs; and (4) Quantify the impact of BVOCs on the climate-relevant properties of mineral aerosol. The results of this research are useful for improving models of the formation and impact of secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere. This project supports an active research program in physical atmospheric chemistry for undergraduate students at Drew University, a small liberal arts college with 1,600 students.",
