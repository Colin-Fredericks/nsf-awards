 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over 60 years annual Science Fairs and Engineering competitions have been held in schools and communities throughout the country, engaging large numbers of middle school students and culminating in national and international events. Science fairs are at the intersection of formal learning in school and informal science learning in other settings including science centers, after-school programs, and clubs. However, in spite of their wide implementation and long history, there are few empirical studies that have examined the relationship between student participation in these fairs and their learning and interest in science. Additionally, there have been no studies to understand the real cost of these programs relative to the student benefits. This educational research project will fill that gap in understanding.  It will systematically document and describe science fair models; measure their impact on learning; and provide evidence about the costs of various models and related benefits.  The findings from this study will inform a wide range of stakeholders (including teachers, science fair leaders, volunteers, parents, and businesses) about these models and how they impact students' mastery of science and engineering practices.  \r\n  \r\nThis four-year study in all regions of the country will be conducted in two phases: Phase 1 will be a survey of 3800 middle school science teachers will define the characteristics of science fair models; Phase 2 will use those understandings to conduct case studies in 20 schools.  Deliverables include handbooks for teachers and the science fair community, articles in journals summarizing findings, the Science and Engineering Practice and Interest Inventory, and a suite of data collection instruments for scoring rubrics to describe science fairs and measure their impact. Research questions will include:  (1) What are the basic models of middle school science fairs? (2) To what extent does participation in a particular model enhance students' mastery of science and engineering practices and/or their interest in science? (3) What student-teacher and school-level factors contribute to or inhibit students' mastery? (4) What resources, human and financial, are required to implement an effective middle school science fair? and (5) What are the most cost-effective aspects of the science fair experience, and how can they be applied or adapted by science fair leaders and teachers to strengthen students' mastery of science and engineering practices? Findings from this study will have the potential to improve current practices in the design and implementation of science fairs and their impact on student learning; they will be widely disseminated to the various stakeholders through publications, conference presentations, and educational association channels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study was designed to document the basic models and elements of middle school science fairs, and understand whether/how they increase students\u2019 interest in science, technology, engineering or math and/or STEM careers; if they enhance students\u2019 mastery of the science and engineering practices; and the resources needed to implement a middle school science fair.\n\nWe collected 370 surveys, conducted 206 interviews with teachers, principals, and others; conducted 19 student focus groups; collected 568 pre- and 537 post-science fair student questionnaires, and observed 20 science fairs from 21 middle schools in the Midwest, Northeast, South, and Western regions of the United States, in rural, suburban, and urban locales, with students representing a range of demographic characteristics.\n\n \n\nMODELS AND ELEMENTS OF MIDDLE SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIRS  \n\nMandatory science fairs were far more common than voluntary fairs, and the types and extent of support teachers provided for student investigations varied greatly. Schools with high proportions of African American students were more likely to offer mandatory fairs with low levels of teacher support. These results have implications for providing high quality and equitable opportunities for all students across science fair experiences. \n\n\nWe found three primary types of science fairs:  \n\nmandatory fairs with high levels of teacher support for students\u2019 investigations (23%), \nmandatory fairs with low levels of teacher support (57%), and \nvoluntary fairs (20%).\n\n\n\n\nTeachers were more likely to provide basic support for students\u2019 science fair projects compared to more substantive support related to students\u2019 investigations.\n\n\nMandatory fairs with low teacher support had higher average proportions of African American students, but were also more likely to endorse a learning-related goal as their top goal for the fair, as opposed to an interest-related goal suggesting implications for providing high quality and equitable opportunities for all students.\n\n\n \n\nSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES\n\nOur analysis suggests that when students are called upon to synthesize their work in order to prepare themselves and their peers for presentations, they are more likely to demonstrate gains in their understandings of science and engineering practices.\n\nIn schools where teachers provided a high level of support for students to communicate about and evaluate their work, such as providing opportunities for students to practice presenting prior to meeting judges, students were more likely to show gains in their understandings of SEPs. \n \n \nControlling for other factors, students who participated in science fairs where they were able to present and defend their work and/or critique other students\u2019 work made greater gains in SEP scores. \n\n\n \n\nCOST OF SCIENCE FAIRS\n\nOur analysis of contrasting science fairs at two schools examined the cost in US dollars of implementing a science fair, and the relationship between equity and cost.\n\nTeachers\u2019 time supporting students represented approximately half to three quarters of the total per-pupil costs: $227.03 per student for teachers\u2019 time at School A and $33.98 per student for teachers\u2019 time at School B.\n\n\nTeachers wanted all students to have an equal opportunity for a productive learning experience regardless of their families\u2019 access to resources, and so they were intentional about the time they devoted to supporting their students\u2019 science fair experiences.\n\n\nBetween one quarter to one half of the time that teachers devoted to science fair-related activities was their personal, non-work time.\n\n\n \n\nPARENT INVOLVEMENT IN SCIENCE FAIRS\n\nParents were positive about the science fair experience. Only 7% of parents offered only negative descriptions, while 46% of parents offered only positive descriptions, and an additional 46% responded with a mixture of negative, positive, and/or neutral descriptions.\n\n\nThe majority of parents who supported their students\u2019 project focused on managing the work, rather than performing the project. Approximately half of parents provided substantive help with mandatory fair projects, but in schools where the science fair was voluntary all parents provided this help.\n\n\nHigh-income parents were significantly more likely to provide substantive support to their children compared to mid-income parents. \n\n\n \n\nSCIENCE INTEREST AND IDENTITY\n\nOpportunities for student agency within the science fair and an emphasis on competition were related to gains in students\u2019 science interest and identity, but importantly, these relationships varied for girls and boys.\n\nBoys      participating in a science fair with a high emphasis on competition      maintained their interest in science careers compared to boys who participated      in a science fair with a low emphasis on competition. In schools with a      low emphasis on competition, boys\u2019 interest in science careers decreased.\n\n\nGirls      who had the opportunity to present their science fair work to a larger      audience decreased less in their desire to do science compared to girls      who did not have that opportunity. \n\n\nGirls who had greater agency in choosing their science fair topic and designing their investigation maintained their self-concept in science compared to girls who had less agency in these matters, whose self-concept in science decreased.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Abigail Jurist Levy"
