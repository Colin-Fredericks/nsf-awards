 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort is focused on better quantifying the emissions of aerosols and trace gases of global significance from combustion sources in Nepal and Bhutan. Very little information currently exists on emissions from sources such as brick kilns, garbage burning, and cooking fires. The broader impacts of this research include the development of a better understanding of the contribution of emissions from South Asia to the global burden of gases and aerosol important for predicting regional air quality and global climate change. This work is part of a larger international effort between the US, Nepal, Bhutan, Germany, and Italy to study atmospheric chemistry in South Asia. \r\n\r\nChemical species to be quantified include: PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 &#956;m), elemental and organic carbon, absorption by black and brown carbon, smoke markers, a suite of particle-phase metals and ions, CO2, CO, CH4, more than 90 diverse non-methane organic gases, SO2, NOx, NH3, HCN, acetonitrile, and many other types of aerosol and trace gases. The measurements will complement ongoing regional monitoring activities by filling a critical need for better source characterization. The results will help to assess the relative importance of South Asian combustion sources in influencing air quality and climate on a local, regional, and global scale.",

Our main goal was to better quantify the large influence of the combined emissions from numerous, but little-studied, individual small-scale combustion sources. These previously under-studied sources utilize biomass, coal, and various liquid fossil fuels to provide energy for transport (scooters), homes (cooking), and micro-enterprises (e.g. brick kilns) and they employ open-burning as a waste-disposal (garbage and crop residue) or land management practice. The sources location in developing countries make them extremely difficult to study due to severe challenges involving logistics, representative sampling, chemical complexity, etc. In addition, the amount of each activity is not well known. Our work is the most complete to date in terms of sampling a wide range of important sources and the thorough characterization of the emitted gases and particulate matter that we provided for each source. To address uncertainty in activity levels we also carried out ambient monitoring in 6 locations and from a mobile lab. The ambient monitoring has enabled us to estimate the relative contribution of each type of pollution to the total regional pollution. We also compared the actual ambient values to atmospheric chemistry model predictions to enable model improvements. The combined source, ambient, and model data were used to recommend mitigation strategies that should improve air quality and health while also reducing negative impacts on global climate and the regional agriculture and water supply. Useful strategies include: cleaner cookstoves (LPG, biogas), cleaner brick kilns (ZigZag), diesel particulate filters, electric motorbikes that can be charged at night using hydropower, a farm tractor accessory that allow replanting without burning the crop residue, solar powered irrigation pumps, and better municipal solid waste collection and composting.
