Plemmons\r\nSan Diego State University\r\n?Research Ethics Education Workshop?\r\n\r\n\r\nUS-Japan Research Ethics Education Workshop\r\n\r\nAs research, practice, and education in science and engineering become increasingly global so must efforts to address their ethical dimensions. This workshop will bring together Japanese counterparts ? researchers, administrators, government representatives ? to discuss the critical issues of misconduct in science and approaches toward education and training which may mitigate some of the circumstances leading to such misconduct. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will facilitate future collaborative interactions with Japanese science and education agencies and researchers.  It is the first US-Japan collaboration on this topic and holds the promise of building new collaborations that will be highly relevant to both sides.",
