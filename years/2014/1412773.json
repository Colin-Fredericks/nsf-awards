 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand what happens to cells when they make mistakes in their genetic codes - why is it that sometimes mistakes help cells grow better, while in other instances cells may die? The project will integrate laboratory research and training programs for undergraduate and graduate students, including members of historically underrepresented minorities. The impact of these efforts will be measured by the presentation of research findings at local and national scientific meetings, by future placements of students, and by student authorship of peer reviewed publications. This project will also provide laboratory training and education experiences for high school and community college students. In addition, the project will contribute to other broader activities including a training course in advanced bacterial genetics, and mentoring workshops for junior investigators.\r\n\r\nTranslating the four-letter code of RNA into the twenty-two-letter alphabet of proteins is a central feature of cellular life. The accuracy of this process, translation of the genetic code, determines how faithfully the information in a genome is transformed into proteins with correct amino acid sequences. The role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in translation is to define the genetic code by correctly pairing cognate tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases select the correct tRNA with comparative ease due to the unique sequences and structures found in these small RNAs. In comparison, the simplicity of amino acid structures makes discrimination between them far more difficult. Synthetases achieve the amino acid substrate specificity necessary to keep errors in translation to an acceptable level in two ways: preferential binding of the cognate amino acid, and selective editing of non-cognate and non- protein amino acids. Editing significantly decreases the frequency of mistakes during aminoacyl- tRNA synthesis in vitro, although many details of the reaction mechanism and the impact of in vivo editing remain unclear. We have identified different growth conditions where editing is required for viability, for example in response to oxidative stress and starvation, and during cellular differentiation. It is not fully clear why quality control (QC) through aaRS editing is required under only a subset of growth conditions, but under some of these conditions, the lack of editing leads to the accumulation of toxic, non-protein amino acids in proteins. Under other conditions, the lack of editing may decrease the amount of uncharged tRNA, a critical molecule that cells sense in order to mount a necessary starvation response. The objectives of this project are to use microbial genetic, physiological and biochemical approaches to determine the mechanisms by which quality control impacts cellular function in response to stress, and the impact of quality control on mistranslation with non-cognate and non-protein amino acids.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this proposal was to understand the importance of quality control (QC) pathways that limits errors in the process of protein production.  These QC pathways ensure that the correct amino acids are attached to their corresponding tRNAs, the shuttle molecules that bring amino acids to the ribosome to make proteins.  There is a distinct QC pathway for each of the tRNAs involving an enzyme, the tRNA synthetase, which must distinguish between structural very similar amino acids.  These tRNA QC pathways are conserved in all life forms, indicating their importance for cells.  However, the QC pathway can be ablated for at least some tRNA synthetases and cells still grow.  In this study, we identified that the tRNA QC pathways are important under stressful environmental conditions.  We observed this to be true for at least two evolutionarily divergent bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.  For E. coli, the QC pathway for the amino acid phenylalanine is critical under conditions of excess oxygen, something E. coli encounters when infecting humans.  For B. subtilis, the QC pathway for the amino acid isoleucine is critical under conditions of starvation.  We further found that the problem caused by lack of the phenylalanine QC pathway is the production of toxic aggregates of protein.  However, these toxic aggregates do not appear in the B. subtilis cells lacking the isoleucine QC pathway, suggesting that there is more to learn about the problems that cells experience due to the loss of QC pathways.  These studies are contributing to our understanding of QC pathways in bacteria, but also suggest explanations for why loss of tRNA QC pathways in humans can lead to disease. \n\nTraining and mentoring of students was an integral part of this research.  Fifteen students participated in this research.  One was a graduate student, two were research associates hired immediately after completing their undergraduate degree, and 12 were undergraduate students at the time of their research.   Of these students, half of them were from low-income families.  All of them are now perusing a career as a medical doctor or a Ph.D. allowing them to change the future for their families financially.  Three of the students were from groups that are underrepresented in science, all of whom will be future role models for others from underrepresented groups that want to pursue a career in science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Beth Lazazzera"
