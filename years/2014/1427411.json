 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Diana Cermak from Knox College and colleagues Katherine Adelsberger, Helen Hoyt and Mark Shroyer will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at Knox College, Monmouth and Illinois Central College.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis and characterization of camphor-sulfonyl derivatives and new phosphonates; (b) studying redox-activity of supporting ligands; (c) characterizing inorganic iron complexes, organic reaction products and organic ligands; (d) identifying phosphorus species and quantifying plant-available phosphorus within soils at Knox's biological field station; (e) studying solution phase magnetism and singlet-triplet splitting for Cu(II) carboxylate dinuclear species; and (f) studying lignans and peptides.",

The new spectrometer, equipped with an autosampler, a variable temperature unit and autotunable 31P NMR, replaced an aging instrument that no longer met the needs of the involved departments and programs.  The instrument has directly contributed to research activities in chemistry and environmental studies at Knox College, research activities at Monmouth College, and curricular needs in chemistry, environmental studies, and physics at Knox College and Illinois Central College.  This instrument has strengthened faculty research programs and facilitated hands-on access by undergraduates in research training as well as in the laboratory curriculum.\n\n \n\nOver the course of the grant period, the NMR has been heavily used for both research initiatives and curricular needs.  Several ongoing faculty research projects heavily utilized the new NMR spectrometer:  PI Cermak made advances on two projects&mdash;synthesis and characterization of new camphorsulfonyl derivatives and novel new-crop phosphonates&mdash;both of which are nearing publishable results; Co-PI Hoyt?s work in iron catalysis focused on the investigation of redox-activity of supporting ligands to determine what is required for selective hydrosilylation reactions&mdash;initial results were published in Polyhedron; Co-PI Adelsberger has successfully used 31P NMR for the identification of phosphorus (P) species and quantification of plant-available P within soils at Knox College?s Green Oaks Biological Field Station and is working to use this same methodology in restored prairie soils at the Nature Conservancy?s Nachusa Grassland in northern Illinois; Co-PI Shroyer has conducted preliminary investigations of paramagnetic shifts as a function of temperature using both novel copper(II) carboxylate research compounds provided by Senior Personnel Clayton as well as iron precatalysts provided by Co-PI Hoyt; Monmouth College Senior Personnel Sturgeon and Prinsell used the NMR to characterize lignans and nucleophilic substitution reaction products.

Additionally, results from these research initiatives were presented at several scientific meetings; these projects resulted in 10 student presentations and 9 faculty presentations at regional and national conferences as well as invited talks. Co-PI Hoyt?s research has also produced a publication in the peer-reviewed journal Polyhedron with several student co-authors during the grant period.  A great number of students have utilized the NMR over the grant period&mdash;either through hands-on use of the instrument or data produced by this spectrometer&mdash;through curricular offerings in Chemistry, Environmental Studies, and Physics at Knox College with a combined enrollment of 417 student seats.  The 24-sample autosampler and automation software has significantly changed our ability to use this instrument in our larger courses (general chemistry and organic chemistry) and will continue to add to our curriculum in the future.
