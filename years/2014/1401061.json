 "awd_abstract_narration": "Racial and ethnic disparities in health status and health care are a major concern for both scientists and public health officials. To date, very little research has focused on the role of mass incarceration on future trends of health disparities. Research reveals disparities in health for inmates across multiple domains, including chronic health and infectious diseases, serious mental illness, and substance use disorders. Yet, incarceration is an often ignored and poorly understood factor in health disparities research, in general. Incarcerated persons are excluded from national health surveys and correctional facilities often have an inadequate surveillance system for providing valid and reliable data on inmate health status. Understanding the health profile and health care needs of the incarcerated population is imperative for achieving health equity and understanding and maintaining the public health of the local communities from which inmates are drawn. \r\n\r\nThe proposed dissertation uses an epidemiological criminology perspective in conjunction with large and representative national data sets to examine the factors that contribute to mortality, morbidity, and health service utilization among an often neglected yet increasingly relevant group for population health: incarcerated adults.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how mass incarceration influences population health and health disparities is imperative for health care policy. Prisons are currently uniquely situated to provide healthcare to individuals who are likely underserved in their communities. Understanding the health care needs of this population is especially timely and given the overrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in U.S. prisons, providing diagnosis and effective treatment during incarceration as well as providing for transitions in care upon release may help reduce health disparities in the population.",
