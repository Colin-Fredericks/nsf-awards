 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advancing what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that shows the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and PI teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and that allows them to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning.  This project team aims to explore how to foster learning in socially-networked communities, particularly learning that results in behavior change. Understanding how to foster such learning could have a wide variety of societal impacts, e.g., better fostering science, engineering, mathematical, or design thinking in school or college or on the job, fostering healthy behaviors, helping teens develop pro-social behaviors, and helping people learn to make environmentally-friendly choices as they live their lives. In previous work, this team has developed YardMap, an infrastructure for citizen science that brings together retired adults who are interested in planting and managing their yards in environmentally-friendly ways. YardMap enables social interactions and shared creation of virtual worlds in which participants can try out different ways of managing their yards and see what the downstream effects will be. They also track and display their changing practices and actual yards in ways that are visible to others. YardMap is used by many thousands of participants. In this project, the team is taking YardMap to the next level, using what is known about how people learn and come to change their behaviors to design and refine ways to more directly support individuals in critiquing and improving their behaviors and designs for the common good. What can be learned from the new YardMap will be useful in other fields that focus on helping people change their behaviors in productive ways.\r\n\r\nThe PIs seek to explore how people learn and how to foster learning in socially-networked citizen science communities. Their research addresses how learning happens, how to foster learning, how to design to increase social activity, and how increased interaction with others elevates interest, generates knowledge, and leads to behavior change. Their technological innovation, an infrastructure for citizen science that fosters behavior change, builds on YardMap, an existing infrastructure for citizen science around environmental issues that allows collective data collection and analysis and supports interactive graphing and mapping. Participants design and refine ways of managing their yards in ways that take into account environmental concerns. YardMap enables social interaction and co-creation of a set of virtual worlds for trying out new ideas; learners who are part of the community interact with others in the community, create and refine virtual worlds together, interact with things in the virtual world, manipulate those worlds and collect and analyze data about outcomes, and discuss visual objects that represent real things and practices. As well, individuals track and display their changing practices and actual yards in ways that are visible to others. YardMap can be thought of as a maker movement community focused on yard maintenance; like other maker communities, it encourages participants to create, share and discuss new inventions and practices in a social-networked community setting. Using both what is known about learning in communities and what is known about social drivers of interaction, the team is is extending YardMap to focus on fostering learning and investigating the relationships between learning and behavior change and the influences each has on the other. Much will be learned about how to use social interactions in positive ways to help individuals become more comfortable with behaviors they need to or should take on for health, civic, or educational reasons. What is learned and the technological infrastructure that is created will be directly applicable to other situations where individual behavior changes are needed for change to happen in a social system (e.g., environmental action, changing the culture of an organization, changing norms in a community, perhaps even creating learning communities in formal on-line courses).",

In the service of this project, we expanded the online Web application, YardMap, to include new tools for forming online groups, assessing collective impact (e.g. how many acres of land do we together have devoted to pollinator gardens?), and analyzing individual's progress towards up to nine conservation goals they selected in a planning tool.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;YardMap generated significant broader impacts from 2014-2018, including 39,249 new contributing participants who collectively created 24,701 maps and another 1,106,869 unique information-seekers who, curious about how to garden for wildlife, visited our learning content 1,824,806 times. Roughly 1200 research participants helped us build a dataset to investigate the importance of group identity formation. Understanding this element will help future design of online learning environments in light of evidence that group identity is a critical element in helping people successfully participate in a diversity of activities, including learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ran three experiments over the lifespan of this project. The first tested the impact of social norms in online contexts by exploring effects of norm violations on judgments of others within a group (N = 292). We showed participants one of two habitat maps at random: one where the pet cat was depicted outdoors and one where the cat was depicted as an indoors-only cat. Participants who saw a map depicting an outdoor cat judged the map's habitat to be lower in quality than those seeing an indoor cat. Seeing an outdoor cat reduced the viewer's confidence that the map's owner would engage in future sustainable behaviors. This effect was mediated by whether or not the person doing the judging was a cat owner themselves (cat owners judged the maps less harshly), suggesting that people are bringing complex, overlapping group identities to bear when making judgments about others in online contexts.</p>\n<p>Our second experiment again built off of theory suggesting group identification has a significant role to play in how individuals interact with a learning activity. This time we ran an experiment to test the effects of how participation in the Habitat Network project was named and framed. Some participants were randomly assigned to a version of the website describing it as a \"citizen science\" project, while others saw it framed as an \"environmental stewardship\" project. Based on previous research linking masculinity with science and femininity with environmentalism we hypothesized that men would identify more with the project when it was referred to as citizen science and women would identify more with the project when it was referred to as an environmental project (N = 704). While preliminary results suggested that women were more productive participants when they experienced the environmental stewardship frame and men more productive in when they experienced the citizen science frame, the difference was not statistically significant, indicating that how the project is framed doesn't affect level of participation in the project. These results are interesting given the current tension within the citizen science field about naming/ framing the field as \"citizen science\" and how that may negatively impact some people's willingness to participate.</p>\n<p>Our culminating experiment for this project used the newly developed online tools described above to expand previous research on group identity by asking whether or not it matters if people get to choose their groups based on topic or are assigned a group at random (N = 344). While these data are still being analyzed, an early result suggests participants who were assigned a group had, on average, slightly higher group identity than those who were given the choice to select their group based on interest/ knowledge/ familiarity. While this is somewhat counterintuitive--you would likely guess that people would be more 'into' a group they selected--there is some evidence from studies of group identity that suggest identity is strongest for groups one doesn't have a choice about belonging to, such as racial or ethnic identity group, or geographic birthplace.
