 "awd_abstract_narration": "An anticipated increase in population to more than 8 billion, a 50% increase in demand for food and fuel, and a 30% increase in demand for clean water will occur in the next 2 decades. To enable this, humanity must increase our understanding of the physical, biological and chemical processes occurring in the Critical Zone (CZ) that nurture human society globally. The CZ is Earth's surface layer between the top of the vegetation canopy and the base of groundwater.  Such understanding will help society to better adapt to and manage the effects associated with ongoing land-use and climate change. This proposal proposes to create an international Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) SAVI as an integrating activity for Earth surface geosciences research worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this proposal is to address important and outstanding charges that challenge the U.S. CZO program: How can individual sites articulate and answer network-wide questions? How can the diverse CZOs make some measurements in a coordinated fashion at all CZOs? Proponents hypothesize that development of such measurements and questions requires focused leadership and a concerted effort that entails 5 years of workshops, graduate and postgraduate student mentoring, and targeted research projects that demand common measurements. They have proposed an approach to the development of international cross-CZO science, and to establish a new cadre of truly interdisciplinary and international scientists through graduate student and postdoctoral training. \r\n\r\nThis CZO SAVI will establish a framework to address major challenges that face humanity with respect to habitability of the CZ. This project will engage U.S. and international partners from diverse networks by: 1) learning to explore and measure the essential variables underpinning models of the CZ; and, 2) supporting a U.S. group of junior scientists to become the next-generation of international scholars of the CZ. In short, the project seeks to implement a cross cutting and coupled network of junior researchers working closely with the senior CZO leaders to promote understanding of the cross-disciplinary and coupled nature of CZ processes.  This is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is co-funded by NSF's Geosciences Directorate, Biological Sciences Directorate and the Office of International and Integrative Activities.",

CZO-SAVI focused this effort on strengthening the relationship between U.S. CZOs with the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and with international partners including the German Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO), the French Reseu des Bassins Versants network (RBV/Critex), the UK/China CZO partnership, and Chinese CZOs.

The relatively small investment allowed international CZ researchers to gather to focus on specific topics of societally-relevant scientific interest, to develop cross-site science questions and an understanding of the common measurements needed to address them. CZO-SAVI supported eight working group workshops with topics ranging from concentration-discharge relationships, data management, slope-aspect control of CZ processes, biogeochemistry, and microbial ecology, to Sino/U.S. CZOs, CZ services, and CZ resiliency. CZO-SAVI supported an additional five international CZO workshops held prior to Fall AGU Meetings from 2015 to 2019. Each workshop averaged forty five participants from nine nations. The early pre-AGU workshops established research foci and working groups in concentration-discharge relations, carbon flux balances for soil organic matter, and measurement and prediction of spatial variations in CZ architecture, while in later years the workshops served to develop strategies, goals and specific plans for implementing the science. The workshops were an integral part of planning for and developing the ongoing Belmont Forum?s Collaborative Research Action on Sustainability of Soils and Groundwater for Society.</p>\n<p>The CZO-SAVI International Scholars Program provided funding for graduate students to travel to CZO sites or pre-eminent laboratories overseas to further the investigation of the CZ, while the CZO-SAVI<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Summer Interns Program<strong>&nbsp;</strong>supported travel and research-related expenses for graduate and postdoctoral students to pursue research at multiple U.S. CZOs.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A CZ and Ecosystems Dynamics summer field school, organized and co-directed by CZO-SAVI and the European Community funded ECOPOTENTIAL project, was convened in the western Alps, Italy.

In addition, CZO-SAVI supported travel and research-related expenses for&nbsp;<em>ad hoc</em>&nbsp;activities including: U.S. graduate students? participation in a CZO Field School in Western Australia, and a CZO Modeling Summer Institute run by the Intensively Managed Landscapes CZO; attendance by U.S. scientists to the 2017 Chapman Conference on extreme climate impacts on aquatic biogeochemical cycles and fluxes, and a CZO/NEON/LTER/ISMC workshop; and,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>cross-CZO network post-doctoral associate to develop conceptual models of hydrologic partitioning in the CZ.</p>\n<p>CZO- SAVI provided the funding to overhaul and update&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.czen.org/\">www.czen.org</a>, the Critical Zone Exploration Network (CZEN) website originally created to help organize the evolving community of CZ researchers prior to the development of NSF?s CZO program.

This effort included the update or addition of 251 field sites from 35 countries to Site Seeker, an interactive multi-parameter search tool for locating field sites used for CZ research around the world ? developed specifically to facilitate collaboration and cooperation so researchers can quickly find sites with characteristics of relevance to their research.</p>\n<p>In summary, CZO-SAVI created a large, diverse international community of researchers and educators poised to continue CZ science into the future, at the core of which are the members of the CZEN.
