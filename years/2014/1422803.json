This tragedy has caused the ban of use of potable water and has resulted in closure in several establishments including schools and business. President Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for the state on Friday, January 10, 2014 to provide federal aid for the state. \r\n\r\nThis project will:\r\n1. Assess the short- and long-term chemical fate of 4-methylcyclonehexane methanol in the drinking water and riverine systems through sampling efforts,\r\n2. Evaluate potential risks of the spill to public health and the environment, and\r\n3. Develop quick remediation measures and strategies for more resilient water treatment and\r\ndistribution operations in future disasters\r\n\r\nEnvironmental disasters resulting from accidents happen and will continue to happen.  In the case of the spill of the coal conditioning chemical it happened to affect about 15 % of the population of West Virginia.  This project will try to determine what might be done in the future to prevent such catastrophes and how can we build more resilience, in water treatment plants for the future.",
