Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Daniel J. Ketover is \"Min-Max Minimal Surfaces in Three-Manifolds.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Princeton University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Fernando Marques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen you dip a wire into soapy water, the soap film that forms along the wire is called a minimal surface.  These surfaces want to minimize the area spanned by the film.  Such minimal surfaces are surprisingly useful throughout geometry and topology.  The PI continued his study of their properties and developed new techniques for construcitng them.  \n\nA basic question in topology is whether one can represent certain special surfaces in a manifold by minimal surfaces.  The PI obtained results in this direciton that had a number of applications to studying three-manifolds.  \n\nAnother question the PI's research addressed involves ellipsoids. Given a three-dimensional ellipsoid, what are all the minimal two-spheres insde of it?  The PI showed with Haslhofer that as one elongates such an object one obtains interesting minimal spheres distinct from the four standard planar ones. \n\nIn an asymptotically flat manifold like the universe in which we live, are there any minimal surfaces?  The PI with Chodosh showed that in such manifolds without embedded minimal surfaces (horizons for black holes, say) through every point there passes a minimal plane.  This gives the existence of a multitude of minimal surfaces in spaces which are not merely perturbations of the Euclidean space.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Ketover"
