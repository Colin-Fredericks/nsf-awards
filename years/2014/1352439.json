 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this award, supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Jeremy A. May of the University of Houston is developing a general method for the chemical synthesis of a variety of biologically active bridged polycyclic natural products. While such structures in the past have required disparate strategic approaches, the use of a cascade reaction sequence efficiently provides a variety of these molecules with control over the molecular bonding. Highly reactive carbene intermediates, carbon-carbon triple bonds that are covalently linked, and dimeric rhodium catalysts allow multiple chemical bonds, including highly strained cyclic structures, to be synthesized in one reaction. As the reaction sequence forms its final chemical bond through a C-H bond insertion, no prior modification of the substrate at the site of this insertion is required, which greatly increases efficiency, maximizes flexibility, and minimizes waste. The controlling elements for the reactivity are under study, and new catalysts for the transformation are being designed.\r\n\r\nThe structural motifs produced by this synthesis technology are found in numerous biologically active compounds produced naturally in minute quantities. Since these natural products display antimalarial, anticancer, antimicrobial, and other useful properties, the synthetic strategy is being applied to these targets to obtain sufficient material for further study. Moreover, the rapid nature of the chemical synthesis allows modifications to the parent structure to be made so that the key molecular elements for biological activity may be identified. Thus, this effort has a broader impact on disease mechanisms, natural product biology, and several fields of chemistry. The research effort under this award is integrated in multiple levels of education, as the graduate, undergraduate, and junior high students who participate learn principles of biochemistry, organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, catalysis, and scientific analysis.",

We built the program to incorporate hands-on demonstrations for the students, which included ooblek (non-Newtonian fluid), electrolysis to form hydrogen filled bubbles (forms of energy), liquid nitrogen (phase changes), and making bouncy balls from the polymer derived from borax and white glue. The students had 20 minutes at each station to learn and experiment with the principles for themselves. We also invited the UH ACS student section to participate and present more hazardous (and non-interactive) chemical demonstrations. The visiting KIPP students were excited to see a group of college students as diverse as themselves perform stimulating experiments. All participants were allowed to keep the safety goggles they wore during experiments as mementos. The teacher organizers from KIPP even used the trip as motivation for the students to study and do well on their science tests. The focus at this KIPP campus is fine arts, and there is limited budget for science programs, so this collaboration has a huge impact on students? education.
