 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to measure methane concentrations in frozen lakes continuously throughout the Arctic winter using autonomous sampling devices, to more thoroughly address the variability in the methane flux from Arctic lakes to the atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, the release of which from Arctic sources is poised to increase with climate warming. This project will expand upon a successful pilot study that included the initial testing of autonomous continuous fluid sampler and sensor systems. The proposed expansion will involve additional capabilities and the deployment of a sampling unit in each of six small lakes along a north-south gradient in the Mackenzie River delta in the Canadian Arctic for a nine-month period, spanning the winter season. With these data the investigators aim to characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial conditions in the water column to elucidate hydrologic, microbial, and weathering processes during the winter season, when methane builds in lake water under the ice cover. The investigators hypothesize that sudden (week, days, or even hours) releases of methane, following spring flooding and ice cover breakup, produce a distinct atmospheric flux from Arctic lakes that would otherwise be missed, since most logistically reasonable sampling occurs in the summer months when methane concentrations in these lakes are low or below detection.\r\n\r\nThe majority of methane flux to the Arctic atmosphere is estimated to come from soils and small lakes, although these estimates are based on few direct observations with large uncertainties. This proposed study, using in situ samplers and sensors, will allow an extensive microbial, gas and ion analytical program coupled with a network of physical and chemical sensor data to assess temporal conditions during winter months; to confirm fundamental processes and rates; to determine the interplay among microbial, geochemical and physical processes; and to develop a plan for a more inclusive study that takes advantage of low cost proxies for significant processes that best characterize temporal aspects of lake conditions. The project will enhance infrastructure for future research in the Arctic through the development of novel in situ sampling. The project will support several undergraduate and graduate students, providing valuable lab-based experience for students from non-research-intensive institutions. The investigators also will conduct two informal outreach activities to communicate the importance of Arctic climate change to primary school students while also teaching them about design and engineering. They also intend to work closely with Aurora College and Aurora Research Institute based in Inuvik, Canada, to engage First Nations youth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas.  It is found in many natural aquatic environments, including lakes and wetlands, and is produced by microbes under anoxic (no oxygen) conditions.  Arctic lakes have been shown to store and release a significant amount of methane.  However, the timing of this release is not well constrained.  The purpose of this study was to continuously collect water from the bottom of lakes of the Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada, in order to assess the dynamics of methane cycling over a full annual cycle, when the lakes freeze over in winter, thaw in spring, and are open water lakes in summer.  We worked closely with collaborators from Natural Resources Canada and Simon Fraser University (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), who have been working in these sites for several decades.  Because of the remote location of the lakes, we deployed autonomous sampling and sensor systems that remained on the lake bottom for a year?s time.  The novelty of the sampling systems is that they continuously collect fluids over the full deployment period which is ideal in remote sites.  Study lake sites included lakes overlying permafrost in the mid- and outer Mackenzie River delta, as well as lakes in a tundra setting on North Richards Island, Northwest Territories, Canada.  Access to these sites required helicopter and boat support.  Samples recovered from the lakes were measured back at our home institutions for microbial, gas, and ion chemistry.  The samplers resulted in measuring a methane concentration on integrated water samples every 10 to 14 days. The experimental concept had been proven previously in deep-sea settings, and the goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of the continuous sampling approach for frozen Arctic settings. After three successful field programs covering two full years (2015-2017), we found that when the lakes iced over, dissolved oxygen levels in the bottom waters decreased to near zero levels and then methane concentrations increased.  When the ice cover melted in the spring, the methane concentrations decreased.  Using stable carbon isotopes, we also found that the methane was formed by microbes in most lakes, but a few lakes emitted deep-sourced thermogenic methane.  This project successfully showed that the continuous sampler systems used are ideal for Arctic lake settings and can provide an unprecedented level of understanding of methane dynamics in this very remote setting. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura L Lapham"
