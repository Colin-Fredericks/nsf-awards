This is one of the flagship conferences in the Software Engineering field for researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, etc. Funding for student travel has significant broader impacts because of the opportunity it gives the students to become part of the research community, discuss their research with others, listen to and meet with leaders in the field, and so on. This conference is international and takes place in China, which provides an international dimension, because students will have experiences relevant to becoming part of a global workforce.",
