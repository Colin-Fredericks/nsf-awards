 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationwide, middle-school youth from underrepresented communities have few opportunities to engage in authentic STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) investigations that build on the students' intrinsic interests in space science and robotics to increase their interests in both ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and STEM careers. ITEAMS II is a collaborative project of science educators and researchers at the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. It is a nationwide online learning community of grades 5-8 students, educators, and parents and caregivers. The project goal is to transfer the intrinsic and active learning of students in space science and robotics into increased interest in ICT or STEM careers. ITEAMS II features research-quality, remotely-controlled, online telescopes (http://mo-www.harvard.edu/Micro-Observatory/ ) accessible from school, home, or any location with internet connection, plus complementary curricula. ITEAMS II will use a wide range of cyber-learning tools to provide ongoing professional development to the educators who are central to the online learning community. At least 80 educators and upwards of 120 students will be involved over the course of the three-year project.\r\n\r\nStudents access the robotic telescopes to acquire solar system or deep space images, and use project software to process the images. Then as part of an online learning community the students will engage in events and contests, and complete and share capstone projects. Educators will participate in online synchronous and asynchronous professional development and take on leadership roles in the learning community. Upwards of 150 parents will be involved each year, collaborating with their children in activities from using the telescopes to shared learning in community events.",

The features of this cyber-learning environment include customized access to robotic telescopes, support for authentic engagement with scientific analysis tools and practices, opportunities to pursue activities and investigations of personal interest, and both live and asynchronous interaction with project staff, scientists, and other YouthAstroNet community members. These features were iteratively designed to incorporate evidence-based strategies that support youth agency and the development of relevant skills and knowledge, with the aim of promoting science affinity, STEM career interest, computer affinity, and science identity, especially among youth from groups underrepresented in STEM.<br />A professional development model for educators was also created as a part of the project. A series of learning experiences for educators was designed based on the literature for adult learning, and the research on supporting educators in successfully adopting educational innovations. The YouthAstroNet educator learning experience included an initial 2 to 3-week self-paced online workshop that included 3 live webinars, and that first engaged educators as learners exploring the universe with the telescopes and image analysis tools, and exploring a few of the hands-on activities of the YouthAstroNet curricula. This initial workshop ended with a capstone in which educators produced a wiki, posting images and outlines to document their ideas for implementation with youth participants. Additional elements of educator PD support includes tools and quick-start guides for classroom implementation, and ongoing support that includes live teleconferencing office-hours and asynchronous discussion forums with project educators and scientists, along with periodic webinar opportunities to learn from other YouthAstroNet practitioners.<br />The ITEAMS II Harvard University research team conducted a rigorous study including student-level and instructor-level analyses of YouthAstroNet program factors that are associated with positive outcomes in participant knowledge, skills, and attitudes, using a dataset that included student and teacher pre- and post-survey data combined with the embedded weblog files of participation in the YouthAstroNet online learning community.<br />The project is having an impact in several areas of STEM education practice, theory, and research. First, the YouthAstroNet Program itself -- and its inclusive online learning community of youth, educators, STEM professionals and project staff from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian -- are now freely available to classroom and out-of-school educators nationwide that wish to engage their youth audiences in exploring the universe for themselves using engaging activities and authentic tools and techniques of professional astronomers. Educators may visit&nbsp;microobservatory.org&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;YouthAstroNet Portal&nbsp;to sign up.<br />Secondly, the project has provided a model for how to scale up and spread innovative technology experiences, such as those developed under NSF's ITEST program, via an online learning hub and professional development model that puts into practice the Concerns-Based Adoption Model for supporting educators over time in building their knowledge and skills to adopt and adapt educational innovations.<br />Thirdly, the project's research findings can inform practitioners, researchers, and policy makers regarding strategies and program factors that are effective in engaging educators and youth in innovative technology experiences, and those that are effective in promoting gains in knowledge and skills, and in STEM and computer affinity, science identity, and STEM career interest. Our findings show that these gains are enhanced by learning environments that provide: i) learner ownership of their data (images) and questions; ii) authentic (i.e. real-world as opposed to hypothetical) engagement with tools, data, and people; iii) accessible data analysis tools that help learners analyze and display their data to pursue personal interests; and iv) ample opportunities to make connections between the learning environment and the real world.<br />Finally, the project's research study has developed reliable and valid measures of science affinity, science identity, computer affinity, and STEM career interest that can be shared with other researchers.<br />Interested readers can find more information about the project through these two STEM For All videos:<br />https://stemforall2017.videohall.com/presentations/971<br />https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/presentations/1407</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/18/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sadler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433431/1433431_10333716_1576692991941_t5scope--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433431/1433431_10333716_1576692991941_t5scope--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MicroObservatory Robotic Telescope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433431/1433431_10333716_1576692991941_t5scope--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MicroObservatory Robotic Telescope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of 5 automated telescopes that YouthAstroNet participants access online to request images of their choosing.
