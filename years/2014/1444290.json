 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leading researchers in the field of Neuroethology from around the world meet at the International Congress of Neuroethology to share their research findings and forge research collaborations that are critical in moving the discipline forward. Research in neuroethology is at the cutting edge of neuroscience and behavioral research with basic biological and health related implications. For U.S. researchers to remain current, it is essential that they exchange ideas directly with their international colleagues. The Congress will emphasis comparative evolutionary approaches which meets the biodiversity initiatives of NSF as well as fostering development of scientists that may be involved in the Brain Initiative. The exchange of information among scientists during oral and poster presentations is of great value, but equally important are the personal exchanges and resulting collaborations established in the hallways between sessions and during the numerous topic-based workshops and symposia scheduled throughout the congress. \r\n\r\nFunds provided by NSF will help support the attendance of future leaders of in neuroethology and behavioral neuroscience. Specifically, recipients will be at an early stage in their careers (e.g., graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and beginning investigators) and will be from U.S. institutions. The selection committee will also strive to support individuals from groups that are historically underrepresented. Assistance of such scientists will help forge new, international collaborations, thereby creating long-term benefits for all involved.",
