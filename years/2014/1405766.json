 "awd_abstract_narration": "An emerging technology in the field of biomanufacturing is the use of disposable or single-use bioreactors. Because these systems offer several advantages over traditional manufacturing platforms, there is an industry trend toward adopting this technology. The industry migration to this new technology is causing a training gap to form within the existing workforce and within biotechnology training curricula. \r\n\r\nSolano Community College  is creating curricular materials to address the single-use, disposable bioreactor gap in the national biotechnology curricula and expanding the biotechnology program at the college to incorporate this technology. The project is also developing short courses for students and incumbent workers and workshops for faculty. The project includes three components: curriculum development, implementation and evaluation, and dissemination. The expected outcomes for this project include: 1) an overall design of educational units that can be inserted into courses that utilize single-use cell culture technology; 2) detailed content, learning objectives, teaching materials and instruction activities for the new units; 3) implementation of the curriculum at the college and other institutions; 4) workshops to disseminate the curriculum; 5) development of a web site hosting the model curriculum and other information generated from this project; and 6) courseware containing the course materials for distribution.\r\n\r\nSince this project is developing curricular materials that address an identified industry need that have not been included in two-year biotechnology programs, it has the potential to impact many two-year biotechnology programs across the country as the project creates exemplary materials that can be used by other programs to teach single-use bioreactor technology in order to meet industrial demand. The impact is being magnified through the dissemination by BioLink, a national biotechnology consortium that has created a community of scholars that encourages collaboration, cooperation, and communication in biotechnology. To facilitate information dissemination, workshops are being organized to train faculty who want to adopt this curriculum. The project will also contribute to the national effort to develop a technically skilled workforce for the national bio-economy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSingle Use Bioreactor Systems Education and Training (SUBSET) for Community College Faculty\n\nThe original application identified the use of single-use (disposable) bioreactors as an emerging technology and proposed a two-year strategy to teach community college faculty about this important new approach in biomanufacturing.  In the interim this technology proved to be even more important than originally projected and has become the dominant approach to the manufacture of biologics.  No new facility is being designed without a major part of its production strategy using a single use.  All new manufacturing plants that are being built will now contain a major single use approach to grow product-producing cells.    \n\nIn traditional biomanufacturing approaches companies grow genetically engineered cells in stainless steel, permanently-plumbed bioreactors that require an extensive Clean-In-Place system to prevent cross contamination of products and a Steam-In-Place system for sterilization.   Most new facilities now use single-use (disposable) technology for at least part of their process. A single-use bioreactor system grows cells within a plastic container or plastic-lined environment.  This innovation removes the need for cleaning (saving both the time, expense, and validation requirement of the cleaning process) and moves the burden of sterilization (and of sterilization validation) onto the vendor. \n\nBefore this grant few faculty running community and technical college biotechnology programs had knowledge of this important emerging technology.  The SUBSET grant funded an effort to increase awareness of this technology and to introduce it into the curriculum of every community college biotechnology program.\n\nFunded by a National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education grant, this effort:\n\nTrained key faculty and equipped them to train-the-trainer\nGave talks at conferences where community college biotechnology faculty gathered\nPublished an article in the Bio-Link (the NSF funded national consortium of community college biotechnology faculty) newsletter on single-use systems and distributed this publication widely\nAcquired the appropriate equipment to run training sessions\nDesigned and published the appropriate curriculum (background information, lectures, Standard Operating Procedures, etc.)\nUtilized these materials to run a successful training session for community college biotechnology faculty (Summer 2018) &ndash; this training enabled the faculty participants to take this technology back to their home institutions \nCreated an infrastructure to repeat this training\nImplemented a new curriculum at Solano College that allows students to earn a Certificate of Achievement in cell-based, stem cell, and gene therapies.  \n\n\n \n\nIn addition, during this time, the Solano College team also: \n\nBuilt and equipped a $ 34.5 million biotechnology training facility on the Solano College Vacaville campus\nDeveloped, designed, and implemented a Bachelors of Science in Biomanufacturing degree\nTeam member Dr. Ed Re was chosen by the Solano College Academic Senate to be Solano College?s faculty of the year, earning the 2018 Distinguished Faculty award. \n\n\nThe single-use bioreactor training funded by this grant was held in Solano College?s new biomanufacturing training facility in May 2018.  This training utilized the single use equipment funded by the grant for the sessions. The time period had been chosen to precede the week-long Bio-Link Summer Fellows conference where hundreds of community and technical college biotechnology faculty gathered.\n\nDuring the one-week model training session, participants utilized the written materials to become familiar with the operation of a single-use bioreactor.  Participants set up, inoculated, operated, and monitored the growth of mammalian cells using new software provided by the vendor.  Participants also heard talks by representatives from local biotech companies that have invested heavily in single use systems and from vendors who sell the equipment.  After the training session, participants were provided with a flash drive that contained all lectures, SOPs, and pertinent technical information on the equipment. \n\nAfter the session, an outside evaluation firm, Innovative Education Consultants LLC, polled the participants and provided an independent analysis of the success of the training session.  The feedback by the participants was almost universally positive.    \n\nSolano College continues to be a leader in the dissemination knowledge of this new technology.  The college will continue to offer workshops on this technology to faculty and to students through interactions with NIIMBL, the National Institute for Innovation in the Manufacture of Biologics and through another National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education grant called \"Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing of Cell and issue-Based Products (CAMCMP)\" led by Madison Community College.\n\nSingle use bioprocessing equipment will continue to increase in importance in the future. This project filled a gap in knowledge contained by many faculty.  Therefore, hundreds of students will be exposed to the knowledge of these technologies that would not have been exposed without the project.  And the continuation of the project will expose even more faculty\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James D Dekloe"
