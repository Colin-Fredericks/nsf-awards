 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human brain undergoes rapid and profound changes during the first 3 years of life, which accompany the emergence of new cognitive skills, including remembering and recognizing faces and objects, acquiring vocabularies, and focusing attention on the task at hand, among others.  While such a rich repertoire of functions requires the coordination of multiple brain regions, little is known about how changes in the brain's electrical activity across different brain regions correlate with changes in behavior. This knowledge gap is in part due to methodological limitations imposed by the predominant brain imaging method, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI not only requires infants or toddlers to remain still or asleep during the observation, but also cannot directly measure rapid changes in neuronal activity at a high temporal resolutions (millisecond).  With recent technological and computational advances, it has  become possible to overcome these technical barriers and obtain direct measurements of brain electrical activity in behaving infants. With the support of the National Science foundation, Dr Stamoulis and colleagues at the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, will have the rare opportunity to systematically characterize development-related changes in neural signals derived from longitudinal hdEEG data acquired in infants and toddlers repeatedly across 3 to 36 months of age using a number of advanced computational approaches. This study will provide fundamental information regarding how the brain changes across early development. Findings from this project are also expected to help educate families on how early experiences shape the brain and facilitate cognitive functions, and will inspire the development of new courses and instructional materials to educate students, researchers and clinicians on the relationships between behavioral and neural mechanisms of cognitive development.\r\n\r\nThe project is an ambitious attempt at characterizing changes in the developing human brain by analysing high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG)  data collected from the same infants across the first three years of life using source localization and frequency analysis of neural oscillations within and between different functional brain regions.  The investigation will focus on characterizing oscillatory waveforms of brain electrical signals originating from different spatial locations  across multiple  time points during early development.  The power of these waveforms in different frequency bands, e.g. theta,  alpha, beta, and gamma power, are known to emerge at different time points during early development and to be associated with variations in external stimuli, information processing demands, and behaviors.  However, age-related changes in the dominant oscillation frequency, power and spatial distribution among brain regions have not been systematically characterized during this age range.  Longitudinal  high-density EEG data  from about  200 typically developing infants at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age will be analyzed under  the same type of tasks and no-task conditions.  Novel source analysis methods will be applied to hdEEGs, to extract and localize dominant sources and to decompose source signals into individual oscillation components and compare them across ages. Resting and functional networks and directional connectivities between identified sources will also be systematically quantified and compared across ages. This project is expected to provide a new source-based language for investigating human brain development using EEG and to reveal how neural signals change in time, frequency and brain spaces to enable infants to communicate with the world and to acquire new skills.",
