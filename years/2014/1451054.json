 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) will organize a full-day workshop that explores the Japanese research efforts towards next-generation extreme computing at the SC14 international conference to be held in November 2014 in New Orleans. The workshop has been accepted and is a part of the SC14 workshop series. A full copy of the workshop proceedings will be available through the ATIP website at and/or the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) Digital Library.  ATIP's workshop  contributes to improving a general understanding of Japanese research approaches towards high performance computing (HPC) at scale.  The workshop also facilitates  discussion between government agencies and HPC scientists and vendors at an international level, which could stimulate new directions of research and practical use.\r\n\r\nThis workshop brings together top scientists and graduate students from both the US and Japan (supported by Japanese government) to form connections that may lead to future research collaborations or cooperative commercialization efforts for practical HPC applications.",
