 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most currently employed convective-scale data assimilation (DA) schemes were developed primarily for application to larger-scale atmospheric flows and weather phenomena, in which sharply contrasting balances and constraints are relevant.  Moreover, at convective scales Doppler radar is the only widely available means of providing extensive observations of sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution needed to facilitate dynamic prediction of high-impact weather phenomena such as severe thunderstorms.  As such, the effective assimilation of Doppler radar data into convection-resolving models is of increasing importance, yet underutilized.  Building upon their previous work on convective-scale DA, these researchers will explore new approaches to optimally assimilate operationally-collected WSR-88D Doppler radar data available from a newly-upgraded national network employing dual-polarization technology, and in particular will: (i) Determine how to best use reflectivity observations in addition to radial velocity data; (ii) examine the usefulness of the background tendency information in a storm-scale DA system; and (iii) implement an efficient ensemble-based hybrid three-dimensional variational/Ensemble Kalman Filter (3DVAR/EnKF) framework that incorporates existing mesoscale ensemble forecast information into a storm-scale three-dimensional variational DA system.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this effort centers upon developing a novel DA strategy that makes optimal use of both radar reflectivity and radial velocity fields, which are uniquely suitable for specifying rapidly evolving convective-scale flows, in order to provide initial conditions for high-resolution storm-scale NWP models such as the NSF/NCAR Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model--a system that enjoys use in both research and operational settings.  This approach seeks to improve our physical understanding of convective storm-scale dynamics and is further aimed toward improved detection and anticipation of thunderstorm-related hazards as well as more accurate quantitative precipitation forecasts needed for hydrological applications.  This work may also help to solve the initial \"balance problem\" that is inherent in convective numerical weather prediction (NWP), but has heretofore been largely overlooked by the research community.  Broader Impacts of this work include deriving maximum benefit from the considerable U.S. investment in the nationwide WSR-88D radar network by accelerating the use of these data in both operational and research-based NWP.  This project will embody educational benefits through mentoring of graduate students and a postdoctoral research associate, and emerging results will be integrated into teaching materials and publications reaching broad audiences.",

Very good progress has been made in terms of code development, publications and synergistic research efforts with other related projects, such as NOAA?s Warn-on-Forecast project which aims at increasing the lead time and accuracy for convective-scale hazardous weather warnings and forecasts. Twelve journal papers and one book chapter (all acknowledged this grant) have been published, accepted, or submitted for publication. We also have presented our research results at various workshops and conferences. Code developed has been used for realtime experiments in NOAA?s Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT). The major accomplishments including education and training are summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major thrust of this project is to develop a hybrid ensemble-based variational data assimilation (DA) system suitable for convective scale NWP. The system has been developed since the beginning of the project (Gao et al. 2014; 2016; 2017). It was further tested using an idealized supercell storm simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model as a first step. Synthetic radar radial velocity, reflectivity, satellite derived cloud water path and total precipitable water data are produced from the simulated supercell storm and then these data are assimilated into another WRF model run that starts with no convection. It is found that the combination of radar data and satellite data within the DA system results in better analyses and forecasts than when only radar data are used. We also found that the accuracy of the storm environment is critical to the accuracy of the convective scale predictions (Pan et al. 2018).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of 2013, the US radar network was upgraded by including dual polarimetric capability. Polarimetric radar data have the ability to provide enhanced insight into the microphysical and dynamic structure of convection. However, relatively little has been done to leverage these data for NWP thus far. Supported by this grant, one study demonstrated how to improve convective scale NWP through the assimilation of differential reflectivity column; this study was conducted by a graduate student. The analyses and forecasts of convection qualitatively and quantitatively improve in two real data cases, including more coherent analyzed updrafts, more realistic forecast reflectivity structures, and improved evaluation scores (Carlin et al. 2017). Also a new dual-polarimetric radar forward operator which is needed to establish the relation between model physics parameters and polarimetric radar variables was developed recently (Gao and Zhang 2018).</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>The program developed through the support of this grant has been also used in synergy with other related projects. A real-time hybrid analysis and forecast system with the WRF model has been tested informally within NOAA/HWT in May 2017 and 2018. The goal is to provide physically-consistent gridded analysis and forecast products to forecasters in order to make warning decisions in a timely manner. The system incorporate available radar data, satellite retrieved cloud water path, and traditional observations to perform 15-minute data assimilation cycles. Our experiments showed the hybrid DA system has potential to improve short-term 3-hour forecasts with reasonable accuracy (Lai et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019). As an example, Figure 1 shows two 3-hour deterministic member forecast examples that were launched from the hybrid DA analysis at 2300 UTC 09 May 2017 and 2100 UTC 16 May 2017, respectively. The forecast captures multiple storm structures which match well with the NOAA/Storm Prediction Center?s reports for tornadoes, hail and damaging winds. Especially for forecast valid at 0000 UTC 17 May 2017, the storms produced several tornadoes near the boundary of Oklahoma and Texas, including the storm that later developed into an EF-3 tornado that hit Elk City, OK at 0035 UTC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project supported three graduate students. One student published one paper on hybrid DA system development with radar and satellite data and he obtained his master degree in August 2017 and then entered School of Meteorology?s PhD program. Another student?s research focused on hydrometer-related dual-polarimetric DA. He published one paper on hydrometeor retrievals for radar dual-polarimetric data and a second paper on differential reflectivity data assimilation. He obtained his PhD in May 2018. The grant has also provided partial support for another MS student who has not finished his study yet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the results of this research may help draw maximum benefit from the Nation?s critical investment in the dual-polarization WSR-88D radar network. It may accelerate the use of the WSR-88D radar data in operational and research NWP. The DA system developed may benefit convective scale NWP and potentially improve high impact weather forecasts to the public.
