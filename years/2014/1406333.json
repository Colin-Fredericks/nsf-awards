 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract\r\n\r\nWithin the past two years, a new strategy has been discovered for manipulating magnetic devices (such as magnetic random access memories) that is at least a factor of 10 more efficient than any previously known technique.  This approach relies on taking advantage of \"spin-orbit coupling\" -- a strong interaction between the intrinsic spin of an electron and its direction of motion in certain materials.  However, the exact mechanism has not yet been resolved.  This project seeks to determine the microscopic mechanism behind this new effect, to investigate how best to optimize materials and devices to enable applications, and to explore the scientific opportunities that can be enabled by using this new strategy to manipulate classes of magnetic materials that have not been investigated previously.  This research is directly applicable to improving technologies for magnetic memory and logic, and the project will also yield additional broad impacts by providing research education to graduate students and undergraduates that helps teach them to be outstanding independent scientists.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nThis project builds upon demonstrations by the principal investigator and collaborators that an in-plane current in a heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayer can provide a very strong torque to the magnetic moment of the ferromagnet on account of the spin Hall effect within the heavy metal. Other research groups have also provided evidence of current-induced torques associated with a different physical mechanism, the Rashba effect, in similar samples. The project will seek to answer unresolved questions about the microscopic mechanisms, symmetries, and strengths of current-induced torques in these heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayers, and how best to optimize materials and devices to enable applications of these torques. The methods employed include techniques to measure current-induced reorientations of magnetic moments in nanofabricated devices and related spin-pumping experiments in which a precessing magnet injects a spin current into the heavy metal.  The research involves investigating a wide variety of different materials and multilayer geometries, and also the exploration of new scientific opportunities that can be enabled by using the new current-induced torques to manipulate spins within insulating ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets, two classes of materials in which spin manipulation could not be implemented efficiently using previously-known mechanisms.  The overall project objectives include both new fundamental understanding about the interactions between electrical currents and magnets and also practical magnetic memory and logic devices that can operate using much lower power or at much higher frequencies than has been possible previously.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMagnetic memory devices that store information based on the orientation of the north and south magnetic poles of a tiny magnetic layer are an attractive alternative for replacing silicon-based random access memories for many applications.  Magnetic memories have the advantages that they are naturally nonvolatile (meaning that they retain information even with the electrical power turned off) and they never wear out.  This is a combination that no silicon-based memory can achieve.  At the same time magnetic memory devices can be made very dense, fast, and inexpensive.  The remaining challenge standing in the way of widespread application of magnetic memories is to reduce the electrical energy required to write their information &ndash; that is, to controllably switch their magnetic orientation using less electrical current and power.  The research performed under this grant has investigated fundamental physics questions related to meeting this challenge.\n\nOne might imagine that small magnetic memory devices could be controlled effectively by just applying a magnetic field.  But it turns out that this doesn?t work well, at all &ndash; to create enough magnetic field to switch a memory device by passing electrical current through a wire near the device requires a great deal of energy.  It is possible to do much better by taking advantage of the fact that all electrons carry an intrinsic spin as well as a charge.  A flow of aligned spins within a metal can very efficiently apply a torque to the magnetization of a magnetic device, thereby switching its orientation and storing a bit of information.  The most efficient strategy known for generating a spin current to apply this sort of \"spin-transfer\" has been discovered very recently.  One can use a property known as \"strong spin-orbit interactions\" which are present in certain materials containing elements with large atomic weights.  This allows an applied electrical current to generate a very strong \"spin-orbit torque\" acting on a nearby magnetic device.\n\nThis grant has funded research to better understand the mechanisms by which spin-orbit torques are generated and to improve several aspects of their performance.  The funded researchers have developed two new strategies to control the direction of the spins in the spin current generated by spin-orbit interactions, which provides greatly-needed flexibility in how they can be used.  The researchers have also shown that the strength of spin-orbit torques can be improved by the use of previously-unexamined family of materials &ndash; the f-electron \"rare earth\" elements.  Finally, the researchers have made progress in developing ways to grow very thin high-quality films of insulating magnetic materials, which may provide a new route toward more efficient devices than the magnetic metals used up to now.  These advances have resulted in 13 published papers in leading journals, with 3 of these papers ranked in the top 1% of most-cited recent physics papers.  \n\nThe grant provided the primary support for 2 graduate students and one undergraduate, with some additional funding for supplies for graduate students with external funding.  Three graduate students completed their Ph.D. degrees.  One has been hired to do industrial research, a second to a US government national lab, and the third to an academic postdoctoral position.  The professor leading the research and the students have also all been active in additional education and outreach activities for K-12 students, working with 4-H.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel C Ralph"
