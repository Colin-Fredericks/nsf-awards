These vulnerabilities are not amenable to the simple technological solutions attempted in the past because they are caused by a very wide range of causes from theoretical to technological to economic to psychological. We are exploring new and novel approaches to mitigating these vulnerabilities so that our society and economy can remain secure and prosperous. We anticipate researchers will proceed to develop solutions for use across the entire range of our national infrastructure.",
