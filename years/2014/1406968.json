 "awd_abstract_narration": "Delivering high-speed, pervasive wireless services to trillions of mobile devices requires a significant transformation to today's wireless cellular networks. Hyper-dense heterogeneous networks (HDHNs), enabled via a viral and large-scale deployment of small cell base stations and mobile devices, are seen as one of the cornerstones of this transformation. However, most existing network design and optimization techniques fall short in handling the scale, density, sustainability, and dynamics of such HDHNs.\r\n\r\nThis project contributes to the foundations of HDHNs via innovations that include novel mobility state estimation techniques,  optimized cell selection and handover methods, and a new game-theoretic framework for self-organizing resource management in energy-efficient HDHNs. The proposed approaches will be evaluated and enhanced via implementation on an experimental testbed using software radio and open source platforms.   \r\n\r\nBoosting the performance of wireless systems will have societal impacts via enablement of novel mobile services requiring high-performance network connectivity. The project results will also support the analysis of dense networks and the development of future wireless standards and products. As a new Japan-US collaboration the project will build long-term relationships between US and Japanese researchers designing sustainable, energy-efficient and dense wireless systems. The project will create new educational and outreach activities to attract under-represented minorities to the field of sustainable HDHNs.",

The intellectual merits addressed five major goals: 1) Development of mobility state estimation approaches with provable accuracy using stochastic geometry techniques; 2) Development of energy-efficient handover and cell selection mechanisms in HDHNs that optimize the tradeoff between the quality-of-service and the energy efficiency; 3) Development of a self-organizing optimization framework that exploits game-theoretic mechanisms for deploying energy-efficient resource management mechanisms in HDHNs; 4) Introduction of physical layer enhancements for HDHNs using cross-layer optimization of upper-layer algorithms via physical layer techniques such as innovative transceiver structures, multiuser scheduling and resource allocation algorithms; and 5) Experimentation over a hardware/software testbed based on various software radio technologies for validation. In this context we have developed effective techniques for estimating a mobile&rsquo;s velocity from the number of handover and sojourn time observations in HDHNs; for configuring the 3GPP LTE-Advanced interference coordination parameters for energy-efficient and spectrally-efficient HDHNs; and for configuring mobility management parameters to minimize handover failures while also maintaining the energy/spectral efficiency. A wide range of related experiments have also been carried out using software defined radio platforms and Android apps. The developed technologies can be deployed in the context of emerging 5G cellular networks and beyond, in order to improve their carbon footprint and energy efficiency, while sustaining high-speed wireless communication links. The broader impacts of this project include: 1) facilitating a close US-Japan research collaboration on HDHNs and 5G wireless technologies; 2) Training of graduate and undergraduate students on wireless communications research and experimentation; 3) Outreach activities to under-represented student populations in Miami metropolitan area; and 4) Dissemination of project outcomes through workshops, tutorials, journal special issues, and conference/journal publications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
