 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps Site, at the University of Chicago's Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, involves five campus-wide programs: the New Venture Challenge, College New Venture Challenge, Global New Venture Challenge, Social New Venture Challenge, and a Mobile App Challenge (offered in partnership with UChicagoTech and Information Technology Services). And, as part of a campus-wide innovation initiative, the Center will be working closely with Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Chicago Computation Institute, Medical Center, and Institute for Molecular Engineering to ideate and start companies based on novel technologies and use-based innovation. \r\n\r\nFunding from this I-Corps Site will support prototyping or proof-of-concept at an early, critical stage of company development, providing funding in line with Polsky's lean start-up methodology that stresses innovative thinking, rapid iteration, market-testing, and flexibility in redesign or repositioning. In particular, the Sites grant enables teaching and employing of this methodology with faculty and students in the Computation Institute and Molecular Engineering, in the Medical Center, and throughout the Physical Sciences. With a growing roster of companies being launched out of Argonne, the Computation Institute, the Medical Center, and Molecular Engineering, the Center's entrepreneurial culture will be made more visible and accessible, and instill an entrepreneurial mindset among faculty and students.\r\n\r\nThe Polsky Center has a strong track record of transitioning technology into the marketplace leading to the creation of multiple companies. The Site award will expand the number of ideas that can be tested quickly and inexpensively (in dollars and opportunity cost) for those that show the greatest promise. \r\n\r\nThis Site will contribute to the growth of the Chicago innovation network where academia, corporations, government, the investor and the philanthropic communities collaborate to contribute to economies based on networks and network effects.  The Chicago Site will be a critical component of working with the city to address the urban challenges of education, healthcare, and opportunity. \r\n\r\nThe University of Chicago is the largest employer on Chicago's South Side. Through their entrepreneurial activities, the institution seeks to change the economic potential for residents on Chicago's South Side and to create new industry and wealth for this underserved part of the city.",

The Polsky Center drives venture creation and technology commercialization within the University of Chicago and the surrounding community. Through education, partnerships, and new venture support, the Polsky Center advances the knowledge and practice of entrepreneurship and accelerates the commercialization of research. The Polsky Center helps students, faculty, staff, alumni, researchers and local entrepreneurs navigate the complex process of creating and growing a startup.</p>\n<p>During the course of its I-Corps Site Grant, the Polsky Center I-Corps Program served 87 entrepreneurial teams. The Polsky Center ran three 7-week-long program cohorts each academic year and served faculty, researchers, and students in the STEM fields.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit for the project included the development of a curriculum to teach STEM innovators early-stage entrepreneurship skills, including customer discovery and interview techniques. Participants practiced these skills by conducting a minimum of 30 customer discovery interviews while participating in the program. Participants learned how to derive insight using entrepreneurial frameworks such as the Business Model Canvas and the Value Proposition Canvas. Additionally, participants learned how to communicate scientific topics to non-scientific audiences and practiced presentation skills in front of instructors, coaches, and entrepreneurs and investors from the Polsky Center community.</p>\n<p>The project had broad impact on the University of Chicago campus. It supported the development of a culture of innovation by engaging faculty, researchers, and students from across campus and providing a resource through which they could test their ideas. The Polsky Center I-Corps Program became an entry-point for these constituents to the University of Chicago&rsquo;s and the NSF&rsquo;s entrepreneurial ecosystems, including: networks of support, additional entrepreneurial programs, and follow-on funding opportunities. As a result, graduates of the Polsky Center I-Corps Program have gone on to raise additional grant and venture funding in excess of $27 million as of summer 2018.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the project had broad impact in the Chicagoland region. As a part of the project, the Polsky Center hosted an entrepreneurial leadership conference for Women in STEM using an Inclusive Entrepreneurship Supplement grant from the NSF. More than fifty women from eighteen regional institutions attended the October 2017 event, gaining access to entrepreneurial training and future NSF support.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the project spurred the creation of a critical entrepreneurial resource on the University of Chicago campus. In 2017, the Polsky Center received continued funding for its I-Corps Site program. As such, the Polsky Center I-Corps Program continues to support a culture of innovation at the University of Chicago. It encourages STEM innovators to explore the potential of their ideas and connects them to a network of resources to help turn those ideas into ventures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Steven&nbsp;N&nbsp;Kaplan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532619968820_20150518_I-Corps_7911--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532619968820_20150518_I-Corps_7911--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Polsky I-Corps Classroom Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532619968820_20150518_I-Corps_7911--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Polsky I-Corps Classroom Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Polsky Center I-Corps Program participant discusses an entrepreneurial concept in class.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Steven&nbsp;N&nbsp;Kaplan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Polsky I-Corps Classroom Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532620032751_20150518_I-Corps_7988CROP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532620032751_20150518_I-Corps_7988CROP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Polsky I-Corps Classroom Photo 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532620032751_20150518_I-Corps_7988CROP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Polsky I-Corps Classroom Photo 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two Polsky Center I-Corps Program participants discuss their ventures during an in-class activity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Steven&nbsp;N&nbsp;Kaplan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Polsky I-Corps Classroom Photo 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532620135008_20171027_WomenStem_0182--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532620135008_20171027_WomenStem_0182--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"From Insight to Innovation: Women in STEM Leadership Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1347383/1347383_10300847_1532620135008_20171027_WomenStem_0182--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"From Insight to Innovation: Women in STEM Leadership Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants from the \"From Insight to Innovation: Women in STEM Leadership Conference\" pose for a photo.
