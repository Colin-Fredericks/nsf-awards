 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationwide, middle-school youth from underrepresented communities have few opportunities to engage in authentic STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) investigations that build on the students' intrinsic interests in space science and robotics to increase their interests in both ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and STEM careers. ITEAMS II is a collaborative project of science educators and researchers at the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. It is a nationwide online learning community of grades 5-8 students, educators, and parents and caregivers. The project goal is to transfer the intrinsic and active learning of students in space science and robotics into increased interest in ICT or STEM careers. ITEAMS II features research-quality, remotely-controlled, online telescopes (http://mo-www.harvard.edu/Micro-Observatory/ ) accessible from school, home, or any location with internet connection, plus complementary curricula. ITEAMS II will use a wide range of cyber-learning tools to provide ongoing professional development to the educators who are central to the online learning community. At least 80 educators and upwards of 120 students will be involved over the course of the three-year project.\r\n\r\nStudents access the robotic telescopes to acquire solar system or deep space images, and use project software to process the images. Then as part of an online learning community the students will engage in events and contests, and complete and share capstone projects. Educators will participate in online synchronous and asynchronous professional development and take on leadership roles in the learning community. Upwards of 150 parents will be involved each year, collaborating with their children in activities from using the telescopes to shared learning in community events.",

The features of this cyber-learning environment include customized access to robotic telescopes, support for authentic engagement with scientific analysis tools and practices, opportunities to pursue activities and investigations of personal interest, and both live and asynchronous interaction with project staff, scientists, and other YouthAstroNet community members.

The YouthAstroNet educator learning experience included an initial 2 to 3-week self-paced online workshop that included 3 live webinars, and that first engaged educators as learners exploring the universe with the telescopes and image analysis tools, and exploring a few of the hands-on activities of the YouthAstroNet curricula. This initial workshop ended with a capstone in which educators produced a wiki, posting images and outlines to document their ideas for implementation with youth participants.

First, the YouthAstroNet Program itself -- and its inclusive online learning community of youth, educators, STEM professionals and project staff from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian -- are now freely available to classroom and out-of-school educators nationwide that wish to engage their youth audiences in exploring the universe for themselves using engaging activities and authentic tools and techniques of professional astronomers.
