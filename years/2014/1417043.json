 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chen\r\n1417043\r\n\r\nThis work will investigate a photovoltaic initiated and sustained electrochemical deposition process for fabricating hybrid metal/CNT nanowires.  It will also study the resultant potential electric conductivity of these metal/CNT nanowires. Nanowires with ultrahigh room temperature conductivities are important for advanced electronics as well as for energy efficient conductors, however pure materials such as metals are prone to electron scattering at the nanoscale. The objectives here will be to investigate and develop a viable fabrication process in photovoltaic assisted deposition of metals onto CNTs to obtain tight bonding and uniform hybrid metal/CNT nanowires. The photovoltaic phenomena of CNTs has been successfully used in solar energy harvesting. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe hybrid metal/CNT will ensure both a large free electron density (from the metal) &#8232;and a large mean free path (from the CNT) that will result in ultrahigh conductivity. Conventional fabrication methods, which rely on catalysts may not only introduce impurities &#8232;but also result in non-uniform wires and Shottky barriers are inevitably formed. The PI's fabrication method will result in a photovoltaic sustained electrochemical deposition where no direct electrical connection nor any catalysts are required, and a uniform but tightly bonded metal layer will&#8232; be produced. The experimental work will not only demonstrate the ultrahigh conductivity, but also a significantly reduced size effect in the nanometer range. The experimental work combined with quantum mechanical calculations will provide an understanding of the conduction mechanism of the hybrid metal/CNT nanowires.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nMaterials at the nanoscale with high conductivities are important for a broad range of applications. For example, interconnects in nanoelectronics requires low resistivity to increase the calculation speed, reduce the Joule heating and to increase reliability. Electrodes for biomolecular and biomedical studies need low resistivity for low or negligible effects due to the Joule heating.  Metals like copper and aluminum are common conductors for electricity but consume about $300B per year due to Joule heating. If successful, this &#8232;work will develop a new material fabrication process and novel hybrid nanowires with ultrahigh conductivity, that will be used as interconnects to reduce the RC delay, and as building blocks to make bulk conductive materials via powder metallurgy to replace copper as conductors in electric systems, including motors, generators, transformers, and electromagnets. This could significantly reduce the Joule heating and reduce the energy consumption and increase the wire?s reliability, &#8232;at the same time. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this integrated research and education program, and existing courses will be amended to include results from this project.",
