The representation theory of Lie algebras, quantum groups and related algebraic structures has become a comprehensive and mainstream research area in mathematics with numerous applications in mathematics and theoretical physics. In particular, representation theory of quantized Kac-Moody algebras and their categorical and geometric constructions have taken the lead not only within Lie theory but also in other areas of mathematics and physics such as combinatorics, group theory, number theory, integrable systems, partial differential equations, topology and conformal field theory. Recent developments in representation theory are strengthening these interactions further.\r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together international experts working on various aspects of representation theory who will report on the current research developments, outline the future directions and interact with other participants including junior researchers and graduate students.  The participating researchers from the US supported through this award will have an opportunity to exchange ideas with their international counterparts which may lead to future collaborations.  The graduate students from the US supported through this award will have a unique opportunity to interact with international experts in the field of representation theory.  The conference website is located at https://sites.google.com/site/icm2014satelliterepn/home.",
