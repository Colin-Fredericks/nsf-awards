 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at Rutgers University entitled, \"RET SITE: Research Experience for Teachers in Engineering (RU RET-E) for Green Energy and Technology\", under the direction of Dr. Kimberly Cook-Chennault. \r\n\r\nRU-RET-E is a critical link in Rutgers' educational pipeline in energy engineering education from K-12, to undergraduate and further to graduate education and STEM fields. It builds upon long-term collaborative relationships between the participating school districts and the Rutgers School of Engineering. Participation of these teachers will readily translate to the learning experience of their students and subsequently their academic achievement.\r\n\r\nThis proposed project will build and improve upon a previous successful NSF RET project (EEC-1009797).  It will expand and enhance the previous project as a comprehensive three-year program to host a total of 46 middle and high school teachers for six weeks during the summer. Participating teachers will be recruited from New Brunswick, Plainfield, and Scotch Plains-Fanwood which collectively are home to high populations of underrepresented minorities, economically challenged and special needs students. RU RET-E seeks to provide teaching professionals the opportunity to engage in science and engineering research, with intellectual foci centered around three research thrusts: nanotechnology and materials, renewable and sustainable fuels, and devices and energy management systems for energy generation, conversion, and storage. These are areas where Rutgers has a critical mass of faculty interest, existing academic and physical infrastructure, and funding. Each teacher pair will develop Student Growth Objectives (SGO) rubrics, to be strategically, linked to engineering units, which will be peer-reviewed over the summer. These units and SGOs will be used to assess student comprehension, critiquing proficiency and the ability to execute and construct lab reports, and aptitude for engineering problem solving.",

Mariel Kohler received the \"Northrop Grumman Award\" award for a lesson she created in the RU RET E program entitled, \"Nanotechnology in Action: Organic Electronics\".  Elizabeth Parker was awarded the \"Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science teaching\" based on the lesson that she created as part of our RU RET E Program. \n\n            In addition to providing professional development activities for in-service and pre-service teachers, the RU RET E program held several engineering education workshops for teachers who were unable to participate in the  RU RET-E summer program.  This program has facilitated meaningful partnerships between Rutgers and local schools; provided opportunities for teachers to work along with undergraduate and/or high school researchers in select laboratories; and opportunities for graduate students to hone their skills in mentoring teachers on cutting edge and novel technology, science and engineering. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly Cook-Chennault"
