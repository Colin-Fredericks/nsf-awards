 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports research and education designed to advance our understanding of materials containing mobile electrons that interact strongly with each other, giving rise to new states of matter with novel superconductive properties.  Superconductivity is a quantum state of many electrons in a metal that is characterized by the loss of electrical resistance and consequently of all dissipation of energy. The materials to be investigated include cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, as well as iridate systems.  The PI's group will use model calculations for electrons to study several problems directed towards a broader understanding of how these materials work.   In particular the fundamental physics of defects and impurities that can destroy or nucleate superconducting states under different circumstances will be studied. These investigations will result in a deeper understanding of the nature of high temperature superconductivity. \r\nUnderstanding properties of correlated electron systems and the influence of disorder may lead to novel materials properties that could be utilized in new devices and technologies, obtaining unusual sensitivity operating near transitions between competing phases that occur in highly correlated electron systems. This could have enormous technological implications. The award will support training of graduate students. The PI's group will engage in outreach activities to educate schoolchildren in the Gainesville area about physics, hold public and colloquium talks on superconductivity, and offer information on research activities at a public level through the extensive website.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education to address long-standing fundamental problems of quenched disorder and various types of competing emergent order in correlated electron systems. The materials to be investigated include cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, as well as iridate systems.  The Fe-based superconductors exhibit a wide variety of behavior suggesting that the electronic responses to external perturbations that break xy symmetry are extremely strong, and may be important for superconductivity.   Both electron-doped cuprate superconductors and Fe-based superconductors exhibit phases where itinerant spin density wave order coexists with superconductivity.  Properties of electronic states in these materials will be studied through a careful analysis of simplified models of interacting electrons on the lattice, informed in some cases by microscopic density functional theory calculations.   The PI's group will also study the influence of impurities on electronic nematic instabilities in Fe-based superconducting systems at temperatures above the superconducting transition.   To achieve research goals the full numerical and analytical calculations of the superconducting critical temperature and order parameter in the Hubbard model across its phase diagram, including the spin density wave and coexistence phases within a fluctuation exchange interaction approximation will be performed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Quantum materials\" are a class of substances thought to be very close to the border of becoming magnetic, superconducting, and/or any number of other \"quantum ordered states\".  Because of this, small \"tweaks\", like applying an electric field or adding an impurity atom, can change the balance between these competing states.   Technological devices that make use of this extreme sensitivity can be designed to replace conventional electronics and solve societal problems.  This project focussed primarily on superconductivity, the state of matter with zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature Tc,  specifically \"unconventional\" superconductors where the electrons are bound into pairs by the repulsive Coulomb interaction.  It  asked how disorder can induce ordered states locally, and possibly lead to new physical phenomena that might be exploited. \n\nHow to detect gap sign change. In unconventional superconductors, the  gap in the excitation spectrum &Delta;(k), which depends on the momentum of the electrons (k,-k) in the pair, changes sign to minimize the energy.  This can be hard to confirm experimentally, since the low-energy excitations depend on &Delta;2. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provides atomic-scale resolution images of surfaces, including local  information about the Cooper pair wave function.  We proposed a test of the gap sign change appropriate for multiband systems like the iron-based superconductors, where magnetism, superconductivity, and nematicity (spontaneous creation of crystalline anisotropy) compete. An experimental group need only collect quasiparticle interference (QPI) data in disordered samples by Fourier transforming the local conductance with respect to space, and antisymmetrizing with respect to STM bias.  This simple test was successfully applied recently to the mysterious superconductor FeSe, showing that its gap changes sign between Fermi surface pockets (Fig. 1).  It means this is strong evidence that pairing between electrons is due to repulsive interactions. \n\nTheory of STM maps. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provides atomic-scale resolution images of surfaces, including local  information about the Cooper pair wave function if the material is a superconductor. In many novel materials, the superconductivity is \"active\" in layers away from the surface, so it is not clear how an STM tip, which is several &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m above the surface, measures these properties.   Previous work was confined almost exclusively to models of electrons hopping on a 2-dimensional lattice representing the active layer,  corresponding to the the CuO2 plane in cuprates or the FeAs plane in iron-based superconductors. \n\n     We developed a method of calculating images of electronic wave functions in the continuum instead of on the lattice, which also respects the local symmetry of the atoms in the crystal.  This enables a much more accurate comparison of theory with experiments, solving some decades-old puzzles in cuprates along the way.     The first of these was the understanding of STM maps of impurity states and quasiparticle interference maps in the cuprate superconductor BSCCO.  The spectacular agreement between our theory and experiment shows that we really understand how these mysterious STM patterns are created in the optimally doped cuprates.  We then undertook the more ambitious task of understanding the charge ordered phases of the underdoped cuprates.  Patterns in STM at bias around the pseudogap   energy have long shown a \"charge order\" that has recently been confirmed by other experiments.  Using an inhomogeneous mean-field approach to the t-J model, incorporating strong interactions between electrons,  we were able to all the correlations seen by experiment in this material, including the bias dependence of the intra-unit cell form factor, that had been a puzzle (Fig. 2).\n\n   In addition to these two highlights of the research funded, we began ongoing investigations of the competition between superconductivity and nematicity in the iron-based systems, and showed how disorder can lead to an increase of Tc under certain circumstances, depending on whether and why these two orders compete or cooperate.  We also studied the competition amoung various superconducting phases in the Hubbard model, the simplest model of an interacting electron system.These calculations led to deeper insight of why superconductivity may occur, allowed for direct comparison to experiments, which has in turn led to theoretical insights that may guide the discovery of high-temperature superconductors suitable for new applications.\n\n Broader Impact.   NSF funds were also used to bring science, and particularly the science of superconductivity, to a wider audience.   First, a database of tight-binding models used for the Fe-based superconductors was made available on the PI's websited.  A database of Wannier functions used for the theoretical STM maps was also added, for use by the wider cuprate and Fe-based SC community.  In addition, superconductivity was brought to the general public through the P.I.'s engagement  in outreach to schools and to the public at a physics table he organized at the local farmers' market.  Finally, the PI organized activities at the University of Florida surrounding UN Women and Girls in Science Day Feb. 11 2017(Fig. 3).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter J Hirschfeld"
