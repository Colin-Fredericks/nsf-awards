There are many clinical populations including: TBI, stroke, multiple sclerosis, autism, neurodegenerative disorders and aging, which could be studied with the proposed equipment and integrated platform. The PIs were the first to study fMRI and eye movements in vision rehabilitation in mTBI, which can potentially impact the health care management of vision dysfunction. Functional brain connectivity and eye movements show promise as potential biomarker(s) to quantitatively measure neurological function in such clinical issues as moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in athletes and soldiers, as well as in children with vision dysfunction and mTBI. \r\n\r\nThe PIs will integrate this platform into their signal processing and instrumentation courses. The PIs have a history of outreach activities previously funded through an NSF CAREER award and the NIH. All those activities will continue, which include: mentorship of under-represented grade school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate (Masters and Ph.D.) students.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThis proposal requests funding to design an integrated, portable functional near infrared spectroscopy instrument (fNIRS) that was successfully developed with Vision and Neural Assessment Equipment. The system will have the following capabilities: 1) custom software with user-friendly script language to program independent and multiple visual stimuli, 2) simultaneous recording of functional connectivity with fNIRS and eye movement responses, 3) library of visual stimuli for other clinicians to use and 4) data analysis algorithms to determine potential brain connectivity measures or biomarkers that are sensitive and specific in identifying neurological and visual deficits. This transformative project will enable basic and clinical research scientists to assess brain functions in normal and impaired populations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe diagnosis of concussion has substantially increased over the last five years.  Clinicians desperately desire a quantitative tool to aid in their determination to recommend when an athlete should return to school and return to play.  The goal of this grant was to integrate functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with eye movement recordings to determine whether concussion could be detected compared to nonconcussed subjects.  Integration of a TechEn fNIRS device with an ISCAN eye movement monitor was successfully accomplished. The grant funded three primary studies.  The first investigated a quantitative method to assess visual distraction using vergence (inward and outward) movement of the eyes in those without head injury and those reporting concussion.  A concussion was either diagnosed by a doctor or assess using the IMPACT test administered by an athletic trainer.   Results support that a new derived binocular health index shows promising sensitivity and specificity to classify a concussion.  The second study was a feasibility study to investigate whether a reliable signal from the frontal eye field (FEF) could be recorded using fNIRS evoked from vergence eye movements.  Results support that in the majority of subjects this signal was stable with a high interclass correlation coefficient supporting that the FEF could be studied with FEF.  The third study investigated a longitudinal assessment of college athletes from various sports including men's and women's basketball and soccer teams.  This pilot data support that eye movement show promise as a means to quantitatively assess concussion and can be used to assess natural recovery.  Future research will further explore eye movement and fNIRS as a means to 1: determine sensitivity and specificity to facilitate the diagnosis of concussion and 2: a tool to quantitatively assess therapeutic interventions both active and natural recovery. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tara Alvarez"
