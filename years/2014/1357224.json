 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lead is a trace metal that has historically been emitted into the atmosphere through human activities such as coal burning and the use of leaded gasoline followed by deposition into the ocean.  Once introduced into the marine environment, lead is dispersed via currents and removed by biota and other sinking particles.  This century-scale growth of lead emissions followed by a decline upon the phase-out of leaded gasoline is one of the great global geochemical experiments. In this study, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will analyze archived seawater samples to improve our knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability of lead concentrations and lead isotope ratios. This data will yield new insights into the sources and transport of lead and other metals, document the time-evolving human footprint on the ocean, and assist with validating models.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The study will improve our understanding of factors influencing lead chemistry in the ocean and provide educational opportunities for graduate and post-doctoral students in the biogeochemistry of this element.",
