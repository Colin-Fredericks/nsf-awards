There are currently over 650 active awards in the program. The PI meeting will be a large, major event for the Foundation and the community, bringing together PIs with government and industry representatives. For this event there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize the technical program, the venue and conference logistics.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides funding for the venue and conference logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.",
