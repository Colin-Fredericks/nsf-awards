 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2014 Beneficial Microbes Conference provides a forum for the exchange of the latest conceptual and technological research advances on resident microorganisms and their impact on the fitness of animals and plants.  The meeting will bring together US and international researchers from multiple disciplines (microbiology, immunology, genomics, nutrition, ecology, systems biology, evolutionary biology and clinical science), and comprises five sessions: (1) Microbiota and the Gut-Brain Axis; (2) Evolutionary Dynamics of Host-Microbe Interactions; (3) Nutrition and Immune Function: Cross-Species Perspectives; (4) The Ecology of Host-Microbial Interactions; and (5) Beneficial Microbes in Human Health and Disease.  Each session will include two invited talks, four talks selected from submitted abstracts and one further talk (invited or selected) with a quantitative flavor, to disseminate best practice in analysis of large datasets and facilitate discussion of outstanding barriers to computational analysis and mathematical modeling of host-microbial interactions. The conference will also include two poster sessions.\r\nBiologists are increasingly recognizing that animals and plants are multi-organismal, i.e. invariably associated with benign or beneficial microorganisms. The 2014 Beneficial Microbes Conference will provide the opportunity to exchange ideas and information on these interactions, and explore exciting new opportunities to promote the health and vigor of animals/plants of economic and conservation importance, including agricultural crops, pollinators, and pests. The conference includes advertised opportunities for break-out groups to discuss specific scientific topics and issues in professional development (e.g. careers). A Conference Discussion on Future Directions in Beneficial Microbes Research will be the foundation for a published commentary on research priorities to overcome current barriers to advancement of the field. The conference will be particularly useful to promote opportunities for early-career researchers, women and minorities, through invitation and travel assistance, ensuring that these participants are well-represented and their scientific career opportunities are fully supported.",

All posters were on display throughout the meeting close to the main lecture hall, to promote easy viewing and informal discussion with the poster presenters.  A total of 172 posters were displayed, with the distribution of first authors as follows: 86 men and 86 women; 26 URMs; 76 international participants.  The survey results indicated that these sessions were greatly valued for informal discussion of scientific topics and for networking and general communication.\n\nConference participants were invited to organize and participate in informal sessions on topics of particular interest Two topics were suggested: Beneficial Microbes and Host Circadian Rhythms organized by Mimi Shirasu-Hiza &amp; Elizabeth Heath-Heckman; and What\u00c6s New and Old at NIH and NIGMS organized by NIH Program Officer Darren Sledjeski.   Both were well-attended and the discussions were lively.  The results of the post-conference survey of participants confirmed that these events were greatly appreciated.\n\nThe conference included a Discussion of Future Directions in Beneficial Microbe Research, led by Professor Margaret McFall Ngai.  The discussion was driven by the floor, and focused principally on routes to promote the discipline, enhance the representation of the discipline in higher education curricula, and engage with the wider community.  This event was identified as a highlight by many respondents to the questionnaire, and was also listed as one of the highlights of the conference in the bimonthly report to the Executive Director of the American Society for Microbiology.  \n\nThe survey organized by ASM revealed strong satisfaction with the conference.  Of the 96 participants that attended, 100% considered the instructional level was appropriate, all but one found the effectiveness of the speakers to be excellent (60%) or good.  The conference was particularly applauded in the survey &ndash; and additionally on Twitter &ndash; for the equal gender ratio among speakers, and the broad ethnic/career/national diversity among attendees. As one respondent commented: \"it makes for a better conference and I know it takes a lot of work to achieve\".\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Angela E Douglas"
