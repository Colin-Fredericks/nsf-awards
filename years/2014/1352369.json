 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Lithwick of Northwestern University to further develop novel techniques that combine analytical formulae with statistical techniques to independently measure important physical and orbital properties of Kepler planets from their Transit Timing Variations (TTV).  These results will be used to answer questions such as how planet density and orbital parameters depend on spacing, multiplicity, orbital period, metallicity, etc.  These results will enable more detailed theoretical studies to understand how systems with multiple Earth to Neptune sized planets in orbits closer than Mercury's are formed.  The principal tool will be N-body simulations of the build up of planets by accretion in which damping by a gas disk is indirectly accounted for.  The procedure will be guided where possible by analytical theory, and the resulting distributions of planet and orbital properties will be constrained by Kepler TTV's.  \r\n\r\nThe work to be carried out under this award will provide  measurements the mass and orbital properties of a large number of planetary systems.  The PI will then be able to model the formation of these systems to better understand why our own planetary system is so different from the vast majority discovered with Kepler.  In his approach to an integrated research and education plan, Professor Lithwick will take advantage of the broad appeal of exoplanets to develop and introduce computer modeling into the science curriculum at Chicago-area high schools.  He will primarily develop and share tools and curriculum materials through workshops for high school teachers, who will then work with student doing independent projects involving computer modeling of exoplanets.  The PI will consult with the teacher-student teams and visit each school.  He will also organize a one-day symposium for students to present their results.",
