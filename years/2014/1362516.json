 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Paul Wagenknecht of the Department of Chemistry at Furman University will develop new classes of transition metal alkynyl complexes with interesting optoelectronic properties.  The goal of this research is to exploit the characteristics of these transition metal alkynyl complexes for the development of optoelectronic devices, namely near-infrared luminescent sensors, organic light emitting diodes, and systems for the conversion of solar energy into stored chemical energy or electricity (e.g. dye-sensitized solar cells).  In addition, this project will provide excellent training of undergraduate, masters, and postdoctoral students in the area of device chemistry.  \r\n\r\nTransition metal alkynyl complexes display a rich array of photophysical properties where substituted alkynyl ligands can be used both for the tuning of excited states and as conduits for electron- and energy-transfer. The proposed syntheses include modifications designed to probe the relationship between excited state photophysics and molecular architecture.  In this project, three classes of new transition metal alkynyl complexes will be prepared to answer the following questions: 1) Can alkynyl-diimine ligands be used to facilitate Cr(III) sensitization of near-infrared lanthanide emission and how is the rate of the Cr to Ln energy transfer affected by the molecular architecture? 2) How does the inclusion of the high field strength trifluoropropynyl ligand impact the excited states of emissive complexes of interest for organic light emitting diodes? 3) Can the redox properties of the Fe(II) to Ti(IV) metal-to-metal charge-transfer excited state in alkynyl bridged Ti(IV)-Fe(II) assemblies be controlled and exploited for the conversion of solar energy into stored chemical energy?",

One leading technology is that of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDS).  Emissive complexes often use electron deficient alkynes to adjust the energy of the emissive state, and thus the color of the emitted light.  We have demonstrated that the trifluoropropynyl ligand, C2CF3may be an ideal candidate for such technologies.\n\nThis research was carried out largely by thirteen different undergraduate students, and one postdoctoral researcher.  This group includes six women and two underrepresented minorities.  The majority of these students are coauthors on peer-reviewed publications from our group and all have given external presentations, including three presentations at international conferences.  Four of the undergraduate researchers are now pursuing Ph.D. degrees in STEM fields, with two of those being in fields related to sustainable energy sources.  Several others are working in industry.  One has entered law school to study patent law, and several others plan to attend medical school.\n\nThe research team eagerly shares its expertise with the local community in an effort to increase interest in STEM fields and in sustainable energy sources. For several summers the group has taught a group of high-school teachers how to make dye-sensitized solar cells and have provided the resources necessary for them to perform those experiments with their own students.  The research team has also worked with the Furman University Bridges to a Brighter Future Program to bring students from under-represented groups into their laboratory.  These high-school students shadow the Furman students in the lab and also make their own solar cells.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul S Wagenknecht"
