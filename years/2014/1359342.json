 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors Marya Lieberman and Toni L. Barstis at the University of Notre Dame. This REU site and its companion faculty research program will train students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to design, develop, and test novel analytical methods and instruments for use in low resource settings.  It will give early career students a chance to use their science or engineering knowledge and skills to help people in the poorest nations of the world. The projects will be aimed at different goals such as to identify low quality pharmaceuticals, diagnose human and animal diseases, detect environmental contamination or food adulteration, and discover and manage bacterial drug resistance. The experience will empower the participants to use their science knowledge and skills to solve real problems, and it will enlarge their view of themselves as global citizens and agents of change.   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this REU site is to bring chemical analysis out of the lab and into the world, particularly in resource-limited locations. Students will study diagnostic tools and technology, portable instruments, sample-collection/analysis methods, or new ideas for remote imaging or monitoring, and they will also learn about the differences between technological infrastructure in developed and developing countries. The intellectual focus of the site is developing and testing better (cheaper, faster, more practical) ways to perform chemical analyses that are relevant to problems in developing countries. Students will study diagnostic tools & technology, portable instruments and sample-collection/analysis methods. The target analytes may be biological (disease markers, pathogens) or chemical (falsified drugs, environmental contaminants, organophosphates in the cooking oil). To develop analytical methodology and instruments that work reliably outside a controlled lab setting is a both a challenge and an opportunity for students to apply their budding skills in building instruments, designing experiments and rigorously analyzing data.",

How can people do good science in places when this infrastructure isn?t available?  In this undergraduate research experience, students helped to develop or test self-contained technologies that can be used in low resource settings: a farmer?s fields, a health care clinic or pharmacy, or a home in a small town. \n\n We chose this theme for the REU because it would force us to ask different types of questions and develop novel approaches to answer those questions.  Most modern analytical chemists work on detecting tiny amounts of a target molecule, but in low-resource settings, it is more important to detect large amounts of the target reliably, with technology that will still work if the power goes out or if the operator has only a high school level education. To develop analytical methodology and instruments that work reliably in such circumstances is a huge intellectual challenge and a wonderful opportunity for students to build instruments, design experiments and rigorously analyze data.   \n\nOver four years, NSF supported 34 undergraduates from outside UND in full time summer research.  The REU participants were selected from a pool of 334 applicants.  19 (56%) were women, and 9 (26%) were underrepresented minority students.
