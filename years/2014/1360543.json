 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support six semiannual AGNES weekend workshops in Algebraic Geometry, the first of which is to be held at Stony Brook University, April 25 - 27, 2014. Algebraic geometry is a dynamic subject with vital connections to physics, applied mathematics, and fields such as number theory, differential geometry and representation theory. The Northeastern United States are a particular nexus, with a density of researchers and an output rivaling any region in the world. AGNES weekend workshops bring together a spectrum of algebraic geometers from the region and beyond, as well as representatives from allied fields invigorating algebraic geometry. There is diversity both in speakers and participants, from senior experts to burgeoning young researchers. There is a special emphasis on students: AGNES hosts \"students-only\" introductory pre-talks, as well as professional development sessions. Through lectures, panels, problem sessions, poster sessions, and informal discussion periods, AGNES informs the community of developments, AGNES fosters new research collaborations, and AGNES trains junior algebraic geometers.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometers study the geometry of shapes defined by the polynomial equations of Algebra. In fact, the geometric shapes occurring in nature -- in science, in engineering, etc. -- are frequently \"algebraic\", explaining the vital importance of algebraic geometry in physics and applied mathematics. This grant promotes research, dissemination and training in algebraic geometry through a series of conferences held throughout the Northeastern United States. There is an emphasis on supporting graduate students, highlighting the broad array of work in the area and its many connections to allied areas, and fostering communication in our broad research community.\r\n\r\nAGNES website is available at http://www.agneshome.org/",
