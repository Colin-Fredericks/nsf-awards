 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educational Pathways Into College and Career is a multi-faceted summer program designed to equip students from low-performing schools, low-income families and ethnic/racial groups underrepresented in STEM fields with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to succeed in STEM majors and pursue STEM-related careers.  Students, through the course of learning about innovative technologies, will develop a project that can transform the lives of a community. During the summer program, students will build real solar electric systems that are designed to perform for many years, and will learn about electricity, energy, system design (engineering); they will experiment with solar technologies and have the opportunity to modify the loads, power production, and energy storage of the systems. Students will send the solar electric systems they build to schools or orphanages in developing countries where they will be the only source of electricity for the school or orphanage, a source of power that is sustainable, easily maintained, and renewable. The summer program will incorporate interdisciplinary mathematics, problem solving, critical thinking and communication to promote STEM literacy and 21st century skills, thereby strengthening students' readiness for STEM majors and careers. This project will also include a research component that will study the best ways to integrate career technical education and service learning into STEM learning, providing a better understanding of how different elements of the program influence student outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration involving multiple organizations, including the Lawrence Hall of Science at University of California, Berkeley (The Hall), Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), We Care Solar, East Bay College Fund, and the Aspire program.  OUSD has recently incorporated science learning as a key element of its strategic plan.  We Care Solar is a non-profit organization that provides small-scale solar energy systems to hospitals, orphanages, and schools in the developing world where the lack of electricity, especially at night, often contributes to high mortality and low achievement rates. East Bay College Fund is a community-based non-profit organization that provides scholarships, mentoring ongoing college counseling and life skills training to public high school students from low income families and communities with historically low college enrollment and graduation rates. The Aspire Education Project is an East Bay non-profit organization that provides academic support tutoring to all students regardless of economic status to improve their academic performance, standardized test scores, and college readiness.",

EPICC incorporated STEM content with a meaningful service project. The STEM content included four major components: 1) innovative solar energy technology; 2) integrated mathematics for application of energy systems; 3) engineering; and 4) global energy issues. For their service project, students designed and built solar suitcases, which functioned as a stand-alone renewable energy system that lit a room and charged equipment such as cell phones, headlamps and e-readers. Students made contact with a community in the developing world, learning about their needs and challenges. After designing and building the systems, the solar suitcases were shared with schools, orphanages, and community centers in the developing world that lack light and power. Students saw that what they learn in school can enable them to make a positive impact on the world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Recruitment for EPICC intentionally focused on students who would be first generation college attendees from underrepresented groups (Black/African-American, Latinx, and Southeast Asian) and/or low-income families. Results indicate that the program was successful, providing an engaging experience for students while also improving their STEM Activation and college and career readiness. In both self-report surveys and research team observations, students were moderately to highly engaged throughout activities. In addition, the research team observed evidence &nbsp;of science practices, such as modeling and investigating. These activities provided opportunities for students to develop valuable skills for science, college, and career. Indeed, the students came away from the experience expressing more positive attitudes towards science in terms of their Science Fascination and Science Values, and a reported greater interest in pursuing a STEM career.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>EPICC also included pre-engineering mathematics coursework, college and career coursework, and community building. The results reveal substantial evidence that the service learning component, in particular, may have been especially valuable for these students. For instance, although the pre-engineering classes supported science practices, and the college and career readiness classes supported engagement, only the service learning activities showed evidence of supporting both areas of engagement and science practices. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Other evidence for the potential value of the service learning component was found in the patterns of growth in science attitudes among EPICC students versus comparison group students. When comparing EPICC students and comparison group students, the largest effect size was seen at post-test in Science Values, with EPICC students valuing science more. It seems reasonable to conclude that, rather than the pre-engineering or college and career coursework, it was the opportunity to engage in a science-based service learning activity that allowed students to observe the value of science for making improvements in the world and in the lives of others.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is also important to consider the potentially unique value of EPICC for students who represent communities that are historically underrepresented and/or underserved in STEM. The overwhelmingly positive reactions students expressed about the program indicate that EPICC succeeded in creating an experience through which these students could connect with the content and activities.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>EPICC was successful because it created an engaging experience for underrepresented and underserved youth that the project incorporated the norms, values, and beliefs of the participants it served. Students could see value in their work and were able to make connections between school and their everyday lives.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>EPICC created opportunities for students to build relationships with each other, realize connections between their home and school, and see value in their work. To allow for connections between students, EPICC incorporated community building activities to create safe spaces where they could learn together. Next, to make connections between their home experiences and school, students reflected on their own electrical use while learning about the lack of electricity access in other communities. Finally, to see value in their work, students were given the opportunity to present their accomplishments to their local community members, which fostered a sense of pride in their work.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/09/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ardice&nbsp;Hartry</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433677/1433677_10337292_1547063810083_5.IMG_3899copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433677/1433677_10337292_1547063810083_5.IMG_3899copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wiring a solar suitcase\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1433677/1433677_10337292_1547063810083_5.IMG_3899copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wiring a solar suitcase\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students build and wire a solar suitcase and power a light.
