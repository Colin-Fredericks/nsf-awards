  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver 80% of the world\u00c6s energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating.  Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, microscale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes.  The world\u00c6s dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety.  Thus, combustion is still an active, vital area of research.\n\nThe International Symposium on Combustion is by far the largest and most important international meeting for dissemination of the results of basic and applied combustion research.  It is held biannually, in a different location each time.  Practically all of the most published, most cited and most respected members of the international combustion research community attend this Symposium.  Students attending this Symposium have a unique opportunity to meet these members of the community, discuss their research with them, and exchange ideas with both senior researchers as well as their student peers from around the world.  Thus, it is almost essential that fledgling combustion researchers attend the Symposium and present their work therein. \n\nThis project supported travel for 47 students to the 35th International Symposium on Combustion, held from August 3 - 8, 2014.  The Symposium included a full 5-day agenda including 1 keynote speaker, 4 plenary lectures, 4 topical review lectures, more than 350 contributed oral presentations (which had undergone a full rigorous peer review process; less than 40% of the submitted papers were accepted) and more than 800 poster presentations.  All students supported by this grant were\n\nUS Citizens or permanent residents\nFull-time students (priority was given to Ph.D. students) at an accredited U. S. university\nSupported by their academic advisor, as evidenced by a letter of recommendation\nAn author or co-author of a contributed paper or poster accepted by the Symposium Program Committee.\n\n\nA request for applications was advertised via the Combustion Institute website (http://www.combustioninstitute.org) and email announcements were sent to the US section members of the Combustion Institute.  The applications included:\n\nA letter of endorsement by the academic advisor \nA list of other potential funding available to attend the Symposium \nComplete mailing address and e-mail address\n\n\nThe Combustion Institute supported this project by\n\nPosting the announcement on its server\nSending emails advertising the support to the appropriate US members\nCollecting the applications and forward them to the PI for approval and payment via USC\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul D Ronney"
