 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the best-known application for particle accelerators is associated with high-energy physics, other applications such as cancer treatment and materials processing are becoming increasingly important.  Since the pioneering accelerators of the 1930s the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated, known as the energy frontier, has increased many orders of magnitude.  The intensity frontier, which refers to the number of particles that can be simultaneously accelerated, has progressed much more slowly, despite the importance of a number of applications that require an increased particle flux.  A major limitation to accelerating more intense beams is the inherently nonlinear behavior that becomes relevant when particle beam currents are increased.\r\n\r\nIt is known that linear focusing forces can stably transport a charged particle beam.  This has led to a strong reliance on linear transport systems, albeit with weak nonlinear elements to correct for various unavoidable beam nonlinearities.  Recent theoretical work has resulted in a fundamental rethinking of the conventional wisdom, which considered nonlinear elements as inherently problematic, and opened the possibility of a significant increase in the intensity frontier.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis award will support the use of the unique capabilities of the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) to experimentally explore, in concert with simulation, a practical demonstration of using a strongly nonlinear lattice to stably transport intense beams.  The research program will exploit the UMER apparatus to fill the gap between theoretical conjecture and practical realization.  This will be accomplished by examining the many deviations from the simplifying assumptions necessary in a tractable analytic treatment, which are inevitable in a real experiment.  In addition to the direct benefit of facilitating stable operation of accelerators at new intensity levels, the fundamental demonstration that strong nonlinearities can be beneficial, when weaker nonlinearities degrade performance, could be an important intellectual contribution to accelerator physics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nOperating accelerators at higher intensity levels will have a substantial impact to areas such as materials processing, accelerator based nuclear energy generation and transmutation of nuclear waste, as well as high-energy physics.  In addition to the direct research effort, this program will carry out workforce training in accelerator-related careers, educating the next generation of accelerator scientists.  The outreach program carried out by the PI also creates research opportunities for both local high school students and undergraduates from across the country.",
