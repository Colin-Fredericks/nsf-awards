 "awd_abstract_narration": "The City University of New York (CUNY)/Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Center for Global Climate Research (CGCR), is based on research related to Geoscience, Atmospheric Science, Sun-Earth interaction and Global Climate Impacts. CUNY/GISS CGCR-Phase II will continue to provide this unique undergraduate student research experience for a second three-year period. Each Summer, ten students will be recruited in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site and will be distributed among the research teams (five at CUNY, five at GISS) under the mentorship of CUNY faculty and NASA scientists. Students will receive a stipend for 10 weeks of research experience. In addition to recruiting students from four-year colleges, the proposed activities will continue to include an active recruitment of students at the community college level. Student external to CUNY, in greater NYC Region, are also encouraged to apply. The CUNY/GISS REU Site will continue to seek 60% under-represented minorities and 40% female participation each year. The Objectives are to: a)provide undergraduate summer research opportunities in Global Climate Change and related areas at CUNY and GISS to a larger Greater NYC region constituency; b)provide enrichment activities at GISS and CUNY which include basic technical skills workshops and\r\nseminars; c)assist students in continuing their research during the academic year, leveraging existing NASA, NSF and NOAA programs; and d)increase the number of students in the STEM pathway to graduate school and to the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nStudents will be involved in existing research projects which are collaborations with NASA scientists and CUNY faculty funded by NASA and/or NOAA. Students will be engaged in original research and contributing to the general body of knowledge in Global Climate Change. The collaboration occurs within a small urban geographical area, which enables faculty and students to interact with scientists on daily basis. The faculty, students and scientists have developed a unique relationship that has benefited both CUNY and NASA GISS.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThis unique urban CUNY-GISS collaboration was expanded so that more undergraduate students in CUNY and the Greater New York City Region could experience the rich scientific research and the diversity of the melting pot environment of CUNY/GISS. Students are involved in cutting edge research, access to a NASA research center and have the opportunity of presenting their results at national conferences and as co-authors in peered review publications. The CUNY faculty and GISS scientists collaboration has a track record of working with students that are under-represented in STEM areas and advancing student through the STEM pathway to graduate study in areas in which fewer students are selecting as careers and where the loss of retired scientists is significant.",
