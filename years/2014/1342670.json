This conference is held annually, at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Qu\u00e9bec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Qu\u00e9bec, and beyond to present and discuss their research, the conference promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American number theorists.  The small scale of the meeting (with around 60 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference website can be found at http://www.math.umaine.edu/numbertheory/mainequebec.html.",
