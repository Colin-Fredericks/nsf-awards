 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is being made to the University of Memphis by the Instrumentation Development for Biological Research program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral areas of biological and biomedical research critically depend on 3D imaging for accurate analysis of subcellular structures within thick cellular samples. This research project will create a new imaging system design based on integrated computational and optical techniques to overcome the depth limitations of high-resolution 3D microscope imaging. The collaborative nature of the research is a model for cooperation between basic scientists and engineers. Outreach activities associated with this project will provide  opportunities for local undergraduate students and community college instructors to participate in this research, connect with biological researchers and the international microscopy community, and gain skills in modern microscopy techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a computational optical system for three-dimensional (3D) microscopy imaging. The research involves integrated structured illumination optics, phase modulated imaging optics, digital signal processing, and analysis/synthesis techniques to achieve results not obtainable from traditional imaging standards. A novel partially coherent illumination configuration will be designed and tested and an imaging system uniquely capable of insensitivity to sample-induced aberration will be engineered. Digital processing algorithms that result in high-resolution, low-noise 3D images at depths of up to 100 micrometers within a thick sample will be developed. The broader impacts of this work include enabling of new capabilities developed to address currently inaccessible biological questions as well as potential societal benefits from implementation of a model for interdisciplinary education that encourages young scientists and engineers to engage each other in the drive toward innovation and discovery. Dissemination plans include a) a 3-day workshop/training session for potential users and industry partners, and b) online plans and instructions to build the system and the right to non-profit institutions to use it for research.",

The main hallmark of our computationally-integrated system is that it requires 40% less data for high-resolution image restoration than commercial instruments. This results in shorter data-acquisition time and less light exposure to live biological samples. This is a big advantage for live-cell imaging.</h2>\n<h2>3D super resolution beyond the resolution limit of conventional widefield microscopes can be achieved with a 3D-SIM provided the sample is illuminated with a structured pattern that encodes high resolution information in the data, thereby increasing the information content of images, which can then be extracted using computational processing methods. In this project we designed novel structured illumination patterns that can be tailored for the needs of different imaging applications. Simultaneously, we developed computational methods to produce high-resolution images from 3D-SIM data using a model-based approach. In this approach, physics-based mathematical modeling is used to describe the information content of the 3D-SIM?s recorded images and the use these models to design computational methods that expand and enhance the recorded image information content. Our 3D model-based approach provides improved 3D resolution (along the x, y, and z spatial coordinates) over other existing methods. Specifically, it provides: 1) quantitative results that do not contain negative values that are non-physical (fluorescence intensity is positive); 2) true 3D super-resolution with 3D processing of the entire 3D volume as opposed to 2D processing of 2D image; and 3) final restored images using 50% less data than traditional methods.</h2>\n<h2>The project also developed an approach to engineer the microscope?s system response by changing the way the data are recorded so that it is less sensitive to spherical aberration due to refractive index differences in the imaging layers when imaging deep into a sample. The data is then processed with the new system response to obtain a final image without any restoration artifacts. This effort led to the design and testing of new optical components that can be easily be adapted to any light microscope to enable imaging of thick samples.</h2>\n<h2>Three post-docs, six graduate students and one undergraduate student participated in the research, dissemination, and outreach activities of the project.
