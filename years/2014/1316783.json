 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Lawrence Hall and Hitoshi Murayama at the University of California, Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThese two faculty members are pursuing a multi-faceted program of research in theoretical high-energy physics. With the deep experience of PI Murayama on exploiting data and building theoretical frameworks, and the inventiveness of co-PI Hall in opening up new landscapes of physics models beyond the standard model, they aim at uncovering deep secrets that span from the smallest scales of particles and strings to the largest scales of the Universe. The proposed scope includes collider physics, dark matter, neutrinos, quark flavor, phenomenology and theory of supersymmetry, observational cosmology, field theory, string theory, and the multiverse.\r\n\r\nThis work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Collectively, this research group provides training to students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists. They also promote diversity by seeking and encouraging participation by women students and scientists. Because the general public is deeply interested in fundamental questions, the Berkeley theory group will also work with QuarkNet teachers to bring the excitement of forefront research to high-school students. Strong ties to the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Tokyo through Murayama's directorship will also bring international connections to students and postdocs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied funndamental questions about how the Universe came to be what it is today.  One crucial question is to understand the nature of mysterious dark matter, which is our mother separated at birth.  Without dark matter, there are no stars, no galaxies, no us.  Murayama proposed a new theory that dark matter is actually a kind of d&eacute;j&agrave; vue; a composite particle made of smaller constituents very much like pions we have discovered back in 1940s.  We may be able to create them at that SuperKEKB accelerator that started operation.  On the other hand, we also need another mysterious particle called Higgs boson to keep our body together.  It is frozen in the empty space and prevents the electrons in our body from shooting out at the speed of light, which would make our body evaporate in a nanosecod.  Hall came up with a new theory that stabilizes the Higgs boson from become too heavy from subtle effects called quantum corrections.  The idea called \"twin Higgs\" used to have a problem that the Universe gets filled with too many neutrinos.  He pointned out that small fiddling with the masses of matter particles can overcome this problem.  Further study of remnant light from Big Bang called cosmic microwave radiation may show this is the right direction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hitoshi Murayama"
