The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VIS is a research-focused meeting which has taken place annually at the visualization conferences since 2006, and has helped launch the careers of a number of outstanding young researchers. The primary goal of the Doctoral Colloquium is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives. The workshop will support community building by connecting beginning and advanced researchers and foster a network of colleagues across the world. \r\n\r\nVisualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas. IEEE VIS is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, now bringing together about thousands researchers and practitioners from around the world with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology. VIS consists this year of the 25th Annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis), the 20th Annual IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), and the 9th Annual IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Conference (VAST). It will also include the IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), the workshop on Beyond Time and Errors: Novel Evaluation Methods for Visualization (BELIV), and the International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec). The papers will be published in the special conference issue of IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics -- a widely cited venue.

Visualization is the use of interactive graphical representations of data to help cognition. VIS is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, bringing together researchers and practitioners with an interest in techniques, tools, and technology for data analysis. VIS 2014 was held in Paris, France during November 9-14, 2014.  The DC itself took place on Saturday, November 8, and involved 18 student participants selected from a submission pool of 30, and 9 distinguished faculty from across the world.\n\nThe goal of the VIS DC is to help newcomers to the visualization field build connections to other researchers and receive external feedback on their work.  Given the distributed nature of the scientific community, performing visualization research can be a solitary and isolated endeavor for many young researchers.  The VIS Doctoral Colloquium allows students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders beyond their doctoral advisor, as well as with their peers.  More specifically, the objectives of the event are the following:\n\nCommunity - Build a cohort group of new researchers from across the world.\nGuidance - Guide the work of the new researchers by having senior experts in the research field coach them and give advice on future directions.\nResearch Topics - Provide encouragement and support for selecting visualization research topics and research methods.\nAfter the Ph.D. - Give insight on future career paths, including job searches, interviewing, industry vs. academia, patents, grant writing, student advising, etc.\nAccessibility - Make attending the research conference more accessible to new entrants into the field so that they may become more integrated into the scientific community.\nDiversity - Illustrate the interrelationship and diversity of visualization research.\nSustainability - Make the new entrants\u00c6 experience at VIS an enjoyable and rewarding experience, encouraging them to return and submit to the conference in future years.\n\n\nThe intellectual merits of this project include the existing and future potential for the doctoral research performed by its participants.  Since the students were selected chiefly on grounds of research excellence, this research represents the state-of-the-art in the field of visualization.  The DC provided an opportunity both for these projects to be shaped and improved through intellectual exchange as well as for the students to present and communicate the character of their work to a key group of their peer professionals.\n\nIn terms of the broader impact, the DC brought together the next generation of visualization researchers.  This allowed them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession.  Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, and research specialization), the students\u00c6 horizons were broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.\n\nThe 2014 edition of the IEEE VIS doctoral colloquium involved 18 student participants and 9 invited faculty members.  The students were carefully selected from an initial pool of 30 submissions using three reviews performed by the co-chairs of the event.  The selection was based not only on research accomplishments, potential, and maturity, but also taking into account the overall balance of research area, nationality, gender, etc.  During the closed, full-day event, student participants were given the opportunity to present their doctoral research in 20-minute talks, followed by a 20-minute feedback session (per student) from faculty panelists as well as other participant..."
