 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of California - Santa Barbara is an eight-week-long program designed to introduce its participants to mathematical research. It seeks to admit twelve students each summer from 2015-2017 to work with two faculty members on original research problems in mathematics.  Previous iterations of this REU have prided themselves on their track record of recruiting women, minorities, and students from colleges that lack research opportunities for their students.  The program aims to continue this trend of recruiting underrepresented and underserved groups in mathematics, and views this as one of the fundamental goals of this REU.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this REU is to introduce its undergraduate participants to the practice and culture of mathematical research.  The topics researched will vary from year to year; likely candidate areas include the fields of design theory, matrix theory, linear algebra, and graph theory. On an academic level, students in the REU will be exposed to a large amount of background material in mathematics.  They will learn about their fields of interest through minicourses taught by faculty and immersion in their research problem.  As well, students will be guided in the practical-level concerns of how to give talks, create posters, and write research papers through weekly meetings, presentations, and written reports.  Students will be guided by faculty in how to present their results in appropriate research conferences and in submitting papers containing their work to refereed journals. Moreover, panels throughout the summer will advise students on how to pursue graduate studies, write a resume and personal statement, network in conferences, and continue to engage with the wider mathematical community once they return to their home institution among others.",
