Growth and material properties of 2D layered semiconductors, optoelectronic and electronic device applications of 2D semiconductor materials and their heterostructures will be a major area on which the Workshop will focus. It is one of the few workshop format meetings where the latest results can be debated and discussed in a relatively open format. WOCSEMMAD has played a key role in identifying new directions for research. The workshop will be held February 16-19, 2014 at the Menger Hotel, San Antonio, TX and the project will support student participation. WOCSEMMAD's broader impact will be on the design and development of novel new devices and materials. Along with these new materials and devices, new industries and jobs will be created with lasting impact on science and economy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFinal Report for the Workshop on Compound Semiconductor Materials and Devices (WOCSEMMAD or WOX) 2014 held in San Antonio Texas, Feb 16th-19th 2014\n\nThis report details the outcomes of the WOX 50th anniversary meeting as supported by the generous contributions of the National Science Foundation through the efforts of Dimitri Pavlidis.\n\nThe first section is summary of the participant support provided by the NSF funds (all funds were allocate for participant support).  Each recipient (15 total) received $425 compensation for the registration fees and $575 compensation toward their travel and lodging experiences.  Comments by each recipient are also included and show the recipients highly valued this conference for its depth and breadth that is unique among modern conferences.\n\nThe next section is a program schedule showing the speakers and their presentation titles.\n\nThe next section is a listing and description of the additional sponsors joining NSF in support of the meeting.  The diversity and number of conference supporters shows additional value for the conference.\n\nThe next section is a complete contact list of the 61 attendees.  More people were scheduled to attend but government travel restrictions prevented many.  Even so, the attendee count was healthy and in line with prior years.\n\nThe next section is the WOCSEMMAD 2014 Evaluation Form Summary.  In this section, evaluators supply feedback on the value of the conference and offer criticism and suggestions on what can be done for future meetings to improve on the meetings.  Additionally, the best contribution award voted on by the conference attendees is surveyed.  Debdeep Jena was voted the best contribution for 2014.\n\nThe final section is a photo archive of several of the events at WOX 2014.\n\nWe again, thank NSF and Dr. Dimitri Pavlidis for their/his gracious support that allowed WOX 2014 to be an abundant success.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William A Doolittle"
