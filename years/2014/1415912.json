 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a tool for designing new drugs.  Designing new drugs that bind to a specified protein target required finding the best molecule in a vast chemical space.   The proposed design tool can search this large chemical space much more efficiently and cheaply compared to current methods.  It is based on a \"reverse engineering\" method to solve the problem of going from a set of desired properties back to chemical structures that may have these properties.  This design tool allows the efficient search of the database to find the best molecule in advance of laboratory work.  The envisioned technology is expected to shorten the screening and drug discovery phase from 3 years to 1 year, while saving ~$20 M per target overall, by shifting current practices and enabling a rapid, lower cost, and more novel targeted drug discovery and lead identification.  \r\n\r\nThis project proposes to develop a computational drug discovery platform.  This platform uses advanced QM/MM  (quantum chemistry and molecular chemistry combined) calculations for binding accuracy combined with an artificial intelligence heuristic search algorithm to find the most appropriate molecule in a vast molecular space.  The advances to be accomplished with this SBIR project include adding two novel toolsl to improve the performance of the current \"in silico\" drug design algorithm: 1) a multi-object optimization algorithm to further improve high accuracy, and 2) an automated scaffold design algorithm. These will result in highly selective designs with novel scaffolds that not only bind well to the target, but that also have excellent drug-like properties such as low probability of toxicity and off target effects, as well as greater stability and synthesizability.  These advancements should provide higher accuracy of binding affinity prediction results with fewer false positives and better molecule selection, and reduced labor, which allows for greater automation.",

Cloud designs new drugs and drug candidates and accelerates the development process by implementing new and innovative cloud computing technology in place of traditional methods. During this Phase I and IB NSF SBIR grant period, Cloud added innovative new capabilities to the company\u00c6s \"Inverse Design\" computational drug discovery platform to make it commercially viable. Inverse Design uses computational models to quickly scan vast molecular space and find the strongest inhibitors of specific biological targets. It uses an advanced implementation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculation for binding accuracy combined with an artificial intelligence heuristic search algorithm. The report shows the progress Cloud made both scientifically and commercially during the award period.\n \nThe process of drug discovery involves the identification of molecular candidates, synthesis, characterization, screening, and assays for therapeutic efficacy. It is generally recognized that drug discovery and development are very time- and resource- consuming processes, which normally take two years after target validation for \"hit\" identification and sometimes an additional two years for lead optimization.  As the pharmaceutical market moves toward personalized medicine, it will be necessary to discover many more drugs, each covering a smaller market or population segment.  Therefore, it is crucial to quickly develop less expensive drugs. \n \nDuring this Phase I and IB NSF SBIR grant period, Cloud enhanced our computational drug design offering. The Inverse Design algorithm searches a vast molecular space that traverses primarily novel molecules with good \"freedom to operate\" potential.  The molecular space is a virtual library defined by scaffolds with multiple functional groups that are chosen based on both chemistry and biological rationales.  This space is filtered or optimized by applying \"multiple objectives\", not just a single property such as binding affinity.  Examples of such multiple objectives are binding affinity, probability of toxic side effects, synthesizability, solubility, and uniqueness.  Special filters, such as Blood-Brain Barrier permeability may be added for specific projects.  The result is a uniquely valuable drug discovery platform that considers many important properties and a vast virtual library, resulting in novel and valuable leads found quickly and inexpensively compared to traditional drug discovery.  Further, the higher quality of the expected molecules improves the probability of success in later stages of drug discovery, reducing cost and decreasing time to market.\n \nIn this research effort, Cloud successfully provided solutions to two problems: \n\nHow to define the subset of molecular space that we will search  (automatic scaffold design).\nHow to efficiently search that space for the best possible molecules before chemical synthesis and wet lab assays begin. \n\n \nCloud has validated these solutions in two drug design projects:\n\nWe have designed and delivered to Egenix, a biotechnology company, two sets of eIF4E inhibitors, targeting two different indications: cancer and Autism, and are currently waiting for experimental results. \nWe have designed and delivered a set of MTH1 inhibitors to experimental collaborators at the University of Florida for the start of their preclinical research. \n\n\n \n\nThe impact of the development of this project is to improve drug discovery in several ways:\n\nThe automatic scaffold designer directs our search in novel virtual chemical space, making it e..."
