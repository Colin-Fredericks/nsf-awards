 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will foster collaborations between physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists to generate theoretical frameworks and statistical tools to interpret genomic, anatomical and physiological data on brain function. A community of researchers will be built through development of a seminar series for discussions of problems in which the theoretical approaches of physics, mathematics and statistics can be brought to be bear on specific research questions regarding neural systems. In addition, a set of pilot projects will be funded to foster collaborations between mathematicians, physicists and neuroscientists. Specific pilot projects will use the techniques of theoretical physics to address problems of understanding large scale functional anatomical connectivity, with the objective of identifying constraints on the distance and pattern of inter-areal connectivity in the human brain. Pilot projects will also develop a theoretical framework for understanding neural activity on different time scales during behavior, with the objective of understanding the unifying neural principles underlying human memory behavior over time scales from seconds to minutes to hours. Pilot projects will also develop mathematical and statistical techniques to identify molecular networks underlying specific features of neural function, with the objective of identifying specific network modules in the prefrontal cortex. These pilot projects will provide example interactions that can be expanded to further build a community of interaction of physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists. \r\n\r\nThe maturation of scientific fields such as physics required the development of sophisticated theoretical frameworks to account for experimental phenomena at multiple different scales of analysis ranging from particle physics to condensed matter physics to astrophysics. The maturation of neuroscience as a field will require similarly sophisticated theoretical frameworks that effectively account for data at the different levels including the genomic, physiological and behavioral levels. Current theories of single neuron function have not yet been effectively extended to address physiological phenomena at the circuit and population level or the behavioral function of these network dynamics. The pilot projects in this grant will attempt to develop theoretical frameworks for addressing these multiple levels of analysis. The intellectual merit of the proposal will be the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to the interpretation of neuroscience data, including the development of theoretical models to account for existing data and to guide the design of future experiments. The field of neuroscience needs more extensive development of a theoretical framework for understanding the structure and function of neural systems at different levels, including genomic, physiological and behavioral. Successful interactions in the pilot projects could provide a model for further interaction of physicists, mathematicians, and neuroscientists throughout the field. More specifically, these pilot projects will provide a framework for development of new theories for analyzing the connectivity patterns of neural systems, the dynamics of brain function underlying behavior, and the molecular networks underlying these neural properties. The resources provided by this grant will serve to recruit additional mathematicians and physicists to address relevant questions concerning brain function.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical sciences.",

Future work combining these operations in different sequences could enhance understanding of cognitive operations in the brain. \n\nBroader impacts:\n\nThe seminar series and pilot projects have developed a community of students trained in both state-of-the art physics and neurobiology.  These students will be uniquely positioned to continue this effort for the decades to come.\n\nIn project 1, the development of techniques for identification of the axons that provide connections between brain cells and their surrounding myelin insulation has supported analysis of changes in myelination with aging and will support the tracing of the connectivity between cortical regions essential to theoretical understanding of brain function.\n\nIn project 2, the analysis of the messenger RNA in Parkinson?s disease and Huntingston?s disease provide important clues about the potential disease processes, including the potential role of the inflammation of neural circuits.\n\nIn project 3, the analysis of neural circuits for translation provides important links between sets of neurophysiological data and potential mechanisms for cognitive operations that could lead to future work elucidating the essential component mechanisms of cognitive function.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael E Hasselmo"
