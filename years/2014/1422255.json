 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing new foundational cryptographic techniques for outsourcing data and computations on it, which fully preserve data privacy. The focus is on real-world settings involving multiple users where privacy with respect to all other users is required, as well as privacy from the service provider. The project will aim to minimize the interaction between users in the system, making the computational complexity for each client independent of the total number of users. The investigators are developing protocols that allow many users to outsource their data to a cloud provider and later access it obliviously with respect to both the provider and other users while achieving as closely as possible the above efficiency requirements. This enables not only access but also computation over the outsourced data using a more efficient computational model called random access machines. \r\n\r\nThese techniques aim to minimize the work performed by the users as well as the communication between users and the service provider. The project develops cryptographic techniques that protect data privacy while enabling its use in cloud computing. Resolving these issues is of increasing importance due to the explosion of data produced by people and machines. The investigators are committed to the dissemination of research results and education of students in this area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project is a joint effort between PI Mariana Raykova and PI Dan Boneh, where the majority of the funds were allocated to Mariana Raykova who is now a Professor at Yale.   During the project we developed a new concept called Order Revealing Encryption (ORE), which is an encryption scheme that lets anyone test if one value is greater than another given only the encryption of the two values.  Order revealing encryption is useful for searching on encrypted data, where the ability to compare encrypted plaintexts allows one to perform binary search on encrypted data.   We developed a number of ORE schemes with different properties.   We next looked at several privacy mechanisms.  We first developed a system called Riposte for private messaging.  That work won the 2016 PETs award for outstanding research in privacy technology.  The second system, called Provisions, is a way for a cryptocurrency exchange to prove that it has enough assets to cover it obligations, without revealing any other information about its customers.   The third system is an efficient technique for privately aggregating customer data without revealing anything else about the underlying data.   The system ensures that an invalid data contribution cannot corrupt the computed aggregate statistic.\n\n\nThroughout the project we worked with several PhD students, including David Wu, who is now a Professor at the University of Virginia.  In addition, the PI regularly gave outreach lectures for high school students, using cryptography as a means to excite students about the applications of Mathematics to Computer Science.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan Boneh"
