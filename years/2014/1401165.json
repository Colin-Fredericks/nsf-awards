 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and provide them an opportunity to establish international collaborations and take advantage of research facilities and opportunities abroad.  Forging strong international collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign hosts.  The fellowship to Carly D. Kenkel supports a research and training plan to investigate the evolution of symbiont transmission mode using reef-building corals as a model system.  The research will advance basic scientific knowledge concerning the evolution of mutualisms and elevate understanding of the coral-algal symbiosis, the foundation of one of the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems on earth.  The host institution is The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Line Bay.  Training goals include acquiring expertise in novel biochemical techniques, next-generation sequencing methods and bioinformatics analyses. Educational and public outreach activities include establishing a high school internship program at AIMS in collaboration a local school.  This fellowship is being funded jointly by the Office of International and Integratiave Activities and the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nSymbioses are ubiquitous in the natural world, yet little is known about how transmission mode evolves in any system.  Reef-building corals are a good system in which to study this question because symbiont transmission mode has diverged repeatedly and recently across coral lineages. This research tests the hypothesis that vertical symbiont transmission (direct transfer of symbionts from parent to offspring) stabilizes mutualistic relationships.  Laboratory experiments use biochemical and physiological assays to quantify resource sharing between coral hosts and algal symbionts in closely related corals with different symbiont transmission strategies. Comparative genomic methods are being used to identify genes involved in the evolution of different transmission modes by looking for signatures of selection.",

I examined the physiological response of these corals, including calcification, photosynthesis, bleaching and the sharing of nutrients between hosts and symbionts. I found that species that pass symbionts on to their offspring in their eggs are more bleaching tolerant. I also discovered that while bleaching causes the coral to lose algae, both the coral animal and remaining algae continue to cooperate through the sharing of nutritional resources. &nbsp;This means that though bleaching is defined as the break-down of the coral-algal relationship, it does not necessarily mean that these partners cheat each other out of resources.</p>\n<p>My second aim was to understand the genetics of vertical transmission &ndash; what genes allow some corals to pass their symbionts to their offspring?

I used next generation sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble these &lsquo;transcriptomes&rsquo; and have made these new genetic resources freely available for use by other scientific researchers and the broader public (<a href=\"http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/carlslab/data/\">http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/carlslab/data/</a>), which will help other scientists who also research these species.</p>\n<p>Investigating natural differences in the transmission of symbionts will contribute to understanding the diversity of life on earth, but there are also pressing applied reasons to probe deeper into the coral-algal relationship.
