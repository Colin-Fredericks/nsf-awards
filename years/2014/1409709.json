Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoctoral researcher, public lectures both for adults and in primary and middle schools, interviews in the media including those targeted to Hispanic audiences, and a lecture series at a senior citizen center.\r\n\r\nDr. Zaldarriaga will develop a new theoretical and statistical framework combining two state-of-the-art techniques: analytical field theory methods that provide a theoretical foundation, and computational and statistical techniques that confront theory with observations in an efficient and statistically accurate way.  The work will be useful in the future interpretation of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).",
