 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports continuation of the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE) program.  The proportion of women, especially underrepresented minority women, in the mathematical sciences declines at each successive academic level.  In response to this problem, the EDGE Program is designed (1) to increase the number of women PhDs in the mathematical sciences, especially those from underrepresented groups; and (2) to place more women in visible leadership roles in the mathematics community.  The EDGE Program seeks to achieve these goals by providing a comprehensive mentoring program that supports the academic development and research activities of women in mathematics.  The proposed activities target women in four different groups: new PhD students, advanced PhD students, postdocs, and junior faculty.   Along with an annual summer session, EDGE supports an annual conference, travel for research collaborations, travel to present research, and other open-ended mentoring activities for each targeted participant group.   \r\n\r\nThis project aims to impact the mathematics community by increasing the number of women, particularly from minority groups, who succeed in graduate programs in the mathematical sciences; who assume leadership roles in academia, industry, and government; and who ultimately diversify the mathematical community and provide a sustainable increase in the pool of available \"home-grown\" talent.  Increased diversity in the mathematics community will ultimately strengthen U.S. competitiveness in mathematics and science and allow people from all backgrounds and cultures to thrive, advance, and contribute to the profession.  Reducing the gender and racial disparities among faculty in the mathematical sciences will facilitate national efforts to increase the diversity of students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs in mathematics.",
