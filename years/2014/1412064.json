These techniques could eventually be used in magnetic resonance imaging applications, and in materials characterization techniques, quality control, and diagnostics for cancer.  This project focuses on the design of new radiofrequency waveforms, designed by optimal control theory techniques, to obtain sensitivity enhancements in the measurements of sodium nuclei, as well as, to increase the specificity of such techniques with respect to the characterization of these nuclei in different environments.\r\n\r\nIn a broader context, Professor Jerschow also works on the development of spectroscopic and imaging techniques in the arts conservation field, in collaboration with Professor Eleonora Del Federico and Professor Cindie Kehlet from Pratt Institute. This activity allows to foster collaborations between conservators, arts students, and chemistry students and researchers in addressing problems of arts conservation science and to reach out to a diverse student population.",
