 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it offers low cost, and compact\r\ntablet/mobile devices with better wireless connectivity and increased battery life. Lower cost of these\r\ndevices will enable their widespread use in the society and enable use of broadband services with higher\r\nefficiency and better connectivity. The transparent antenna technology offers a platform on which\r\nseveral other applications can be built. For instance, compact health monitoring sensors can be\r\nintegrated with wireless capability by integrating antennas on their displays. This technology also will\r\nalso improve wireless capability of wearables as they have very limited real estate for antennas.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop transparent antenna\r\ntechnology for wireless consumer devices. This SBIR project will advance our understanding of\r\ninteractions between touch sensor and transparent antennas and enable development of multifunctional\r\ntouch sensors that not only operates as a touch sensor but also a transparent antenna as\r\nwell. A very comprehensive research approach will be undertaken in Phase I. Namely, in addition to\r\nevaluating performance of the antenna technology in the presence of touch sensor, performance of\r\ntouch sensor in the presence of transparent antennas will also be characterized to ensure that the\r\nproposed multi?]functional touch sensors meet the requirements of wireless consumer devices such as\r\ntablets and mobile phones.",
