 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six million Americans use crutches, canes, or walkers for mobility assistance due to chronic conditions and more than 10 million Americans use crutches due to temporary injuries. Users who commonly require walking assistance using crutches or a walking cane include individuals with cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological diseases, a fractured leg, sprained ankle, limited balance, and an exoskeleton. Although crutches and canes are imperative to walking assistance and rehabilitation for many individuals, the designs have not significantly changed in the past century. Users frequently report problems with comfort and the inability to walk long distances. The discomfort and lack of long-term walking partially stems from the rubber point tip that is unstable and does not provide any assistance propelling the person forward. A point or constant radius tip cannot assist or resist the user during swinging or rolling over the crutch tip, and all forward progression forces are generated by the users pushing themselves forward over the crutch. The aim of this project is to develop advanced and low-cost walking crutches/canes that are able to passively and effectively assist users during level ground or up-hill walking, while also enhancing control and balance during standing or down-hill walking.\r\n\r\nPlacing a properly designed kinetic shape on the crutch/cane tip can generate a rolling force based on the vertical force applied by the user?s weight. These crutch/cane roll-over shapes can either be passive and predetermined or actively changing shapes, which can accommodate different walking environments and user preferences. An actively changing crutch/cane tip also allows for the crutch/cane to stand up on its own as needed so users are able to free their hands for other everyday motions, for example shaking someone's hand or pushing an elevator button. Having a crutch/cane be able to stand up independently is a feature that several chronic users of canes are excited about.",
