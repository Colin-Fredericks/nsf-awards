There will be numerous networking opportunities to stimulate scientific and technical discussion with senior investigators and industry leaders. We will also have a focus on engaging women at the undergraduate level to stay in the engineering field. We will have special emphasis on undergraduate senior design awards. The broader impacts and goals are to develop a robust pipeline for discovery and development of medical therapies, diagnostics and research technologies to cure diseases and injury.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nBiomedical grand challenges facing our society can be addressed in part or in whole by interfacing stem cell -, synthetic -, or systems biology with biomedical engineering tools (including microfluidics, nanomaterials and nanotechnology, cellular and molecular machines, bioinspired materials and structures) and engineering principles (such as biophotonics, transport phenomenon, drug delivery). By drawing leaders from each of these fields (from both industry and academia) together to discuss ways to address pressing medical issues with the most cutting edge technology in a highly interactive venue, we will enable progress at the interface of science, engineering, and medicine. Requested funding for this proposal will enable support for registration fees for the best student participants, provide funding for student awards (oral and poster presentations and innovation competitions) and provide funding for junior faculty awards (innovation competition).",
