 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying theme of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is the development of a unified predictive analysis framework that will significantly improves the state of analysis-based design for stability-critical structures. The framework crosses disciplinary boundaries by bringing together data mining, information theory and statistical inference techniques from data sciences and high fidelity stochastic nonlinear solvers that are based on embedded nonlinear predictors into incremental-iterative path following techniques from computational sciences. Thin-wall structural components such as cold-formed steel members and thin wall cylindrical structures are extremely sensitive to material and fabrication imperfections because they fail in buckling mode when subjected to compressive stresses. The buckling/stability failure mode makes it difficult to predict collapse loads. The challenge in devising predictive analysis framework for components is that a slight deviation from perfection dramatically affects their response to loads. The result is a large scatter in results especially when the response up to collapse load is of interest. Realistic input models for observable and unobservable uncertainties that are adaptable to both global and local scales as well as to stochastic and deterministic methods will be a unique feature of the proposed framework. The goal is to develop analytical non-linear computational model that includes all variables, to integrate research in to curriculum and to provide outreach to community college and high school students. The computational model will be validated with experimental data that is already available.\r\n\r\nThe methodologies developed in this project will advance the state of the art in computational modeling of stability-critical structures and will create a leap towards moderating large safety factors involved in designing these structures. A new course in probabilistic methods in structural stability will be developed for the PhD curriculum.",
