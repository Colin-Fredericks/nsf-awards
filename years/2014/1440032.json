 "awd_abstract_narration": "Core-collapse supernovae dramatically announce the death of massive stars\r\nand the birth of neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes. They are the\r\nsites where most of the heavy elements of Nature are created.  Viewed as a\r\nnuclear physics laboratory, core-collapse supernovae produce some of the\r\nhighest densities and energies in the Universe, and during this violent\r\nprocess a combination of nuclear physics, turbulent hydrodynamics,\r\nradiation transport, and neutrino physics determines whether and how the\r\nstar explodes. However, to date the puzzle of the precise mechanism of\r\nexplosion has not been cracked.  A thesis of this team is that a\r\nfundamental impediment to progress over the last few decades may have been\r\nthe lack of access to codes, computers, and resources with which to\r\nproperly simulate the collapse phenomenon. This could explain the\r\nagonizingly slow march since the 1960's towards demonstrating a robust\r\nmechanism of explosion. However, with the state-of-the-art computer code\r\nthis team has recently developed, the time may now be ripe to make a final\r\nassault on this central problem in astrophysics. Going to fully\r\nthree-dimensional neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics and employing the best\r\nneutrino and nuclear physics may together be the keys to demonstrating and\r\nunderstanding the generic core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism.\r\nSince these supernova simulations lend themselves easily to public and\r\nschool outreach, the team plans to generate video products for public\r\ntalks and web-based distribution.\r\n\r\nCore-collapse supernovae probe the nuclear and particle physics of matter\r\nat super-nuclear density, high temperature, and at extremes of isospin.\r\nThis project supports the experimental nuclear physics program of the NSF\r\nby exploring nucleosynthesis in astrophysical explosions, the properties\r\nof the neutrino, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. The \r\nnumerical simulations connect directly with the lower-energy programs of\r\nFRIB and FAIR, the high-energy experiments carried out at RHIC and the\r\nLHC, and the hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon programs of JPARC, GSI,\r\nJLAB, and NICA. In addition, a solution to the core-collapse supernova\r\nproblem will benefit ongoing efforts of observers and instrument\r\ndesigners in the U.S. and around the world engaged in projects to\r\ndetermine the origin of the elements, measure gravitational waves (LIGO),\r\nand interpret laboratory nuclear reaction rate measurements in light of\r\nstellar nucleosynthesis.",
