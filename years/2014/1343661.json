The conceptual architecture\r\nwill serve as the blueprint for the definition, construction, and deployment of both existing\r\nand new components to ensure that they can be unified and integrated into a evolutionary national\r\ninfrastructure for EarthCube. They intend to create a concept that incorporates findings and\r\nrequirements from ongoing EarthCube activities as well as other cross-agency Earth Science\r\ninformatics efforts. The architecture models will be a roadmap for building an extensible\r\nand sustainable EarthCube system that facilitates new science and inspires substantive participation\r\nof a broad spectrum of geoscientists. The project team is led by a group of computer scientists\r\nfrom National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and private industry that has extensive\r\nexperience and a proven track record leading the architecture, design and development of complex\r\nand data intensive science data systems. They will specifically focus on the development of\r\na guiding architecture report and specification. \r\n\r\nThe results of this EarthCube architecture study can intellectually\r\ncontribute to other scientific and agency efforts as they are studying new architectural models\r\nto address scientific data management and discovery in the big data era.",
