 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central goal of this research is to understand how within traditional societies (such as those which characterize many parts of the developing world today) urban and rural dwellers are linked together through social and economic ties and how these linkages are affected by environmental change. Archaeology provides an excellent context for analyses of this type because it can trace and correlate changes in social organization and environmental context sometimes over millennial time scales.\r\n\r\nThis NSF-supported investigation will reconstruct the economic foundations of agrarian life through time in the northern Maya area in Yucatan, Mexico.  The power and complexity of the economic foundations of pre-modern states is acutely reflected in the impacts that governmental institutions had on the humblest, most peripheral residents of society. Such effects can be positive, neutral, or negative. For example, thriving market networks can connect rural houselots to larger spheres of interaction with the outside world that bring opportunities for affluence and occupational specialization. Alternatively, commoners situated within a matrix of competitive city states may suffer suppressed opportunities for prosperity, due to higher levels of taxation or instability associated with warfare. Of equal importance are bottom-up processes by which ordinary citizens innovate or reproduce economic strategies that foster household maintenance and survival. Understanding the economic organization of rural populations is essential for evaluating the prospects for a sustainable agrarian food base needed to support urban towns and cities of this arid region.\r\n\r\nThe primary research objective is to document the degree of diversity in farming, craft production, and service industries that characterized the work lives of rural residential groups through time. Related factors will also be evaluated, including the degree of wealth, stability, and longevity of the hinterland commoner house groups, as well as their level of dependency on local and regional exchange for the essentials of daily life. An extensive program of household archaeology will provide the data needed to address these research objectives, building on a previous NSF-supported investigation that located thousands of dwellings across a continuously-occupied area of 40 square kilometers, using LiDAR remote sensing. Rural life in two contrastive political geographic settings will be compared. Initially, Late and Terminal Classic era houselots were located in an extremely marginal position, far from towns or cities of significant size. Later, Postclassic homesteads were within four kilometers of a major political capital, the site of Mayap\u00e1n, a large urban center that emerged in this area. This study will document the resulting transformations to regional political economy. The study will examine long term viable strategies for farming in a drought-prone environment in an area that suffered repeated catastrophic demographic collapses, followed by remarkable resilience and demographic recovery. Although prior surface surveys revealed that the Yucatecan countryside was surprisingly populous in ancient times, with rural densities of at least 6 persons per hectare across vast tracts of the outback, no prior study has targeted the household economies of the non-urban Maya countryside.",

This study focused on transitions in household economy over a 400 year period, from A.D. 950-1450, an interval that encompasses the collapse of Terminal Classic Period Maya states (950-1050) and a subsequent political coalescence by 1250 with the establishment of the Postclassic Mayapan state. Little is known of the diversity, self-sufficiency, or regional economic interdependence of families in agrarian zones that extended almost continuously through the countryside that linked together settlements of better-documented cities and towns. Data from urban centers reflects a complex regional commercial economy, with significant inter-household dependencies promoted occupational specialization (craft production, etc.) and market trade across the Yucatan peninsula.

These findings imply high population levels and good agricultural productivity in this region, the driest of the Maya world with notoriously shallow soils. Rural agriculturalists would have generated surplus crops essential to sustain cities and towns of thousands of inhabitants. But surface survey work provides no data regarding the social and economic patterns of daily life needed to fully reconstruct regional demography and the foundations of political economies.

Excavations targeted small, humble dwellings from the LiDAR survey that fit the project&rsquo;s goal of investigating rural zone commoners exhibiting diverse spatial locations, architectural characteristics, and time periods.

Obsidian, a long distance good, was acquired by seven of eight households. Low levels of production debris (using nonlocal chert and shell) indicates that household activities were slightly diversified in these rural dwellings and that the primary activity was farming. These agriculturalists did not make large quantities of craft goods like the commoners of urban Mayapan. But most importantly, there are no indications of household &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; or dire poverty for either period as traditionally thought for pre-modern agrarian peasants. Although they were poorer than their urban counterparts, these rural households relied to an important degree on regional and long distance commercial networks. Also significant is the variation of wealth and residential growth among rural houselots of each period, and our data reflect the contingencies of social group histories in the countryside. Modest affluence suggests that these occupants profited from the exchange of some of the foodstuffs that they produced.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/20/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474382787316_MapaEdificiosExcav2015--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474382787316_MapaEdificiosExcav2015--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474382787316_MapaEdificiosExcav2015--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Locations of excavated rural houses in 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Timothy Hare, Marilyn Masson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474382903580_AerialJabahcasa--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474382903580_AerialJabahcasa--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Excavated house\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474382903580_AerialJabahcasa--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Excavated house\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example (aerial photo) of one Postclassic house group excavated in 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Timothy Hare, Marilyn Masson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Excavated house</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474383130163_AerialPulYaxChe--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474383130163_AerialPulYaxChe--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Excavated house (example 2)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1418989/1418989_10310633_1474383130163_AerialPulYaxChe--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Excavated house (example 2)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">House (Terminal Classic) excavated in 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Timothy Hare, Marilyn Masson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Excavated house (example 2)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
