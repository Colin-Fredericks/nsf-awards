 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leftwich\r\n1437611\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is significant in that it aims to provide new insights into human birth. Natural, vaginal delivery is strongly linked to positive outcomes in newborns. These include: shorter post-birth hospital stays; lower likelihood of intensive care stays and, overall, lower mortality rates. A better understanding of the fundamental fluid mechanics of vaginal delivery may reduce the need for surgical delivery in cases like prolonged labors and slightly abnormal fetal presentations. The PI aims to look at previously undetermined mechanics related to human birth. She proposes to explore an important issue related to women's and babies' health, which is clearly high impact, but which few others have previously gone after. A better understanding of the fluid dynamics involved with natural delivery can avoid birth trauma such as: clavicle fracture, brachial plexus palsy (damage to the nerves than control shoulder, arm and hand), head and brain trauma and fetal asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to study the role of fluid dynamics in the physical process of human delivery and birth. The research component of the program is primarily experimental and consists of two major objectives. In the first objective, the PI will characterize the forces involved in delivery (for vacuum assisted and \"natural\" birth) using a custom made apparatus that mimics the process of human birth. In a second aim, the PI will characterize the fundamental rheological properties of fluids (amniotic, vernix caseosa) involved in birth using rheological tools. The PI has planned an organized series of experiments to measure forces during assisted and unassisted birth, and to examine the impact of realistic geometry on the above.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis work sought to answer fundamental questions about fluid mechanics and biomechanics of human birth.  By looking at simplified uterine and fetal models, we began to establish the specific, non-biological (i.e. mechanical) role of each component of the pregnant uterus&mdash;amniotic fluid, vernix caseosa and the fetal position.  This EAGER project specifically found a relationship between the fetal offset and removal force for a simplified human birth model (Lehn, Baumer and Leftwich 2016).  Additionally, we determined that small variations in the properties of the model amniotic fluid can lead to large&mdash;up to 30%&mdash;reductions in the fetal removal force. \n\nBy understanding the fundamental physics of the birth process, we aim to reduce the incidence of C-sections in less sever cases such as slightly irregular fetal lie and failure of labor to progress.  The number of babies born each year, 4 million in the United States, leads to a very high potential impact of this work.  Furthermore, the increased cost of surgical deliveries means that in addition to improved health outcomes, the findings of this project can reducer healthcare costs for deliveries, the most common cause of hospitalization for women in the United States.  Thus, our successful aim&mdash;to find mechanical (non-surgical) solutions to difficult births through a fundamental, mechanical, study of the human birth process&mdash;will have a large and sustained impact across society.\n\nFinally, two graduate students, 6 undergraduate students and 4 high school students worked on this project, 75% of them from under represented groups in STEM.  One peer reviewed journal paper was published (Lehn, Baumer and Leftwich 2016), and 7 non-peer reviewed conference papers and posters resulted from this work.    The PI gave 5 invited seminars on the results of this work over the funding period. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Megan C Leftwich"
