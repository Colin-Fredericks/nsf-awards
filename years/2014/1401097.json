 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 2-year research project focuses on investigating the fate of oceanic crust and tectonic plates that dive into Earth's interior at subduction zones.  Earth's convecting mantle transports the former crust to the deep interior, and eventually back up to the surface.  This work specifically seeks to understand the chemistry, structure, and dynamics of oceanic crust in Earth's lower mantle. Plate tectonics and thus subduction-currents carrying crust into the deep mantle are an ongoing process; thus better understanding the distribution of, the dynamics of, and chemistry of deeply transported crust uniquely provides a window into the chemical and dynamical evolution of Earth's mantle as a whole. Past work clearly establishes how the mantle might convect, viable deep mantle minerals, and that there are seismically detected heterogeneities.  This work builds upon these ideas by seeking to connect them via studying a known input into the system of unique chemistry: the oceanic crust. This work has broad impact, since the mantle's evolution ultimately plays a role in the chemical and thermal evolution of the oceans and atmosphere. \r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary approach is adopted for this project, since (a) high pressure mineral physics in the diamond anvil cell can investigate the properties of former crust and sediments (e.g., melt) at conditions 1000's of km deep in Earth's mantle; (b) how former crust interacts with convective flow and structures, including deep compositional reservoirs, hot mantle plumes, and deep mantle chemistries can be explored with state-of-the-art numerical convection experiments; and (c) former oceanic crust may relate to structures observed with modern array seismology methods that have unknown mineralogy, including thin ultra low seismic wave speed zones at the bottom of the mantle, as well as massive continent-sized zones of low shear wave velocities beneath the Pacific  and Atlantic Oceans. The multidisciplinary proposed work will include a strong co-mentoring approach among the team of PIs for the graduate student and postdoctoral researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project our main focus is to look at features referred to as ultra low-velocity zones (ULVZs) in the deepest part of the mantle and their possible relationship to subducted oceanic lithosphere. The features called ULVZs are known to exist sitting on top of Earth?s core-mantle boundary (CMB) and their existence is possibly linked to the formation of whole mantle plumes of upwelling material that ultimately give rise to hot spot volcanoes.  Yet, little is still known about the makeup and origin of these ULVZs.  This project has a primary focus of looking at possible links between these ULVZs and material being transported to the CMB via subduction.\n\nIn this work we have demonstrated the existence of subducted slab material reaching deep into the mantle beneath northwestern South America.  We inferred this deep subduction by looking at seismic waves that interact with this slab.  Seismic waves travel as both P- and S-waves, and in this study we were able to observe waves that start as S-waves, emanating from an earthquake, but get converted to P-waves when they strike the subducted slab in deepest mantle.  Here we were able to establish that the subducted slab was still coherent enough to create this conversion from S to P waves at a depth of 1750 km (1087 miles) beneath the surface of the Earth.\n\nIn a separate study we examined the seismic wavefield in the vicinity of Central America and the southern United States.  This region is remarkable because much previous work has shown that subduction in this region started about 200 million years ago and that the subducted material has reached the CMB where it appears to be piling up beneath Central America. \n\nIn this study we used seismic observations recorded at sensors globally that have seismic waves that pass through the lower mantle beneath Central America.  As noted above, the deepest mantle in this location has been associated with the final resting place of subducted slab material which is characterized by faster than average seismic velocities.  What we found here is that these patches of highly reduced seismic wave speeds, referred to as ULVZs, appear to be associated with the borders of the high wave speed region.  That is, along the border of the subducted slab material.  The properties of these ULVZs are consistent with them being regions of partial melt.  A possible scenario for their creation is that mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), which is what the crust of the subducting slabs is made of, has a low melting temperature at temperatures and pressures in the deep Earth.  Experimental work has previously shown that MORB material is likely to partially melt in the deep mantle, yet little evidence for such MORB melt has previously been found.  Thus, we postulate in this work that the presence of ULVZs around the edge of the subducted slab material could be due to the melting of MORB material as the subducted slab reaches the CMB.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Thorne"
