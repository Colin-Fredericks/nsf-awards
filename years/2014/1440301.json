 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops the Digital Crust, an online workspace where the geosciences community can contribute data and knowledge, visualize, explore, synthesize and test multiple hypotheses across space-time and themes, and derive 4D data product from multiple data.The platform can serve as a resource to bring together geoscientists working on separate aspects of the Earth system, by bringing their data/ideas together and by providing an environment to view the Earth from different perspectives. It will also be a \"one-stop shop\" for Earth science educators to expose the growing minds to the multi-faceted nature of Earth science problems and to see data and knowledge gaps which are powerful motivators for the young (not all problems have been solved ? there is a place for me to contribute). \r\n\r\nThe Digital Crust platform prototype will demonstrate technology that has the potential to transform the way geoscientists  conduct research and learning, by (1) linking existing data repositories on all aspects of the Earth?s crust created by all disciplines of geosciences, communities as well as individuals, (2) creating a multi-context environment (e.g., tectonics, structural geology, stratigraphy, sedimentology, geomorphology, paleontology, archeology, mineralogy, geochemistry, soil science, hydrology, terrestrial ecology) at any given space (xyz) and time (t) for synthesis-type explorations, hypothesis-testing or learning, (3) allowing for multi-scale (e.g., outcrop to continent) data extractions and downloads for all research and learning applications, and (4) exposing data-knowledge gaps to identify the most rewarding future investments. Hosting multiple data types and sometimes conflicting interpretations and hypotheses of Earth processes will promote community discussion and debate on Earth processes that will foster interaction, collaboration, and data/idea sharing among scientists who might otherwise never have met. From the CI perspective, Digital Crust leverages and links with existing Building Blocks, explores the application of \"loose-schema\", noSQL databases to allow the flexibility necessary in a geoscience research database, and utilizes a modular software design to facilitate long-term maintenance and evolution of the platform.",

However, comprehensive analysis of subsurface structures and processes is often hampered by scarcity of data about lithology, permeability, porosity, and other characteristics of the upper crust. The data are scattered across multiple research projects, and often reside with government agencies or environmental engineering and mineral exploration companies. But even if these data are found, integrating them into a comprehensive, spatially-complete 4-D (3-dimensional location plus geologic time) model of the subsurface remains a key challenge. The Digital Crust project addressed this challenge by creating a prototype system where data of different types - geologic maps, drilling data, 3D solid object models, geophysical survey information, tables and notes scattered across research papers, etc. &ndash; can be consistently described, registered and integrated in a manner that is compatible with mainstream data representation and processing standards. As a result, the project team developed a series of such integrated 4D models of the upper crust, which now can be used in many research and modeling scenarios, in particular for analysis of groundwater flows. The generated models were created using different combinations of available datasets assembled by the project team, and following different assumptions about the structure of the subsurface, and respective interpolation techniques. Each generated permeability dataset, and accompanying uncertainty measures, was computed for a 3D regular grid with 0.1 degree horizontal resolution and 108 vertical levels. The grid&rsquo;s vertical resolution varies with depth: it decreases from 0.5 m near the surface to 1000m at the maximum depth of 27km. Generating such grids at a resolution not possible before is a key project outcome. Using such data, geologists and paleontologists can better &ldquo;see&rdquo; the large picture and discover hidden patterns that can help them understand the evolution of the Earth&rsquo;s physical settings and the biota. Hydrologists and geochemists can base their models of material fluxes on better constrained material properties and thus improve model abilities to predict changes in water and biogeochemical cycles. Another key outcome is developing components of a system where grid models describing the Earth&rsquo;s crust can be further refined when new information becomes available. In the process, the project team extended existing or developed new system components.
