This one-day workshop has been accepted by the 2014 IEEE Big Data conference, and is tentatively scheduled to be held on October 27, 2014 in Washington DC. The objective of the workshop is to engage its participants in using the national Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for Big Data management activities, thereby enhancing the possibilities of making discoveries in the areas of data-driven and data-intensive computing. Through the proposed project, 20 students from underrepresented groups will be funded to participate in the aforementioned workshop, and will also be supported to participate in additional activities at the conference.",

This workshop was designed to engage non-traditional HPC users (e.g., data curators, data managers, and librarians) in leveraging the national Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for Big Data Management activities. Such non-traditional HPC users need to be trained on leveraging the national CI for efficiently addressing the Big Data management needs arising in various scientific and engineering disciplines.\nThis project enabled in funding the participation of undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in not only the aforementioned workshop but also in the additional activities (e.g., technical sessions and posters) at the 2014 IEEE Big Data Conference, with which the workshop was co-located. The workshop was held on October 27, 2014 in Washington DC. \n\n\nThere were four invited speakers at the workshop who presented on Big Data Management challenges and solutions from various domains and helped in setting the context for the hands-on sessions. An overview of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) resources was provided to the workshop participants. The process of requesting allocation on XSEDE resources was discussed and the participants were apprised about the policies and practices at the open-science data centers. \n\n\nThe workshop participants were provided temporary accounts for using the supercomputers at the TACC and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) for conducting some Big Data Management activities. They connected to the Stampede supercomputer at TACC and/or to the Hopper supercomputer at NERSC. Then they learnt about the basic Linux commands and familiarized themselves with the user environment of the remote supercomputers. The workshop participants were provided a heterogeneous dataset to use during the hands-on exercises on metadata extraction and checksum calculation. They learnt about the basic protocols for file-transfer and practiced transferring data to/from Stampede and/or Hopper supercomputers. They were then given instructions on downloading and installing DROID, a tool for metadata extraction and file format identification. \n\n\nDuring the hackathon session at the workshop, the participants got an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during invited talks and hands-on sessions to propose solutions for the challenging test cases provided to them. \n\n\nIn addition to the invited talks, hands-on sessions, and the hackathon session, mentoring and networking sessions were also organized for the students supported through this project. These sessions were funded by workshop sponsors, and gave the students an opportunity to interact with the recruiters from national laboratories and discuss career options with them. The students learnt about the career possibilities in the areas of Big Data Management and HPC. \n\n\n\nThe feedback provided by the workshop participants indicates that all of them learnt something new at the workshop and that the workshop succeeded in achieving most of its goals. About 94.44% of the respondents to the post-workshop survey felt that the workshop provided enough information to further explore the TACC and XSEDE resources.\n\n\nA paper summarizing the project and the aforementioned workshop has been published and presented at the XSEDE15 conference, and is accessible through the ACM archive. The paper is titled as \"Connecting the Non-Traditional User-Community to the National CyberInfrastructure\".\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ritu Ritu"
