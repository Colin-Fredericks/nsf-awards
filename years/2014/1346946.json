 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an NSF/CBMS regional conference to be held at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, June 28 - July 2, 2014.  The conference focuses on understanding genetic relationships via the study of binary trees known as phylogenies. These trees are constructed by comparing nucleotide or protein sequence data which is then mathematically analyzed to find the tree which best reflects the differences among the genetic material. At the heart of these mathematical models are problems of interest to pure and applied mathematicians, statisticians, and operations researchers. The principal lecturer will be Dr. Mike Steel, Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, and cofounder and director of the university's Biomathematics Research Centre.  In additional to 10 primary lectures by Dr. Steel, four guest lecturers will present research and problems from related mathematical perspectives.\r\n\r\nHallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation through regional recruitment emphasis.  Funding is available for faculty from undergraduate institutions, graduate students, post-doctorates, and beginning researchers.  During this conference working groups will encourage collaboration, the development of resources, and the acquisition of new tangible research skills.",

Sequencing the genomes of various species has become significantly less expensive over time, allowing for more accessible opportunities for research at institutions of various sizes. Furthermore, the mathematical expertise needed to explore problems in this area have become of interest to researchers at various points in their careers in order to address important biological issues of mathematical complexity. Two related problems include a) the exploration of links between existing organisms and newly discovered ones and b) the relationships between and similarities of species through evolutionary time.\n\nThis conference featured a ten lecture series by the world's leading expert in the field, Dr. Mike Steel.  This series was supplemented by invited talks by international experts in phylogenetics from the perspectives of biology, statistics and computer science. \n\nFunding was aimed toward beginning researchers, women, minorities and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions in the southeast. Through the support of CBMS/NSF, fifty of the sixty conference participants received partial funding.  Due to the support, no registration fee was charged.  Most of the unfunded participants were local students and faculty who did not need housing or travel support.  While there was a strong regional theme to the participant group, Dr. Steel\u00c6s international appeal was clear, with visitors from seven different countries represented.\n\n\nRegional, national and international research collaborations were fostered through a series of working groups.  Lectures notes and materials have been made available through the conference website, and should help broaden the participation in this research area. The lecture notes will be more fully developed by the primary speaker and be published as a monograph by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  Moreover, a website was developed to host information about using phylogenetics as a tool in the undergraduate classroom. \n\n \n\nConference participants provided overwhelmingly positive feedback, and noted in particular that this conference truly enabled them to engaged in a new and exciting field of mathematics.  As a result we believe this event will have a lasting impact on the development of phylogenetics research in the region.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph P Rusinko"
