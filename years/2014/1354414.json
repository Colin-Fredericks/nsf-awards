 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the factors that govern the abundance and number of tree species in species-diverse wet tropical forests remains a major challenge in ecology. Complicating this challenge is the knowledge that tropical forests are expected to change as they become warmer and as rainfall patterns change. This long-term study of tropical forest biodiversity tackles this challenge by focusing on the important phases of a tree's life, including seed and seedling production by mature trees, the growth and survival of those seedlings, and the growth and survival of mature trees. The project extends a 13-year record of seedling and mature tree surveys in five forest stands in Costa Rica, with the goal of developing models of critical aspects of forest regeneration - seedling production, dispersal, growth, and survival - in response to light, soil nutrients, rainfall, and temperature. Tree life cycles are typically long, some species reproduce only once every 12 or more years, and many trees live for hundreds of years. The longer-term data collected as part of this study are therefore essential to capture a greater part of the tree life cycle and to span variation in weather conditions. The data and models resulting from the study will identify major mechanisms of species co-existence, helping to explain the unusually high diversity in tropical forests.\r\n\r\nImproved understanding of the factors that govern the abundance of tree species will aid in predicting forest responses to environmental changes, which is critical to timber production, wildlife habitat, and forest carbon storage. Results will also improve predictions of how some of the most diverse communities on the plant respond to warmer temperatures, reduced rainfall and increasing deposition of chemical pollutants. The project will educate and train students, make valuable long-term data publicly available, and promote science education of the general public through activities at Science Festivals and a website.",

During this time, we have provided new insights into how soil, light, and local density of trees drive the growth and survival of trees from seedlings to adults. Recently, we have been leveraging the time scale of our data to study the climate impacts on forest regeneration, growth, and development. Our data include (1) the emergence and survival every six weeks of seedlings in 1000 small field plots (1 meter x 1 meter) and (2) the yearly growth, survival, number of new individuals, and seed production of adult trees in five larger field plots (280 m x 80 m) at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.</p>\n<p>La Selva is a very wet place, receiving about 4000 mm (or 13 feet) of rain annually. However, there are occasional dry periods (especially from January to March), and these droughts have become more frequent and intense. Therefore, we have been able to capture how drought is affecting the mortality of mature trees, and we found that even mild drought was associated with increased mature tree mortality. Most tree species were negatively impacted by mild drought, and no species gained an advantage under drier conditions. Thus, under these recent changes in weather conditions, many tree species appear to be losing, and there is not a &lsquo;replacement species&rsquo; that is winning. These initial results raise more concerns about the future of wet tropical forests under a changing climate. Will some tree species be lost? Will these forests lose their ability to store tremendous amounts of carbon in forest biomass and keep that carbon out of the atmosphere?</p>\n<p>In contrast to mature trees, for tree seedlings of most species, mild drought can result in higher survivorship. We speculate that these less rainy periods allow more sunlight -- which is crucial for tree seedlings to survive -- to reach the heavily shaded forest floor. It also is possible that drier conditions reduce the abundance of fungal diseases that can kill seedlings in wetter conditions and hence mitigate &lsquo;seedling density&rsquo; effects. Numerous seedlings of the same species in a small plot result in higher seedling death rates, probably because seedlings pass along fungal diseases to their neighbors. Having a mix of species of tree seedlings in a plot does not result in higher mortality, likely because fungal diseases tend to specialize on different species of trees. We found that this &lsquo;seedling density&rsquo; effect of the same species had stronger impacts on mortality than soil nutrients and sunlight reaching the forest floor. Our findings on seedling survival raise further concern about the future of wet tropical forests. If the bigger trees are dying and the smaller trees seem to be thriving with mild drought, will we have shorter forests in the future, as some studies already suggest? If drought reduces the seedling density effect by decreasing fungal infections between trees of the same species, will we have less diverse tropical forests dominated by fewer species?</p>\n<p>We are looking further into these questions by measuring the production of seeds by mature trees, which is the first step in ensuring forest regeneration in the future. Although we did not find effects of soil nutrients on seed production, we found that bigger trees produce more seeds, and trees that live in more crowded neighborhoods produce fewer. The potential changes in the structure of the forest towards shorter sizes and more crowded and less diverse canopies caused by increased drought could affect seed production indirectly. In this project, we plan to study these indirect effects on seed production and the direct effects of precipitation and temperature.</p>\n<p>A better understanding of how climate change influences wet tropical forest regeneration, as well as mature tree survival, is important to ensure conservation and ecosystem services such as timber, fruits, and carbon storage. With this long-term data set, we will continue to gain a better understanding of how wet tropical forests work and find new leads on how tropical forests will appear in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Richard&nbsp;K&nbsp;Kobe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1354414/1354414_10292210_1666286344172_ademarusingtapetomeasurediameteronbigdipteryxint5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1354414/1354414_10292210_1666286344172_ademarusingtapetomeasurediameteronbigdipteryxint5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Measuring diameter of a large tree\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1354414/1354414_10292210_1666286344172_ademarusingtapetomeasurediameteronbigdipteryxint5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Measuring diameter of a large tree\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">To get an accurate measure of diameter, it is necessary to use a ladder to measure above the tree buttresses.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Richard Kobe</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Richard&nbsp;K&nbsp;Kobe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Measuring diameter of a large tree</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1354414/1354414_10292210_1666286527173_VitexcooperiStandl.(Verbenaceae)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1354414/1354414_10292210_1666286527173_VitexcooperiStandl.(Verbenaceae)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Vitex cooperi seedling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1354414/1354414_10292210_1666286527173_VitexcooperiStandl.(Verbenaceae)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Vitex cooperi seedling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A seedling of Vitex cooperi found in one of our small plots</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ademar Hurtado</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Richard&nbsp;K&nbsp;Kobe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Vitex cooperi seedling</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
