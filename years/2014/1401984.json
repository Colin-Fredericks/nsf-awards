 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. \r\n\r\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland.  It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering these Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson.  One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work carried out within this project will focus on the analysis of data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of beyond the Standard Model physics. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nSome of the search targets are mentioned in this paragraph.  A discovery of leptoquarks would provide a link between the quark sector and the lepton sectors and help to explain why both sectors contain three generations of matter. Detection of substantial invisible decays of the Higgs boson would answer important questions about the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Invisible decays of the Higgs are a signature of various beyond the standard model physics theories. In these, the Higgs can interact with new heavy particles which decay into particles that are usually not detected by the experiment (like neutrinos). Limits on the invisible decay rate of the Higgs boson also provide constraints on models of Dark Matter. The proposed studies also include measurements of the differential cross section measurements of Standard Model processes, such as ZZ production, and W+jets production, that have sensitivity to new physics. These studies are tightly coupled with the new physics searches because the processes they measure are important backgrounds to the specific searches targeted. The presence of a signal in any of these channels would have profound impact on our understanding of particle physics, while establishing its absence would provide important constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nWith the strong cooperative education program at Northeastern University, the group will continue to routinely involve undergraduates in meaningful six-month projects at CERN. The PIs will also continue their involvement with the Boston Area QuarkNet group (now in its 14th year) where they are able to reach out to local high school teachers and their students. The group members also share the excitement and knowledge of the discoveries and results with the broader public through lectures and presentations to audiences outside of particle physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur group from Northeastern University used the data from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to study the most fundamental interactions of particles at the smallest distance scales.  One of the exciting possibilities at the LHC is the creation of new particles that have not been observed before.  Our group focused on searching for two interesting categories of new particles: leptoquarks and dark matter. We have also worked on improving the muon detection system of the CMS detector to make future measurements and searches even more sensitive.\n\nLeptoquarks, if they exist, could provide a connection between quarks (the building blocks of hadrons like protons and neutrons) and leptons (particles like electrons and neutrinos).  We can search for leptoquarks at the LHC by looking for muons, for example, that are produced together with jets of hadrons that result from high energy quarks.\n\nDark matter particles would help us explain why clusters of galaxies move as if there is much more mass than the known mass of stars, dust, and planets.  The rotational movement of galaxies and other astronomical evidence convince us that there is an abundant for of matter that exerts gravitational force on ordinary matter, but otherwise interacts so weakly as to be invisible. There are many approaches to searching for the constituents of dark matter, and we concentrated on searching for \"mono-Z\" events with a well-known particle called a Z boson produced together with undetected dark matter.\n\nIn 2015, the LHC began operations at an energy of 13 TeV, nearly twice the energy that was used in the successful search for the Higgs boson.  Because of Einstein?s relation between mass and energy, E=mc2, a higher energy makes it possible to produce particles with larger masses.  Because the masses of leptoquarks are unknown, the new data presented us with the opportunity test hypotheses with larger masses.  No evidence for leptoquarks was found, but we were able to eliminate the possibilities of up to masses 1,000 times the mass of the proton. \n\nFor dark matter, we were able to use the higher energy of the LHC to search for unknown particles that could be the mediator between ordinary matter and dark matter.  The fact that these particles are very massive would make them difficult to produce, and thus account for the very feeble nature of the interaction.  By showing that we did not have an excess of mono-Z events, we were able to exclude these mediator particles up to a mass of about 250 times the proton mass.\n\nIn order to find new particle and phenomena, we need to understand very well the production and decay of known particles.  In the leptoquarks searches, we found it essential to accurately predict the production of W bosons and jets of hadrons.  In the standard model of particle physics, these events are expected to be quite common, but the theoretical predictions are not precise enough for our purposes.  Consequently, we pursued a detailed study of W bosons with jets and characterized the rates as well as the numbers of jets, their energies and angles. The completed measurements were entered into a data bank that is used by both theoretical and experimental physicists to calculate more precise predictions.\n\nMost of the processes we wish to study at the LHC are very rare.  For example, it took billions of collisions to get a handful of events that established the existence of the Higgs boson. To be able to find even rarer particles in the future, the LHC will be upgraded to run at about five times the intensity it does now.  This will put unprecedented demands on the detectors, and in particular on the electronics system that reads out the detectors.  We studied how to improve the electronics of the CMS muon detection system and described this in a technical design report.  When this plan is carried out, it will ensure the efficient performance of the CMS muon system in this future high-intensity era.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Darien R Wood"
