 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is building on prior work (DUE-0735655) that produced OrganicPad, a free form, interactive, tablet-PC-based chemical structure drawing program. The PIs are  developing SocraticGraphs - a web-based, cross platform system that recognizes student free-form input and provides tiered levels of contextual, \"Socratic\" feedback and support for learners as they construct graphical representations without the constraints usually imposed by computer based assessment and tutorial systems. SocraticGraphs provides a unique graphics-based interactive learning system designed to i) recognize and respond to student actions in a naturalistic manner and ii) facilitate studies on how students come to understand of scientific concepts, develop analytical representations and re-express and interpret data. This system is applicable to a wide range of disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, mathematics, and engineering. \r\nThe design of each activity is guided by preliminary research using pencil and paper tutorials, student interviews and direct observations of students as they work through preliminary versions of the on-line materials. The PIs are developing a range of activities in chemistry, physics and molecular biology, each of which will probe and respond with contextual Socratic feedback. The data from student responses are recorded and stored in a database for analysis using a number of data-mining techniques including Hidden Markov Modeling and Artificial Neural Nets. Ultimately, the project is providing activities that respond to student free-form input \"on the fly\" with the aim of developing analytical thinking skills and a robust and rigorous understanding of scientific phenomena.",
