 "awd_abstract_narration": "GeoPRISMS program that conducts interdisciplinary activities that integrate the Earth and Ocean Sciences communities. The overarching themes of research are 1) the origin and evolution of the continental crust; 2) fluids, melts and their interactions; 3) tectonic-sediment-climate interactions; 4) geochemical cycles; and 5) plate boundary deformation and geodynamics. The guiding principles to study these main themes are 1) the use of interdisciplinary communities; 2) the study of active systems; 3) use of experiment, theory and computation; 4) crossing the shorelines; and 5) use of focus sites. Research at the main initiatives (Rift Initiation and Evolution; Subduction Cycles and Deformation) combine large scale amphibious deployments and smaller marine or terrestrial field studies at Cascadia, Eastern US, Alaska-Aleutians, East Africa and New Zealand. The field studies are augmented with thematic and global studies. \r\n\r\nFunds are provided for the GeoPRISMS Office including deliberations of a Steering and Oversight Committee and an Education Advisory committee. The Office will  provide structure for the GeoPRISMS community to facilitate community planning, organizes planning and synthesis meetings, and supports the community management structure by organizing meetings of the steering and educational committees. The Office will also support education and outreach activities, provides direct links between the GeoPRISMS community and national infrastructure facilities (such as EarthScope), and facilitates international collaboration.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe office will provide a central vehicle for the dissemination of the planning, execution, and documentation of the main scientific projects.  The Office will also provide outreach to scientists working in hazards and economical resources and promote  teaching, training, and learning through its education and outreach activities that include a distinguished lecturer program, mini-lessons and webinars, a student and community forum, a postdoctoral fellowship program, and graduate student symposia that are held during GeoPRISMS workshops.",
