Access to high-quality content and sequencing that content remain to be two of the main challenges.  This team has developed a technology that has the potential of becoming every teacher's assistant and help them develop their instructional plans, collaborate with their peers and experts, access high quality instructional/educational resources, receive mentoring, and connect their students/parents to educational resources that can be used at home.\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology \"CPALMS\" is a K-12 educator portal that includes 16 web-based apps for curriculum planning, collaboration, and professional development. In particular, a curriculum mapping (CMap) tool was developed to guide and assist districts, schools, and teachers in developing interactive, detailed curriculum plans and connect them with thousands of high quality and vetted instructional resources to help them implement the curriculum standards (e.g., Common Core State Standards). This tool provides smart recommendations for instructional/educational resources based on the teacher's plans and timeline. This portal was developed by an NSF grant which aimed to get four school districts in Florida to pilot the portal.",
