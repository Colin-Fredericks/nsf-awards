 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long sought to understand how species reshuffle into novel ecological communities during periods of major environmental change, and the consequences of this reshuffling for the services that those ecological communities provide for human society. This project capitalizes on a major historical event - massive changes in plant communities roughly 17,000 years ago - to determine the relative roles that climate change, species interactions, and fire played in the creation of novel communities. Results from this research will inform contemporary debates about the potential for climate change to create 'no analog' communities that differ fundamentally in their structure, function, and the services they provide to society.  They will also guide management practices intended to restore communities to prior states and improve our understanding of the consequences of widespread extinctions.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on prior evidence that plant communities changed dramatically during the last deglaciation because the extinction of large grazers released plants from herbivore suppression. New research will test the novel Megafaunal Release Hypothesis by assessing the relative importance of climate and species interactions on vegetation and fire dynamics. The investigators will collect and analyze a series of lake-sediment cores in the eastern US, and quantify relationships among independent climatic and ecological proxies within and across sites in order to test the Megafaunal Release Hypothesis. Eight new lake sites will be analyzed for indicators of past vegetation composition (fossil pollen), fire regime (sedimentary charcoal), megafaunal abundance (spores from fungi found in dung), and temperature (organic geochemistry). Broader impacts include the mentoring and training of a postdoctoral research scientist, a graduate student, and several undergraduates, and the expansion of collaborations among paleontologists, geographers, and ecologists to understand future environmental change.  All data will be made publicly available through standard community data repositories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe end of the last ice age, 19,000 to 8,000 years ago, was the last period of major environmental change prior to the Industrial Revolution, with several similarities to current environmental trends.  During the last deglaciation, temperatures rose globally by 3 to 4&deg;C, the ice sheets covering much of North America melted, sea level rose by roughly 110 meters, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations rose.  Humans arrived in the Americas, plant ranges shifted by 100s to 1000s of kilometers, ?no-analog? communities formed that contained mixtures of species not found at present, and many large animals died out.  These changes have made the last ice age an important model system for understanding how species and ecosystems adapt to large environmental change.\n\nThe specific goal of this research project was to better understand the mechanisms governing the large changes in plant ranges and the formation of ?no-analog? plant communities in the eastern US during the last deglaciation.  A key challenge was to disentangle the effects of rising temperatures, changes in fire frequency, and the loss of keystone large herbivores such as mammoths and mastodons on plant communities.  The project design was to collect a series of lake-sediment cores from a network of sites in the southern Great Lakes (IN, OH, PA) and southeastern US (MO, GA, SC, FL) and analyze these sediments for multiple signals of past environmental and ecological change:  fossil pollen as signals of plant species abundances and distributions; counts of charcoal pieces as indicators of past fire events and frequency; spores from dung fungi as indicators of large herbivores; and organic geochemical indicators of past temperatures (using a set of compounds called brGDGTs).  The timing of past events was estimated based on radiocarbon dates of plant fossils from the sediments.  This multi-site, multi-signal study was designed to test causal hypotheses through analysis of environmental and ecological events within and across sites.\n\nWe collected lake sediment cores from seven new sites:  Stotzel-Leis, OH, Bonnet Lake, OH, Triangle Lake Bog, OH, Hidden Lake, PA, Sheelar Lake, FL, Quicksand Pond, GA, and White Pond, SC.  All sites were radiocarbon dated and analyzed for fossil pollen and charcoal and four (Stotzel-Leis, Bonnet, Sheelar, White) were analyzed for brGDGT temperature reconstructions.  We also generated new temperature reconstructions for two previously cored sites:  Cupola Pond, MO and Silver Lake, OH.  The large network of sites, the multiple signals of past environmental and ecological dating, and improved age estimates are all important advances of this study.  The north-central records provide continuous environmental histories back to ca. 17,000 years ago and several of the southeastern records are 30,000 years ago. \n\nThe new reconstructions demonstrate that deglacial temperature variations in the north-central US were similar to but larger than reported elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.  However, temperature variations in the southeastern US followed different trends, sometimes warming while sites in the north cooled. This complex spatial pattern may provide new insights into the drivers of deglacial climate change and abrupt climate change.  Vegetation changes track temperature variations at all sites, suggesting that temperatures were an important driver of past changes in tree distributions and abundances.  Additionally, the brGDGT-based estimates of past temperature variations agree well with independently calculated temperature estimates based on fossil pollen records.  This agreement lends support to both methods and also supports underlying assumptions that ecological communities are sensitive to and respond quickly to temperature variations.  At some sites in the north-central US, abrupt losses of spruce forests and woodlands correspond to periods of frequent fire, suggesting that frequent fire can catalyze abrupt vegetation change.  This sensitivity to rising temperature and frequent fire is relevant for current concerns about the possibility of widespread conversion of contemporary conifer forests in the western and northern US, due to the combination of rising temperatures and intensified fire regimes.\n\nThe role of the large herbivore extinctions on past plant communities is being assessed in a paper that is in preparation.  Most sites show declines in dung fungal spores, indicating that these lake sedimentary archives do capture signals of these biodiversity losses.\n\nThis work has helped support the next generation of scientists through the support and training of three postdoctoral research scholars, one research associate, three graduate students, and twelve undergraduate students.  Of these nineteen early-career scientists, twelve were women.  Two undergraduates participated in UW-Madison?s Integrated Biological Sciences? Summer Research Program, designed to help prepare students from underrepresented populations for careers in science and technology.  To date, three Masters theses, three undergraduate honors theses, five peer-reviewed publications, and one book chapter were supported by this work.  The publications to date have presented detailed environmental reconstructions for individual sites, and several papers are in preparation that both present regional syntheses of past environmental change and discuss implications for the present.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John W Williams"
