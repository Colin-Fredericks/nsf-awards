 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large of body of research suggests that two-way interactions between plants and soils, known as plant-soil feedbacks, have major effects on the abundance and distribution of plant species, and that soil bacteria and fungi are largely responsible. This project will provide a large-scale test of these important hypotheses. Plant-soil feedbacks will be measured in a large set of plant species at sites with ongoing, long-term experiments on plant diversity and productivity. The combined data will be used to construct models that relate feedbacks to productivity. Linked genetic studies will help identify the specific microbes that drive feedbacks. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include extensive training of students and outreach to K-12 education, and clear applications to agriculture. The project plans to train many undergraduate students, two Ph.D. students, and numerous high school students. The research has relevance to food production and food security because it is expected to identify key beneficial and harmful microbes and thus improve our understanding of how soil microbes can be used to manage crop growth.",
