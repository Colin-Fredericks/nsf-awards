 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) Technology Translation (TT) project focuses on translating fluidized bed impregnation technology to improve manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. This technology is important because pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are manufactured primarily by an inefficient process, which involves blending drug crystals called the API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) with inactive filler powders (called excipients).  The resulting mixture of powders is then further processed and fed into capsules or compressed to make tablets. During blending, it is difficult to make sure that the correct amount of the API is distributed throughout the excipient powders. During subsequent processing of the powder mixture it is challenging to keep the mixture mixed and prevent the excipients from segregating or flowing to different regions from the API. This is a particular challenge for low dose pharmaceuticals. If there is segregation or inadequate blending, it can lead to tablets or capsules with too much or too little drug substance. The resulting out-of-spec tablets and capsules must then be discarded. This project will result in a prototype of fluidized bed impregnation technology for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.  This technology has the following unique features:  the impregnation of porous excipients with a solution containing the API and subsequent drying to produce excipients uniformly impregnated with the API. The excipients impregnated with the API can then be fed into capsules or compressed into tablets without concern for de-mixing or segregation of the API and excipients since the API is now present in the pores of the excipients. These features provide advantages of improved product quality and reductions in out-of-spec product when compared to the usual method of blending API crystals with excipients for making pharmaceuticals. \r\n \r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application:  1) For very potent drugs, the amount of API in the solid dosage form can vary from 1% to 0.1% by weight. These very low API loadings pose one of the biggest challenges in pharmaceutical product development: the control of dose uniformity. Low API content variability is highly desired and strictly enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 2) Another challenge in product development is that a large fraction of newly discovered drug compounds have poor solubility which subsequently affects their bioavailability. 3) Another important aspect of pharmaceutical process development is the final product cost. As pharmaceutical companies strive to develop more affordable drugs, any possible elimination of lengthy and expensive unit operations becomes commercially advantageous.  Fluidized bed impregnation of APIs onto porous excipients can potentially address all of the above challenges in drug substance and product development by improving dose uniformity, enhancing bioavailability and reducing the number of manufacturing steps. In addition, personnel involved in this project, graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through specific training that will address these topics and by being involved with the commercialization of the technology.",

A large proportion of all prescription drugs are manufactured as solid dosage forms, which includes tablets and capsules.

An important aspect of pharmaceutical process development is the final product cost. As pharmaceutical companies strive to develop more affordable drugs, any possible elimination of lengthy and expensive unit operations becomes commercially advantageous. One group of such unit operations is associated with the control of API attributes (size, size distribution, shape, bulk density, etc.). These unit operations can include crystallization control and various milling and de-lumping steps. The need for control of API attributes is solely dictated by the drug product development and usually is associated with desired improvements in blend uniformity or release profile. Having a formulation process that can make these and other steps unnecessary can potentially provide a large advantage to pharmaceutical companies. This project has examined a manufacturing method for solid dosage forms using fluidized bed impregnation of APIs onto porous excipients that can potentially address all of the above challenges in drug substance and product development.&nbsp; Fluidized bed impregnation can be summarized as the combination of three distinct processes taking place simultaneously. These include fluidization of the porous carrier, spraying API solution within the bed, which penetrates the excipient due to capillary forces, and drying of the porous particles causing the API to be deposited within. We have shown that this process can deliver final product with high blend uniformity, and final API loading is not limited by its solubility in the organic solvent. Fluidized bed impregnation by design does not depend on the nature of the API but rather on the nature of the excipient used. The product is an excipient impregnated with API that has flow properties that depend on the excipient and not on the physical properties of the API. In this project we have demonstrated an integrated technology for fluidized bed impregnation that is designed and optimized based on an in-depth understanding of the main components of the manufacturing system.
