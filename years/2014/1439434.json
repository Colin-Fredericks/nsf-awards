 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stereolithography and 3-D printing are examples of emerging technologies that are revolutionizing prototyping and manufacturing. These technologies not only allow consumers to fabricate custom products on demand but also present ways for the military, NASA, medical providers and others to solve problems in the field. These rapid fabrication procedures employ polymer materials which are typically generated from petroleum. As these technologies become more commonplace it will be important to find alternative and sustainable ways to produce the input materials required.  This I-Corps proposal is designed to analyze the market potential for manufacturing polymers generated from agricultural waste residues.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps proposal is designed to analyze the market potential for manufacturing polymers generated by microbial biocatalysts from agricultural waste residues. Research by others and the team has revealed unique metabolic capabilities of non-traditional yeast. The team has identified pathways that will allow a percentage of the metabolic flux to be diverted to produce specific high value polymers. The proposed technology platform, which is built around abundant monomers and takes advantage of readily available inexpensive substrates, has potential for cost-effective production of value added chemicals and materials. The technology developed by the team will expand the understanding of how environmental resources can be better used.",
