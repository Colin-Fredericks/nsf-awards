 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in MCB and the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program in CBET, is part of a larger ERASynBio funded collaborative. The team of investigators will develop the rules that govern the design of complex nanometer scale structures made from nucleic acids and polypeptides, and use those rules to create new biological molecules that have never been seen before in nature.  They will also develop the tools that will enable the assembly of these new materials that could potentially be used to control many aspects of cell function, or create new materials that could be used as sensors or in biomanufacturing.\r\n\r\nTechnical: Biological organisms are capable of producing chemicals, materials and molecular machines that far exceed our engineering capabilities. Underlying these abilities are the unique properties of proteins, exquisitely evolved for function, allowing precise positioning of atoms and chemistries. Designing novel proteins is difficult because of our still incomplete understanding of how proteins fold for a given primary amino-acid sequence. In this project, researchers will apply principles of synthetic biology to define and modularize building blocks that can be combined in rational ways to enable control of 3D positioning in designed macromolecular structure. Members of the consortium have advanced design and engineering principles for polypeptide- and DNA-based nanostructures and developed next-generation gene synthesis to facilitate high-throughput approaches.  The team will build on these foundations to engineer bio-macromolecular assemblies with shapes and functions of unprecedented complexity. They will deliver an expanded toolbox of polypeptide building elements; rules, design principles and methods for constructing complex bionanostructures; and routes to nucleic acid/ polypeptide-hybrid platforms for the community of synthetic biology. The project will expand the limits of the designed polypeptide and nucleic acid/protein hybrid providing a platform to facilitate their use in a wide range of biomanufacturing applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  \nThe overarching goal of this project was to advance biomolecular design and self-assembly capabilities beyond the protein building blocks present in nature, by engineering specificity into protein-protein interactions.  The project was intended to be highly iterative, with each round of experimental results being used to further improve the theory and computational methodology. During the lifetime of this award, we produced a series of self-assembling protein homo- and hetero- oligomers, and demonstrated their high interaction specificity. \nWe have developed a robust computational method for designing hydrogen bond networks, which enables new ways of designing specificity, and also allows for the design of larger protein-protein interfaces.  Previous attempts to design larger coiled-coil topologies failed due to large hydrophobic regions at the intermolecular interface, leading to issues of solubility and non-specific aggregation.  Designing in hydrogen bond networks has rescued these topologies, and we have significantly expanded the number of topologies of de novo coiled-coils we can successfully design; new \"two-ring\" (inner ring of helices, with an outer ring of helices around them) coiled-coil topologies have larger interface area, allowing for design space to engineer in specificity, as well as increased thermostability of the resulting complexes. We have successfully designed two-ring homo-dimers (parallel and antiparallel), trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers.  In addition, we have successfully designed two-ring hetero-dimers, and solved two structures by nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. From this set of six heterodimers, we demonstrated that five of them are orthogonal to each other using native mass spectrometry. Lastly, we successfully designed and verified two-ring hetero-trimers using native mass spectrometry. Increasing the types and numbers of building blocks expands the possibility of the larger, more complex, topologies that can be designed by these efforts, which is essential to make the large protein assemblies.  \n\nThe method for designing hydrogen bond networks developed during this project will improve our understanding of self-assembly and bioorthoganality, which have implications for disciplines ranging from molecular biology and synthetic biology, to materials engineering and chemical engineering.  The nanoscale building blocks yielded by these efforts will also have wide-ranging impact on any discipline that aims to control matter at the nanometer scale.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Baker"
