 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating our newly-developed upconversion inks and associated printing techniques into a complete system for printing, reading, and decoding covert markings that exhibit full red-green-blue (RGB) additive color upconversion luminescence upon excitation with near-infrared (NIR) light.  This system will constitute a new anti-counterfeiting and authentication technology to fill the need for fighting the staggering counterfeiting and intellectual-property losses suffered across a broad range of industries.   The project will result in a prototype of a complete Print-Read-Decode system for RGB upconverting inks.  This Print-Read-Decode system will have the following unique features: it will be based on inks activated with nanocrystals which are responsible for the upconversion luminescence; the covert markings are invisible under ambient and UV lighting, and only become visible under NIR light; it will be based on the only known print system demonstrated to fill the RGB color space using upconversion luminescence; and it will be a closed-loop system, in which the entire system, from printing, to encoding, to reading and decoding will be included within one system. These features provide advantages when compared to the leading competing security inks and marking systems due to increased difficulty to counterfeit. Specifically, the ability to replicate would require reproduction of not only the inks (which are intrinsically difficult to reproduce), but of the entire system. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, the development of a cyber-enabled, integrated reader; and adaptation of the current ink formulations to accommodate industry-friendly equipment and processes.  The project engages Midwest Micro-Tek in Brookings, SD to augment its research capabilities and to provide a suitable test environment in this technology translation effort.\r\n\r\nThe Print-Read-Decode prototype for RGB upconverting inks is important because counterfeit goods cost U.S. businesses $200-$250 billion annually, and are directly responsible for the loss of 750,000 American jobs. Beyond the dollar costs, counterfeit drugs are a proven danger to public health and safety. Counterfeit integrated circuits and electronic components are a threat to the full functionality of national defense systems. In addition, the economic impact of the $2 billion mass serialization track-and-trace market is predicted to expand to $75 billion in less than three years. Success in combating counterfeiting will require numerous creative approaches; a single market-dominant anti-counterfeiting technology seems unrealistic and even dangerous. If the proposed system captures a mere one percent of the predicted market within three years, the economic impact would be $750,000,000.",
