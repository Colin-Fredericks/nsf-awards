 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change in the Antarctic, along with its several global consequences (e.g. sea-level rise associated with surface mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet) are often attributed in terms of rising greenhouse-gas (GHG) forcing. Ozone, especially that residing in the stratosphere, is another radiatively important gas whose past anthropogenic depletion also has climate consequences e.g. intensification of the polar night jet during spring. GHG concentrations will continue to rise over the remainder of this century, whereas stratospheric ozone is expected to recover, following the Montreal Protocol, leaving some uncertainty in the resulting circulation trends in the Southern Hemisphere. \r\n\r\nLinkages between ozone change and four aspects of Antarctic climate namely: i) Antarctic surface temperatures, ii) cloud cover, iii) sea-ice and ice-sheet mass balance will be investigated by a series of earth systems model experiments.  Two different types of models will be utilized, the first being a coupled chemistry-climate model, the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). The second will be a stand-alone ice sheet model, the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), which will be forced with the atmospheric fields from the WACCM runs. Simulations that only vary atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) amounts will further permit comparison between future ozone and GHG climate effects. \r\n\r\nThese large scale climate effects are also of direct societal and economic interest. Antarctic climate and environmental change has far reaching impacts through its ties to biogeochemical cycling of carbon, ocean circulation and global sea level rise. The latter are highly relevant to society, and thus understanding the causes of Antarctic climate change",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nClimate and environmental change over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean has far-reaching impacts through its ties to biogeochemical cycling, ocean circulation and global sea-level rise.  The latter are highly relevant to society, and thus understanding the causes of Antarctic climate change is of paramount importance.  The work that we have done in this project has served to enhance scientific understanding of how Antarctic climate responds to stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery.  Additionally, we have identified significant biases in climate model simulations of Antarctic climate that can potentially serve as a useful target for improving models and thus refining future projections.  Finally, our work has placed stronger constraints on the relative roles of anthropogenic forcing and internal climate variability in driving observed Antarctic change over recent decades.\n\nOur investigation into stratospheric ozone effects on Antarctic climate has focused primarily on the effects on surface temperature and surface mass balance (i.e., net snow accumulation).  We showed that stratospheric ozone depletion in the late twentieth century likely played a negligible role in driving Antarctic surface temperature trends on a continental scale, despite large ozone-induced increases in the surface downwelling solar radiation over the ice sheet.  The mechanism responsible for this lack of temperature response is rather simple: reflection of the enhanced solar radiation by the bright Antarctic surface.  Similarly, we found that the impact of stratospheric ozone changes on Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) is also likely to be small on a continental scale.  In contrast, however, the associated changes in atmospheric ozone-depleting substances (ODSs, such as CFCs) were found to exert a large impact, with SMB increasing in response to increases in ODS concentrations.  This implies that the Montreal Protocol, with its stipulated phase-out of ODS emissions, will act to decrease the Antarctic SMB and thus mitigate global sea-level rise over the next several decades.\n\nOur work in this project has also identified significant biases in climate model simulations of the present-day Antarctic climate.  Specifically, we have documented excessive amounts of absorbed solar radiation in the Antarctic region during summer that are due mainly to errors in the models? surface albedo (or surface reflectivity).  This offers a clear target for improving models (e.g., by incorporating more realistic albedo representations) and thereby narrowing the uncertainty in future climate change projections.\n\nFinally, we have assessed the relative roles of anthropogenic forcing and internal climate variability in driving recently observed changes in Antarctic surface temperature and SMB.  Our results suggest an important role for internal variability in producing the observed pattern of Antarctic temperature change over recent decades, which is marked by annually-averaged warming of the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica and very small changes over East Antarctica.  For the Antarctic SMB, observations indicate that there has been no significant change over the past several decades despite expectations from models that the SMB should increase in response to rising greenhouse gases.  We showed that this apparent discrepancy between models and observations can be explained by the fact that the anthropogenic climate change signal during the second half of the twentieth century is small compared to the noise associated with internal climate variability.  The implication of this is that the forced SMB increase due to global warming in recent decades is unlikely to be detectable in the observations.  Our analysis revealed, however, that the anthropogenic impact on Antarctic SMB is very likely to emerge from internal variability by the middle of the current century.\n\nIn summary, the results from this project will enhance our ability to interpret past observed Antarctic changes, and will lead to more confident projections of the changes yet to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Previdi"
