 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on estimating the environmental cost of transportation-based accessibility.  Accessibility is a central concept in transportation science, planning, and engineering.  Accessibility refers to an individual's potential mobility and interactivity within a given geographic setting using transportation and communications technologies.  Transportation scientists, planners, and engineers have a well-developed theory and methodology for measuring transportation-based accessibility:  the space-time prism (STP), which is the envelope of an individual's possible travel paths between two geographic locations given limits on available time and travel speeds.  The STP measures how well a transportation system provides mobility options that connect people to places they might want to go.  Scholars have not considered the environmental costs of this potential mobility, however.  Estimating the resource cost of actual mobility involves monitoring the resource consumption and/or emissions of a vehicle as it moves through geographic space.  Calculating the environmental costs of a STP is difficult, however, because there are many potential paths, but only one will actually occur.  This research project will extend the STP to include the environmental costs of accessibility.  The investigators will improve theoretical understanding of the STP by developing methods for estimating the distribution of potential paths within the prism interior.  They will develop practical measures of expected mobility costs for prisms in both continuous space and transportation networks, and they will evaluate the expected cost measures using empirical mobility data.  They will develop geographic information system (GIS) software for applying prism benefit/cost measures in transportation planning and project evaluation, including a usability evaluation involving practicing transportation planners.  Finally, they will create a framework for deploying STP cost/benefit measures in federally mandated transportation planning documents.\r\n\r\nThis project will substantially advance scientific knowledge about human accessibility, a fundamental concept in transportation science, planning, and engineering as well as in other social and behavioral sciences.  This interdisciplinary project will link fundamental concepts in the human sciences (accessibility) and physical science and engineering (resource consumption and waste emissions) with modern transportation planning practice, creating new transdisciplinary opportunities.  Graduate and undergraduate students from geography, urban planning, and transportation engineering will be engaged in research that is relevant to basic scientific understanding as well as to a critical, real-world problem.  The project will have potentially transformative effects on transportation as well as urban and sustainability science and planning. The extension of accessibility theory to environmental science will challenge the assumption in transportation science and planning that greater accessibility is a generally unmitigated benefit to individuals and society, thereby helping generate more nuanced and sophisticated approaches to the analysis, planning, and management of complex human-physical systems like transportation and cities.",

<em>Accessibility</em>&nbsp;is the ability to reach opportunities and resources within a given environment. &nbsp; Transportation scientists, planners and engineers have a well-developed method for measuring transportation-based accessibility:&nbsp; the <em>space-time prism</em> (STP) and <em>network time prism </em>(NTP). &nbsp;A STP measures the region in geographic space and time that a person can travel given a travel origin and destination (the <em>prism anchors</em>), a <em>time budget</em>&nbsp;based on the origin departure time and the destination arrival time, any stationary <em>activity time</em>&nbsp;(e.g., stopping to shop or have a coffee)&nbsp; and the maximum speed for travel. &nbsp; The STP is the envelope of all possible paths with respect to time between the origin and destination given these constraints. &nbsp;Figure 1 illustrates a STP in two-dimensional space and time. &nbsp;A <em>network time prism</em>&nbsp;(NTP) is the extension of a STP to transportation networks, accounting for the geometry and varying speed limits within the network. &nbsp;Figure 2 illustrates a NTP defined within a small transportation network in two dimensional space and time. &nbsp; We can define STPs and NTPs for individuals or for social&nbsp;groups&nbsp;with similar activity patterns and constraints, allowing planners&nbsp;to assess the varying&nbsp;accessibility levels afforded by&nbsp;a new transportation plan, policy or investment&nbsp;within a neighborhood, city or region.</p>\n<p>STPs and NTPs are important for assessing the performance and equity of a transportation system and for guiding new transportation plans, policies and investments. &nbsp;These measures assume that bigger prisms, indicating more accessibility, is better for individuals. &nbsp;While this is true, no one has considered the broader environmental costs of accessibility, such as resource consumption and emissions from vehicles. &nbsp;This is a tricky problem. &nbsp;Estimating the resource cost of <em>actual</em> mobility is straightforward: record the resource consumption and/or emissions of a vehicle as it travels.&nbsp; However,

&nbsp;Our testbed is Phoenix, Arizona, USA. &nbsp;Figure 3 shows estimated movement probabilities and expected speed distribution for a NTP defined within the Phoenix road network based on a travel origin (Arizona State University campus), a destination (Scottsdale Fashion Mall), a time budget for travel (25 minutes) and secondary data from a local ridesharing service to capture realistic travel

The products are the expected CO2 emissions for the NTP overall, as well as the distribution of emissions over space with respect to time. &nbsp;Figure 4 illustrates the expected CO2 emissions for the

accessibility versus expected emissions. &nbsp;For example, we can test changes in speed limits or congestion mitigation technologies such as smart vehicles. &nbsp;For example, Figure 5 compares the estimated baseline CO2 emissions for the Phoenix NTP with two scenarios: a 20% increase in mobility levels versus 20% decrease through changes in congestion mitigation strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of this project, we also developed a new method for matching global positioning system&nbsp;(GPS) trajectory data to transportation networks and a new method for designing transportation networks to maximize accessibility. &nbsp;We also conducted empirical analysis of strategic planning documents for metropolitan planning organizations in the United States to assess how much they emphasize accessibility. &nbsp;We also compared their accessibility orientation with the levels of vehicle miles traveled within their regions, finding that an emphasis on mobility instead of accessibility leads to more vehicle miles traveled. &nbsp;This analysis suggests several strategies to integrate accessibility tools such as our NTP emissions tools into transportation planning practice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harvey&nbsp;J&nbsp;Miller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
