 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Application-Based Curriculum in Advanced Manufacturing (IACAM) project prepares students with integrated-manufacturing skills and enables them to meet 21st century workplace competency requirements. The project is developing an Integrated Manufacturing Technician curriculum model, creating a 'real-world' manufacturing-environment learning-lab, to provide development opportunities for college faculty through mentoring opportunities with secondary school teachers and guidance counselors who are working together to gain a better understanding of manufacturing technician needs. \r\n\r\nThe curriculum model features a student-centered program, which recruits, retains, and facilitates program completion, and tracks and measures enrollment, completion, and placement data. Students are advancing through their educational pathways by finishing courses, completing certificates, earning associate degrees, and achieving a transfer option into a bachelor's degree program. Within the curriculum, students begin by studying specialized machines performing complex tasks; electricity's role as the single largest provider of power; and controlling, collecting, processing, distributing and storing critical information about machines and processes. The automation's role is taught through integrating of Programmable Logic Controllers, computer networking systems, and robots. Teaching these skills is facilitated through integrated, applied projects-based and real-life knowledge and experience of employers and faculty. Intellectual merits are rooted in the comprehensive and integrated nature of the curriculum that is to bring all stakeholders together.  \r\n\r\nProject materials and results, including student learning outcomes, are being disseminated through presentations at state and national conferences, through the College website, and through mainstream media advertising. Broader impacts are evidenced in the dissemination efforts and appropriate training of the workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Integrated, Applications-Based Curriculum in Advanced Manufacturing (IACAM) certificate promotes interest in science and engineering among secondary education students and unemployed or under-employed adults, specifically in disciplines relating to advanced manufacturing.  The disparity between qualified technicians entering the workforce and the demand for them continues to widen.  As qualified technicians continue to retire, technology brings progressively more automation into every aspect of manufacturing.  A general lack of interest and understanding of career opportunities in skilled-trades has resulted in a deficit of qualified technicians as the demand for them continues to increase.\n\nAn IACAM certificate is composed of a set of core courses common to the mechanical, electrical, manufacturing and robotics curricula.  A student with an interest in any one of these disciplines would achieve credentials common to all of them, reflecting a general competence leading to entry-level employment in a technical field, specifically advanced manufacturing.\n\nInitial academic advising of students in any of the four IACAM disciplines underscores the IACAM certificate as a \"generalist?s\" credential and expounds on IACAM being the foundation of each of the disciplines.  Subsequent advising highlights the fact that the student has already completed approximately half of the associate degree requirements for any of the four IACAM disciplines.  Industrial advisory board meetings are led by program faculty to insure that the curriculum continually addresses technical skills needed to support current advanced manufacturing practices.\n\nThe IACAM program faces numerous challenges while targeting interest in entry level education in science and engineering.  A two-year applied technical degree from a community college is generally misunderstood and under-appreciated within the community while considered a highly desirable credential among local manufacturers. Prospective employers often seek the highest level of skill and knowledge in the most advanced concepts in technology and educators sometimes attempt to promote the same idea in an effort to attract students by showing just how exciting a technical career can be.  Financial challenges are inherent to any educational endeavor and need no introduction.\n\nIn the absence of a reliable student-success tracking system, after students have moved into the workforce, Terra State Community College?s \"success stories\" have come through empirical, yet anecdotal observation by faculty.  For example, students coming back for second and third certificates, degrees or returning to teach propagate an idea for faculty to pursue.  The idea is to focus on providing a thorough background in the fundamental concepts of any discipline and to provide a clear and navigable pathway to allow a student to expand upon that foundation of knowledge.\n\nStudents are encouraged to pursue multiple certificates and degrees in order to catch up and keep up with the latest technology as well as industry needs for multi-disciplinary knowledge.  To achieve a broader range of knowledge, it becomes necessary to attend more courses rather than to sacrifice general and fundamental knowledge in order to make it all fit into one certificate or degree with shallow exposure.  This takes more time and costs more money up front, but by creating the clear and navigable pathway by which to pursue a more thorough education, a new efficiency is introduced which saves both time and money.  Students can be advised more accurately and efficiently because they start out on a path which is mapped out with all the milestones and possible options along the way.  Students are required to take more control of their educational destiny, but are never left to do so alone or without clear options.\n\nBy establishing a clear and navigable pathway to a rewarding technical career, students and prospective employers will be assured that critical fundamentals of science and engineering are not displaced by infatuation with the latest and greatest technology.  Multi-disciplinary backgrounds are built based on an observable and achievable set of options and objectives for students to attain successive credentials in a specific discipline while also planning out future options to expand into other related disciplines.  A plan can be mapped out start to finish with the convenient option to branch out or change directions without slowing down.  This plan serves as a visible set of goals for the student and can be exploited by prospective employers to add incentive to reduce turnover in a volatile market for skilled workers.  New goals will propagate naturally throughout the student?s career and can be more easily accommodate with an established set of progression options.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffery Hamilton"
