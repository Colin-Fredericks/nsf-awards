 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) program, Professor Isabell Thommann from the William Marsh Rice University will acquire parts to asssemble a femtosecond time-resolved nanophotonic scanning probe microscope. This will make it possible to study nanostructured materials synthesized for energy and sustainability applications with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. These measurements will allow probing the chemical and physical properties of the materials to help understand energy flow and charge carrier dynamics in hybrid nanostructured materials.  This will help to address challenges in the production of large scale applications of these materials. The acquisition will be a multiuser instrument used by researchers at the university and also for new collaborations in the Houston area, and nationally. It will strengthen the outreach efforts at the university to high school teachers and students. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying charge separation kinetics in all-conjugated block copolymer thin films; (b) investigating carrier dynamics in two-dimensional materials and devices for energy; (c) using time-resolved photoluminescence as a probe of hot electron dynamics; (d) studying hot electron dynamics in plasmonic antennas; (e) carrying out spatiotemporal investigations of photocatalytic virus inactivation; (f) studying photocatalytic water splitting on nanostructured cobalt oxide by time-resolved tip-enhanced Raman scattering; (g) investigating photocatalytic water splitting on plasmonic photoelectrodes.",
