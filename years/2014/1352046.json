 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impacts of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change on weather and climate are expected to vary depending upon the island geometry (size, aspect ratio and shoreline shape) and terrain. A conceptual understanding of such variations will be established though idealized numerical modeling experiments (NME). The concept developed will be used to analyze more realistic NME, investigating the weather and climate impacts of observed LULC changes (2000-2010) in the maritime continent, which exerts an important influence on tropical climate. Educational aspects of this project is the integration of Polaris, a discovery engine designed for operating on big data, with NME outputs generated from the Principal Investigator's (PI) research (past, ongoing and future) to transition from a deductive to inductive methodology for teaching of graduate level courses in Atmospheric Dynamics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nLULC change can have a substantial impact on weather and climate, but varies in complex fashion depending upon geographical setting, especially terrain and continentality. A conceptual framework for understanding the geographic variability is gradually emerging from prior studies, including those of the PI. The research activities will lead to an important addition to this framework, namely the impact LULC change in the context of island settings, and improved understanding of the effect of deforestation in the maritime continent. Note that the influence of the maritime continent on tropical climate is disproportionate to its land area, contributing to 40% of latent heating in the global tropics (~twice compared to continental convection). A large portion occurs in the vicinity of small islands as sea breeze initiated convection and is potentially impacted by LULC changes. Thus the proposed research is relevant and important, especially in the context of the IPCC determination that radiative forcing caused by land-atmosphere interactions is not well quantified, and is one of the key uncertainties. Whereas tools for big data analysis are becoming more common in field of Atmospheric Science, incorporation of this capability in classroom settings is lacking. Analysis of large datasets to establish relationship between atmospheric variables relevant to a phenomenon, and inferring the nature of theoretical framework needed to analyze it is an effective method for teaching of Atmospheric Dynamics. Learning in such an inductive setting mimics the natural development of the field. However, the pedagogy required for this purpose is also lacking. The PI addresses these critical gaps through integration of his research and educational activities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThe LULC change impacts could be exacerbating or mitigating the effects large scale climate trends in the maritime continent. For some island settings, deforestation could lead to decrease in rainfall over agricultural regions and thus the concern that increase in productivity gained from expanding the crop lands may be negated by reduced rainfall caused by deforestation. Thus the results from this study have the potential to inform and lead to better policy formulation regarding climate change mitigation and sustainable environmental management. Atmospheric dynamics is often a very difficult course for students in atmospheric science. The teaching method developed via this award has the potential to transition students from mimicry to mastery, improving research creativity and retention in graduate programs. The proposed educational portal will document and share the big data supported inductive pedagogy with a wider community, allowing continued evolution from other educators and students.",

However, the nature of the impact can differ depending on geography. One of the major outcomes of this project is new findings regarding combinations of geographical features, types of land modification and weather systems that maximize impacts on weather and climate. This project also identified mechanisms through which weather and climate is impacted under such situations, which enables global application of the study findings. For example, the study found that destruction of natural vegetation in island settings of Grand Bahamas (Figure 1) by hurricanes leads to reduction in rainfall that can persist over decadal timescales. One of the mechanisms through which rain clouds persistently form over the island is through interaction of sea breeze with air over the island that overturn as the land heats up during the day. When the surface vegetation is destroyed, there is less water vapor in the overturning air and causes cloud to rain less. A second example is the finding that reduction of wetlands and increase in urbanization and agriculture along the Louisiana coast have the potential to affect the strength of landfalling tropical storms and also rainfall.&nbsp; A third example is the finding that urbanization in the foothills regions for mountains can substantially alter rainfall over higher elevations.
