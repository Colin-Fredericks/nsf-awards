The project will review existing evidence related to time, type, and substance of science learning experiences in elementary schools, conduct interviews and surveys of key informants, convene an expert panel in order to approach consensus related to measurement strategy and implementation recommendations, document research findings and expert recommendations, and lay groundwork for next steps regarding implementation of measurement systems.  The project will advance the work of the Education & Human Resources (EHR) directorate in fostering research on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.",
