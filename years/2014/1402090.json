This symposium will focus on the latest developments at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding fundamental interactions.\r\n\r\nIt will be held September 15-20, 2014 at the University of California Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. \r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. To make the symposium more accessible to the general public, the organizers have integrated a public lecture by one of the symposium speakers into the schedule.",
