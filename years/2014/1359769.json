 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry Professor Peter Armentrout of the Department of Chemistry of the University of Utah and graduate student researchers are studying the reactivity of electrically-charged species (ions) with neutral molecules in extraordinarily well-defined systems.  From these experiments, they obtain information about the energetics of reactions (thermochemistry) as well as information about the speed with which these reactions take place (kinetics). Students educated in the Armentrout laboratory will be trained for a wide variety of technical careers.  Besides his scientific work, Prof. Armentrout reaches large numbers of members of the public through his Christmas Faraday Lectures at the University of Utah.\r\n\r\nProf. Armentrout and his graduate students will be carrying out a series of experiments, exploring the reactivity of transition metal cations with neutral reaction partners, using the Armentrout group's guided ion beam mass spectrometer (GIBMS) instruments.  Studies will include:  (1)  state-specific measurements of transition metal cation reactivity, with an emphasis on quantitative evaluation of spin-orbit effects on chemical reactivity; (2) measurement of solvation energies of multiply charged metal ions, including explicit quantification of the potential energy surface for charge separation channels, emphasizing environmentally and biologically important examples; (3) continued studies of binding of biologically-relevant molecules to metal cations and protonated systems; and (4) theoretical work to complement all of the experimental studies in (1) - (3).  Students receiving training in Prof. Armentrout's laboratory have gone on to positions in academia and industry.",

These studies include work concerning transition metal cation chemistry, hydration of metal dications, metal ion and proton interactions with biologically relevant molecules, and several miscellaneous studies.</p>\n<p>For transition metal cations, infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy was used to identify that Pt<sup>+</sup> reacts with two molecules of methane to activate several CH bonds and form the platinum dimethyl cation. Studies of the energetics of methane activation by Ru<sup>+</sup> were completed and an invited review of similar chemistry for all 5d transition metal cations was published. We also measured the thermochemistry for association of CO onto iron cluster cations ranging in size from 4 &ndash; 17 atoms, which compared favorably with measurements of CO binding to surfaces. The PI also contributed to a theoretical paper providing benchmark theoretical results for 1<sup>st</sup> row (3d) TMs, which led to a reinterpretation of our previous measurements of the bond energies of VH and CrH. Studies of the oxidation of the 5d cations, Re<sup>+</sup>, Os<sup>+</sup>, and Ir<sup>+</sup>, with CO were completed, and compared to previous work on oxidation by O<sub>2</sub> (see example of Re<sup>+</sup> in Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>Measurements of the hydration energies of metal dications is one focus of our NSF research. During the latest funding period, we completed studies of the alkaline earths by examining Ba<sup>2+</sup> (<em>n</em> = 1 &ndash; 8), and the second shell of Sr<sup>2+</sup> (<em>n</em> = 5 &ndash; 9). We also examined the hydration of Cu, measuring thermochemistry of Cu<sup>2+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<em><sub>n</sub></em> (<em>n</em> = 7 &ndash; 10) and CuOH<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<em><sub>n</sub></em> (<em>n</em> = 1 &ndash; 4), and augmenting this work by an IRMPD study of CuOH<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<em><sub>n</sub></em> (<em>n</em> = 2 &ndash; 9). This work shows that CuOH<sup>+</sup> binds three water ligands directly to the copper with an additional four water molecules hydrogen bonded to the inner shell ligands in a square planar arrangement. Our most recent work extends these studies to Co<sup>2+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<em><sub>n</sub></em> (<em>n</em> = 4 &ndash; 11) and Ni<sup>2+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<em><sub>n </sub></em>(<em>n</em> = 4 &ndash; 11). In the latter work, hydration energies for both ground and excited isomers are obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 2.</p>\n<p>Concerning biological molecules, our studies regarding the binding energies of alkali cations to amino acids was included in an invited review in the book: <em>Metal Ions in Life Sciences. Volume 16: The Alkali Metal Ions: Their Role for Life</em>. Our research activity in this area during the last funding cycle included an examination of the energetics for dissociation of a model protein cross-linker, the AsnGly dipeptide, and the GGG tripeptide. Results for the latter system are shown in Fig. 5. Here, the crucial threshold regions of six channels are modeled <em>simultaneously</em> with good fidelity, and barrier heights for eleven distinct pathways were obtained by such analysis.</p>\n<p>Our traditional collisional and reaction studies have been complemented by using IRMPD action spectroscopy at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) facility, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. We have examined amino acid complexes of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>, with the idea of providing fundamental structural information regarding why Zn binds preferentially to Cys and His residues in biological systems and how the toxic Cd metal replaces it. IRMPD results for complexes of these metals to Cys, its methyl ester, Gln, Glu, Ser, and Asn were obtained and published. Comparison of the IRMPD spectra with theoretical predictions allows the structures of these complexes to be identified. In general, Zn forms complexes in which the amino acid is deprotonated, whereas Cd forms complexes of the intact amino acid with CdCl<sup>+</sup>. In most cases, the metal binds to the amine and carbonyl groups of the backbone and the side-chain functional group; however, for Zn(Ser-H)<sup>+</sup>, proton loss occurs at both the hydroxyl side-chain [N,CO,O<sup>?</sup>] and the carboxylic acid group [N,CO<sup>?</sup>,OH], as shown in Fig. 6. This differs from the Cys complex where only side-chain deprotonation is observed.</p>\n<p>In miscellaneous work, we performed thermodynamic studies of the benzylpyridinium &ldquo;thermometer&rdquo; ions, providing the first experimental bond dissociation energies for these commonly used compounds. In addition, the thermochemistry of the complexes of protonated hydrazine and N,N-dimethylhydrazine with itself and water has been elucidated.</p>\n<p>In nearly all of these projects, graduate and undergraduate students participated in all phases of the research experience by acquiring the data, analyzing it, writing it up for publication, and often presenting results orally or via posters at conferences. The theoretical studies that often accompany the experimental work are also carried out by the students in most cases. Several students have been involved in both domestic and international research experiences by traveling to the FELIX facility at Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands. During the course of this grant, four students completed their Ph.D. theses while supported by the National Science Foundation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/08/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;B&nbsp;Armentrout</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359769/1359769_10317719_1502230144535_Fig2outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359769/1359769_10317719_1502230144535_Fig2outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359769/1359769_10317719_1502230144535_Fig2outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reaction cross sections of rhenium cations with O2, SO2, CO2, and CO as a function of relative kinetic energy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">P.
