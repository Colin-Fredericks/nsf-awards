The federated logic conference is an event which brings together ten major international conferences in the area of Formal Methods, and around 75 satellite workshops.  While the participating conferences are normally held individually by their local conference organization on an annual basis, they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every three-four years.\r\n\r\nEnhancing the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems is widely accepted as one the grand challenges facing the computing-research community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal Methods. It is also an outstanding training opportunity for young researchers, as it offers them a grand view of the whole area.",
