The workshop will be under the direction of Dr. James Murday and co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will address the challenges/opportunities facing nanoscale science/engineering education (NSEE) worldwide, with special attention to: a) an assessment of the global NSEE efforts to see what has been working best; b) the goal of scaling up availability/usage of the best NSEE resources, c) the symbiosis among NSE, information technology, biology/medicine, and cognitive processes (U.S. BRAIN1 and European Union Brain Project initiatives2); d) the NSEE Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) opportunities engendered by the newly released U.S. Next Generation K-12 Science Standards3; e) changing needs in the workforce as nanotechnology continues its rapid market penetration; f) the need and possible mechanisms for ongoing public education and engagement with nanoscale science, engineering, and technology; and g) roles for NSEE in broadening participation in the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will address the NSE needs for all the stages of education. This integrated approach is necessary since the stages of education are all interrelated.",
