 "awd_abstract_narration": "Speciation, in which one ancestral population gives rise to two or more descendant species with distinct characteristics, is the fundamental evolutionary process generating the diversity of life on earth. This project will harness recent advances in DNA sequencing technology to examine in unprecedented detail the ways in which history, geography and natural selection combine to produce the genetic changes responsible for the evolution of new species. This is basic research that aims to advance the new field of speciation genomics and increase fundamental knowledge of the natural world, while testing the hypothesis that natural selection on a small number of genes is sufficient to generate new species. The project will also generate important data for setting conservation priorities, provide advanced training in molecular and computational biology for a graduate student, and create opportunities for engaging students and the general public in modern genomics research with an accessible example involving birds.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on twelve finch species (genus Lonchura) that represent one of the most extraordinary cases of recent and rapid diversification in birds. With a diversity of plumage patterns and replicate examples of closely related species living in the same geographic regions, this group is ideally suited for addressing fundamental questions about the genomics of speciation. Whole genome sequencing combined with targeted re-sequencing will be used to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and divergence among species and populations in the Lonchura radiation and to: 1) assess the number, size and location of genomic regions (i.e., genes) diverging early in the speciation process; and 2) test alternative models for the origin and history of genetic variants (i.e., alleles) in these regions. The general hypothesis that each species' phenotype has evolved through the fixation of genetic variants at a small number of genes and that the phylogenetic history of these genes is largely decoupled from genome-wide patterns of genetic variation will be tested. Of particular interest is the possibility that novel genetic variants have been transferred between species via hybridization, resulting in novel phenotypes generated by unique combinations of alleles across a small subset of genomic loci.",

It is not only one of the most fundamental processes in evolutionary biology, but is central to understanding the history of life on earth. Evolutionary biologists and population geneticists have long been interested in understanding how geography and the key population genetic processes of mutation, natural selection, genetic drift and recombination contribute to the evolution of new species, but much of the well-developed theory in this field could not be fully tested because our understanding of the genetic changes underlying speciation was limited. Recent advances in technology have made it relatively easy and inexpensive to sequence the entire genome of almost any organism, which has spurred the development of a new scientific subfield, speciation genomics. Speciation genomics uses genome sequence data from multiple individual and multiple species to better understand the history of speciation, the specific genetic changes that make each species unique, and the processes by which a single ancestral species diverges into two or more distinct and separate forms. This study is an example of basic research designed to advance the new field of speciation genomics and increase fundamental knowledge of the natural world, while testing the specific hypothesis that natural selection on just a small number of genes is sufficient to generate new species.</p>\n<p>Dating to Darwin's study of small finches in the Galapagos, evolutionary biologists have been particularly interested in cases of apparently recent and rapid diversification, in which multiple species evolve from a single ancestral form over a short time period. This study focused on a group of twelve finch species in the genus Lonchura that represent one of the most extraordinary cases of recent and rapid speciation in birds. Different species of Lonchura finches, also known as \"munias,\" occur in different parts of the island of New Guinea, on certain nearby islands, and in northern Australia. Aside from their basic description by ornithologists and knowledge of where they occur geographically, these birds had never been the subject of serious scientific inquiry prior to this study. Preliminary genetic data revealed that this group of species was among the most extraordinary examples of rapid diversification in birds, one in which the different species evolved more recently and rapidly than Darwin's finches in the Galapogos. Genetic data collected as part of this study showed that speciation occurred over just tens or hundreds of thousands of years as compared to millions of years for most other bird species.</p>\n<p>Following fieldwork in Papua New Guinea and northern Australia during which a total of 623 birds representing 11 different species were captured and sampled for genetic analysis, the principal work supported by this grant was the collection and analysis of whole genome sequence data. Analysis of these data resulted in a number of important insights: First, munia species are nearly identical genetically, but differ only at a small number of genes, representing less than 1% of the genome. Among the few genes that were different between species were some known to influence coloration in a wide variety of other organisms from humans to fish. Second, at each of these \"color genes,\" there were only two to four different versions of the gene (these different versions are known as \"alleles\") among the eleven munia species that were sampled. Third, the unique color and pattern of each species appears to result from each species having acquired a unique combination of alleles across this small set of genes. Finally, munia species living in the same region were more similar to each other across the vast majority of the genome than they were to species living elsewhere, yet still maintained differences at a few key genes. Taken together, these results suggest that the unique traits of each species are based on a tiny fraction of the genome, that different species in some cases may exchange most of their genetic material with another species while still maintaining the critical genetic differences that make them unique, and that novel phenotypes (color, pattern, morphology) may originate be creating new combinations of existing genetic variation rather than relying only on novel mutations the accumulate in reproductively isolated populations. All of these results potentially challenge conventional models of the speciation process.</p>\n<p>Results of this project have been reported in a peer-reviewed scientific paper and have been disseminated through various public presentations, an online blog, and news coverage.
