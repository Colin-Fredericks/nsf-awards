The main goals are to delineate what civic science is, to specify how it differs from citizen science and activist street science, and to generate best practices for civic science. The proposers also hope to develop strategies to impact policy discussions and professional education, and to make some headway towards shifting the national conversation about the role of science in society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work should help foster the collective capacities of scientists and non-scientists to come together to solve real-world problems in a democratic society.  A white paper will be produced",
