 "awd_abstract_narration": "The observed ongoing decline of summer sea ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean results, in part, from heat carried by ocean waters.  This heat enters the Arctic Ocean by direct solar heating and by the transport of heat with flows from the Atlantic Ocean and Bering Sea.  The warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean are isolated from direct contact with the sea ice by subsurface colder waters.  This project will develop a model that synthesizes our understanding of important physical processes in the Arctic Ocean, compare the model output to observations, use the model to increase understanding of the processes responsible for modulating heat flux to the sea ice, and understand the observed recent trends in those processes\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator proposes to study processes that lead to water mass transformation within the Chukchi Sea, exchange across the shelfbreak to the basin interior, and the melting of ice using a very high resolution regional numerical model in conjunction with recent and historical observations. The model is a realistically configured coupled ocean/sea ice model forced by synoptic atmospheric fields and flow through Bering Strait. Physical processes responsible for exchange of mass, heat, freshwater, and tracers across the shelfbreak will be diagnosed. The circulation and fluxes in the model will be compared with in-situ mooring and hydrographic data. The objectives of the proposed study are to better understand the processes responsible for cross shelf exchange in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean, their relation to ice melt in the interior, and how they might change in a changing Arctic climate. The focus of the regional model is to diagnose the mechanisms responsible for shelf-basin exchange and relate them to the basic forcing mechanisms in this region (flow through Bering Strait and the atmosphere). The efficiency of the regional model allows for large numbers of calculations to be carried out, and for hypotheses relating to exchange to be tested. Such a process-based approach allows for a general understanding of the controlling physics with broader implications for other regions and forcing scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator teaches graduate level classes in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Physical Oceanography, and the material developed during this project will be incorporated into his classes. He has also been involved in the GFD summer school and will offer summer school lectures about the understanding gained from this study. Undergraduate students strong in mathematics and physics will also be recruited to work on the model analysis through the WHOI Summer Student Fellowship program at no cost to this project. The PI also maintains a web site that summarizes and highlights his research interests for a broader audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goals of this study were to understand how the nutrient-rich, low salinity water originating in the Pacific Ocean crosses the Chukchi Sea and enters the interior of the Arctic Ocean.  This is important for the local ecosystem, ice cover, air-sea exchange, and climate of the high latitudes.  Using a high resolution regional numerical model and observations, we found that the dominant pathway for Pacific waters modified in the Chukchi Sea to get into the Arctic Ocean is by direct advection through Barrow Canyon.  This occurs all year round, although there does appear to be a seasonality in the flow once offshore.  This explains the recently described Chukchi Slope Current and the loss of transport along the north shelf of Alaska.  Once in the basin interior, the wind drives this low salinity water towards the center of the basin.  This convergence is balanced by large meandering currents and vortices (100 km scale) that transport this water back towards the coast.  This balance allowed us to develop a theory to predict the amount of freshwater that can be stored in the basin and how it evolves over time in response to changing winds.  The resulting system is a damped oscillator such that the time-dependent behavior is a complex combination of an immediate response to changing winds but also a slower response (decadal) due to a memory of past winds.  This is important for understanding how the Arctic and freshwater budget will respond to a changing climate due to both natural variability and anthropogenic influences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Spall"
