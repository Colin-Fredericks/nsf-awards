 "awd_abstract_narration": "Owing to their extraordinary natural resources and ecosystem services, river-delta coastlines host hundreds of millions of people worldwide. However, the sustainability of society on delta landscapes is uncertain, due to significant human influences including: 1) reduction of sediment - the life sustaining resource for any delta system - as a result of damming and leveeing of river channels, 2) disrupting natural sediment dispersal and deposition patterns within and along river-delta coastlines, 3) accelerated sinking of low-lying deltaic landscapes due to sub-surface water and fossil fuel extraction, and 4) sea-level rise, which threatens to drown deltaic landscapes.  The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate river-delta sustainability by merging science that examines physical aspects of delta growth with socio-economic decisions.  This research will provide guidance for the sustainable use of vulnerable delta resources, while promoting best engineering practices that protect society and infrastructure from disasters including river flooding, ocean storms, and sea-level rise.  Additional broader impacts include training future scholars for the interdisciplinary field of coastal sustainability, creating an internet-based interface to promote global-citizen awareness in coastal sustainability, and developing teaching modules with complementary workshops intended for high-school courses on coastal science and sustainability for underrepresented groups in Houston and Los Angeles. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.\r\n\r\nThe crucial resource in building sustainable deltaic coastlines is sediment, and the key control on sediment delivery is river channel avulsions, relatively rapid displacements of river channels and the formation of new river channels. A multi-investigator, cross disciplinary team of researchers will address the following questions of fundamental importance to river-delta coastal sustainability: What are the socioeconomic consequences of altering river channel pathways on a highly utilized delta? Are current delta land loss mitigation strategies sustainable over long-range (decades to centuries) timescales? Can the location of significant future flooding events be predicted? These questions will be addressed using the Huanghe (Yellow River) delta, China as a case study. The Huanghe delta is a compelling region because it is one of the most dynamic and heavily urbanized coastal landscapes in the world. Lessons learned from the Huanghe delta will be exportable to evaluate the sustainability of delta coastlines worldwide. This project will build predictive models for coastal sustainability by bringing together the mechanics of avulsion on deltas, associated channel-shoreline interaction, socio-economic response to natural and engineered avulsions, and the resulting coupled human-natural system dynamics. U.S. researchers in cooperation with Chinese colleagues will create a template for multi-disciplinary coastal sustainability research to help guide future governance and decision making that integrates human-delta dynamics, societal objectives and uncertainty, hazard and land use engineering, coastal morphodynamics, and educational outreach. This project will evaluate whether massively anthropic coastal landscapes can be managed using engineered avulsions to minimize coastal erosion in the face of reduced sediment supply and rising sea level.",
