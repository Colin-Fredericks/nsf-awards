 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tim Mueller and Chao Wang of Johns Hopkins University are supported by an award funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) program to develop a way to rationally design new alloy nanoparticle catalysts.   Alloy nanoparticles are promising materials for use as advanced catalysts that increase the energy efficiency of chemical processes at relatively low cost.  It is possible to modify the performance of alloy nanoparticle catalysts by adjusting their size, shape, atomic structure, and chemical composition.   The research approach used by Mueller and Wang takes advantage of this flexibility.  They create computational models that are able to accurately predict how the conditions under which nanoparticles are made affect their catalytic performance.   These models are refined and validated by iterative comparisons with experimental results.  As a proof of concept, this approach is being used to design catalysts that facilitate the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels.  The conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels could simultaneously increase global fuel supply and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; but it is not yet economically viable due to the lack of suitable catalysts.  This research is integrated with a comprehensive educational outreach program that includes research opportunities for a female high school student, a workshop on energy technologies, and a new course on renewable energy technologies at Johns Hopkins University. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project has two primary thrusts.  In the first, the researchers are developing a predictive model that relates synthesis conditions to nanoparticle structure. To accomplish this, computational models based on cluster expansions are trained on ab-initio data and used to predict the atomic structures of alloy nanoparticles. The predicted structures are then compared to the experimentally-determined structural characteristics of monodisperse and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles created from organic solution synthesis. The computational and experimental approaches are iteratively refined until they are consistent, resulting in a model with strong predictive power.  In the second thrust, the researchers are developing and validating a predictive model that relates nanoparticle structure to catalytic properties. Density functional theory is used to calculate the binding energies of key intermediate adsorbates on the surfaces of nanoparticles, and these energies are used in the computational hydrogen electrode model to calculate catalytic properties of the alloy nanoparticles. To iteratively refine the computational models, computational predictions for nanoparticles of different sizes, compositions, and surface structures are compared to experimental catalytic and spectroscopic studies.  To demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of this approach, the researchers are designing and testing Cu-alloy nanoparticle catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, computational and experimental methods were tightly integrated to develop new ways to predict the structures and properties of metal and metal-alloy nanocatalysts, with the goal of enabling the design of new, highly efficient catalysts.  The tight integration between theory and experiments was essential for the success of this research and provided a valuable education for the students and postdoctoral researchers on the project team.  The experimental and computational researchers learned from each other and have become skilled at collaborating with researchers who have different backgrounds and areas of expertise.\n\nAlthough the methods developed in this project could be applied to a variety of chemical reactions, the research was focused primarily on nanocatalysts for the electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into more useful products, including fuels.  The discovery of catalysts capable of doing this in an economically viable way could reduce the cost of hydrocarbon fuels, broaden the distribution of fuel production, and mitigate the effects of releasing large amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe catalytic properties of a nanocatalyst are highly dependent on the atomic structure of its surface.  For this reason, a primary focus of this project was to develop experimentally-validated methods for predicting the surface structures of nanocatalysts.  One of the key outcomes of this research was a new method for predicting the surface structures of alloy nanocatalysts that has significantly better agreement with experiment than previous approaches.  Guided by experimental inputs, computational methods were used to predict the surface structures of a variety of nanoparticle and nanowire catalysts.\n\nA second focus area of this research was to predict the catalytic properties of a nanomaterial once its surface structure is known.  This research also required close collaboration between theoretical and experimental researchers and yielded new insights for a variety of nanocatalysts.  These include a better understanding of how to stabilize alloy nanoparticles; the identification of copper surfaces that are likely to be highly active for CO and CO2 reduction (and an understanding of how these surfaces can be synthesized); an understanding of how problems with mass transport can limit the efficiency of nanocatalysts; insights into how the arrangements of elements on the surfaces of alloy nanocatalysts affect their catalytic activity; and an understanding of how the surface structure of gold affects its catalytic activity.\n\nThis research also resulted in the discovery of new types of nanocatalysts with enhanced catalytic properties.  These catalysts include copper nanowires created by removing the oxygen from copper oxide, gold nanorods with a crystal structure that differs from that of normal gold, nanoporous copper structures, and gold-palladium alloys with isolated palladium atoms.  In addition to these new catalysts, it is anticipated that this project will have a broad impact as the fundamental insights it has revealed will be of use to other researchers seeking to design new catalysts for a variety of chemical processes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tim Mueller"
