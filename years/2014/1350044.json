 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary\r\nMolecular glasses with high densities and exceptional kinetic stabilities have been recently produced by means of physical vapor deposition (PVD). In these experiments, the substrate temperature was held at a temperature below the glass transition temperature, Tg, where the bulk relaxation dynamics are extremely slow.  In order for these PVD glasses to overcome the kinetic barriers preventing bulk glasses from reaching such near-equilibrium states at low temperatures, molecules must have access to enhanced mobility during vapor deposition. It is hypothesized that this enhanced mobility is caused by a layer of increased mobility close to the air interface. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this hypothesis will be tested by studying the dynamical properties of the surface of organic molecular glasses using a nanoparticle probe technique developed by the PI and others. The proposed improvements to this technique will allow simultaneous studies of the properties of the bulk glass and its free surface, making it an ideal method for investigating the correlation between surface properties and stable glass formation. This technique will be applied on a broad range of organic molecules to investigate whether this phenomena is universal for all glasses, or a chemical effect specific to particular molecular structures.  These studies will be important in advancing our fundamental understanding of the glass transition phenomena. \r\n\r\nNon-Technical Summary: \r\nGlasses, out of equilibrium solids with structures that resemble that of equilibrium liquids, are ubiquitous in our daily life, and are widely used in the electronic and medical industries. Despite this, developing new useful glassy materials, or improving the properties of known glassy materials has proven to be difficult due to extremely slow molecular motion within the glass. For example, in order to make high-density glasses via aging, the process by which a glass naturally becomes more dense, one would have to wait a few hundred thousand years. A recent discovery, however, shows that glasses with highly desirable properties, such as increased density and stability, can be produced in a few hours. It is hypothesized that this is caused by the presence of a layer at the air/glass surface of most organic and polymeric glasses that is a few nanometers thick and  behaves like a liquid rather than an out of equilibrium solid. Our proposed studies aim at understanding the origins of the liquid-layer and its effect on the structure of glasses.  Understating the properties of the liquid-layer can help design and produce materials with improved properties for organic electronic, pharmaceutical, lubrication and coating technologies. Furthermore, we will combine these studies with educational efforts aimed at introducing concepts of glassy polymer dynamics and structure to a wide audience. Polymers are widely used in everyday life.   Products such as bullet proof glass, silly putty and tires are examples of materials with similar design concepts, but widely varying properties. We will design experimental modules to highlight the importance of chemical composition, structure and dynamics on the final properties of a polymeric system. These experiments will be presented with adjustable levels of technical detail so that students of all backgrounds can learn from them.  The PI will also work closely with institutions at the University of Pennsylvania and science teachers from elementary and high schools in the Philadelphia area to develop, implement, and disseminate these modules.   To reach an even larger audience, videos of these modules will be made available online.",

The glass transition is the process of cooling a liquid below its melting point (super-cooled liquid) until it falls out of equilibrium at the glass transition temperature T<sub>g</sub>. Once out of equilibrium, the motion of molecules inside the glass become extremely slow, such that it can take a molecule hours, or decades to rearrange and move towards an equilibrium state. As such, obtaining equilibrium states of a liquid at low enough temperatures is nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It has been shown that if a glass is produced by vapor-deposition, near-equilibrium states (stable glasses) can be achieved at temperatures where the super-cooled liquid would take millions of years to equilibrate. It has been hypothesized that this is due to the enhanced motion of the molecule at the free surface (surface diffusion) as well as layers below. The goal of this project was to study the surface diffusion directly, and understand how it affects the glass dynamics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the course of this project we also developed methods that allow us to study properties of nanocomposite thin films and nanoparticle clusters [1-3]. These methods, originally developed for the study of surface mobility, found to have broad applications in the field of plasmonics and polymer composites [4-7].</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Surface diffusion in glasses thin films. </strong>We developed a novel method, using tobacco mosaic virus as a probe of surface diffusion (Figure 1). When we place a virus or rod on the glass surface, material slowly accumulates around the virus (observed as a halo in Figure 1) [8]. This is a direct evidence of the liquid-like nature of the film?s surface. However, when we place the rod on the surface of a stable glass, depending on the structure of the molecule it may or may not show this liquid-like surface behavior [9,10]. These studies indicate that the first layer of the glass at the interface, may not directly play a role in the stable glass formation as it was hypothesized.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Can a glass remain glassy at nanometer length scale?</strong> However, we were also able to show that the interface can affect the dynamics at distances much deeper into the surface, thus enabling the production of more stable glasses upon physical vapor-deposition. In addition, this effect can have important consequences for designing glass thin films for coatings and other applications. We generally assume that a thin film of a glassy system behaves as a rigid solid. However, our studies shows that this assumption may not be correct if the film thickness is less than 30 nm [11]. Figure 1 shows that a 20 nm film of a glass (in this case made of TPD molecule) spontaneously forms holes and self-destructs, behaving more like a very viscous liquid as opposed to a glassy solid [12]. &nbsp;Intriguingly, the glass self-destructs at a rate faster than predicted by the rate of material accumulation on the layer at the free surface, challenging some well-established theories of glass transition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Broader impacts.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Besides the development of new methodology and techniques that are broadly applicable to other fields [1-7], this project provided full or partial funding for training of 9 PhD and 9 undergraduate students and a post-doctoral fellow. 4 students earned PhDs (2 women) who have now joined industrial positions.
