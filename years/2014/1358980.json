The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, who will perform state-of-the-art data analysis using a wide variety of space- and ground-based astronomical observations. The student projects on offer include mapping star formation across galaxies, uncovering the universe of hidden quasars, and understanding the structure and evolution of galaxy clusters.\r\n\r\nThe MMO REU program will have a significant impact on the skills and career development of student participants by enhancing their capability to do research, to present their results at scientific meetings and in public settings, to write scientific papers, and to write observing proposals to use national and international telescope facilities.  Hundreds of undergraduate students have participated in the REU program to date, the great majority of them women, and many have gone on to successful careers as astronomers at leading universities, observatories and other organizations around the world. Indeed, roughly one of every 20 American women with a PhD in astronomy today acquired formative research experience at the MMO. This award will therefore contribute to developing a talented STEM workforce in the United States.",

Fully 67% (16/24) of the students supported on this award are women, while 42% (10/24) are members of traditionally under-represented racial and ethnic groups.&nbsp; 50% (12/24) of the students hail from small, liberal arts, and undergraduate-only universities, where access to astrophysics research is limited or non-existent.&nbsp; An an additional 17% (4/24) are from larger, state universities without advanced astrophysics degree programs or significant research opportunities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Keenly aware of the importance of cultivating diverse mentors, 50% (8/16) of the affiliated astronomers active during this award are women.&nbsp; Of those, three women are alumnae of the MMO REU program, providing not only first-hand testaments to the long-term career successes of MMO REU alumnae, but also, real-world mentoring and networking for current MMO REU students.&nbsp; Finally, it should be noted that the current Director of the MMO is a woman and also an alumna of the MMO REU program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong></p>\n<p>Research at MMO emphasizes state-of-the-art data reduction techniques and thoughtful physical interpretation.

Each MMO REU student works on an individualized research project under the guidance of experienced astronomers, as well as a collaborative team project.

During this award period, MMO REU students have published two first-author peer-reviewed papers, three contributing author papers, and four senior theses.&nbsp; Several additional papers are currently in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students also develop their communication skills by participating actively in public outreach, especially our twice-weekly public stargazing nights at the observatory, a very successful outreach program that attracts more than 3,500 visitors each summer.
