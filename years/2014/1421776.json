 "awd_abstract_narration": "On-line sharing of images has become a key enabler of users' connectivity.  Various types of images are shared through social media to represent users' interests and experiences.  While extremely convenient and socially valuable, this level of pervasiveness introduces acute privacy concerns. First, once shared images may go anywhere, as copying / resharing images is straightforward. Second, the information disclosed through an image reveals aspects of users' private lives, affecting both the owner and other subjects in the image.  Malicious attackers can take advantage of these unnecessary leaks to launch context-aware attacks (e.g., spearfishing) or even impersonation attacks.  This project is developing methods to help users appropriately control access to their shared images.\r\n\r\nThe investigators are developing new techniques to tackle image privacy based on the image content as well as images and users' meta-data, by (a) inferring the sensitivity of a given image based on the visual properties of the images and the users' image sharing patterns, and then automatically applying the appropriate privacy settings for that image, and (b) by using discovered users' sharing patters to define access policies according to the locally enforceable controls on the domain of interest.  Beyond the technical results, this project is developing a framework for understanding the common classes and categories of images with respect to the users' understanding of privacy.  This framework will enable an understanding of the images that need protection and help improve  user awareness of classes of images that are often unintentionally or accidentally under-protected.",

Sharing happens within a group of known people, and also increasingly with people outside a user's social circles for purposes of social discovery.

The goal of this award is to develop algorithms  and systems for automated image protection, through privacy recommendations and access control policies. We aim at exploring   novel features that capture the specifics of privacy-related images, as well as investigate effective and efficient privacy-setting classification and learning models, using both supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques. \n\n \n\nThis project led to a suite of key research advances. First, our studies revealed   important correlations between  visual content and  private content.  We developed a set of increasingly accurate models  to detect private images, and private content within images, using both   meta-data and of low-level visual features that can identify key points of the images.   Along with our collaborators  from University of Illinois Chicago (formerly at University of North Texas),   we  have studied the extent to which image tags are a possible proxy for images descriptors, and the extent to which these could be used to associate  privacy policies in a semi-automated fashion. In one study, we identified that in addition to objects, the scene context obtained from images? content can improve the performance of privacy prediction. As a proof of concept, we proposed  an effective framework to uncover scene-based tags from images? content using convolutional neural networks.  \n\nSecond, we have  developed an efficient approach to address   personalization of image privacy recommendations.  We have  developed  a  model  to identify users' archetypes that can be used to quickly instantiate a recommender system for privacy decision making. In a subsequent study, we  have extended this work   to support  privacy decision-making in the context of multi-owned images. \n\nFinally, we have developed methods to recommend privacy policies from a risk-centric perspective. Specifically, we developed  a  risk reminder system that offers social network users a quantitative view of their image sharing risks due to friend-to-friend re-sharing.  Our research findings  have been  widely disseminated in top research venues in Web, social media, and privacy. \n\nResults from this project have been incorporated into a series of lectures, seminar presentations  and invited talks. Research components have been critical parts of undergraduate and graduate courses that have impacted  undergraduate and graduate students. Further, this project has supported outreach &ndash; through lectures and invited seminars,  to  k-12 students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anna Squicciarini"
