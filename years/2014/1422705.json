 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing a software protocol stack is a complex task with many parties and products \r\ninvolved over multiple years. There are many issues that have to be resolved in the \r\nprocess, and it is incredibly hard to get all of them correct for all platforms and \r\nall possible states of a system. Hence, there are numerous examples of serious errors\r\nthat ended up in production, where the cost of fixing them is high. Software protocol \r\nstacks are widely used in many domains, and rigorous methods to improve their \r\nreliability would have a very broad impact. \r\n\r\nThe project develops a more rigorous approach to developing and maintaining such complex software\r\n protocol stacks.In particular, formal methods are used to find errors early through rigorous \r\nverification and testing, as well as to assist the analysis in locating reported errors. The approach\r\n is based on automatically learning abstract and succinct protocol models at different layers of the\r\n target software stack. Compositional reasoning is then applied to find errors effectively and \r\nprecisely. The generated models are leveraged to help with error localization and diagnosis. The \r\nusability of the approach is assessed through a real-life case study on the Android Bluetooth\r\n software stack.",
