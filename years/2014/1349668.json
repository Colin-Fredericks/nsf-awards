 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mouth connects the digestive system with the external environment.  Without this connection animals cannot eat.  Remarkably, despite its obvious importance, there have been few studies that address how this initial connection is established. It is also not often considered in studies of orofacial evolution, development and birth defects, and is rarely mentioned in developmental or anatomical textbooks. In this project, a series of experiments will define how the first connection to the digestive system is formed, and how its development is intimately tied to the formation of surrounding facial structures. Specifically, the hypothesis is that growth and tension within the face pulls the mouth open. Molecular, cellular, embryological and biomechanical approaches in Xenopus will be combined to test this hypothesis. Based on preliminary data it is expected that novel connections between molecular signals, cellular junctions, such as desmosomes, and mitosis will be uncovered. This work is potentially high impact in that it is the first to study: 1) the role of tension in orofacial development and 2) the molecular mechanisms governing how the connection to the digestive system is established. Additionally, this work is integrated into an innovative educational plan. Graduate and undergraduate level laboratory courses will be created where students will perform experiments contributing to the project. In addition, undergraduate independent study and summer research projects are planned for VCU's minority programs. On the opposite end of the educational spectrum is a preschool component where children will be exposed to living frogs at various life stages combined with art, math and reading activities. Together, this work will provide students at several levels with the opportunity to contribute to a better understanding of vertebrate mouth development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: The aquatic frog, Xenopus laevis, has become a unique and effective model to dissect the mechanisms governing craniofacial development.  Early development in Xenopus is highly conserved with mammals and experiments can be performed in free-living embryos that develop rapidly, can be obtained in great numbers at relatively low cost.  Many craniofacial developmental biologists focus on neural crest and palate development with the aim to better understand a common craniofacial disorder, cleft palate.  However, this leaves a major knowledge gap in our understanding of the other craniofacial structures.  One such understudied structure is the embryonic mouth. This is the first opening between the digestive system and the environment and is central to jaw and adult mouth formation.

My Tadpoles to Tots and Elementary Science programs introduced the youngest students to developmental life stages of frogs and encouraged girls to be resistant to the common \"eww yuck\" responses to amphibians. Middle and high school outreach activities and visits to my lab focused on an introduction to research using model organisms and hands on activities with embryos.  In higher education I developed a 12-student lab course, integrated lab modules into a lecture-based courses and developed projects where students performed experiments that contributed to my research goals.  Further, this grant has enabled independent research experiences for over 20 undergraduates and several graduate students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amanda J Dickinson"
