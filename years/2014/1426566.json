 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds theoretical and empirical research on school assignment mechanisms found in many US cities.  School choice programs aspire to weaken the link between the housing market and access to good schools.  Given existing evidence that, all else equal, students prefer to attend schools close to home, choice systems struggle to avoid scenarios where neighborhoods with good schools fill up only with students who live nearby, shutting out those who live in other parts of town.    Opening up schools to pupils throughout the district, however, requires that the district to absorb transportation costs, spending funds which may otherwise be used to educate children.  The projects outlined here are unified by their focus on ways to resolve conflicts between increasing access, ensuring diversity, and assigning students close to home.  \r\n\r\nOne strategy districts use to adjudicate claims between those from inside and outside the neighborhood is to apply a neighborhood priority for only a fraction of school seats.  The PIs develop theoretical results on matching algorithms with slot-specific priority structures to cover this scenario.  They also investigate whether mechanisms with richer message spaces, such as allowing students to be considered for schools either with or without busing, would accommodate a reduction in transportation costs.   Finally, another important aspect of these choice plans involves developing the set of schools an applicant may rank.  For instance, it may be possible to define choice menus in a flexible way so that students have options close to home and each student also has access to high quality schools.  A plan with these features was recently adopted in Boston in 2013 based on our earlier work.  Another project examines whether flexible choice menus provide a satisfactory compromise using data from the new choice system.  The research will compare the newly submitted choices under the new choice menus to earlier forecasts in a genuine out-of-sample validation that will inform the strengths and limitations of counterfactual analysis based on structural demand models.",

One way that school choice is operationalized is  through a centralized assignment system that allows students to rank and  apply to multiple schools on a single application. The district or  governing non-profit then uses this application to assign each student  to her highest ranked school contingent on priorities and capacity.  Centralized assignment systems have been adopted by many large urban  school districts including Boston, Chicago, New York City, Denver,  Indianapolis, New Orleans and Washington DC. <br /> <br /> In addition to  offering more options for families, centralized assignment can  potentially alleviate school segregation caused by neighborhood  homogeneity. However, these systems present many logistical challenges,  including managing increasing transportation costs and deploying complex  student sorting algorithms, also known as matching mechanisms.<br /> <br /> The purpose of this grant was to study the effects of matching  mechanisms on educational outcomes, including diversity. The line of  inquiry includes reserve systems that give admission priority to  students with certain characteristics. For example, a student may have a  better chance of admission to a certain school if she lives in a  specific neighborhood, qualifies for Free or Reduced Priced Lunch, or  meets academic criteria. Some districts, such as Boston, give preference  to students who live close to a school. This policy is considered a  compromise that allows for choice while still keeping district  transportation costs down. <br /> <br /> As a result of this grant, the  Principal Investigators published three papers and contributed to the  theoretical literature on matching mechanisms. First, in \"Explicit vs.  Statistical Targeting in Affirmative Action: Theory and Evidence from  Chicago's Exam Schools,\" the authors analyzed Chicago's tier-based  preference system that divides neighborhoods into four tiers based on  socioeconomic status. An equal amount of seats at each school are  reserved for all four tiers and the rest are assigned by merit. One of  the goals for this system is to increase diversity at selective or  in-demand schools. In addition to assigning tiers, the authors show that  it is possible to further target disadvantaged students by changing the  order in which seats are assigned.

DA is increasingly popular and used by many  districts that implement centralized assignment mechanisms, including  Boston Public Schools. TTC was used by New Orleans until 2013, at which  time the process switched to DA. SD is not currently used by districts  but is considered one possible alternative. <br /> <br /> The authors  compare the mechanisms across three criteria: strategy-proofness,  fairness, and efficiency. DA and TTC mechanisms are strategy-proof,  meaning that the best way to ensure a student receives her preferred  school is to rank her choices truthfully. This eliminates the gaming  aspect observed in previous application processes used by the New York  City Department of Education. In terms of fairness, DA completely  eliminates justified envy, which occurs when a student prefers a school  that accepts a different student with lower priority. Empirical evidence  from New Orleans and Boston shows TTC has significantly less justified  envy than SD. Finally, TTC and SD are Pareto efficient, meaning that no  student could be assigned to a higher priority school without another  student being worse-off.
