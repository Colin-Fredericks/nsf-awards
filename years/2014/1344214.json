The addition of Professor Lopez to this collaboration adds expertise in plant biology and mangrove forest structure to the proposed project and gives a new direction to the existing collaboration between Drs. Torchin and Byers. This project will examine the effects of parasitism and predation of a group of congeneric mud snails of the genus Cerithidea in tropical mangroves. These preliminary experiments would be carried out during one summer to gather preliminary data for the submission on an NSF proposal in the future. The project will provide fundamental training opportunities for a US undergraduate student and a postdoc on ecosystems engineering and conservation. Public outreach activities would have potential broader impacts and educational benefits to the Panamanian community.",
