 "awd_abstract_narration": "The I/UCRC for Wind Energy Science, Technology and Research plans to integrate engineering with fundamental research to support the development of wind energy systems for production of low-cost energy with high reliability. The center and its partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education in the following key areas: (a) Composites, (b) Foundations, Towers, and Infrastructure (c) Manufacturing and Design, (d) Structural Health Monitoring, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing, (e) Control Systems and Energy Storage, and (f) Wind System Planning, Siting, and Operations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed I/UCRC will have broad impacts with respect to the environment, the economy, and education. With large minority populations near Lowell and Dallas, the Center is well situated to involve underrepresented groups within the wind energy field. The Center intends to leverage best practices from several successful programs to develop and integrate educational activities that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse student populations and encourage under-represented minority and female students to pursue STEM careers. In addition to workforce development and R&D, WindSTAR will provide a forum in which multiple facets of the wind industry (e.g., wind turbine manufacturers, manufacturers of key components, materials suppliers, suppliers of ancillary equipment, service companies, and wind project developers) can work together to solve precompetitive problems that hinder the advancement of wind energy.",
