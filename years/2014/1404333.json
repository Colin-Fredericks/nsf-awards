 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cognitive disorders are a key health problem affecting millions of individuals, a problem that is increasing in importance as America's population ages. Just a single dementia, Alzheimer's disease, is estimated to afflict some 5.4 million Americans in 2012, projected to rise to 11-16 million by 2050, with the potential for staggering cost both in dollars and human costs for the afflicted and their caregivers. Yet cognitive health is not monitored effectively in the way that physical conditions and wellness are: physician visits routinely include screens for heart disease, diabetes, etc., but there is far less consistent screening for cognitive status. This project seeks to develop rapid, precise, and objective cognitive assessment tools that will provide operationally defined, quantitative metrics with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to aid in early detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, as well as monitoring disease process and treatment efficacy. Its evidence-based approach offers the possibility of earlier treatment, which can slow the progress of cognitive disease, resulting in better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe first research objective is to develop two new digital versions of two traditional tests.  The digital Maze Completion (dMC) assesses  frontal brain system associated cognitive functions by providing measures of tiered decision making and executive planning, and calibration of memory function by measuring the effect of priming. The digital Symbol-Digit Test (dSDT) assesses executive function by measuring information processing speed, and calibrates planning and cognitive shifting by detecting and measuring subtle behaviors. Both tests provide new measures of learning, assessing reaction time changes and short term memory retention. The second objective is to develop the algorithms required to detect subtle behaviors during the dMC and dSDT tests, which can serve as a platform to which additional tests can easily be added. The third objective is to make all the tests as self-scoring as possible, through advances in signal interpretation. The fourth objective involves administering the dCDT, dMC and dSDT to both healthy adults and subjects with known cognitive impairments, permitting the calibration of the power and value of the tests. The final objective is to establish the validity of selected measures provided by the tests, by comparing the measures to standard cognitive test results, to specific neuroanatomical structures, and to external and subcortical gray matter integrity relative to white matter integrity.  These research activities are integrated with education through projects in courses, engagement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research, and annual workshops for students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject: \"Collaborative Research: THink - Inferring Cognitive State From Subtle Behaviors\"\nPI:                  Catherine Price, Ph.D.\n Organization: University of Florida\n\nIn our previous work before receiving this grant we showed that paper and pencil tests such as requiring a person to \"draw the face of a clock, put in all the numbers, and set the hands to ten after eleven\" helped assess disease states for people with severe memory or thinking problems (such as Alzheimer?s disease).  With collaborators (Dana Penney, Ph.D., Lahey Clinic, and Randall Davis, Ph.D., MIT) we were able to investigate the validity of a new digitized assessment version of this classic clock drawing test as well as two other novel digital test measures.  The digital tests use a pen that records movement and pauses at least 82 times per second.  The current grant allowed us to more closely examine what tests and brain regions associated with specific variables of these new digital tests.  Our scientists followed people aged 60 and older who had subtle cognitive problems.   Each person in the study completed the digital tests, traditional standard paper and pencil measures, and completed a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan.   Some people were followed out to one or two years.\n\nMain findings of the study are:\n\nCertain subtle behaviors on the digital tests helped identify people with early signs of cognitive impairment.\nCertain subtle behaviors recorded on the digital tests changed after an important health event (for example, total knee surgery surgery).\nCertain subtle behaviors on the digital tests appear to tell us about which areas of the brain are communicating.\nThe study has expanded our scientific teams' view of cognitive assessment and the feasibility of cognitive assessment in rapid paced environments.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Catherine E Price"
