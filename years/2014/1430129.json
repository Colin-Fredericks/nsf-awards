PLDI is the top technical forum for the presentation of new and exciting advances in programming languages and compiler research. The symposium covers a wide range of topics in the field, including: Language designs and extensions; Static and dynamic analysis of programs, Domain-specific languages and tools; Type systems and program logics; Program transformation and optimization; Checking or improving the security or correctness of programs; Memory management; Parallelism, both implicit and explicit; Performance analysis, evaluation, and tools; Novel programming models; Debugging techniques and tools; Program understanding; Interaction of compilers/runtimes with underlying systems; Program synthesis. Students will be able to attend all events associated with the conference, and a rich set of workshops and tutorials.\r\n\r\nThe NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. To broaden participation, the grant is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students who cannot otherwise attend, that is, students who do not have any financial support whatsoever, e.g., from their advisors, departments, universities. The broader impacts include building international community and cooperation in the research areas of the conference, and enhancing education of students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. This award will therefore help train the next generation of language designers, compiler implementers and systems researchers.",
