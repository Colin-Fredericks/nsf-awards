Rising unemployment, increased poverty and income inequality, high foreclosure rates, and falling home prices have strained communities and exacerbated inequalities across areas and between racial/ethnic groups in ways that should alter levels and disparities in serious crime. Changing crime, in turn, can alter the fate of neighborhoods as groups and institutions seek to leave or instead remain trapped in high crime areas. Yet, there is a lack of information about the influences of societal conditions and crime on each other in a changing society. This research will answer two fundamental questions: (1) how have social transformations since 2000 affected differences across neighborhoods in their levels of crime?; and (2) to what extent are changing city and neighborhood conditions, including race-ethnic inequality, both causes and consequences of evolving crime patterns?  The research team will collect new data for 2010 on crime for over 9,500 neighborhoods in 91 cities and combine these with crime data for 2000 from the first wave of the National Neighborhood Crime Study.  Information regarding the social, economic, demographic, political and geographic contexts of cities and neighborhoods will be added to the crime data to produce a comprehensive nationally representative database of urban neighborhoods and crime for 1990 to 2010. These data will be used to analyze the consequences of recent societal changes for crime and neighborhood race-ethnic differences in crime. They will also be used to study how crime shapes social conditions within U.S. communities. The research questions will be addressed using forms of statistical analysis that consider how neighborhoods are embedded within a particular city and metropolitan area, and how neighborhoods that are near one another may affect each other.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis research has significant broad impacts in a number of important ways. First, by shedding light on the underlying sources of neighborhood vulnerabilities for rising crime, especially in non-White areas, findings will inform discussions about how to make communities safer. Second, the data collected will be made publically available and, thereby, provide an unprecedented resource for other researchers to further study changes in cities and neighborhoods. Third, the investigators will enhance the training and careers of students from diverse backgrounds by employing students from underrepresented groups to work on data collection and analysis.  Fourth, the project will contribute to the intellectual development of a diverse interdisciplinary group of scholars with core interests in race, crime, and justice (the Racial Democracy, Crime, and Justice Network currently funded by the National Science Foundation) by providing members of this network with direct training and early access to the data. Finally, the investigators plan to disseminate theoretical and practical information based upon findings about ways to improve neighborhoods and cities to increase safety within communities through presentations at academic conferences, scholarly publications, and briefings with policymakers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe new century ushered in dramatic social and economic changes leading up to and following the Great Recession that affected communities across the United States.  Rising unemployment, increased poverty and income inequality, and high foreclosure rates after 2000 hit many local areas hard, but disproportionately harmed Black and Latino communities.  At the same time, the United States continued its notable \"crime decline\" that began in the 1990s.  Our project examined how these social transformations since 2000 influenced crime and violence in U.S. urban neighborhoods &ndash; small local areas for which we have surprisingly limited systematic information about crime rates.  A key concern was whether inequalities in crime between White, Black, Latino, and other neighborhoods increased, decreased, or remained stable, and why such changes took place.  We further asked if the changes in crime within neighborhoods themselves produced declines or improvements in community socioeconomic conditions and in racial-ethnic inequality. \n\nOur research examines the causes and consequences of neighborhood crime in three key ways.  First, we assess whether fluctuations in neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics (such as poverty and joblessness) and housing conditions (such as mortgage foreclosures and vacant units) explain differences in violent and property crime across communities.  Second, we examine whether the U.S. crime decline took place in all types of neighborhoods.  In light of evidence that the Great Recession and the related housing crisis had more serious consequences for non-White and poor than White and advantaged neighborhoods, we compare changes in crime to determine if some minority and disadvantaged communities failed to see crime go down or even saw it rise despite the overall crime decline.  Third, we investigate the consequences of crime itself for neighborhood social and economic conditions by testing whether crime can set in motion subsequent population loss and economic decline.\n\nTo investigate these issues, we conducted the second National Neighborhood Crime Study (NNCS2) -- the only comprehensive nationally representative study of urban neighborhoods and crime for 2000 to 2013.  For NNCS2, we collected data on four serious violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) and three serious property crimes (burglary, larceny, and aggravated assault) for over 9,500 neighborhoods in 92 cities for 2010-2013.  Information regarding the social, economic, demographic, political and geographic characteristics of cities and neighborhoods were combined with the crime data.  Finally, we merged these data with the first wave of National Neighborhood Crime Study data, which includes information on the same neighborhoods for 1999-2001.  The unparalleled scope of these data allow us to provide a national portrait of the dynamic structural connections of urban socioeconomic, demographic, political, and spatial change with neighborhood crime in the United States.  In addition, the inclusion of neighborhoods in many cities over time, rather than one city at a single time point as in most prior research, provides information needed to study variation across cities in the patterns, causes, and consequences of neighborhood crime trends.\n\nOur analyses of these data demonstrate that most neighborhoods saw violent and property crime decline from 1999-2013 consistent with the crime decline evident for the United States as a whole and for many cities.  However, not all neighborhoods experienced decreasing crime; homicide and burglary actually increased in some neighborhoods. This countertrend is highly racially inequitable, largely being limited to Black neighborhoods.  Further, disadvantage and housing instability were notably higher in neighborhoods that experienced increasing rather than declining or stable levels of crime.  In contrast, immigration contributes to steady and declining neighborhood crime rates.  Overall, we observe a widening of the racial divide in crime in the new century with some of the most marginalized communities in the United States witnessing increases in crime while White areas have very low and declining crime. \n\nThis project also has broader impacts.  By identifying the underlying sources of neighborhood vulnerabilities for rising crime, especially in non-White areas, our results are key to informing discussions about how to make communities safer. The NNCS2 data will be publicly available, providing an unprecedented resource for scholars, policy makers, and other analysts to study changes in cities and neighborhoods.
