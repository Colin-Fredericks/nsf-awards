 "awd_abstract_narration": "The addition of one or more specific markers to proteins by enzymes known as protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) allows cells to adapt to their ever-changing environments.  Biological pathways responsible for development, the response to hormones and viruses, cancer and cardiovascular disease are all impacted by exactly how PRMTs carry out their additions to protein targets.  The studies will characterize how the individual members of the PRMT family dictate very specific product formation, for example, one versus two additions, in order to direct the result that is required in the cell.  The proposed strategy will integrate both computational modeling and \"at-the-bench\" biochemical experiments to reveal just how product formation takes place for two members of the PRMT family.  The results of these studies will provide foundational information that is required for novel inhibitor development, as well as allow for an understanding of the sophisticated role PRMTs play in cellular signaling.  The studies will provide cross training for students in both computational and wet biochemistry experimental strategies, as well as provide the opportunity for undergraduates to receive on-the-job training in the lab, preparing them for the STEM workforce.\r\n \r\nWith this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Joan Hevel and Dr. Orlando Acevedo to characterize the mechanism of protein arginine monomethylation versus dimethylation using advanced computational and biophysical techniques.  The role of sterics, dynamics, and mode of substrate binding in determining which of two different methylation products the protein arginine methyltransferases form will be determined.  Information from this study will provide new insight into the sophisticated control of product formation that is required to maintain appropriate patterns of signaling in cells.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnzymes are specialized protein machines that can do chemical work-they make and break bonds to manipulate the cohort of molecules in the cell.  With thousands and thousands of molecules in the cell, some of which are remarkably similar, scientist still grapple with understanding how enzymes show such amazing specificity.  The significance of understanding specificity greatly impacts our general knowledge of the cell, as well as our understanding of infection, aging, and disease. \n\nDuring the last funding period our lab acted as ?protein mechanics? to try and understand how two very similar human enzymes (PRMT1 and PRMT7) were engineered to make two different products that are involved in cellular communication.  We used computer modeling (because the proteins are too small to see even with the most powerful microscope) to predict functional space inside the enzyme machines and what parts of the machines might contribute to specificity.  We tested our ideas by creating altered versions of PRMT1 and PRMT7 and determining what kinds of products they make.  We successfully identified several components of the machines that governed specificity.  This information will help us create better research tools and help us understand why PRMT1 and PRMT7 only perform chemistry on particular molecules in human cells.  Along the way we also discovered that PRMT1 works best in the presence of anti-oxidants (remember that many fruits and vegetables are chalked full of anti-oxidants).   This surprising result suggests that PRMT1 may behave as a sensor in physiological states where oxidative stress is common (e.g., cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases).   The funded project also allowed our lab to train 11 high school students, 12 undergraduates, and 5 graduate students in biotechnology techniques and communication skills.  Overall our results helped clarify how the communication network in the cell works and revealed a previously unknown mechanism for regulating cell communication.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joan M Hevel"
