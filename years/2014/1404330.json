 "awd_abstract_narration": "H3+ is the simplest molecule with more than two atoms: it consists of three protons bound by two electrons.  As such, it is an ideal benchmark system for testing state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of molecular energy levels. H3+ is significant not only for these fundamental reasons, but also because it has been widely observed in a variety of astronomical environments, including the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn and in clouds of gas between stars.  These observations are made by precisely determining the colors of light that are emitted by the molecule, a technique called \"spectroscopy\".  The latest calculations can reproduce the colors of H3+ to within the accuracy of current laboratory spectroscopy measurements, so further progress in theoretical development will require improvements in the laboratory instrumentation.  The group supported by this grant plans to utilize a novel instrument that will allow them to measure H3+ colors to a precision that is 10,000 times better than previous work.  The resulting dataset will serve as an enduring benchmark for high-level theoretical calculations, and will also assist astronomical observations of this important molecule.  In the long run, it is anticipated that this work will help in the development of improved methods of controlling chemical reactions and thereby advance a significant fraction of the industrial sector.\r\n\r\nThe work will use a recently-constructed instrument that allows routine sub-Doppler spectroscopy of molecular ions.  This instrument will be upgraded to achieve a precision of  approximately 30 kiloHertz, or one-millionth of a wavenumber, and then used to record high-precision spectra of H3+ in the mid-infrared.  An analysis using combination differences and effective Hamiltonian fitting will be used to produce a set of experimentally determined energy levels of H3+, with a precision that is approximately four orders of magnitude better than previous work.   These precise energy levels will permit the direct testing of non-adiabatic corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, various empirical corrections, and ultimately calculations of the Lamb shift for H3+.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur reseach group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign refined a very sensitive and precise technique (called NICE-OHVMS) that allowed us to determine the quantum mechanical energy levels of H3+ with considerably higher accuracy and precision than has ever been possible in the past.  H3+, which contains three hydrogen atoms with one missing electron, is the simplest molecule with more than two atoms (that is, the simplest polyatomic molecule) and has long been used as an important testing ground for theoretical calculations of the energy levels of polyatomic molecules.\n\nThe last time that the energy levels of H3+ were measured in this fashion was back in 2001.  Since then, the sophistication of theoretical calculations had greatly improved, such that their accuracy rivalled that of the 2001 measurements.  As a result, it was not possible to determine whether there were any errors in the theoretical calculations, as there were not sufficiently accurate measurements to compare to.  Given that similar theoretical approaches are used for many other molecular system, it was important to improve the experimental measurements.\n\nOur new H3+ energy levels are roughly a hundred times more accurate than the previous values, and allowed a stringent new test of theoretical predictions.  A surprising result was that the errors in the theoretical energy levels (that is, the differences between our measurements and the theoretical calculations) have an unexpected dependence on a particular quantum number.\n\nOur project also generated highly accurate energy levels for a version of H3+ in which two of the hydrogen atoms are substituted by heavy hydrogen, or deuterium, atoms: D2H+.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts beyond physical chemistry and theoretical calculations of molecular energy levels, our work provides new accurate predictions for a particular type of transition in H3+ (a pure rotational transition) that has been proposed as a potential maser (microwave equivalent of a laser) in certain astronomical environments.  Even more broadly speaking, this project has helped train several undergraduate and graduate students, all of whom are now pursuing careers in science, engineering, or technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin J Mccall"
