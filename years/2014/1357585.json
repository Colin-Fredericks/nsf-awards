Research Data Centers are established by host institutions with cooperation from the Bureau of the Census.  The Center will provide secure access to restricted-use government microdata for the purpose of statistical research.   Research at this Center will include projects on a wide range of topics, including economics, rural vs. urban life and resource sustainability, and water and food security.   The research conducted at this RDC will give policymakers new insights into long term trends in this region of the country.  In addition, Center researchers plan to use their expertise in survey methods to work to develop methods appropriate for Census data.\r\n\r\nThis RDC is supported by an initial consortium that includes the host institutions and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the University of South Dakota, and the University of Iowa.  The Center will add geographic diversity to the current network of 18 existing RDCs.",
