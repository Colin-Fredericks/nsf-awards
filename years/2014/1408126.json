 "awd_abstract_narration": "GOALI: Widely Tunable GaSb-based Diode Lasers for Spectroscopy\r\n\r\nThe objective of this program is to address the current industrial need for compact efficient mid-infrared laser sources for spectroscopic applications. Diffraction limited GaSb-based diode lasers with extra-broad gain spectra suitable for direct integration into external cavity state-of-the-art spectroscopic systems developed by industrial collaborators at DayLight Solutions will be designed and developed. The proposed device applications include: gas leak monitoring in refineries and near the pipe lines, methane control inside underground coal mines and others. The new devices can be used for studies of chemical and radiation transfer processes in atmosphere, control of greenhouse gasses, for studies of marine environments and planetary research. There is significant commercial interest in tunable laser sources for spectroscopic applications as envisioned by industrial partner. Novel lasers will be utilized for development of the prototypes of the commercial products. The testing of the fabricated devices will be performed with participation of Stony Brook University students.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work will involve the design of a novel type of diode lasers with triple layer quantum well active region with engineered subband structure. Devices emitting in spectral region from 3.1 to 3.4 microns at room temperature will be sent to the industrial collaborator to perform die-attach tests. The mounted devices will be extensively characterized via optical measurements. Diode lasers with different heterostructure designs for the active region based on triple layer quantum wells having wide optical gain spectra will be fabricated and characterized. Cascade pumping will be utilized to minimize threshold current to achieve room temperature operation in the spectral region from 3 to 4 \u00b5m. The proposed efforts will include the design and development of ultra-low-reflection optical coatings optimized for antimonide-based heterostructures. The GaSb-based diode laser technology will be available for spectroscopic applications in home security and commercial sectors.",
