 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technologies which process natural language have become ubiquitous in the last decade. Web search engines, for example, process billions of pages of text, in order to determine which of those pages best match a user's search query. Many interfaces for interacting with computers -- for example, Apple's Siri personal assistant -- take voice-issued commands from their users, and must process these commands in order to follow the users' instructions. Finally, machine translation technologies have become available for many of the world's most common languages, allowing users to automatically translate text that they find in foreign books or websites. These technologies mostly rely on simple models of language, known as n-gram models or context-free grammars, which were developed in the 1950's and 1960's, and refined in later decades. These simple models of language have many advantages, most notably that they can be used to process large amounts of data very quickly. Because of their simplicity, however, these models are not able to capture many aspects of meaning in natural language. This has resulted in limitations for the technologies discussed above; virtual personal assistants are only able to process very simple types of instructions, and machine translations is still far from being as accurate as human translation. In the current project, Leon Bergen and Dr. Edward Gibson will be investigating more sophisticated kinds of language models, with the goal of increasing the ability of computers to understand language.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of Dr. Gibson, Mr. Berger will be studying language models known as mildly context-sensitive grammars. These grammars are able to express certain types of linguistic knowledge that humans have, but which cannot be expressed using simpler types of grammatical formalisms. For example, native speakers of English know that a declarative sentence like \"Mary kicked the ball\" is closely related in meaning to the question \"What did Mary kick?\" Although this fact seems obvious, it is difficult (or impossible) to express using simple types of grammars. However, mildly context-sensitive grammars can be used to express this knowledge in a very natural way. Mr. Bergen and Dr. Gibson will be studying whether mildly context-sensitive grammars can be automatically learned from examples of grammatical sentences. To do this, they will be using techniques from machine learning, a branch of computer science and statistics that develops algorithms that can automatically learn from data. The researchers will integrate these learning algorithms with their grammatical formalism, and will test whether their method learns an accurate grammar. The accuracy of the grammar will be evaluated using a corpus -- a collection of sentences -- in which every sentence has been manually annotated with its correct grammatical structure. If accurate mildly context-sensitive grammars can be learned in this manner, then this provides a potential method for improving the natural language processing technologies which were discussed above. In particular, because this method does not require an expert to write down the complete grammar for a language, it has the potential to be deployed without tremendous engineering effort, and may be deployed easily in foreign languages.",
