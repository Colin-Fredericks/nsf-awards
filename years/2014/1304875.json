 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a continuation of time series measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentration, the stable isotopes of CO2, and the O2/N2 and Ar/N2 ratios of air samples collected at Arctic sampling stations.  Measurements of O2/N2 ratio at Arctic sites, when also combined with measurements at lower latitudes, have the potential to help quantify the magnitude of the seasonal air-sea exchanges of O2 with the Arctic Ocean, which could be a key indicator of biogeochemical change in a time of rapid Arctic warming. Although the land biosphere also contributes to seasonal variations in O2/N2 ratio, the ocean contribution can be resolved by combining O2/N2 and CO2 data to compute the tracer atmospheric potential oxygen (APO), which is effectively an atmospheric tracer of ocean biology and chemistry. This work will draw on support from international collaborators, with the potential to shape Arctic O2/N2 measurements by the international community into a critical component of the AON.  Measurements of the 13C/12C ratio and 18O/16O ratio at Arctic sites also may provide key early warning indicators of ecological change. The project will support the archiving of aliquots of atmospheric CO2 in background arctic air to be used for open-ended purposes by future researchers. Finally, the project will support graduate student involvement in the collection and foster collaborations among scientific groups engaged in measurements of O2 and CO2 isotopes in support of detecting Arctic change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAtmospheric oxygen has been measured for 25 to 30 years at a range of surface monitoring sites in both hemispheres.  Oxygen measurements are reported in terms of deviations in the O2/N2 ratio and can be combined with atmospheric CO2 data to define atmospheric potential oxygen (APO ~ O2/N2 + 1.1 CO2).   APO is a tracer that largely removes the influence of terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration and isolates the influence of oceanic air-sea O2 fluxes on the atmosphere.  APO data have revealed both a long-term decreasing secular trend, the result of fossil fuel combustion, and small, annually repeating seasonal cycles, which are largest at mid to high latitudes.  These seasonal cycles are driven mainly by the influence of spring/summer outgassing of oxygen due to photosynthetic production in the surface ocean, followed by in-gassing due to fall/winter ventilation of O2-depleted subsurface waters.  APO data provide a broad-scale, regionally-integrated metric of both these processes.   Changes in the shape and amplitude of the APO seasonal cycle offer a means of detecting and evaluating changes in ocean biogeochemistry over time.  Systematic examination of data from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography monitoring network reveals statistically significant changes in the amplitude and/or phasing of the APO seasonal cycle at all 3 northern high latitudes sites.  At Cold Bay, Alaska (CBA) at 55&ordm;N, the APO seasonal cycle has shifted earlier by ~1 week and increased up to ~10 per meg in amplitude relative to the earliest data from the mid 1990s (see Figure 1). A similar early shift of 1 week has occurred at Barrow, Alaska (BRW) at 71&ordm;N, but the amplitude there has decreased by ~10 per meg over the last 25 years of observations.  The phasing changes at these two sites may reflect an earlier start to photosynthetic production in the spring associated with global change.  In contrast, the reasons for the disparate amplitude trends at CBA and BRW are unclear and are the subject of continued research.  At the northernmost SIO site, Alert, Canada (ALT) at 82&ordm;N, there is little evidence yet of a change in the APO cycle amplitude, but the negative zero crossing day of the cycle appears to be shifting earlier.  CBA shows similar signs that APO is decreasing more steeply in fall.  These observations are consistent with declining sea ice coverage and later freeze-up, which allows for increased fall ventilation of O2-depleted deepwater from the Sea of Okhotsk and the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.  Overall, the long-term monitoring of the APO seasonal cycle allows for the detection of subtle signals that serve as a bellwether of changing ocean biogeochemistry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia D Nevison"
