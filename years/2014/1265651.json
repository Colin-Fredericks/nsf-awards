 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two activities. The first will continue the operation and data distribution of observations from the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS). The second is a research program using the MACCS data along with SuperDARN radar, the Relocatable Atmospheric Observatory in Resolute Bay, nominally conjugate stations in the Antarctic and GPS TEC receivers at two of the MACCS sites. Data from the AMPERE satellites also will be used. The proposal identifies four topics: \r\n*\tPerforming detailed studies of dayside high-latitude ULF waves and transient events, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data. \r\n*\tProviding observational and theoretical support for the recently-launched Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission by investigating the role of ULF waves in energizing or depleting radiation belt electrons during magnetic storms, in part using the recently developed ULF index. \r\n*\tInvestigating the high-latitude field-aligned current structures associated with both transient events and steady convection, using magnetic field and GPS TEC data along with global data from the AMPERE project. \r\n*\tUsing the combination of MACCS data with simultaneous data from both low-orbiting and high-orbiting satellites to separate spatial and temporal variations in magnetospheric and ionospheric processes, and carrying out theoretical and modeling studies of the excitation and propagation of ULF waves through the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system. This study will use the BATS-R-US global magnetohydrodynamic simulation code. \r\n\r\nThe MAACS data are freely distributed to the entire science community.",
