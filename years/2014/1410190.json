 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to build on previous NSF supported research regarding the earliest stages of star formation; i.e. the initial fragmentation of giant clouds of molecular gas and the evolution of these fragments into dense cores that will eventually become newborn stars.   The proposal aims to study these sites of star formation through a multi-wavelength campaign of observations from the radio to the infrared using a number of different ground-based and space-based facilities.  The proposers will use these observations to test computational models of star formation and stellar evolution. \r\n\r\nThe proposed new research will undertake a detailed systematic study of the physical, chemical, and kinematic structure of large populations of low-mass starless cores and high-mass starless clumps.  For the high-mass starless clumps, the research will utilize the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) previously completed by the PI to identify a statistically significant sample of high-mass starless clumps for more detailed study through observations with the IRAM, APEX, HHT, JVLA and ALMA.  For the low-mass starless cores, the project will use radiation transfer modeling of the starless core population in molecular clouds to investigate the evolutionary phases of the cores and to determine the importance of magnetic fields during their evolution.  The project will make use of low-mass starless core identifications from the space-based Herschel and ground-based SCUBA observatories.  The project will perform new observations of these identifications with the 12m Arizona Radio Observatory and ALMA for comparison with the results from their radiative transfer models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStars and planets form from clouds of molecular gas in our Milky Way Galaxy. Dense structures within molecular clouds are categorized into cores on the smallest scales and clumps on larger (parsec) scales.  Starless clumps and cores are objects in the phase prior to the formation of a protostar.  It is important to understand the structure and evolution of starless clumps and cores in order to understand the initial conditions for star and planet formation.  This grant studied the evolution of starless clumps and cores, from nearby low-mass star-forming regions to distant massive star-forming regions, through multiple observational surveys.  The work carried out from this grant resulted in the completion of two Ph.D theses and part of a third as well as the completion of an award winning undergraduate Senior Honors Thesis at The University of Arizona.\n\n \n\nAn evolutionary analysis of clumps discovered in blind Galactic Plane surveys identified a population of over 2000 massive starless clump candidates in the Milky Way Galaxy.  The physical properties of this new population of starless clumps were analyzed: they have sizes ~ 1 parsec, they are cold (median temperature ~ 12K), and massive (median mass ~ 230 solar masses).  Higher resolution observations toward a subset of the most massive starless clump candidates revealed significant fragmentation on thermal scales as well as the presence of previously undetected low-mass star formation.  Very massive starless clumps (M &gt; 1000 solar masses) are rare and their phase lifetimes are short (&lt; few 100,000 years).  A candidate massive starless core (M &gt;~ 27 solar masses) capable of forming a massive star was discovered within the clumps indicating that these objects are also rare.  A search for the kinematic signature of inflowing gas in starless clump candidates found that this signature only occurs in ~6% of clumps.  This survey identified an interesting subset of starless clump candidates that may have mass inflow rates approaching 2000 solar masses per million years.  The kinematic survey was carried out by a group of undergraduate students from The University of Arizona Astronomy Club using the 12m Arizona Radio Observatory on Kitt Peak.\n\n \n\nA series of surveys of nearby clouds studied the properties of low-mass starless cores.  A search for the kinematic signature of infall revealed that the standard spectroscopic signature of collapsing gas motions is rare when observing the complete core populations within clouds.  Some previously used astrochemical indicators of the evolutionary state of starless cores, such as the ratio of the abundance of the CCS molecule to ammonia, need to be reconsidered as it was discovered that these ratios are sensitive to initial chemical conditions (for instance carbon to oxygen ratio) in the gas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yancy L Shirley"
