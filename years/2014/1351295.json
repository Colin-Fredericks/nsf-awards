 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are large differences in cognitive abilities and brain morphology both within and between species, yet it remains unclear why such differences exist. Such differences may result from differential biological fitness associated with individual variation in cognitive abilities, yet empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Different tasks require different cognitive abilities (e.g. spatial memory vs. memory for color), yet whether natural selection can shape different cognitive abilities independently is also debated. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will address these two major questions by (1) comparing individual differences in two cognitive abilities (spatial learning and non-spatial learning in wild food-caching mountain chickadees in two environments that place different demands on just one of these abilities, spatial memory, which is involved in recovering thousands of previously made food caches and (2) measuring biological fitness associated with individual differences in both cognitive abilities. If natural selection can affect these abilities independently, only differences in spatial learning ability should be associated with differential biological fitness. \r\n\r\nIn addition to addressing major evolutionary questions about population/species differences in cognitive abilities, the proposed study will also have significant implications for learning and memory research. It is still generally assumed that the mechanisms underlying associative learning in general are the same for all types of learning and memory and so studying one type of memory allows development of treatments for all memory types. Demonstrating that natural selection can affect different cognitive abilities independently would suggest that we must consider specific cognitive abilities and their regulatory mechanisms individually when designing interventions. The proposed research will also increase research readiness and science literacy by providing intensive research training to undergraduate and graduate students as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public through the Sagehen Biological Station.",

It has been hypothesized that such differences are a product of natural selection resulting from differences in biological fitness (e.g. survival and reproduction) associated with individual variation in cognitive abilities, yet empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. We studied wild food-caching mountain chickadees banded with unique Passive Integrative Transponder (PIT)-tags in two environments that place different demands on spatial learning and memory, which are involved in recovering thousands of previously made food caches needed to survive winter and provided first direct support of this hypotheses. We have developed novel Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based system allowing testing spatial cognition in wild PIT-tagged individuals and demonstrated that:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Individual variation in spatial learning and memory abilities in the first-year, juvenile birds was associated with significant differences in overwinter survival during their first year of life. Chickadees that have survived their first winter had better spatial cognitive abilities compared to birds that did not survive.</p>\n<p>2. Adult chickadees (birds that have survived at least one year and reproduced) had significantly better spatial cognitive abilities compared to that of juveniles, which further supported natural selection - juvenile birds that survive and become adults have better spatial cognition than the ones that died during their first year. At the same time, spatial cognitive performance did not significant change with age &ndash; birds had similar cognitive performance when they were tested as juveniles and then the next year as adults. These results also suggest that adults have better spatial cognitive performance because they already were better and not because their cognitive performance improved with age.</p>\n<p>3. Females mated to males with better spatial cognitive abilities invested more in reproduction by laying larger clutches. Since variation in memory of males does not appear to be associated with differences in parental abilities, these results suggest indirect benefit - females mated to males with better spatial cognition produce more young that are more likely to survive because of better spatial cognition. At the same time, variation in spatial cognitive abilities of females was not associated with differences in clutch size.</p>\n<p>4. Chickadees at harsher high elevations had better spatial cognitive abilities compared to birds at lower milder elevations. We directly demonstrated natural selection acting of spatial abilities at high elevations, which suggested that elevation-related differences are due to differences in selection strength - selection appears stronger at high elevations. In support of this idea, we also documented (a) higher mortality of first-year, juvenile birds at high elevations as indicated by more adult breeders and fewer first-year breeders at high elevation compared to low elevation and (b) higher annual survival rate of adults at high elevations despite significantly harsher conditions. These findings are consistent with elevation-related differences in natural selection. Stronger selection on spatial cognition at higher harsher elevation was associated with lower survival of juveniles during their first winter, overwinter survival of juveniles was dependent on their spatial cognitive abilities &ndash; only birds with best spatial cognitive abilities survive their first winter, and higher survival rates of adults. Birds that have survived their first winter due to better spatial cognition and became adults are better prepared to cope with harsh winter environment and hence they survive better.</p>\n<p>Overall, our results support the hypothesis that both within and between species differences in cognition can be shaped by natural selection associated with variation in environmental conditions providing different demands on cognitive abilities.</p>\n<p>The project provided training to 2 postdoctoral researchers and to 5 graduate students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vladimir&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pravosudov</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583094045626__DSC5587--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583094045626__DSC5587--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583094045626__DSC5587--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vladimir Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vladimir&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583093850515_MOCH_lastday_April_2017_1-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583093850515_MOCH_lastday_April_2017_1-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spatial array\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583093850515_MOCH_lastday_April_2017_1-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spatial array\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RFID-based spatial array used to test spatial learning and memory in chickadees</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vladimir Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vladimir&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Spatial array</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583093705502__DSC5088--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583093705502__DSC5088--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583093705502__DSC5088--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vladimir Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vladimir&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mountain chickadee with PIT-tag</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583094514158_Sonnenberg2_LowR--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583094514158_Sonnenberg2_LowR--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mountain chickadee\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351295/1351295_10289787_1583094514158_Sonnenberg2_LowR--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain chickadee\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mountain chickadee with a PIT-tag getting food from RFID-based feeder, which opens the door only to specific individuals.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vladimir Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vladimir&nbsp;V&nbsp;Pravosudov</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mountain chickadee</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
