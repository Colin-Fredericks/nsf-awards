  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to develop solutions for computer\nnetworks in scenarios where there is significant uncertainty in the\noperating environment.  This uncertainty may manifest as lack of\ninformation about the inputs (e.g., network traffic, computational\ntasks), adversarial threats (e.g., denial-of-service attacks), or\naccidental failures (e.g., dynamic changes in networks, communication\nerrors).  Developing algorithms that work in such uncertain scenarios\nis challenging.  In this project, we have addressed these challenges\nin three different ways.\n\nFirst, we have developed new algorithms for allocating resources in\ndatacenter networks which ensure that critical data processing tasks\nget completed even under threats to the underlying infrastructure.\nThese results offer new techniques for allocating datacenter resources\nin the presence of complex failure patterns.  Second, we have shown\nthat if the communication links within a distributed system are\ncontrolled by an adversary even partially, it is necessary to develop\nrandomized, as opposed to deterministic, methods for exchanging\ninformation to ensure timely sharing of data.  These results also\nhighlight the power of simple local gossip-style protocols that enable\nfast sharing of information.  Finally, we have studied various\ncommunication paradigms (e.g., streaming from a single location to\nmultiple network locations) and have shown how to build network\nstructures that support these paradigms on a given communication\ninfrastructure in a cost-effective manner.  The mathematical problems\nunderlying the design of such network structures are known to be\ncomputationally intractable, and we have shown how to overcome such\nchallenges using new techniques.\n\nThe results from our project will have the following broader impacts:\nimproved allocation of resources in datacenters    that handle virtually\nall of our Internet needs (e.g., email, web services, e-commerce,\ncomputing needs of small businesses); new techniques for sharing\ninformation in networks    under adversarial or natural threats (e.g., ad\nhoc networks in disaster recovery, military communications);\ncost-effective methods for realizing important communication paradigms\nin communication networks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rajmohan Rajaraman"
