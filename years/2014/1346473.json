 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will result in the development of a scalable prototype technology to transform swine manure into a sustainable alternative for petroleum-based construction adhesives. Thermochemical liquefaction processing of swine manure will be used to produce bio-oil which will be chemically modified to produce adhesives. Treatment of swine manure is a worldwide issue; current practices have high cost, both environmentally and economically. The proposed technology addresses these problems by converting swine manure into bio-adhesives which are then used as liquid asphalt for construction applications. The price of liquid asphalt has increased dramatically (by 150% over the past nine years), as refineries are decreasing asphalt production by converting their asphalt binder into synthetic fuel and selling it at a much higher price.  The specific objective of this project is to determine the commercial feasibility and to scale up bio-adhesive technology via the design and construction of a pilot plant.  The pilot plant will be further used to determine optimum heating and cooling rates to develop bio-adhesives with specified rheological characteristics by relating the molecular structure of the bio-adhesive to its mechanical properties, on one hand, and to the bio-adhesive processing parameters from the other side. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a novel and transformative approach to develop sustainable construction adhesives, while also sequestering carbon from manure and providing a sustainable solution to manure management. Currently, more than 6 billion gallons of swine manure are produced annually in the U.S., and all of this waste must be treated.  More than 90% of swine manure is stored in lagoons, with the remainder sold to farmers as fertilizer - with added costs to the hog farmers to store and deliver it. The proposed process will also create a source of revenue for farmers and lead to new jobs related to production of bio-adhesives and their applications. Finally, this technology can lead to a reduction of the U.S. dependence on foreign petroleum resources.",
