 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview:\r\n\r\nThis grant will support a CST cruise on the R/V Atlantic Explorer from Barbados to Bermuda\r\nin May and June 2014. Chief Scientist Training (CST) cruises are part of an educational initiative\r\ndesigned for young US oceanographers, from senior graduate students to junior faculty, to\r\nincrease their participation in seagoing research by educating them about the capabilities\r\nand opportunities provided by the UNOLS research fleet. In addition to providing sampling\r\nopportunities for individual research, a CST cruise is specifically organized to teach cruise\r\nparticipants how to successfully plan and execute a research cruise, from proposal to post-cruise\r\nreporting. Cruise participants will be selected based on the feasibility of their proposed\r\nscience objectives, with an additional goal of maximizing scientific, societal and geographic\r\ndiversity of the participants.\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe ship track covers a oceanographically important transitional area in the western subtropical\r\nAtlantic, and thus the participants will be able to obtain scientifically valuable data in\r\naddition to gaining valuable skills and training that will help them to plan and execute successful\r\ncruises in their future careers.\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThe CST cruise will help develop future expertise in the US oceanographic community by reducing\r\nthe barriers to participation of young scientists in seagoing research, particularly those\r\nscientists from non ship-operator institutions. The activities proposed will help to disseminate\r\ninformation about the research opportunities that are provided by NSF and the UNOLS research\r\nfleet. The training and workshop activities are projected to increase the number and breadth\r\nof future proposals requesting ship support as well as to improve the quality of execution\r\nand success of funded cruises. The CST cruise opportunity will also help to broaden the\r\ngeographic representation of the research community that is involved in ship-based scientific\r\nstudies as well as increase the diversity of this community.",
