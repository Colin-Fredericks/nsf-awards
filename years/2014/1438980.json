In order to ease programmer and user effort in achieving\r\nefficient use of parallel architectures and to enable optimal usage of\r\nparallel hardware both within a single chip and across a data center,\r\nthis project explores the co-design of a fine-grain configurable (down\r\nto the ALU, FPU, Cache bank, fetch unit, etc) architecture along with\r\na software optimizing runtime system which controls the architecture's\r\nconfiguration. This runtime management system understands high-level\r\ngoals and constraints such as optimizing for power, latency, cost, or\r\ncomplex mixed-goals and dynamically allocates fine-grain resources to\r\nmeet the constraints. This project will evaluate and design a configurable\r\nmanycore-inspired architecture and a self-adapting runtime system.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the creation of a complete, scalable,\r\nself-adaptive computing system; and will push the boundaries of\r\nadapting systems by utilizing hardware that is configurable and\r\nmonitorable below the processor core level. By providing such a\r\nflexible and highly monitored architecture to the adaptation runtime,\r\nthis project will explore the scalability of adaptive runtime\r\nalgorithms to handle a game-changing increase in the number of\r\ncontrollable parameters. This project will explore the extent to\r\nwhich it is fruitful to configure a parallel architecture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis work has developed novel computer architectures that can be reconfigured at a very fine-grain level and software optimization systems that can choose how best to configure the sub-components of the processors at a very fine-grain.  These computer hardware designs are reconfigurable below that size of the processor core and can have the number of Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) and cache bank (temporary memory) dynamically reconfigured at runtime.  By dynamically changing the hardware and optimizing the design to the program that is running and the need of the user, the architecture can improve performance, save energy, and optimize for other goals of the user such as completing a task by a certain time or computing a result within a certain cost budget.  An important component of this work is the co-design of a software and hardware system together.  In this work, we created a novel optimizing software framework that we have shown surpasses traditional schemes for optimizing computation.  We studied this in the context of both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing systems as well as in other non-cloud applications.  \n\nWe expanded our work and investigated different pricing models in cloud computing with different optimization strategies in this work and showed different ways for cloud computing users to be incentivized to use cloud computing infrastructure as the cloud provider wanted.\n\nThis work?s has had broader impacts by helping create an open source manycore processor integrating some of the ideas from this work.  Also, this work has helped fund tutorials at major conference venues on this work to enable other researchers to use the results of this work.  This work has had broader impacts by funding students to travel to top conferences in the field.  Last, during this work, the PI of the program has refined and continued to teach a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) in Computer Architecture which has enabled many people to learn computer architecture outside of a formal university setting.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Wentzlaff"
