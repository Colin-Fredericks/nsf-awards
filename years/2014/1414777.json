 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential impacts of climate induced sea level rise on coastal societies are a pressing global issue. The best way to understand sea level responses to climate change is to observe how the processes have proceeded in the past. This research aims to produce and combine high-resolution climate and sea level records so that an interpretation of how the sea level response to climate variation has operated during Late Pleistocene time. The two records will produce direct information on how sea level rose and fell in response to the growth and decay of the major northern hemisphere ice sheets in the Mediterranean.  Under the supervision of Dr. Chuan-Chou Shen, this project will be conducted at the National University of Taiwan.  Dr. Shen is responsible for the refined analytical precision of mass spectrometric dating methods that will allow for radiometric ages with minimal error.\r\n\r\nCarbonate encrustations (CE) are documented above, below, and at the current Mediterranean sea level and stalagmites from the same caves can be accurately dated using U-series methodology, thus precisely constraining the elevation of each sea-level stand and a climate history for the region. Speleothems are sensitive to climate changes as their growth mechanism is linked to Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere. Oxygen and carbon isotopic variations along the growth axis of a given speleothem deposited under isotopic equilibrium conditions are potentially powerful tracers of climatic changes. Dating of fifteen CE and two stalagmites previously collected from Mallorca by means of Multi Collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer will be used to generate ages. The high resolution U/Th chronology of the two stalagmites and the precisely dated CE will provide timelines for past sea level high and low stands and climate variability. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.",

With the potential to cause significant damage to coastal societies, it is crucial that we develop a better understanding of how climate can affect mean sea level and to what degree sea level can fluctuate in response to climate change. Caves along the Mallorcan coast are partially flooded with water that approximates mean sea level of the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 1). Calcium carbonate encrustations (Phreatic Overgrowths on Speleothems: POS) precipitate out of the seawater and encrust onto to the walls and speleothems within the cave (Gin&eacute;s et al., 2012). Therefore by dating POS above and below the current elevation of sea level, a record of past sea level high stands and low stands can be produced (Dorale et al., 2010). In addition, stable isotopes within precisely dated calcium carbonate stalagmites were use to reconstruct the past climate of the western Mediterranean during periods of sea level variation. Oxygen isotopes that eventually become incorporated into the mineral structure of stalagmites fractionate in accordance with climate (Fairfield et al., 2006).
