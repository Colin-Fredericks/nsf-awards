This technology has the potential to radically change current disease diagnosis and treatment techniques. The idea of improving the accuracy of existing diagnostic techniques based on individual nano-biosensors by utilizing a distributed network of coordinated nano-devices, is transformative. This project contributes to a much wider and ambitious vision of advanced health-monitoring and drug delivery systems, using a novel interdisciplinary approach to leverage and combine the state-of-the-art in nano-biosensing, wireless communication and networks, as well as distributed data collection and signal processing.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Description:\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to prove the feasibility of cooperative spectroscopy for real-time in vivo nano-biosensing applications. The ultimate goal is to replace the external independent excitation and measurement system used in classical spectroscopy by a network of coordinated nano-devices, able to both excite and measure the response of nano-biofunctional particles. The benefits of this approach are several. First, the much smaller size and lower power requirements than classical spectroscopy systems will allow the integration of the proposed platform in the next generation of health-centric smartphones as well as new types of wearable devices. Second, the placement of the nanodevices in close contact with the entity to measure on a fingerprint touch scanner or eventually inside the human body, allows for the transmission and detection of low-power, low-noise signals. Third, the collection of the received signal at different nano-devices that collaborate with each other, allows for much more accurate sensing using advanced signal processing for distributed data collection.",

More specifically, we have developed a framework to design plasmonic nano-antennas which allow us to interact with optical signals in the same way as conventional antennas allow us to interact with electromagnetic waves at radio- and microwave frequencies. The developed nano-antennas, when working in conjunction with nano-lasers and nano-photodetectors, can be utilized to both excite and measure the response of intra-body nano-biofunctional particles used in in-vivo nano-biosensing systems. Second, we have experimentally demonstrated ultra-broadband super-absorbing particles with excellent absorption from visible to near infrared frequencies. High absorbing efficiency and broadband frequency response are two key properties that determine the usefulness of such particles. The developed nano-particles can then be functionalized to react only in the presence of specific biomarkers related to a plethora of biological processes. Third, we have characterized the propagation of optical signals inside the human body, by looking at the wireless channel in the same way that nano-devices see it, i.e., as a heterogeneous medium with different types of absorbing and scattering elements, including molecules, cell components, cells and tissues, with different electromagnetic properties. The developed time and frequency domain channel models allow us to define the optimal type of signals to be transmitted with the optical nano-devices (pre-equalization) and the required algorithms to post-process (post-equalization) the detected signals in reception. As a culmination of the project, and by building upon and combining the aforementioned outcomes, we have developed novel sensing architectures and algorithms that can accurately estimate the response of nano-biofunctional particles. We have introduced the concept of information capacity of the sensing system and derived optimal power allocation schemes to increase the reliability of the measurements. The effect of the density of nano-biofunctional particles and molecule noise has been analyzed and the accuracy of the sensing system has been evaluated. Our results show that the cooperative Raman spectroscopy is able to provide accurate estimation of the Raman spectrum, which can be utilized for molecule and chemicals identification.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Josep&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jornet</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1445934/1445934_10315540_1490663771989_complete_system--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1445934/1445934_10315540_1490663771989_complete_system--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Distributed Nano-biosensing System\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1445934/1445934_10315540_1490663771989_complete_system--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Distributed Nano-biosensing System\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nano-devices embedded on a ring cooperatively excite and measure the response of nano-biofunctionalized particles traveling in the circulatory system.
