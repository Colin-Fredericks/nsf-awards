 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California State University, Northridge (CSUN) Noyce Scholarship Phase II project will build on lessons learned from its Phase I project.  CSUN will work closely with Local Districts of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and other area Districts (Glendale, Pasadena, and Antelope Valley), to place program graduates into middle and secondary school mathematics and science classrooms. The overall goal is to increase the quality and quantity of mathematics and science majors entering and remaining in teaching careers, and to track graduates of the CSUN Phase I project. By increasing the number of highly qualified middle and high school math and science teachers (27 new teachers are targeted), the program will help ease acute teacher shortages in these disciplines in the greater Los Angeles area, and increase the diversity of the teacher workforce by especially encouraging the participation of students from underrepresented minority groups in seeking scholarship support. The Phase II Noyce scholars will also benefit from relationships established by working with underprivileged secondary students in Upward Bound and Project GRAD Los Angeles (PGLA) in summer enrichment programs. The program will have a multiplier effect, as those teachers will influence future generations of students in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nNew to the program will be support offered to freshmen and sophomore math and science majors to participate in summer field experiences, with a goal of interesting these STEM majors in teaching careers through early clinical/field experiences. Also new is support for teachers during their initial teaching years.  The project aims to provide professional development opportunities and professional learning communities that keep new teachers connected to one another and to experienced group of teacher leaders. By expanding the conduit for new teachers through Noyce-supported pre-service and in-service activities, new math and science teachers will help to build a robust community of teacher/learners.  Specific components of the program include: (1) academic coursework for the California single subject credential in math or science; (2) summer and academic year practicum/clinical (or field) experiences for freshmen, sophomores and participating scholars; (3) monthly meetings and regional/national meetings; and (4) mentoring during the first year of teaching. All aspects of the Phase I project will be enhanced, including outreach, recruitment, research, and evaluation efforts. Specific research questions the PIs intend to tackle include: 1) How does student teaching (clinical) experience (including school and master teacher placement) impact a preservice teacher during the initial teaching years?; 2) Are there requirements for pre-service math majors (in CSUN's Freshman Year/Junior Year/Secondary Teaching Options) that can be modified to better serve the needs of these students over the long-term and why? (e.g., Would additional field experiences benefit them? How? Which aspects are most useful? Why?); 3) How can CCSSM and NGSS be integrated into pre-service mathematics and science content courses?; and 4) Which professional development activities best train pre- and in-service teachers to teach the new standards of mathematical and science practice? Finally, long-term tracking of graduates will be an important component of the program with respect to formative and summative evaluation, determining if teaching commitments are being fulfilled, and assessing the achievement of project objectives.",
