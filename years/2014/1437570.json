The self-propelled particles, which are sometimes thought of as swimmers, can contribute to the properties of the suspension as a whole.  This project will explore a novel concept called the swim pressure that can help characterize the state of such a suspension. The swim pressure is similar to the usual pressure that molecules in a gas exert on the walls of a container, but in this case the pressure is exerted by self-propelled particles that could be microorganisms, chemically reactive particles, or micro-motors moving through liquid. Preliminary data suggest that the swim pressure and its dependence on particle concentration can be used to predict changes in the suspension, including phase changes, deformation and motion, that cannot be predicted by other theories for active matter.  The project will investigate the swim pressure and its utility in predicting suspension behavior by carrying out a series of numerical simulations. The results will be useful to scientists and engineers who process active matter suspensions in pharmaceutical, medicinal, food and similar industries.\r\n\r\nThe micromechanical origin of spontaneous self-assembly in suspensions of self-propelled particles will be investigated by focusing on the swim pressure exerted by the particles.  Numerical simulations based on Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics and other methods will be used to determine the variation of swim pressure with particle concentration, activity, etc., which can be used to formulate a nonequilibrium equation of state and pressure-volume phase diagrams for the suspension.  Hydrodynamic interactions among the particles will be included in the computations.  The swim pressure will then be correlated with detailed motions of the active particles that can lead to spontaneous formation of clusters, aggregates and other patterns, as well as the overall deformation and motion of the suspension.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA distinguishing feature of many living organisms is their ability to move, to self-propel, to be active. Constituents of ?active matter? systems are capable of independent self-propulsion by converting fuel into mechanical motion, and include both microscopic entities like microorganisms and motor proteins within our cells to large bodies like fishes and birds.  Inanimate, nonliving bodies can also achieve self-propulsion using mechanisms that are different than living organisms, but the outcome of their collective behavior is not necessarily different between living and nonliving active systems.  Indeed, active matter systems of all scales have the tendency to associate together and move collectively, from colonies of bacteria, swarms of insects, flocks of birds, schools of fish, and herds of cattle.  In this research we discovered a general relation between the stress generated in active systems and their diffusive behavior, analogous to the osmotic pressure exerted by Brownian particles or chemical solutes.  The remarkable aspect of this ?swim? pressure is that it predicts that the swarming behavior observed in many active systems is actually an entropically-driven phase transition, and provides the first hint at a ?thermodynamics? of active systems.  The swim stress further predicts that a suspension of active particles can exhibit zero viscosity, becoming a ?superfluid.?  Both the phase behavior and the superfluid-like behavior have been observed experimentally in bacterial systems.  The swim stress, which is a purely fluid mechanical stress generated by activity, has revolutionized the study of active systems and offers the promise that biological behavior may be explained in simple mechanical terms. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John F Brady"
