 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultra-low frequency (3 to 15 minute periods) electromagnetic waves called Pc 5 pulsations have been studied for over 50 years. They are an important magnetospheric phenomenon because they convert energy from one form to another and transmit energy from one location to another.  Although there have been a number of physical explanations proposed for these waves their origin remains unknown. This proposal seeks to determine the origin of one class of these waves ? compressional Pc 5 pulsations. The Principal Investigator of this proposal will be assisted by a graduate student in carrying out this research protocol. \r\n\r\n\r\n These are waves in the Pc 5 frequency range for which there are oscillations along the direction of the background magnetic field. Three mechanisms have been proposed for these waves: drift mirror instabilities due to pressure anisotropies, drift bounce instabilities and injection of blobs of plasma sheet plasma into the inner magnetosphere.  The combination of THEMIS observations near the equator and Cluster observations in polar orbit now makes it possible to determine which of these mechanisms are operating. \r\n The following questions have been identified for study: \r\n1. What mechanism generates compressional pulsations in the dawn and dusk magnetosphere? \r\n2. What are the characteristics of the compressional pulsations, including their spatial extent and latitudinal structure? \r\n3. What mechanism generates the subcategory of compressional waves exhibiting frequency doubling (the frequency of the compression component of the waves is twice that of the transverse components) and how do suprathermal particles respond to the pulsations?",

The different Alfven velocities on four orbits &nbsp;resulted primarily from changes in the plasma density. The density increased from Orbit 1 to Orbit 4 consistent with ionospheric plasma refilling the eroded plasmasphere during the late recovery phase. We tested the hypothesis that the Pc4 pulsations were generated in close proximity to the plasmapause and did not find any direct relationship between the location of plasmapause and the pulsations.&nbsp;&nbsp;We investigated interactions of ULF pulsations with energetic particles such as wave-particle resonance, modulation and particle acceleration. &nbsp;We presented multipoint observations concerning the response of the electric and magnetic fields, plasma and energetic particles in the magnetosphere to an interplanetary (IP) shock on February 27, 2014. The shock produced compressional Pc5 magnetic field pulsations observed by GOES 15 in the morning sector of the magnetosphere and a dusk?dawn oscillatory electrical field in the dayside equatorial magnetosphere with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~ 15 mV m<sup>-1</sup> for a period of 30 min. Figures 2 show response of the energetic particles to the transmitted&nbsp; IP shock. &nbsp;Van Allen Probes observed enhanced fluxes of energetic electrons in the range of energies from 31.5 to 342&nbsp;&nbsp; KeV and their intensity shows a regular periodicity, with periods corresponding to the electric field pulsations. &nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a drift period (panels e and f) in the electrical field of 15 mV/m&nbsp; electron fluxes increased by factors of 21 and 14 at Van Allen&nbsp; Probes B and A, respectively. We interpret these observations as evidence for prompt energization of electrons due to shock induced ULF electric fields with an additional contribution for the initial acceleration from the compressional effect of the shock. We used Van Allen Probes and GOES 13-15&nbsp; multipoint magnetic field, plasma and&nbsp; energetic particle observations to study the spatial, temporal&nbsp; and spectral characteristics of compressional&nbsp;&nbsp; Pc5 pulsations&nbsp; &nbsp;on &nbsp;January 1, 2016. Figure 3 presents three components of dynamic spectra of&nbsp; the magnetic field observations&nbsp; at Probes A and B from&nbsp; 18:30 to 21:10 UT and from 20:50&nbsp; UT to 23:10 UT.&nbsp; The magnetic field dynamic spectra exhibit several broad band enhancements&nbsp;&nbsp; in the range of frequencies from&nbsp; ~ 5&nbsp; mHz to ~ 28 mHz.&nbsp; The strongest power densities in the spectra occur in the Bz component at frequencies of ~5-6 mHz for both spacecraft as expected for the compressional&nbsp; Pc5&nbsp; types of pulsations. Two red arrows in the&nbsp; Bz component at Probes A&nbsp; and B indicate an occurrence of the peculiar&nbsp; pulsations called double frequency pulsations when the compressional component oscillated with a frequency twice as high as that&nbsp; of the transverse component.&nbsp; The enhancement of power densities at frequencies of&nbsp; ~ 25-28 mHz&nbsp;&nbsp; displayed&nbsp; mostly in the radial component <strong>&nbsp;</strong>can be attributed to poloidal Pc4 pulsations generating simultaneously with the Pc5&nbsp; pulsations but likely&nbsp; having a different source of energy. The frequencies of the Pc4 pulsations varied with radial distance. An explanation for this behavior can be given in terms of standing Alfv?n waves along resonant field lines.&nbsp; By contrast, Fourier analysis of the magnetic field observations&nbsp;&nbsp; shows&nbsp;&nbsp; that &nbsp;the compressional&nbsp; Pc5 pulsations&nbsp; exhibited&nbsp; similar spectra at different radial distances.&nbsp; The long duration of the Pc5 pulsations and their nearly constant frequencies indicate that the plasma conditions in the morning sector of magnetosphere were stable for more than two hours. We demonstrated that when&nbsp; the&nbsp; spacecraft were in the vicinity of&nbsp; the geomagnetic equator at&nbsp; local times from 10:00 LT to 12:30 LT&nbsp; Van Allen Probes and GOES 15 observed meridional sloshing of the&nbsp;&nbsp; equatorial wave node&nbsp; confined to the range&nbsp; of&nbsp; Zsm&nbsp;&nbsp; from 0.5 Re to -0.8 Re&nbsp; and its amplitudes did not exceed&nbsp; 1.3 Re We searched for possible solar wind triggers and discuss generation mechanisms for the compressional Pc5 pulsations&nbsp; in terms of drift mirror instability and&nbsp; drift bounce resonance.&nbsp;&nbsp; We report&nbsp;&nbsp; the first evidence for the meridional sloshing of the&nbsp; equatorial node in variations of&nbsp; electrons fluxes&nbsp; and&nbsp; electron density. &nbsp;The &nbsp;results of the project&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; provide&nbsp; some new insights into the global distribution properties&nbsp; of ULF wave&nbsp; and&nbsp; understanding on how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space form or change in response to changes in solar activity and the solar wind.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Galina&nbsp;Korotova</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1207445/1207445_10336869_1577918999863_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1207445/1207445_10336869_1577918999863_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1207445/1207445_10336869_1577918999863_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three components of  dynamic spectra of  the magnetic field observations  at Probes A and B from  18:30  UT to 21:10 UT and from 20:50  UT to 23:10 UT  on January 1, 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Galina Korotova</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Galina&nbsp;Korotova</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1207445/1207445_10336869_1577922206049_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1207445/1207445_10336869_1577922206049_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1207445/1207445_10336869_1577922206049_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Response of the energetic particles to the  IP shock.
