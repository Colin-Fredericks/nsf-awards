 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a CRAY XC-30 HPC Cluster, supports the NCAT Research Computing, Education and Outreach. NCAT is requesting this support for the Research Computing Consortium of the Sciences, Engineering and Technology (ReCoSETC). This system will expand both the capacity and capability of high performance Computing (HPC) at NCAT by increasing the number of CPU cores, memory and disk, and adding a much needed GPGPU capability for applications ranging from computer algebra systems to large scale modeling, simulations, and database processing. This instrument will impact research advances in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Biology, Education, Outreach and Training, Numerical Weather Forecasting (NWF), GIS analysis, Acoustics, Nuclear and Particle Physics. In addition, this cluster will be a significant enhancement for the current ongoing research activities at NCAT including: material science, nano-engineering, weather modeling and the collaborative development of research training and education. The acquisition supports the following projects:\r\n-\tVariable Star Identification and Modeling \r\n-\tIn Silico Investigation on the Potential of Novel Porous Materials for Olefin and Paraffin Separation for Potential Use in Petroleum Refining Processes\r\n-\tModeling and Simulation of Complex Biological Systems \r\n-\tInvestigation of the Origin, Formation, and Propagation of the Pre-Tropical Cyclone African Easterly Waves and Mesoscale Convective Systems \r\n-\tThe Dynamics and Predictions of Orographic Rainfall Associated with Landfalling Hurricanes\r\n-\tAncillary Research Projects;\r\n-\tOutreach to K-12 and the Community\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation supports researchers and their external collaborators in diverse data-intensive science fields such as engineering, atmospheric sciences, energy and environmental systems, physics, biology and bioengineering education and outreach. As a leading producer of African-American baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree-holding engineers, this integrated research instrument will serve as a focal point to promote future collaborations with other academic institutions working on various research topics. This instrument is expected to strengthen education training activities by enabling innovative cross-disciplinary courses and promoting its education outreach activity with K-12 teachers and students. The proposed research at NCAT will promote a seamless integration of intellectual activity with outreach at all levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grant provided the capacity and capability to enhance research at NCA&amp;T.  The CRAY XC30ac computational platform is the centerpiece of the research computing center - Visualization and Computation Advancing Research (ViCAR) at NCA&amp;T supporting research and student training across campus led by the Division of Research and the Computational Science and Engineering Department in the College of Engineering.\n\nDuring the time of this award, there are many students across the colleges whose research relied on this resource, in particular the Numerical Weather Prediction group, Physics, Chemistry and several departments in Engineering whose research could make use of this class of computational platform.  This award also provided for other research groups, such as Business and Economics to expand their computational efforts due to the availability of this reource\n\nViCAR has users from the College of Engineering, College of Science and Technology, College of Business, Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering,  School of Business and others.\n\nViCAR fosters collaboration and provides support for a wide range of computationally enabled research especially Big Data.  The ability to scale research up from the desktop to HPC environments is new to many disciplines but this scaling allows researchers to explore details of their models not viable without the HPC systems.  The system here at NCA&amp;T also provides a step to even larger more complex models requiring other resources, such as at national centers.\n\nStudents at NCA&amp;T are trained in the usage of these scalable resources enhancing their work and improving their skills for future work.  This improves the students' ability to compete for position upon graduation.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth Flurchick"
