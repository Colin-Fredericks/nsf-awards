The properties of these materials can change owing to the contact between the material and solid walls, such as the walls of a container holding the material.  This collaborative project involves the development of a new device and new method to measure the rheological properties of fluids or solids that avoid contact between the sample and solid walls.  The method is called acoustic tweezing rheometry, and it uses acoustic levitation to hold a small sample freely suspended in air or water while applying a force on the material that causes it to deform.  The device then reads the response of the material by recording changes in the shape of the sample as a function of time.  By comparing the shape of the sample with computer simulations carried out as part of the project, the rheological properties of the material can be deduced.  This new instrument will find applications in a diverse array of science and engineering disciplines.\r\n\r\nAcoustic tweezing rheometry will be used to measure properties of active polymeric and biological fluids and soft tissue without artifacts such as contamination, biological activation or gelation due to contact with solid walls. A model will be developed for noncontact measurement of material constants through analytical studies and computational simulation.  The acoustic tweezing technique will be developed and validated for measurement of material properties of viscoelastic fluids.  The method will be applied to biological fluids and soft tissue, including whole blood during coagulation and collagen gel.  Results will be disseminated broadly, including outreach to the biological communities that could benefit from the new method.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are many diseases that either directly or indirectly result in a change in blood's mechanical properties.  When blood is still in liquid form, diseases such as sickle cell disease can result in life-threateningly higher thickness (viscosity) of the blood.  Other disease states and medications to treat them can affect how blood clots, resulting in either slow clotting (hemophilia, for example) or rapid clotting (some post-surgical states)\n\nThe resesrch performed in our project has developed and demonstrated a new way to test for abnormal mechanical changes in blood.  Our technique utilizes acoustic waves to levitate a single drop of blood.  Using only acoustics we can dynamically deform that blood drop and, by applying mathematical analysis, infer the mechanical properties of the blood quickly and accurately.\n\nWe hope ultimately to improve the quality of life for those individuals who suffer from undetected and untreated coagulopathies, or for those who must daily monitor coagulopathy owing to some other disease.
