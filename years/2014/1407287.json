 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the critical information needed to piece together the puzzles of modern astronomy research is carried by wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, such as the long wavelength radio waves and the very short wavelength ultraviolet.  Building instrumentation to see what the human eye cannot is essential to science.  This project aims to develop instruments sensitive to the submillimeter range of the light spectrum, shorter in wavelength than radio waves, but longer than the optical light to which the human eye is sensitive.  The investigators indeed set themselves the very ambitious goal of building a complete spectrograph, or detector system, capable of quantitatively measuring wavelength components of submillimeter radiation, on a single chip made by techniques similar to those used to make microscopic electronic integrated circuits.\r\n\r\nThe detectors used in this effort are classic, low-temperature superconductors, configured as bolometric sensors.  In particular, this investigation will make use of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) made of titanium nitride (TiN), a relatively mature material system and detector design that calls for relatively relaxed line rules.  When devices are ready, they will be deployed on an instrument taken to a telescope.  Demonstration observations will target distant dusty galaxies.  Longer term, the technology to be pioneered here will enable Integral Field Unit instrumentation featuring 2D arrays of spectrometers, a powerful tool in a broad range of astronomical research.\r\n\r\nThese observations should have substantial broader impacts as a technology pathfinder in an exciting new direction in submillimeter instrumentation. The planned training of younger scientists, and the public outreach activities of the senior personnel, will help to communicate this excitement to the profession and the general public.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.",

This technology will enable future instruments with a large number of spatial pixels each of which is able to measure the spectrum of the incoming radiation.  SuperSpec's very small size, wide spectral bandwidth, and highly multiplexed detector readout will enable construction of powerful instruments able to efficiently observe the atomic and molecular spectral lines from the gas present in the earliest galaxies.  Such measurements provide critical information both about the distance to individual galaxies and the properties of those galaxies. Future instruments based upon this technology will provide unique insight into the history of star formation in our universe, including the first stars responsible for the epoch of reionization.\n\nAt the start of this project, our team had simulations and initial prototype detectors with a small number of channels.  We have since scaled that detector technology to 300-channel devices capable of simultaneously covering the entire 1-mm atmospheric transmission window in a frequency range from 195-310 GHz.  We have fully designed and are currently finishing the integration of a new demonstration instrument which consists of three dual-polarization pixels, each coupled to a full spectrometer.  This instrument will be deployed at the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in early 2019 for an engineering run, and will later be available for dedicated observations based upon competitive proposals to the LMT scheduling committee.  Among other science goals, this instrument will be able to use this instrument to identify the spectral lines from a very high redshift (z&gt;5) galaxy in a few hours, dramatically increasing the known number of these rare and important sources.\n\nWhile our principal outcome is the completion of the SuperSpec instrument and demonstrating the viability of this on-chip spectrometer technology, the SuperSpec project has achieved a number of significant technical goals related to a recently developed superconducting sensor, the kinetic inductance detector (KID.)  We have produced and tested exquisitely sensitive KIDs which meet our sensitivity requirements for our instrument. We have also shown that when placed in an instrument with lower stage temperatures they become much more sensitive, reaching a noise equivalent power below 10^(-18) Watts per Hz^(1/2), suitable for a wide range of applications such as very high resolving power spectrometers and balloon-born mm-wave instruments.  We have worked with collaborators to develop a robust multi-tone readout system able to operate all six spectrometers (1800 channels) simultaneously and we have demonstrated its noise performance in the laboratory.  \n\nIn addition to the technical outcomes discussed above, this project has supported the dissertation projects of three graduate students, the training of three postdocs, and research experiences for many undergraduate students. These students and postdocs have all gained significant hands-on experience in cutting-edge laboratory techniques and instrument design.  Collaborators have also presented many public lectures, demonstrations, and lab tours to a wide range of audiences based upon this work.</pre><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/07/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erik&nbsp;Shirokoff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407287/1407287_10333522_1541604025332_01-chip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407287/1407287_10333522_1541604025332_01-chip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SuperSpec 300 channel filterbank on a chip.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407287/1407287_10333522_1541604025332_01-chip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SuperSpec 300 channel filterbank on a chip.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows one of the 300 channel SuperSpec filterbanks.
