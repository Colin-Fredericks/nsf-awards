This teacher preparation project represents a joint venture between the College of Natural and Health Sciences and College of Education as well as local school districts in central Virginia to increase interest, pedagogical skills, confidence and expertise of preservice elementary education teachers to teach science utilizing research-based instructional methods.  The project will pair preservice teachers with science majors and biology faculty to work collaboratively on interdisciplinary projects, allow for field-based experiences that incorporate applied knowledge, practices, and hands-on learning by exposing preservice teachers to practical application of science concepts, enable preservice teachers' participation in professional development conferences and activities; and enhance VSU's College of Education Teaching and Learning Resource Center with science resources.  The project supports both formal and informal learning for thirty (30) pre-service teachers over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated using the Teaching Science as Inquiry (TSI) survey instrument to measure teacher's self-efficacy as it relates specifically to classroom practice.",
