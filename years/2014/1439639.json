 "awd_abstract_narration": "The I/UCRC for Bioplastics and Biocomposites intends to create of transformative new materials and processing technologies as well as the reliable, comparable material data to allow efficient and profitable industrial use of biorenewable, alternative materials. The center team includes experts from the fields of polymer processing, polymer chemistry, materials science, and crop utilization, allowing a well-rounded interdisciplinary approach. The participating institutions have state-of-the-art facilities for polymer processing and characterization to facilitate the development of fundamental understanding of the influence of processing on the thermomechanical properties of biopolymers and biocomposites.\r\n\r\nThe bioplastics industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the US (10% to 20% growth annually). The proposed center effort seeks to take advantage of expressed industrial interest in leveraging research efforts in order to accelerate systematic development of corroborated material data and processing experience for these novel materials. This center intends to train and educate undergraduates, graduate students and post docs as the future scientists and engineers in this area. The center will also prepare web-based videos targeted at K-12 teachers that will provide instructions on how to make easy-to-make, off-the-shelf bioplastics in the classroom. This will provide a pathway to introduce young students to STEM and engage them in green technologies.",

While plastics have greatly increased our quality of life, setting the stage for advances in medical devices, food packaging, consumer goods, and electronics, there are growing reports how these engineered materials are leaving behind a concerning legacy. There are concerns regarding micro-plastics in many of today&rsquo;s consumer goods and even food and beverage products. There are numerous reports about plastics in the oceans and how they impact marine life and our natural ecosystems. An estimated 600 billion paper and plastic cups are distributed worldwide, and most of these are not recyclable or compostable<sup>1</sup>. There is a growing concern among the companies using plastics and synthetic composites as their feedstock about the lack of their fit within a circular economy. Many of them have initiated their projects to develop more ecofriendly materials, for example Starbucks and McDonald&rsquo;s have joined together in an initiative to develop a totally recyclable and/or compostable cup solution that promotes a circular economy<sup>2</sup>. There is the general concern regarding the large amount of plastics that is simply sent to our waste management infrastructure (i.e. landfills) and the global impacts on countries that lack such infrastructures.

These advances are necessary to develop a bioeconomy where renewable feedstocks are converted into benign and biodegradable bio-based polymers, chemical products, and composites that can be substituted for petroleum-based products. The chemical constituents of the renewable feedstocks favor a biorefinery, analogous to a petroleum refinery. Cellulose and hemicellulose, together, can yield sugars for production of biofuels and biopolymers in a biorefinery. Lignin can be used to formulate dispersants, binders, emulsifiers, stabilizers, and extenders.

For example, the center (together with the United Soybean Board and the USDA) funded a project that developed and commercialized fully biobased planting and self-fertilizing containers that can now be purchased from SelfEco through Walmart and Amazon. The horticulture containers, formulated using soy/corn meals, act as natural fertilizers and are degradable in the soil within one to two years and degradable in compost within six weeks.
