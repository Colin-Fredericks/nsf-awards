The Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the International Number Theory Conference at Laval University in Quebec City. The purpose of the CNTA is to enhance and promote learning and research in Number Theory. To advance these goals, the CNTA organizes major international conferences, with the aim of bringing the latest developments in number theory to both students and researchers. One direct impact of NSF funding for CNTA XIII will be the training of a significant number of junior American researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) by giving them the opportunity to participate in the conference and to interact with experts in the field. \r\n \r\nNumber theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Number theorists study questions concerning the fundamental properties of the integers. Although some of these questions may be easily stated, their solutions often employ advanced methods from diverse fields of mathematics. Moreover, theoretical results in number theory have a wide range of applications and have been applied by researchers to cryptography, coding theory, combinatorics, and theoretical physics.",
