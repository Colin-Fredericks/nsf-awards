 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for young scientists to attend the 5th International Symposium on Lepton Moments, devoted to the study of fundamental properties of leptons. Topics covered at the symposium include the searches for permanent electric dipole moments, electron and muon magnetic moments, and lepton flavor violating decays of the muon.  These areas are all of fundamental importance to our understanding of matter and the formation of the universe.  This conference is unusual in that it brings together researchers in atomic, nuclear, and particle physics.  The support of graduate students and postdocs to attend such a conference is critical to their overall training and development as scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are two great mysteries in sub-atomic physics:\n\nWhy are we made of matter when the early universe must have consisted of equal amounts of matter and anti-matter?  \n\nWhat new physics lies beyond the \"Standard Model\" of subatomic physics?  \n\nThese two questions drive the discovery science of the 21st century.   \n\nWithout some new source of a matter-antimatter asymmetry, the equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the early universe should have annihilated into pure energy.  Instead, we live in a universe dominated by matter.   So where did the antimatter go?  The mechanism that could cause this matter-antimatter asymmetry is called \"CP\" violation.  One source of CP-violation has been discovered and is accommodated in the Standard Model.  However, the Standard-Model CP violation is too weak to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry that permits our universe to exist.   One signal of new CP violation would be the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of a subatomic particle.  The searches for EDMs spans a range of systems, from the electron, which is the lightest constituent of atoms, to more complicated atomic nuclear systems.   To date, no evidence has been found for an EDM, but searches in many different systems are being actively pursued worldwide.\n\nTo answer the second question, physicists are searching for the discovery of new particles and forces at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva Switzerland, and in precision measurements of the magnetic dipole moments of subatomic particles.   At present, it appears that the muon, a heavier \"brother\" of the electron, appears to have a magnetic moment that is larger than that predicted by the Standard Model particles and forces.  If confirmed in a new experiment at the Fermilab National Laboratory http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/, it would signify the discovery of new physics. \n\nAnother way to search for new physics is to look for the occurrence of Standard-Model forbidden processes such as muon turning into an electron without the emission of a neutrino.  These processes are called \"Lepton Flavor Violation\". \n\nThe series of Lepton Moments Symposia http://g2pc1.bu.edu/lept14/ have brought together the leading theoretical and experimental physicists working on these problems to meet in an informal environment for a four-day meeting.  The participation of the next generation of scientists, the graduate students and post-doctoral research associates, is an essential part of this meeting.  We live, eat and work together during the meeting.  A graduate student has the possibility of sitting down to a meal with a Nobel Laureate, if he/she chooses to do so.   They also have the opportunity to present their work in a poster presentation, and at each meeting several have been given the opportunity for an oral presentation. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: B.
