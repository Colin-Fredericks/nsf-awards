 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an I-Corps Site project located in the Center for Innovation and Technology Entrepreneurship (CITE) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. UTSA has history of bringing students, researchers, and community resources together to assess market potential of products and ideas. This project builds on those efforts. With the designation as an I-Corps Site, and the NSF resources proveded by this award, CITE will expand the opportunities for nurturing innovation on its campus. \r\n\r\nThis institution has a track record of creating and maintaining a transformational entrepreneurial ecosystem within the university environment to foster, support, develop, and commercialize new technologies. This ecosystem not only contributes to transforming academic cultures but also contributes to competiveness in global markets, increased external funding, and an enhanced educational environment for students and faculty. These activities contribute to the goals of improving Texas' economy and elevate the visibility and success of the UT System by implementing entrepreneurial evolution at the University. Commercialization of Intellectual Property (IP) also impacts the San Antonio region, the University of Texas System, and the State of Texas, attracting further outside investments.\r\n\r\nWith NSF I-Corps designation and the formalization of local partnerships, UTSA's CITE will increase the number of teams yearly from an average of 15, to more than 30. Collaboration described in the proposal, such as with Startech, has the potential to commercialize new innovations in the life sciences, information technology, and engineering.",
