 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project addresses a new cost-effective, environmentally friendly process for producing activated carbon (AC). Prior experimentation conducted by the principal investigator has demonstrated that it is possible to produce AC in small laboratory batches using a new low-cost raw material - coke breeze.  This Phase I project will extend that understanding and test the process at larger scale and in a more industrially-relevant scenario.  This research represents a critical intermediate step towards the production of AC in commercial quantities. The proposed approach is counter-intuitive and demonstrating its feasibility will constitute a technological breakthrough, because prior attempts to convert coke breeze to AC have been unsuccessful. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial since the current U.S. market for AC is large and is predicted to grow at a 10% annual rate to reach 650,000 metric tons by 2016. This growth is precipitated in large part by recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations concerning emissions from coal fired power plants and drinking water standards.  Application of the new technology will decrease raw material costs by two-thirds and production costs 40 percent versus competing materials. The availability of lower cost, higher quality AC will permit its wider application with significant societal benefits.  The environmental implications of this new technology are equally important.  It is anticipated that use of the new technology and the alternate raw material will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing by 40-50%, and will virtually eliminate the release of toxic airborne emissions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe stated objective of Forest Vue Research's NSF funded Phase I (award #1345503) was to determine if high value activated carbon could be produced from a low value steel mill waste.  The steel mill waste studied was metallurgical coke breeze.  Metallurgical coke breeze is a industry term that describes small pieces (typically less than 3/4\") of metallurgical coke that is too small to be used in the blast furnace for iron making.  One of the major reasons for pursuing an alternative production route for activated carbon is that the U.S. is the world's largest market for activated carbon with consumption currently exceeding domestic production and the market for activated carbon in the U.S. is poised to expand significantly, primarily due to recent EPA regulations to control mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\nEighty-one tests were performed using Forest Vue Research's bench scale activation equipment.  The equipment consisted of a vertically mounted high temperature (1850 oF) tube furnace, steam generator, 3/4\" diameter quartz tube sample holder, and associated laboratory equipment.  Simply stated, a test run consisted of placing a pre-weighed sample of coke breeze into the quartz tube which was then lowered into the pre-heated tube furnace.  The bottom of the sample tube was connected to a source of activating gas (steam or carbon dioxide).  After an appropriate activating period, the sample tube was removed and the sample was recovered, cooled and re-weighed.  Recovered samples were packaged and shipped to the Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research for Iodine Number determinations.  The Iodine Number is the most widely accepted test method to determine an activated carbon's adsorption capacity.  Commercially viable activated carbons typically have Iodine Numbers of 600 - 1000.\n\nThese eighty-one tests were conducted using the direct parametric variation method wherein only one or two variables were changed at a time and variables were selected from prior analytical results and literature research.  Variables selected for the tests are listed below:\n\nActivation time - 5 to 90 minutes\nTube Furnace Temperature - 838 oF to 1850 oF\nSource of Coke Breeze - 3 different coke plants\nActivating Gas - H2O, CO2, O2\nInitial Coke Breeze Particle Size - 45 microns to 9.5 mm\nSteam Rate - High, Low, Pulsing\nFixed Bed and Fluidized bed\nWater source for steam - distilled, city, well\nCoke Breeze Moisture Content - 0 to 20%\nHeating Rate - 1 minute to 1 hour\nIntercalation compounds - alkali metal compounds\nWater Gas Reaction Catalysts\nCoke Breeze Pre-treatment - freeze/thaw, surfactant, sonication\n\n\nNone of the eighty-one test results produced commercially viable activated carbon.  Given that commercially viable activated carbon typically has an Iodine Number greater than 600.  The highest value achieved in our tests was 381 and only 20 tests showed Iodine Numbers greater than 200.\n\nOur results showed that significant amounts of carbon (up to 66% by weight) was removed during the activation trials based on pre and post weight loss; however, micro-pore size (less than 20 angstrom diameter) formation did not readily occur.  It appears that the carbon forms present in coke breeze are resistant to micro-pore formation.  High micro-pore formation is what makes activated carbon such a valuable industrial product.\n\nBased on some minor trends observed during the activation trials, Forest Vue Research will continue with a limited number of self-funded trials to ensure that we did not overlook any potential activation options.\n\nThe principal investiagtor and all those at Forest Vue Research would like to personally thank the very professional NSF organization and especially our Program Director, Ben Schrag, for his expertise, guidance and support during this Phase I project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Barkdoll"
