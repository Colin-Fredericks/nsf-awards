 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the SoLEAP Program at Old Dominion University (ODU) is to provide academic, social and financial support to approximately 36 talented, motivated, and financially-needy students enrolled in the photovoltaic Solar Engineering Academic Program (SoLEAP). SoLEAP at ODU impacts student success and addresses the urgent need for well-trained energy scientists and engineers at both regional and national levels. SoLEAP scholars receive access to innovative academic training, mentoring, and career development/transition programs that help them enter into the solar energy sectors with the expertise needed for successful careers. The program expands and advances the solar engineering workforce to become globally competitive in photovoltaic industries. \r\n\r\nThe SoLEAP program at Old Dominion University is an educational program that incorporates innovative academic strategies with resources needed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to confront problems in the rapidly changing field of photovoltaic technology. The academic support approach combines virtual and physical hands-on activities and project based learning. Student support programs are improved by using reciprocal mentoring/peer mentoring programs and social networking by a peer-learning community of students.  Academic success is fostered through support provided for career development and career transitions through collaborative research and industry-based projects with local industry partners, academic and national laboratories.  The comprehensive academic training and mentoring programs prepares students with the skill sets essential to photovoltaic technologies. To maximize student learning, integrated modules of theory, virtual learning, and hands-on experience complement theory-based lectures with project-based learning. In addition, reciprocal mentoring between students and faculty/industrial partners is practiced for transformative support of success in completing degrees, career counseling, development, and transition. A SoLEAP mentoring cohort consisting of undergraduates and graduates forms reciprocal and peer mentoring networks in which more experienced students mentor less experienced peers. SoLEAP offers comprehensive training and career development programs to help students as they transition between their academic and professional careers. The project includes efforts to make the project results known to the broader STEM education community.",
