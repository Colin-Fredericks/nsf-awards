 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support to the national biennial conference of the Reinvention Center.  The Reinvention Center was formed in 2000 to support the recommendations of the Boyer Commission in the widely read publication: \"Reinventing Undergraduate Education, a Blueprint for America's Research Universities\" (1995).\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this Reinvention Center Convention is to re-establish the Reinvention Center as a force in achieving the goals of the Boyer Commission and to connect directly with major college and university associations. The first plenary will be a panel discussion entitled\" \"Twenty Years after Boyer, Research Universities' Enduring Promise to Undergraduates: the Ethos of Discovery Matters.\" \r\n\r\nThe goals of the Boyer Commission are:\r\n1. Make Research-Based Learning the Standard \r\n2. Construct an Inquiry-based Freshman Year \r\n3. Build on the Freshman Foundation \r\n4. Remove Barriers to Interdisciplinary Education \r\n5. Link Communication Skills and Course Work \r\n6. Use Information Technology Creatively \r\n7. Culminate with a Capstone Experience \r\n8. Educate Graduate Students as Apprentice Teachers \r\n9. Change Faculty Reward Systems \r\n10. Cultivate a Sense of Community \r\n\r\nThis Reinvention Center conference will lay the groundwork for an evaluation of how consortia of universities can deliver on the promise that research universities provide a distinctively valuable undergraduate educational experience.  The conference will launch a cluster of collaborations, each comprised of a network of faculty, staff, administrators, and other educators that will be supported on a continuing basis.  Five new networks will be launched: (1) Applied Analytics; (2) Science of Learning (and Pedagogical Innovation); (3) Curricular and Co-Curricular Integration; (4) Distinguished Teaching Scholars; and (5) Student Success.  Each of these will include disciplinary subgroups including STEM fields. (Already established are focused networks of (1) directors of undergraduate research programs, (2) assessment specialists and STEM educators, and (3) writing-to-learn experts.  These networks have functioned effectively since their formation.]",

The grant referenced in this report supported the November 2014 conference held in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe 2014 conference theme was Engaged Learning and the Ethos of Discovery &ndash; Achieving the Promise in a Tumultuous Era. The \"promise\" referred to in the theme was the Boyer Commission\u00c6s over-arching commitment to providing distinctive opportunities for undergraduate students in research universities to have an educational experience characterized by engaged learning and inquiry.  The conference agenda was designed to expand the Commission\u00c6s original focus on active, engaged learning to include co-curricular learning and curricular/co-curricular integration to promote student success.\n\nThe conference agenda was also designed to focus on the many changes since 1998 that have made the contemporary period in higher education so tumultuous.
