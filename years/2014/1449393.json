 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks support for a UC Biomedical Research Acceleration, Integration, and Development (UC BRAID/CAI) I-Corps Hub consortium, a coordinated effort among the UC medical campuses with the goal of facilitating translation and accelerating promising technologies at the UCs. The campuses include: Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. The program will implement a training and education curriculum in order to train entrepreneurs on the UC BRAID campuses by leveraging the infrastructure of the UC Center for Accelerated Innovation (UC CAI) housed at UCLA, along with the NSF-approved LLP curriculum - through accessing the experience and knowledge that helped draft the initial Lean Launch Pad for Life Science/Healthcare (that was hosted by UCSF). The course will provide real world, hands-on education and training on what it is needed to start a scalable company.  \r\n\r\nThe I-Corps Hub will leverage UC CAI's training and education emphasis and be able to provide: 1) world-class scientific and clinical research that generates a flow of technologies which are potentially on the brink of commercialization; 2) leadership in NSF I-Corps education for life science/healthcare that will help deliver a strong offering to its component campuses; 3) utilization of the infrastructure built by the UC CAI to deliver education and training components across the UC campuses (as well as across departments and schools) to attract entrepreneurs at all levels; and 4) robust and proven curriculum that encourages entrepreneurship, networking, interdisciplinary team building and world-class teaching and mentorship to all levels of interested entrepreneurs.",
