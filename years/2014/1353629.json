 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop advanced versions of a hidden and noninvasive balance device that can be used for balance assistance for people with vestibular dysfunction. Vestibular patients experience imbalance due to loss of vestibular feedback, which may result in an increased risk of falling, reduced activity levels, and in some cases, a significantly impaired life. Phase I of the project has successfully demonstrated a first-generation device that can be worn entirely inside the oral cavity and provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement to patients. The prototypes to be developed in Phase II will be market-oriented, user friendly, and robust for extended use in mobile environments. Research in Phase II will include 1) implementation of a wirelessly controlled intra-oral device; 2) exploration of designs that provide more sensitive perception of the feedback, reliable contact at the palatal interface, and a robust user experience for long-term use; and 3) evaluation of the device performance on human subjects through collaboration with health professionals on vestibular assessment and rehabilitation. Market-oriented prototypes will be developed by the end of Phase II, tested by vestibular patients, and supported by medical professionals from an expanded list of balance centers/clinics.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will be a hidden and noninvasive assistive device to treat vestibular imbalance.  Currently, there is no practical device currently available to provide in-situ sensory feedback of head movement for patients with vestibular loss.  The product from the proposed Phase II research will capture this great market opportunity with its unique features while assisting vestibular patients in balance control wherever they go. The benefits to people with vestibular disorders are enormous as the device has the potential to help them to gain confidence in social settings, mitigate secondary problems associated with vestibular loss, and enable them to live a healthier and more enjoyable life. In addition, the device offers new opportunities for health professionals in the field of vestibular rehabilitation to conduct research on motion, imbalance, and treatment. Also, it provides a new tool for neuroscience researchers to study the role of multisensory integration on balance and perceptual learning involving use of alternative sensory feedback. The palatal stimulation technology may have potential in other applications where hidden, noninvasive, and hands-free sensory feedback is desirable.",
