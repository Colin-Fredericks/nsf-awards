 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-cell fusion is an essential process in most multicellular organisms. In filamentous fungi, formation of cellular networks via fusion of cells is essential for movement of nutrients, which has an immediate applicability to industrial fungus control. In order to interact with one another and respond to environmental cues, these fungi communicate via chemical languages using extracellular signals and cellular responses. This project will study the molecular mechanisms of specific signaling proteins that localize to sites of interaction between cells in order to provide a model to understand signaling between genetically identical cells. The project offers an interdisciplinary training opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral associates (including members of underrepresented groups) who will conduct live cell microscopy, as well as genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology experiments. They will present their work at national and international conferences, and they will have opportunities to author publications on their research. In addition, biological images and movies developed as a result of the proposed research will be distributed to other Universities and mycological organizations nation-wide as teaching material at undergraduate level and for the public at large.\r\n \r\nThe elucidation of chemical communication in fungi is important for understanding their role in nature and serves as a molecular paradigm for cell-cell communication. Understanding at molecular scale the homotypic fusion of filamentous fungi has the potential to uncover a new paradigm, that is, a novel mode of establishing specific communication and fusion between related cells. In Neurospora crassa, the attraction of cells to each other, and subsequent fusion, requires a precise regulation of protein localization and activation which is dependent upon reception of chemical signals. Analyses of wild specimens of N. crassa indicate that different chemical languages (i.e. dialects) determine whether or not fusion will occur between genetically different specimens. This project will study the molecular mechanisms of specific signaling proteins that localize to sites of interaction between cells in order to provide a model to understand signaling between genetically identical cells. Using genomic comparisons between wild specimens, the genetic basis of the chemical dialects will be determined.",

In microbes, such as filamentous fungi, sensing and communication between genetically similar (or identical) individuals is important for mediating the development of the multinucleate syncytial vegetative colony that is characteristic of this group of organisms (Fischer <em>et al., Genetics</em> 2018). Germinated asexual spores (germlings) of filamentous fungi, such as <em>Neurospora crassa,</em> engage in chemotropic interactions with cells that share identity at recognition loci. Once contact between germlings is established, cells will initiate the process of cell fusion, in which cell walls are remodeled, plasma membranes fuse, and ultimately the two cells become one with a shared cytoplasm. Cell fusion between hyphae within an individual colony reinforces network architecture and influences the flow of resources throughout the colony. Cell fusion between germlings and between hyphae in filamentous fungi is a fitness attribute that contributes to more rapid colony establishment and exploitation of resources. Over 70 genes have been identified in filamentous fungi (primarily <em>N. crassa</em>) that are involved in kind recognition, chemotropic interactions, and cell fusion (Fig. 1) (Fischer <em>et al. Front Microbiol</em> 2019). While the hypothetical signal(s) and receptor(s) remain to be described, a dynamic molecular signaling network that regulates cell-cell interactions has been revealed, including two conserved mitogen activated protein (MAP)-kinase cascades, a broadly conserved STRIPAK signaling complex, transcription factors, a NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species, cell wall integrity sensors, actin, components of the secretory pathway, and several other proteins.
