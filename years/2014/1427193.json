 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to establish a user-centered optimal design framework for customized lower-extremity exoskeletons, in which human-exoskeleton physical interactions and dynamics can be predicted and optimized to provide design requirements.  The objectives are to establish: (1) mathematical models of disability parameters, performance indices, and desired/task-failure motions; (2) formulations for constraint status, contact load, and coupled dynamics; (3) optimization method of contact load distribution; (4) sensor integration for required data and experimental validation; and (5) prototype design modification, fabrication, and usability tests.  This research will open a new paradigm for systematic characterization of disability parameters and the desired motions from engineering perspectives, leading to user-specific mathematical models.  The potential to reduce the need for involving human subjects as part of the design iteration loop will result in accelerated development and better performing assistive devices at reduced cost.  Given the growing number of individuals who would benefit from customized exoskeletons as assistive devices, this project will have broad social impact by resolving major hurdles to their widespread use.  This research will be integrated into comprehensive education and outreach plans for minority students and individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm with controlled infeasibility will provide physically valid solutions of task failure as well as desired motions for integrated human-exoskeleton systems.  The concurrent formulations for constraint status/loads and coupled dynamics will resolve the problems of incorporating physical interactions into optimal motions.  As a novel design method, this project will introduce optimal contact load distribution subject to exoskeleton dynamics and transformation of a complex design into a dynamically equivalent model.  The feedback loops in the design framework will serve as self-evaluation/contingency plans.  This research will transform exoskeleton technologies through user-centered design and predictive evaluations by systematically considering end-user requirements and limitations right from the beginning and at each stage of design.  Project outcomes will represent a significant breakthrough that will bring exoskeleton technologies to the next level by (a) functioning as a central hub that systematically connects and integrates relevant disciplines; and (b) providing customized design, reduced design cycle, optimized systems with light weight and natural motion, and improved user comfort and safety.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual merit:  The research goal of this project was to establish a user-centered optimal design and analysis framework for powered lower-limb exoskeletons.  Metrics for stability and energetics were formulated for design and performance analysis.  In particular, since the assessment of fall risk during robot-assisted locomotion is crucial for gait control and operator safety, a theoretical-algorithmic framework that estimates the balanced and falling states of a two-dimensional model of general biped systems in the sagittal plane was established.  Comprehensive and univocal definitions of the states of balance of a legged system were introduced with respect to the system?s contact with the environment.  Theoretical models of joint-space and center of mass (COM)-space dynamics under multiple contacts, distribution of contact wrenches, and system parameters were established for their integration into an optimization formulation.  The balance stability capabilities of a biped system were quantified by a partition of the state space of the COM position and velocity.  The boundary of such a partition provides a threshold between balanced and falling states of the biped system with respect to a specified contact configuration.  Through the computed stability boundaries, the effects of different contact configurations (single support and double support with different step lengths) on the system?s balance stability capabilities could be quantitatively evaluated.  For the purpose of this study, Mina v2, a powered lower-limb robotic exoskeleton developed through this collaborative project by the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC; Pensacola, FL), which demonstrated human-like gait and won the 2nd place in the 2016 Cybathlon competition (Zurich, Switzerland), was used as the main platform.  The properties of the Linear Linkage Actuator, which is custom-designed for Mina v2, were analyzed to obtain mathematical models of torque-velocity limits.  Using the equivalent mechanical model of the combined human-exoskeleton system, the stability regions of Mina v2 were computed, based on which, its locomotion stability and the implications in the role of crutches and controllers were evaluated.  The results indicate that, for the given gait, the fore-aft balance stability can be maintained without using crutches during most of the times (see the attached figure), implying the major role of the crutches for the lateral stability.  For comparative analyses, the stability regions for sagittal-plane walking of a bipedal robot and healthy human subjects were also evaluated in a similar manner.  The results showed overly-balanced and inefficient walking by the biped robot, in contrast to the unbalanced but efficient walking by healthy humans.  These different walking stability characteristics between the robot and humans will provide the guidelines for the designs of future lower-limb exoskeletons. \nBroader impacts:  The research was integrated into comprehensive education and outreach plans in various aspects.  Three Ph.D. (including one female), one master, and one REU students were directly supported through this grant, which also enabled them to participate as mentors in two of NYU?s annual summer K-12 STEM programs (attended by a total of ten high school students and six teachers, including several minorities and females).
