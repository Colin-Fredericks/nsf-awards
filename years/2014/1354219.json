 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of plants on earth harbor fungal endophytes within their healthy leaves. These endophytes enhance plant physiology and defense against pathogens, and shape the productivity of crops and wild plants. It was recently discovered that endophytes harbor their own endosymbionts -- endosymbiotic bacteria that live within fungal tissues (endohyphal bacteria). Fungal traits such as stress tolerance and cellulose degradation are enhanced by bacterial symbionts, suggesting an important, yet previously unknown, role in structuring beneficial relationships between fungi and their host plants. Broader impacts will directly reach high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and the public via a rotating display in the University of Arizona Mycological Herbarium, an extensive series of workshops for students at a large, urban, Hispanic-serving school, field experiences and laboratory internships for high school students, training for high school teachers, development of curriculum to achieve State of Arizona science standards, integration of project material into undergraduate courses at the University of Arizona, and mentoring junior researchers at multiple life stages. More broadly, the work will contribute to a new understanding of the factors shaping one of the most important, but least-studied, symbioses in which plants engage,thereby contributing to human health and sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the hypothesis that phenotypic variation in endophytic fungi, and the outcomes of their associations with plants, reflect a major role of endohyphal bacteria. Using tractable model systems, the specificity and lability of these associations and their outcomes will be tested. Transcriptomics will be used to identify how bacteria and fungi communicate, and to determine which pathways are upregulated in these dynamic symbioses. Overall, examining the diversity, plasticity, specificity, and gene expression associated with phenotypic effects of bacteria on fungi in the lab, in experimental plants, and across an environmental gradient will clarify the ecological importance of this tripartite symbiosis.",

Our project investigated the influence of bacteria that are associated with, able to colonize, and can survive within fungal cells in a facultative manner. Over the course of this award, we have developed new methods to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the ability of bacteria to associate with fungi, have established model systems to investigate molecular details that enable such interactions, and have shown that the presence of endofungal bacteria can dramatically shift fungal phenotypes in ways that could impact important biogeochemical cycles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this award, we know relatively little about how relationships between facultative endofungal bacteria and their hosts were established and even less about physiological changes that bacteria can impart on these fungi. Over the course of this project we have successfully demonstrated that only a subset of bacteria can colonize a subset of fungi, which suggests that bacteria may have active colonization systems that are potentially matched by some type of fungal immune system. Using microscopy, we have definitively proven that these bacteria can be found inside of fungal cells which is a major step forward in investigating these interactions. We have carried out broad ranging analyses to identify the particular pathways that are turned on when bacteria interact with these fungi, analyses which point towards the production of antibiotics by fungi being a major factor structuring these relationships. Lastly, we have shown that presence of facultative bacterial symbionts can shift interactions between fungi and living plants and dramatically alters the ability of fungi to decompose plant material. Results arising from this project have spurred a variety of new avenues of research investigating how relationships between bacteria and fungi are structured under natural conditions, and will enable future experiments to dissect the fine scale genetic and genomic bases of these interactions.
