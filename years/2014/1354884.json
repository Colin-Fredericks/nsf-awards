 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens are symbiotic associations between a fungus and one or more algae or cyanobacteria. They perform critical ecological functions such as soil stability and water purification in many ecosystems. The lichen genus Sticta plays these roles in forest and woodland ecosystems in temperate and tropical regions. Due to their large size and capacity to store and release large amounts of water, these lichens contribute to the water cycle, including in regions that are water reservoirs for urban areas. Most species contain cyanobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen and thus function as biological fertilizers. Sticta species are particularly sensitive indicators of ecological disturbance, air pollution and global climate change, and have therefore disappeared from many habitats over vast geographical regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Although Sticta includes 120 species, genetic data suggest that perhaps as many as 400 species await discovery throughout the world, particularly in tropical mountains. An international team of researchers seeks to fully elucidate Sticta diversity using modern genomic approaches, and reconstruct its evolutionary history to further our understanding of the role of global climatic shifts and geological events on the diversification of these symbiotic fungi.  This knowledge is critical in understanding and conserving their important ecological roles they play for our society.  The project also contains components of citizen science and outreach materials aimed at public education and ecotourism.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together a broad array of tools to elucidate the evolution and diversification of Sticta within a framework of historical biogeography, including a combination of traditional and next-generation DNA sequencing methods, to test the viability of DNA barcoding for a large lichen fungal genus. The research will begin with targeted collection of Sticta specimens which will be used for DNA sequence and morphological analyses. Using phylogenetic methods the project will infer species delimitations, divergence dates among lineages, biogeography, ecological niche and morphological character state reconstructions. Novel approaches that effectively integrate molecular and morphological data are implemented. This includes morphology-based phylogenetic binning to place historical type specimens within the molecular phylogeny.  These tools will resolve the biodiversity questions within Sticta and generate tools essential to their identification.  The evolution of phenotypes and photosymbiodemes (lichens that include two different types of photobionts) and their importance for the understanding of morphogenesis and interactions of fungal and algal or cyanobacterial partners in lichens will be studied. The project trains two postdocs and includes two international workshops.",

They are important elements in terrestrial ecosystems, as pioneers in soil formation, as buffers in the water cycle, and by providing nutrients through atmospheric nitrogen fixation. They are also sensitive biomonitors of environmental changes, such as pollution and perturbation. The family Lobariaceae forms large, conspicuous macrolichens that dwell particularly under humid conditions in well-preserved ecosystems. In order to explore the ecological importance of these lichens and their potential applications in environmental biomonitoring, in this project, we assessed their evolutionary history and the correct delimitation of species. Such baseline data are indispensable to evaluate their importance and establish biomonitoring protocols. We thereby focused on the flagship genus <em>Sticta</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Traditionally it was assumed that lichens, including the genus <em>Sticta</em>, have large, often intercontinental distributional ranges. This has implications for their importance and use, as the assumption was that most species occur everywhere. To test this assumption, we employed a broad array of methods in an integrative approach to assessing the evolution and species delimitation in the genus <em>Sticta</em>. This encompassed data on morphology, anatomy, and chemistry, within a framework of DNA sequence data including DNA barcoding and entire genome data, for the fungus and for the photosynthetic partner. <em>Sticta</em> is the first lichen genus to be studied with such a broad approach at a global level and hence we consider this project a model for similar studies, including new methods to quantitatively delimit species based on genome similarity.</p>\n<p>Our results showed that the diversity in the genus <em>Sticta</em> (and in other Lobariaceae) is much higher than previously assumed. At the onset of the project, approximately 120 species of <em>Sticta</em> were recognized, and now we distinguish nearly 400, a more than 3-fold increase! DNA barcoding using the ITS fungal barcoding marker worked well to distinguish morphologically similar lineages in almost all cases. However, for very recently evolving lineages, we developed a new protocol based on the genome skimming approach that enabled us to recognize very fine lineage diversifications. Both methods were applied in an exemplary fashion to a clade of species in New Zealand that serve as environmental biomonitors to assess the conservation status of forest remnants. Prior to our study, two species were recognized that did not exhibit accurate monitoring capabilities. With our study, we now distinguish five species based on DNA barcoding and genome skimming, with the three newly recognized species being excellent indicators of a well-conserved forest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In general, we also found that most species have clear geographic patterns, being restricted to a continent or region and often endemic in island biota. In fact, the results of our study suggest that the evolutionary history of lichens in archipelagoes such as Hawaii or Galapagos has to be rewritten: before, endemism for lichens was estimated at less than 20%, and our results required a correction at least for Lobariaceae to about 80% endemism, which has dramatic implications for conservation efforts in these much-altered island biota. There is also evidence for rare long-distance dispersal and some of this may have been caused recently by humans.</p>\n<p>The genus <em>Sticta </em>and other genera in Lobariaceae are unique in forming associations with green algal and cyanobacterial partners, often at the same time, with quite distinct morphologies. We found a surprising flexibility of the fungus to associate with different, unrelated groups of green algae, which allows species to survive in different habitats. Our estimates suggest that the genus <em>Sticta</em> originated about 30 million years ago during the Oligocene (34 to 23 million years ago), an important geological epoch that led to the evolution of modern ecosystems as they are known today. <em>Sticta</em> evolved most probably in southern South America and subsequently diversified during the Miocene (23 to 5 million years ago), an epoch which saw slow climate cooling and dwindling of forest ecosystems. Our analyses found diversification rates to correlate particularly with the uplift of the Andes in South America, which explains the very high number of species in the Neotropics; for instance, only for Colombia, we have now an estimation of nearly 200 species!</p>\n<p>Finally, our novel genome skimming approach (target-enrichment of 400 protein-coding genes) for the entire family Lobariaceae, including now 13 genera, resulted in evidence for so-called reticulate evolution and rapid diversification among the focal genera. This explains why certain relationships among lineages cannot be fully resolved, although we did find higher resolution compared to previous DNA studies and we have some evidence that the genera <em>Pseudocyphellaria</em>, <em>Podostictina</em>, and <em>Yarrumia</em>, all either most diverse in or endemic to the Southern Hemisphere, are most closely related to <em>Sticta</em>. We also found that the family Lobariaceae rapidly diversified near the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (66 million years ago), at the same time when the last dinosaurs became extinct.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thorsten&nbsp;Lumbsch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354884/1354884_10321548_1540806838748_DSC_3614--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354884/1354884_10321548_1540806838748_DSC_3614--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Flagship lichen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354884/1354884_10321548_1540806838748_DSC_3614--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Flagship lichen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sticta lumbschiana from Colombia, one of the many new species discovered during this project.
