 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, massive astrophysical objects can produce gravitational waves, which are ripples in the geometry of space-time that travel outward at the speed of light.  Scientists around the world are currently building and refining exquisitely sensitive instruments, named LIGO in the U.S. and Virgo in Europe, to detect these tiny ripples directly for the first time.  These instruments are expected to detect signals from colliding neutron stars, black holes, and/or other sources starting in a few years.  The work supported by this award will increase the science value of LIGO-Virgo data by enabling rapid communication and joint analysis with astronomers who may see the same events using optical, radio, X-ray or gamma-ray telescopes--\"multi-messenger\" science. Among other things, this work has the potential to test theories of the origins of short gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts, two types of brief enigmatic signals seen by astronomers.  Besides direct scientific results, this research will build cooperation within the scientific community, and results will be shared with the general public through summaries posted on the ligo.org web site and at outreach events.\r\n\r\nBuilding on previous experience, we will pursue two main projects to enable multi-messenger searches.  First, we will play a leading role in preparing the \"electromagnetic (EM) follow-up program\" that the LIGO and Virgo collaborations have committed to supporting.  We will provide software tools and validation to select gravitational-wave (GW) event candidates, assemble relevant information, and send alerts to astronomers who have partnered with LIGO and Virgo to actively search for EM counterparts.  We will facilitate communication among partners and participate in the analysis of any astrophysical events that are jointly observed.  Second, we will implement and carry out joint searches for GW signals and radio bursts detected by large-field-of-view radio telescope facilities such as LWA1.  Combined with the all-sky sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo, this will improve our ability to detect certain types of rare astrophysical transients while suppressing local noise sources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGravitational waves are tiny ripples in the geometry of spacetime, predicted a century ago by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) succeeded in detecting gravitational waves directly for the first time in September 2015 thanks to NSF support of this award, LIGO Laboratory construction and operations, and support of many collaborators in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  Additional events have been detected, each one telling us more about the properties of binary black holes and neutron stars in the universe.  These events also allow us to test Einstein's theory in various ways.\n\nGravitational waves give us unique insights but can be even more powerful when combined with conventional astronomy observations of the same events.  This award has supported the development of \"multi-messenger\" astronomy and astrophysics using such complementary observations.  Dozens of teams of astronomers signed up to search for \"counterparts\" in their data whenever LIGO identified a possible gravitational-wave event, coordinated by software tools, procedures and relationships forged as a result of this award.  The program was expanded to include LIGO's European sister project, Virgo, when it began collecting sensitive data.\n\nWhile the first few events detected by LIGO (and in one case Virgo) had no convincing counterpart (despite determined attempts to find one), the intellectual merit of this research was on full display in the spectacular discovery of a binary neutron star event, named GW170817, associated with a short-duration gamma-ray burst seen by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.  The network of partner astronomers was alerted, and they succeeded in pinpointing the source with optical telescopes and then watching it change color and fade over the course of weeks afterward.  The very thorough optical observations, combined with an early ultraviolet signal and late-appearing X-ray and radio afterglow signals, are revealing a lot about the violent aftermath of the merger.  A joint analysis of radio data supported by this award provides an additional piece of information for the overall picture.  Thus, this project has helped to maximize NSF's investment in LIGO and Advanced LIGO by enabling new scientific discoveries.\n\nBroader impacts of this work include connecting two fields of science -- gravitational-wave and conventional astronomy -- with a new capability that will carry into the future.  This project has also increased the participation of students and underrepresented minorities in scientific research, and disseminated the results from this research to the general public through online materials and live presentations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter S Shawhan"
