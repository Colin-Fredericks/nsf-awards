 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in reducing manufacturing costs in the $32 billion touchscreen module market and eliminating use of the rare-earth metal, Indium. Touchscreen modules are used in mobile phones, computers, point-of-sale terminals, and other display products. Existing methods to produce the transparent conducting film in touchscreen modules require many process steps and have low throughput. . By using much higher-speed processes and greatly reducing the number of process steps, this method enables 80% cost reduction in production of touchscreen sensor films. The phase II project will further develop the process to produce patterned sensor films over large areas and integrate with equipment that scales well to manufacturing. Analysis shows that the payback time on capital expenditure for new equipment required by the process will be under one year. Cost reductions enable gross margin increases of 50% and make US-based manufacturing of touchscreen modules feasible.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high speed laser crystallization (HSLC) of printed aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanoparticle layers on glass to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) for the Touch Panel Industry. Sputter deposition of ITO layers for touch panels has been the Industry standard for many years. Sputtered ITO requires costly vacuum systems with slow growth rates during ITO deposition. In addition, touchscreen sensors require expensive patterning using slow and costly photolithography process steps. Indium is a rare-earth material used in multiple large volume markets which has experienced high price volatility. R&D in Phase II will focus on producing patterned AZO films and working prototypes over large areas with a figure of merit higher than industry standard touch films with a projected cost structure lower than what is currently capable in large volume manufacturing . HSLC rapidly converts nanoparticles into crystalline films with superior properties at energy efficient ambient conditions. The advantages of this environmentally benign process include high throughput, high efficiency, high optical transmission, and low cost.  Technical results will also advance printable electronics for other applications and markets.",
