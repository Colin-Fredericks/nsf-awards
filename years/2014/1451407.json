The symposia will be held in San Francisco, California, in February 2015. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of compilers and parallel programming. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.",
