The award also aims to characterize the mechanical properties of the freestanding nanoparticle films, such as the tensile strength and the Young's modulus, to probe how large the adhesion among nanoparticles can extend in the macroscopic scale.  For some of the nanoparticle films, like the Fe3O4 nanocrystal films, the magnetic properties of the ensemble, such as the magnetic dipolar coupling, can be probed.  Characterization of magnetic properties can provide substantial insight into the coupling between such magnetic nanoparticles.  This new class of materials is likely to stimulate the development of wholly novel varieties of composite materials and device applications, such as anti-corrosion and anti-fogging coatings and freestanding, flexible video display devices.  Diverse and underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students, as well as high school students and secondary school educators, will participate in this project thanks to existing programs, such as the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge Program.\r\n\r\n****Non Technical Abstract****\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award focuses on a study of the assembly and the characteristics of free-standing and transportable macroscopic materials formed from collections of nanomaterials.  The investigation seeks to optimize the conditions for nanoparticles in a solution and for nanoparticles in film form, such that the fabrication of films of nanomaterials in macroscopic sizes can be achieved.  The award also aims to characterize the mechanical properties of the freestanding nanoparticle films, such as the tensile strength, to probe how strong these nanostructured materials can be.  Characterization of magnetic properties can provide substantial insight into the coupling between magnetic nanoparticles.  This new class of materials is likely to stimulate wide ranging technical developments and device applications, such as anti-corrosion and anti-fogging coatings and freestanding, flexible video display devices.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe guiding theme of our work on the electric field assisted assembly and characterization of freestanding films of nanoparticles (NPs) has been to understand what governing forces are involved to cause nanoparticles to aggregate in controlled and (sometimes) ordered fashions, which would provide the greatest amount of self-sticking among the NPs to allow them to freestand without additional support.  This initial idea led to an even more fundamental and integral study to understand how to produce an ordered arrangement of (quasi-)spherical NPs that would possess high integrity, resisting degradation from external effects, like wear or chemical attack. \n\n \n\nOur primary discoveries found that a balance of attractive and repulsive forces among the nanoparticles is critical to produce order among them.  Further, this balance is entirely necessary to yield nanoparticle monolayers (single layers of the spherical particles) or thicker films that possessed sufficient integrity to suppress degradation.  Many of our revelations were achieved using electron microscopy, particularly scanning electron microscopy, and image analysis.  Refining techniques of image analysis and data processing, taken from granular media studies, we were able to probe and to assess how well ordered our NP films were, which allowed us to infer the magnitude of adhesion among our film constituents.  This contribution to the scientific community may find notable value in other areas for which image processing of very small constituents could be of importance. \n\n \n\nThis NSF project contributed to the successful production of one doctoral degree recipient (Dr. Alex J. Krejci, now Professor at SUNY Korea), an undergraduate researcher (Jyotimoy Mandal, now graduate student at Columbia University), and two outstanding high school researchers (Shalom Rottman-Yang and Jyotishka Biswas), both of whom were first authors on publications that emanated from this award.  Guiding the research development of these students has been one of the most gratifying experiences in my professional career.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James H Dickerson"
