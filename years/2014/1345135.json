 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate the origin of the intra-plate volcanic province in Pacific Northwest, with features including the mid-Miocene Steens-Columbia River flood basalt and subsequent Yellowstone and Newberry hotspot tracks. Possible mechanisms we will test include a mantle plume originating from the core-mantle boundary, and volcanism from shallow mantle processes such as slab-driven upwelling flow. Besides geological observations, we emphasize on better constraining deep mantle dynamics including the pattern of mantle flow and the nature of slow seismic anomalies beneath the Pacific Northwest. Our approach is 4-D geodynamic modeling with data assimilation, which involves both high-resolution forward subduction simulations and adjoint convection calculations reconstructing past mantle states. Important model constraints come from the much improved mantle structure revealed by USArray and the well understood Cenozoic subduction history beneath western North America. \r\n\r\nThis proposal attempts to solve for a long-debated issue in the scientific community: formation of volcanisms far away from active tectonic plate boundaries. The Pacific Northwest represents an ideal study region due to the existence of such volcanisms as the voluminous eruption of Columbia River flood basalt ~16 million years ago and the ongoing Yellowstone-Newberry hotspot volcanoes. Origin of these volcanic events has remained elusive because of our poor understanding on the configuration of deep mantle where these volcanisms originate. Now with the USArray seismic experiment finally delineating a 3-dimentional picture of the sub-continental mantle, a better understanding on the formation the Pacific Northwest volcanism becomes possible. To solve this apparently complex problem, we will rely on sophisticated numerical models based on powerful supercomputers. These models will take into account not only surface geologic records, but also the mantle structures underneath, and most importantly the time-evolution of the system since the remote past. Scientifically, the proposed work has impacts on almost every field of solid Earth research. Another important implication of this research is to improve knowledge on the formation of natural hazards and their effects on climate and environment.",

At some places hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from the nearest subduction boundary, i.e., intraplate regions, extensive volcanism may also occur. A good example is the Pacific Northwest where a large volcanic eruption suddenly appeared along a north-south belt from southeastern Washington to eastern Oregon at around 16 million years ago. Since then the volcanism has continued but gradually evolved into two branches, with one moving westward to the present Newberry volcanic field and the other one moving eastward to Yellowstone. This regional volcanic system is traditionally called the Yellowstone Volcanic Province (YVP), and has been attributed to sustained eruption of an underlying mantle plume that presumable originated from thousands of kilometers deep above the Earth's core. However, the plume model has been questioned since it was first proposed in the 90's, due to many non-plume-like properties of the YVP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this proposal, we examine both the model of a deep mantle plume and its alternative models related to shallow subduction processes. Our research approach takes advantage of the modern supercomputing capability and the detailed Earth's internal geophysical image. We systematically evaluate the roles of the sinking oceanic plate, the putative mantle plume, as well as heat sources from the shallow upper mantle. We first reproduced the present-day geophysical image of the mantle by simulating the subduction of the Juan de Fuca slab during the past tens of millions of years. Based on this model, we further incorporated a hot plume beneath Yellowstone and found that the plume is always covered by the slab from above, meaning the plume could not have been the driver of the Yellowstone volcanism. We then took the complex mantle seismic image as a direct model input, based on which we push the convection backward in time using a sophisticated mathematical method. Then we realized that the heat source directly fueling the intraplate volcanism actually originated from the Pacific upper mantle, and that this heat intruded to the underside of the western U.S. through the broken Juan de Fuca slab. To show that this model is physically plausible, we further calculated the rock fabrics deformed during the history of the intraplate volcanism, and found that the modeled fabrics form a large circular pattern geographically centered in Nevada that matches remarkably well with the seismic observations. In another step beyond the original plan, we estimated the change of elevation within the western U.S., and found that the west coast experienced significant uplift since 20 million years ago while regions further east did not, a result consistent with several lines of observations as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/27/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lijun&nbsp;Liu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1345135/1345135_10287919_1558990436119_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1345135/1345135_10287919_1558990436119_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lijun Liu\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1345135/1345135_10287919_1558990436119_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lijun Liu\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of the mantle dynamics beneath the western U.S. The east-west diverging shallow hot mantle fueling the NB-YS hotspot tracks reflects the combined effect of the local returning flow above the Juan de Fuca slab and the long-range eastward flow driven by the former Farallon slab.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lijun Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lijun&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lijun Liu</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1345135/1345135_10287919_1558988074950_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1345135/1345135_10287919_1558988074950_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1345135/1345135_10287919_1558988074950_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interaction of a hot plume with the sinking Juan de Fuca slab.
