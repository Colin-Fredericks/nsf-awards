The project at Central State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. The institution seeks to address low first year retention and persistence in the STEM areas. Central State University recognizes that the need to improve learning practices must be addressed. To address the issue of high unemployment levels for veterans in the state of Ohio, Central State University will increase educational opportunities for veterans in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to improve retention and persistence rates by adopting evidence-based strategies to include: enhancement of the university's cyber-infrastructure for \"anytime, anywhere, anyone learning\"; development and assessment of innovative teaching and learning techniques in STEM curricula; enhancement of undergraduate student research experiences; faculty professional development in effective STEM teaching pedagogy and research; and the creation of new approaches to recruitment and retention of undergraduate STEM students. Through the evaluation plan, the impact of infusion of cyber-pedagogy and integration of experiential learning on traditional students and veterans will be studied and disseminated.",

When students and mentors of all ages work toward the same goals, success is assured when there is commitment to guiding, learning from, and celebrating each other. This collective of guided curiosity, motivation, and potential within a group is the key to success in anything.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Suzanne Marie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Augustus&nbsp;Morris</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">We Care, We Connect, We Cultivate</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the NSF Improving Pathways for STEM Retention and Graduation (IPSRG) program was to increase the number of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Agriculture, and Mathematics) majors, including military associated students, who successfully entered the workforce or pursued advanced STEAM degrees by increasing the recruitment, retention, persistence, and graduation rates through enhanced quality student experiences and remediating gap areas.\n\nThe overarching theme of the IPSRG program was to improve retention and persistence rates by adopting evidence-based techniques including: \n\n*Enhancing Central State University's (CSU) cyber infrastructure      for anytime, anywhere, anyone learning;\n*Developing and accessing innovative STEAM curriculum teaching and      learning techniques;\n*Enhancing undergraduate student research experiences;\n*Providing faculty professional development in effective STEAM      teaching pedagogy and research; and\n*Creating new approaches to recruitment and retention of      undergraduate STEAM students.\n \n\nThe following objectives guided the success of the program:\n\n*Increase      the retention rate of freshmen STEAM majors from 51% to 72% at graduated      rates of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9% per year.\n*Increase      the graduation rate of STEAM majors from 21% to 39%.\n*Increase      persistence rates of STEAM majors through the Junior year from 24% to 39%      at graduated rates of 10% per year.\n*Increase      the number of students engaging in undergraduate research and capstone      courses.\n*Increase      the number of Military associated STEAM majors.\n*Increase the number of students      entering graduate school upon graduation.\n \n\nThe depth and breadth of activities that contributed to successful student experiences and results included:\n\nInfrastructure      Improvement\n\n*Up-to-date instructional technology was incorporated into classrooms across the college where STEAM gateway courses were taught.\n*The institution upgraded internet connectivity and bandwidth across the campus.\n \n\nInstructor Professional Development\n\n*Workshops were offered to faculty to improve teaching effectiveness using Learning Management Software (LMS) and incorporating hybrid or flipped class teaching models.\n*IPSRG partnered with a collaborating program on campus to offer and encourage faculty participation with the Mobile Summer Institute (MoSI) on Scientific Teaching workshops and training offered on campus.\n \n\nStudent Tutoring Support\n\n*IPSRG partnered with Wright State University to offer online tutoring for students.\n*IPSRG returned to traditional and peer tutoring after online tutoring provided less than expected results.\n \n\nEngaging      Students in Research\n \n\n*The IPSRG Team liaised with faculty mentors and undergraduate students for successful research project outcomes.\n*Initial momentum in the number of undergraduate research projects each year increased exponentially.\n*A hurdle that had to be taken was faculty's desire for greater incentives before agreeing to mentor students.\n*The COVID-19 pandemic significantly slowed the growth in undergraduate research participation.\n \n\nDevelopment      of Students\n \n\n*Professional development activities for students included field trips to business partners, graduate school opportunities, guest speakers, conferences, tutoring, etc.\n*Students' motivation and activity levels were markedly increased and improved when they were part of a community of peers and mentors devoted to their own improvement through self-direction and guided objectives.  IPSRG created a successful Community of Practice (CoP).\n \n\nIntellectual Merits and Broader Impacts\n\nObservation      indicates there is strong evidence that student success for STEAM majors is not dependent      on specific technology or teaching models.\n\nNovel      technology and new models of teaching/learning are not a promise of STEAM student success. However, there is sufficient      data to provide evidence that instructional technology advances and new models of      teaching/learning coupled with hands-on learning and mentoring may be      major factors in supporting the academic success of students.\n\nAlso, when students assembled together      focused      on educational and      life goals, a dynamic developed where, collectively, students found the motivation and camaraderie      to manifest positive advancements.  There are      several keys to having such a dynamic emerge and be sustained:\n \n\n*Students must be allowed to explore creative and autonomous thought processes and actions.\n*Students must have the guidance of a set of mentors invested in directing the group toward successful experiences.\n*Rapport must exist between students and mentors.\n*Students and mentors must be willing to support each other through successful experiences over time.\n \n\nWhile      observing the dynamics of the Community of Practice (CoP) created through      IPSRG, successful assemblies of students and mentors have the following      characteristics:\n \n\n*They Care\n*They Connect, and\n*They Cultivate\n \n\nThere is strong anecdotal      evidence to suggest that students can and will be successful in STEAM      majors, careers, and in most other areas of life when they are surrounded      in a nurturing environment with caring mentors invested in allowing      students to grow and develop through guided, autonomous experiences, and      where all successes are celebrated by the assembly.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Augustus Morris"
