 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embryos of many species assess and respond to their environment in ways that matter for survival. Many features and challenges of embryonic life are broadly shared across animals, but frog eggs are particularly tractable to study. Structures such as egg capsules protect and constrain the embryo inside, creating a trade-off of costs and benefits. Upon hatching, animals enter a new environment, with both new dangers and resources. When to hatch is an essential decision embryos make, based on environmental cues. Hatching is also a physical feat that embryos must perform. The ability to assess cues, to exit the egg, and to survive outside the egg all change as embryos develop. Thus, under the same conditions, what embryos can do and what they should do to survive also changes. This project will examine how and why development changes behavior, using embryos of red-eyed treefrogs that hatch up to 40% prematurely to escape threats to the egg. It will assess the importance of maturation, adaptive changes in decisions matched to abilities, embryonic learning, and how embryos use two kinds of information; simple cues of oxygen availability and complex vibrations that can indicate predator attack. It will improve our understanding of embryo lives, behavioral development, and how animals use different kinds of information to make decisions, including broadly important but poorly understood vibrational information. The adaptive behavior of embryos is accessible and appealing, and thus ideal for scientific education and outreach. This project will offer interdisciplinary biology-engineering training for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as Neotropical research and cross-cultural experiences for US students and Latin American interns. The PIs will work with the media, museums, and zoos to disseminate results broadly. They will offer research experiences for teachers and develop online multimedia resources for educators at multiple levels. New methods and tools developed by this project will facilitate other research on embryo behavior and animal responses to vibrational cues. \r\n\r\nThis project is an integrative study of the development and regulation of environmentally cued hatching in red-eyed treefrogs, for which multiple selective trade-offs shaping hatching timing are known. Embryos use cues in at least two sensory modalities for their hatching decision. Older embryos hatch more readily, but even 30%-premature embryos sometimes hatch within seconds of a cue. This project will assess: I) how the speed and success of hatching change across effector development, focusing on hatching glands; II) how sensor development changes sensitivity to cues and cue properties, addressing developmental changes in mechanoreception by the inner ear and lateral line vs. more consistent, early developed, oxygen sensing; and III) how hatching decision rules for responses to simple hypoxia cues and complex vibrational, and potentially tactile, physical disturbance cues are shaped by developmentally changing trade-offs, a history of stage-specific selection, and the earlier experiences of embryos. The team will use (a) histology and microscopy to characterize morphological changes, (b) respirometry to assess metabolic changes, (c) measures of vestibulo-ocular reflexes to assess otic function, and (d) macro-videography to analyze embryo behavior and hatching performance. They will assess ontogenetic changes in hatching under controlled hypoxia, vibration playback, and predator attacks, and develop new playback methods for separating motion and tactile components of physical disturbance cues. Mechanosensory stimuli and hypoxia are common cues for hatching across taxa. Moreover, vibrational signals and cues inform behavior in many other contexts, later in life, and oxygen availability shapes the behavior of many aquatic animals. Results from red-eyed treefrog embryos will advance our understanding of behavioral development and animal information use more broadly. Datasets will be deposited in DRYAD. Outreach materials, including images and video, will be posted on Warkentin's lab website or contributed to the Encyclopedia of Life or National Association of Biology Teachers web resource page.",

In many species, embryos assess their environment and adjust hatching timing to improve survival. However, what embryos can sense, the actions they can perform, and their best response to specific conditions all change as they develop. This project used an integrative study of environmentally cued hatching in red-eyed treefrogs to examine how and why development changes behavior. These frogs lay terrestrial egg clutches on plants above ponds, and their tadpoles develop in water. Threatened embryos hatch early to escape from egg-predator attacks, cued by vibrations, and from flooding, cued by hypoxia; safe embryos hatch when they are older and more developed, which improves their survival in the water.</p>\n<p>This project developed new methods to improve research on embryo behavior and cued hatching. These include: (i) a custom playback system to present controlled motion cues, tactile cues, or both, to embryos across developmental stages; (ii) a \"tadpole rotator\" to measure vestibular sensory function rapidly and with minimal stress; (iii) an \"egg sauna\" to assess embryo responses to warming, (iv) a series of devices to rear embryos individually, manipulate them without inducing hatching, and visualize behavior, and (v) a custom antibody to mark hatching enzyme.</p>\n<p>The project substantially advanced our understanding of mechanisms underlying cued hatching. Red-eyed treefrogs have a novel rapid hatching mechanism that requires precise coordination of hatching enzyme release, to digest a hole in the capsule, and specific embryo behaviors, to exit through it. Behavioral attempts to hatch appear before embryos can release enzyme. Once enzyme release functions, flooded embryos hatch but predator-induced hatching must await the development of mechanoreceptors that sense physical disturbance. Later in development, embryos also hatch in response to drying or overheating, and the onset of darkness cues diel timing of spontaneous hatching. Thus, hatching responses depend on multiple cue types and may be limited by sensory development as well as by hatching ability.</p>\n<p>Many lines of evidence revealed adaptive changes in decision rules congruent with the decreasing cost of false alarms as embryos develop. Younger embryos take more time to assess risk, use slow-to-assess vibration properties as indicators of safety, rarely hatch in response to ambiguous cues, and treat sensory modalities as non-redundant so multimodal cues elicit more hatching. Older embryos decide to hatch more quickly, ignore some possible indicators of safety, hatch in response to ambiguous cues, and hatch as much with unimodal as multimodal cues. Embryos also modulate their risk assessment process and hatching perfomance contextually, with cue type, escaping more quickly from the immediate threat of egg-predation than the slower risk of asphyxiation.</p>\n<p>Considering all the information used for the decision to hatch, adaptive developmental changes in decision rules, and precisely regulated hatching mechanism, environmentally cued hatching appears as well-adapted to challenges facing early life stages as any behavior that animals use later in life. This suggests that our former view of hatching as a passive, invariant developmental process underestimated the potential for natural selection to shape adaptive embryo behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts --</strong> This project enabled collaborative international research and training for people from 11 countries (USA, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Israel, Panama, Peru, Thailand). It helped support the research of 10 graduate students (5 female, 5 Latin American, 1 US Latino, 4 first-generation), 30 interns [26 female, 17 Latine (US or Latin American)], a postdoctoral collaborator, US and Colombian colleagues from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, and 4 school teachers (3 female, 2 Black). At least 12 interns went on to graduate school (11 female, 9 Latine) and others intend to. The project contributed to five PhD dissertations and an MSc thesis (two PhDs are now faculty, two are postdocs, and one plus the MSc are working in conservation), with more PhDs in progress. Two PhDs won \"Best Dissertation in Biology\" awards at Boston University. The project generated 57 presentations at scientific meetings including 9 plenaries and 8 symposium talks; 21 were outside the USA, some in Spanish. For recordings of some presentations, see: <a href=\"https://sites.bu.edu/warkentinlab/video-library/\">https://sites.bu.edu/warkentinlab/video-library/</a>. PI Warkentin gave 30 invited seminars and trainees gave additional talks at their own and other institutions. For broader reach, we worked with reporters on media coverage of our project and publications; one \"Escape Hatch\" social media video received over 2.8 million views. We also gave many smaller outreach talks and workshops for community groups, school classes and the public in Boston, Panama, and Costa Rica, and Warkentin wrote two forthcoming book chapters for general audiences. As well as research results, Warkentin's presentations for scientific and public audiences address the value of human diversity for scientific progress.
