The program will bring 12 students to CSUMB to participate in oceanographic research for 10 weeks each summer for three years. CSUMB, a Hispanic-Serving Institution with a strong undergraduate research program, will serve as the hub of this Monterey Bay Regional REU program. In addition to research opportunities at CSUMB, students will be paired with mentors at five partner institutions: Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, the Naval Postgraduate School, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. Students will live at CSUMB and the PI will organize all professional development activities, but students will have the opportunity to participate in research at the partner institutions. This program leverages the scientific and educational assets of the Monterey Bay region to increase the diversity and number of students prepared for careers in Ocean Science. To accomplish this goal the PI will recruit participants with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups and those with limited access to oceanographic research. Students will be recruited nationally and will be provided with stipends, housing for the duration of the program, a meal plan, and transportation.",

These included Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, Moss Landing Marine Labs, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University and the Naval Postgraduate. This new training alliancce provided up to 12 students with summer research opportunities across the following four areas; 1) marine biology and ecology, 2) ocean engineering, 3) marine geology and 4) oceanography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of its annual recruiting efforts for the program the REU staff made a special effort to recruit students who are historically underrepresented in the Ocean Sciences. These included, but was not limited to, students who identify as African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Native Alaskan, Pacific Islander, U.S. Veteran and first generation college students. The REU staff also made efforst to recruit students who came from institutions where research opportunities are limited (e.g. community colleges).</p>\n<p>A multitude of approaches were employed by the REU team to reach a diverse audiience for each year's applicant pool. These included 1) presentations at conferences focused on engaging underrepresented students, 2) the development of an active social media presence and 3) visits to community colleges to host workshops on how to apply to a summer REU program. These efforts were succesful as the program saw greater than 50% particiation by underrepresented students and, greater than 50% participation by students from research limited institutions. Both these numbers are above the average for other Ocean Science REU sites.</p>\n<p>Beyond the research projects that students participated in each summer, students also participated in a number of professional development activities. These activites were meant to develop professional skills in students beyond those acquired during their research project. Students were provided with a series of professional development workshops that included; 1) scientific ethics, 2) science communication, 3) applying to graduate school and professional opportunities, 4) geographic information systems and 5) scientific boating. Each student was also provided with the opportunity to present the results of their research at an end of summer REU symposium as well as, at professional conferences in the following Fall and Spring semesters.</p>\n<p>Following their summer REU experience our students were provided with the opportunity to present their work at professional conferences. We had over 20 conference presentations at meetings such as the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society and the Society for the Advancment of Chicanos and Native Americans in Sciences. Beyond presenting their research results, our REU students also used the opportunity to network with scientific professionals about graduate school and professional opportunities.</p>\n<p>To date, greater than 50% of our REU students are in graduate school or professional research positions within the Ocean Sciences. Three of our former students have recevied the prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Another of our alumni is currenty a research oceanographer with the U.S. Naval Research Lab. We anticipate that these numbers will continue to climb as more of our alumni finish their Bachelor's degrees and being to look at graduate school and professional opportunities. The REU program at CSU Monterey Bay looks forward to continuing its mission to recruit and train students to serve the needs of 21st century Ocean Science workforce.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/10/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Corey&nbsp;Garza</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359488/1359488_10298844_1552239271235_REU_2014--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359488/1359488_10298844_1552239271235_REU_2014--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Aquarium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359488/1359488_10298844_1552239271235_REU_2014--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Aquarium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The 2014 REU cohort at the Monterey Bay Aquarium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">C.
