 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is currently warming faster than anywhere else on Earth.   This so-called Arctic Amplification of surface temperatures is well documented; however, the various feedback mechanisms and how they co-operate to amplify arctic temperatures remain uncertain. Important clues for solving some of these fundamental climate questions regarding arctic amplification may be found during the Pliocene (2.6 to 5.3 million years ago), which is the last time in Earth's history when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were comparable to modern concentrations of about 400 ppm, and yet arctic temperatures were 10 to 20 degrees C warmer. \r\n\r\nThis project investigates the interactions among terrestrial feedback mechanisms during the Pliocene and their role in amplifying arctic surface temperatures.  In particular, it investigates the net radiative forcing of vegetation albedo, atmospheric water vapor, and black carbon emitted from fire on the arctic climate system. This will be accomplished by conducting high-resolution reconstructions of past temperatures, atmospheric CO2, and fire for three high arctic sites that have been recently well-dated by terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides.  To disentangle how these processes may have been interacting to amplify arctic temperatures, a series of climate experiments will be conducted using the Community Earth System Model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we explored how feedback mechanisms may have lead to much warmer Arctic climate conditions in Earth's past.  These feedback mechanisms were explored using climate models and field observations.  What we discovered was that temperatures were 10 to 15 degrees warmer on Ellesmere Island in the Arctic approximately 3.5 Million Years Ago during the Pliocene.  Although atmospheric CO2 levels were quite similar to today's values.  We also discovered that Ellesmere Island was covered by thick boreal forests during this warm period and an abundance of charcoal suggesting prevalent forestfires at this high arctic site during the Pliocene.  From our climate model experiments we discovered that fires in the arctic at this time actually had a slight cooling effect by contributing particles to the atmosphere that helped in cloud formation.  Our model experiments also suggest that the lack of industrial aerosols in Earth's atmosphere lead to a slight amplification of Arctic temperatures in Earth's past.\n\nCollectively our evidence from the field and models paints a very different picture of Ellesmere Island during the Pliocene- a warmer boreal forest covered by larch trees that burned frequently- in contrast to the cold dry tundra that now covers much of the Arcitc, especially on Ellesmere Island.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ashley P Ballantyne"
