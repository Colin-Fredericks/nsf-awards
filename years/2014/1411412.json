 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of processes and physical phenomena in science and engineering have to contend with uncertainties in the measurements of the data or the forces that drive the system. Such situations are described by stochastic systems, where suitable assumptions are made about the stochastic nature of the unknown parameters and forcing in the system. Frequently, one is interested in controlling the system through control parameters or forcing with the goal of optimizing a given \"cost\" functional. For example, in the context of finance, the net worth is described by an stochastic differential equation, the controls are the shares placed in the various assets, and the goal is to optimize a functional of the net worth. The goal of this research is the study of optimal control and adaptive control of stochastic systems. The solutions of such problems require algorithms for parameter identification and the determination of explicit optimal controls.  The noise processes used in this project are empirically determined and belong to a class of fractional Brownian motions. In addition to the investigation of problems of stochastic optimal and adaptive control some problems of two-person zero-sum stochastic differential games will be studied.  These games can model many situations of two competing players or interest groups so they often arise.  These stochastic problems in control and differential games will be studied for both continuous and discrete time systems. The proposal will also engage undergraduate and graduate students, as well as high school students, in research on stochastic problems.\r\n\r\nStochastic optimal control problems for a variety of systems, cost functionals, and noise processes will be studied with the particular emphasis on obtaining explicit optimal controls.  The proposers have developed a method that does not require solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations or using a stochastic maximum principle and can be applied to systems with general noise processes that are not Markov or semimartingales.  The systems include both discrete and continuous time and linear and nonlinear systems.  Two person zero sum stochastic differential games will also be investigated for both linear and nonlinear equations to determine explicit optimal control strategies for the two players by a direct method.  Since stochastic systems often contain unknown parameters, the problems of adaptive control, which connote the simultaneous identification of parameters and the control of the system will be investigated for linear systems with ergodic (long run average) quadratic and exponential quadratic cost functionals and noise processes that are fractional Brownian motions or other processes with stationary increments.  The stochastic systems for control to be studied are both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional.  The infinite dimensional systems that evolve in Hilbert spaces can model both parabolic and hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations with fractional Brownian motion noise.  The control and the noise can be restricted to the boundary of the domain or to discrete points in the domain.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany physical systems can be described mathematically as stochastic systems because the systems have unmodeled dynamics or the systems are subject to random perturbations. In this research a variety of stochastic systems are formulated and studied to solve questions of control of the systems or to solve for strategies of two competing players that can exert some control or influence on the stochastic systems.  These formulations can be used to describe a variety of physical situations such as aerospace systems, mechanical systems and financial systems.  The description of the noise in the systems is important for the effective modeling of the physical systems.  The noise included Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion, and Rosenblatt processes.  The systems can be described in finite or infinite dimensional linear spaces.  There is a cost or payoff associated with any strategy for the control or game problem.  These problems are typically difficult to solve explicitly.  In the work supported by this grant some methods were developed to obtain explicit solutions to determine optimal controllers for the stochastic systems or for optimal strategies for the players in the stochastic differential games.  Thus these results are implementable and are applicable to a wide variety of problems such as aerospace, mechanical or financial systems.\n\nAdditionally this grant has supported outreach presentation activities for K-12 students at international conferences and for the annual Math-Stat Awareness Months.  These activities had a definite positive impact on the participants.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tyrone E Duncan"
