 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical:  The acquisition of this confocal laser scanning microscope enables new research programs in the Materials Science, Biology, and Chemistry departments at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.  The instrument significantly expands the imaging capabilities of the University's interdisciplinary Materials Science Center, and is used to solve problems in research areas such as smart suspensions, superconducting magnets, plant light responses, movement within nematode cells, neural cell interactions, fluorescent dye development, and nanomaterials.  The instrument is also used to expand undergraduate research training efforts in hard materials, soft materials, nanomaterials and cellular biology, with an emphasis on underrepresented students in the STEM disciplines.  The instrument is further integrated into the undergraduate lab curriculum of Materials Science and Biology, through courses such as Materials Characterization, Developmental Biology, and Research Methods. Existing industrial collaborations and K12 outreach efforts in the Materials Science Center also utilize this system.\r\n\r\nTechnical:  This Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire enables new research directions for faculty across disciplines, provides the most relevant research and research training experiences for STEM undergraduates, helps recruit high-quality researchers for the future, and enables collaborations with neighboring institutions and industry. The research of the principal investigators and senior personnel spans multiple disciplines, including the interdisciplinary Materials Science Center, Biology Department, and Chemistry Department. Current Materials Science projects include: (1) investigation of colloidal gels, both for fundamental molecular interactions research and for applications such as catalyst supports and membranes, using temperature-controlled confocal fluorescence microscopy to generate 3D reconstructions from confocal z-stacks for quiescent gels and fast resonant scanning for particle tracking of colloidal suspensions under flow, and (2) the characterization of fracture surfaces of low temperature and high temperature superconductors using high z resolution confocal reflectance height maps, which will help assess the role of the composite strand microstructure in the overall wire fracture toughness. Current Biology principal investigator projects include: (1) exploration of light response pathways in plants using high resolution subcellular fluorescent protein imaging in living plant cells and simultaneous detection of multiple fluorophores for determination of co-localization and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer experiments, and (2) investigation of the movement of fluorescent-tagged components of the cilia of nematodes using fast resonant scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy and subcellular localization and co-localization of multiple fluorophores using high resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy. Additional projects include: (1) investigation of fluorescent rare earth ion-bound polypeptide aggregates using 3D confocal fluorescence imaging, (2) live cell imaging and kinetic studies of cell interactions using high resolution fast resonant scanning confocal microscopy and environmental control, and (3) the testing of new site-selective fluorescent dyes by staining and 3D imaging live cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy.",
