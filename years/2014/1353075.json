 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all animal species have two distinct sexes. However, the genetic differences between males and females of a given species are generally very small and sometimes even non-existent. This project will use the nematode C. elegans, a powerful genetic model system, to test the hypothesis that a set of conserved genes (the DMRT genes) acts as a bridge between these minimal genetic sex differences and the changes in developmental and physiological programs that distinguish males and females. It is expected that these genes provide tailored information to individual cells during development, instructing cells to undergo sex-specific processes only at the correct time and in the correct place. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding how these genes carry out these functions will help reveal the ways in which two distinct sexes can be \"encoded\" in one genome, a fundamental issue in developmental biology. Moreover, it will provide fundamental insight into the ways in which developmental programs can be fine-tuned to bring about changes in structural appearance and physiological functions. This research will also have important value in training undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge molecular genetics, and will make special efforts to involve those from groups traditionally underrepresented in the biological sciences. The research process and its findings will be shared with the community through a variety of outreach mechanisms, including novel uses of social media by student researchers.",
