 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the renewal the REU Site at the SETI Institute (SI), which focuses on astronomy and planetary science with a connecting theme of astrobiology. Ten student participants per year will be paired with SI scientists to conduct laboratory research at both SI and at the NASA Ames Research Center. The undergraduate students will perform detailed research into a variety of topics, including the interstellar medium, asteroids, geological activity on Mars, and spectroscopy of the outer solar system. In addition, all participants will attend tutorials by SI scientists on introductory concepts in astronomy, biology, and geology.\r\n\r\nBy offering high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants will develop the research methods and analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and highly developed plan to recruit underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.",
