At a distance of 5-7 km from the spreading axis, the results will document any recent faulting, flow, hydrothermal and associated biological activity across each hill. Changes as plate age increases, or along the faults bounding each hill will also be determined at each site. This information will be used to evaluate the role of off-axis magma  in powering volcanic and hydrothermal activity. Post-cruise analysis will reconstruct the tectonic and volcanic history of the site using visual estimates of relative lava age and geologic contacts, radiometric dating of lava and sediment analysis for microbial activity.",
