Participants will continue development and implementation of a plan for an international program first conceived in a workshop at the University of Delaware in 2011, taking a significant step towards defining the international research agenda and establishing the evidence base to support a joint funding proposal to national funders.\r\n\r\nThe Critical Zone is the near-surface environment extending from the base of the groundwater to the top of the vegetative canopy. Scientific research of the critical zone is interdisciplinary using a system approach to understand the coupling of biological, chemical and physical processes in this zone.  The establishment of a global networks of Critical Zone Observatories have the potential to integrate transformative basic science with innovation in the global human adaptation of Critical Zone management to ongoing rapid and intensive environmental and social change.",

Attendees identified initial steps to establish methods for common observations, governance and data sharing and management. Discussions among funders confirmed broad multi-national support for the science agenda of the CZ science community. A series of actions were proposed to help develop international collaboration and funding for multilateral CZ research. This schedule of actions includes an initial rapid dissemination of workshop outputs via blogs, news releases, popular and technical science articles, and establishment of an international scientific committee by the funders. It is the aim of the scientific community to have a framework for a multilateral CZ program and a roadmap to deliver this, in place in 2015. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy S White"
