 "awd_abstract_narration": "All of the elements other than hydrogen and helium are created inside of stars by \"nucleosynthesis\" processes.  The origin of the material that makes planets - and people - is thus intimately tied to the detailed process that take place within stars.  The PI and his collaborators will use novel computational techniques and the most powerful computing resources available to simulate conditions inside the earliest stars in the universe.  These simulations will be used to evaluate a postulated, but unexplored, nucleosynthesis mechanism they call the \"i-process\".  Graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge stellar modeling and computational astrophysics by one of the world leaders in this field.  The potential for probing new forms of nucleosynthesis are of interest to the nuclear physics field as well as to astrophysics.  Advanced techniques developed in this program could have applications in other areas of computational science.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this investigation is to simulate convection and nucleosynthesis processes inside the kind of stars that were present early in the universe.   They will develop novel \"autocorrecting\" techniques to couple a 3-D treatment of convection with 1-D stellar evolution models, and they will generate a large database of results and tools to mine this database.  These results will be accessible to the larger stellar modeling community, and they will chart new territory in computational astrophysics.  These simulations should allow a probe of postulated nucleosynthesis processes that are driven by neutron capture at rates intermediate between the s- and r-processes.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the Computational Physics Program in the Division of Physics and the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences.",

In 1-D stellar evolution simulations, these give rise to rapid hydrogen burning, with enormous energy release and causing nucleosynthesis by neutron capture from neutron fluxes intermediate between the slow (s) and rapid (r) processes.  This is the intermediate, or i-process nucleosynthesis that we targeted in this study.  Accurate treatment of the convective boundary mixing and the subsequent advection and nuclear burning of H in the He-burning convection zone that drives this i-process requires full 3-D simulation.  The rapid hydrogen burning that ensues, together with the very large luminosities involved, make 3-D simulation affordable on NSF's powerful supercomputing platforms, such as Blue Waters, at NCSA, and now Frontera, at TACC.\n\nIn this project, we took substantial steps to build a new and powerful capability to simulate these events by coupling together 3-D simulations that cover brief time intervals with 1-D simulations spanning much longer times.  In some cases, it is possible to simulate the entire event in 3-D.  In others, 3-D simulations performed at intervals as part of a coupled 1-D and 3-D stellar evolution calculation can serve to recalibrate the coefficients in approximate 1-D models for dynamic mixing processes.  Such coupled calculations can use these periodic model recalibrations to validate the use of the models as the calculation progresses.  We call this new process autocorrecting modeling.
