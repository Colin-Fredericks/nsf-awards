 "awd_abstract_narration": "Women and minorities are underrepresented in mathematics, particularly in the professoriate. The Mathematics Department at the University of Kentucky has a strong track record of preparing its graduates to become faculty members and academic leaders. The department also has a long history of outreach to Appalachian K-12 programs and to public and private universities in Appalachia. The Graduate Scholars in Mathematics (GSM) program at the University of Kentucky will support incoming Mathematics graduate students who are from underrepresented groups for the first two years of doctoral study. The goal is to increase the participation of female, minority, and Appalachian students in the Mathematical Sciences and to develop a new generation of academic leaders and role models for these underrepresented groups. This program will provide rigorous pre-professional training in advanced mathematics, provides an early introduction to research in Mathematics, and develops academic leadership skills. GSM Fellows will begin their careers with extensive pre-service training in effective teaching methods, established connections with the national mathematical community, and the experience of doing original mathematical work with a nationally recognized research faculty member in mathematics. By connecting GSM fellows with mathematics professionals, it will inform and expand their career interests and help them focus their preparation for careers as educators and practitioners of Mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe program will recruit 5-6 new GSM fellows each year, supporting 28 doctoral students over the course of the project. In addition to the scholarship, each GSM fellow will receive supplementary academic preparation and pre-professional training; a summer research fellowship and support for travel to professional meetings to present the results of their research and network with professionals in the Mathematical sciences. These supports will help GSM fellows complete the required preliminary examinations in Mathematics by the end of the second year, reducing time-to-degree, give GSM fellows an early introduction to research and advanced teaching methods, and help them become a part of the national mathematical community. Formative assessment of the GSM program will consistent of surveys and interviews by an external evaluator.  To assess the long-term success of the program, the achievements of the GSM scholars will be compared, using both quantitative and qualitative data with other mathematics PhD candidates both locally and nationally",
