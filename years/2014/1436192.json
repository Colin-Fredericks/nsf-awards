 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control of friction and adhesion are widely recognized problems that impact a broad range of materials applications from gears and engine components, to medical implants for joint replacements, to micro- and nano-scaled machine technologies. The drive to design advanced lubrication schemes not only facilitates bringing new technologies online in these areas, but can also play a critical role in terms of improved machine efficiencies, where aggregate energy losses to friction and wear in many sectors of the economy contribute greatly to the daunting challenges of meeting US energy needs. Graphene, a single-atom-thick film of carbon, offers a potential solution to many of the challenges in controlling friction and adhesion at interfaces due to its exceptional electrical and mechanical properties. The majority of the scientific studies on the frictional properties of graphene, however, are on perfectly smooth, idealized surfaces.  This award supports fundamental research to understand the properties of atomically thin materials such as graphene in realistic interfaces, which are not perfectly smooth but have fine roughness. These experimental studies will be used to determine what aspects control the properties in atomically thin films of graphene, and how these may be engineered to meet technological needs. Students involved in this project receive multidisciplinary training in materials science, engineering, and surface chemistry and physics, developing proficiency in these areas that are critical for the continued development of US technological competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe influence of real surface characteristics like surface roughness and adhesive interactions on graphene-based lubricants will be investigated to determine how surfaces and graphene may be engineered to meet technological needs. Importantly, how such materials bind to substrates with controlled nanoscopic roughness will be examined by creating films of fused silica nanoparticles, where surface roughness is determined by particle size. Analogous studies with gold nanoparticulate films will be used to address these same questions for conductive surfaces. Atomic force microscopy and Raman microspectroscopy will be used to understand how these materials conform to substrates with nanoscale roughness, and how this influences its tribochemical reactivity and frictional characteristics.  These studies will be paired with molecular dynamics simulations of graphene in asperity contacts under analogous conditions, providing atomically resolved detail of the chemical interactions and mechanical contributions to changes in the chemical, structural, mechanical, and frictional properties of graphene in the asperity-asperity contacts that dominate contact between technologically relevant surfaces.",

As 20% of all energy used in the world is presently reported to go toward overcoming friction, a broader impact of this work is the development of new approaches and fundamental scientific insight into potential technologies to control friction and wear, which can have a significant impact on US energy independence and sustainability. A key challenge in this is the design of new materials that can mitigate frictional losses, while remaining robust throughout the operational lifetime of the desired application, whether this be, for example, in car engines or biomedical implants. The intellectual merit of this work was to address these fundamental questions using a combination of experimental methods and computational models, developed specifically to examine how energy is dissipated, and how wear can be mitigated, in the nanoscopic asperity-asperity contacts that dominate the interactions of machined interfaces in sliding contact. The experimental studies included the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to explore friction and adhesion on model surfaces, where surface roughness was controlled through the use of silica nanoparticles to create surfaces which mimic those of real machined interfaces, while providing a controlled approach to their study. Here the frictional properties of single layers of graphene (a honey-combed network of carbon atoms, only a single atomic layer in thickness) and molybdenum disulfide (three atomic layers thick, with Mo atoms surrounded by S atoms) deposited on rough surfaces were examined. From these studies we demonstrated that even on real surfaces, very low friction conditions could be obtained using these materials. Their frictional properties could also be tuned by altering the chemical interactions between these materials and the interfaces they came into contact with. Through Raman microspectroscopy measurements, we also advanced our understanding of the mechanically induced chemical breakdown of these materials, by exploring the effects of applied mechanical force on their chemical reactivity, shedding light on ways to improve their longevity. Our work has also uncovered a potential new means of controlling friction in these materials using light, whereby the optical properties of graphene could be altered by chemical modification, which would in turn change its frictional properties. We are continuing to investigate this phenomena, as this could become a game changing technology for controlling friction.</p>\n<p>Beyond the fundamental research activities supported by this grant, additional broader impacts included providing students participating in this project (ranging from junior high and high school students, up through graduate school) with cross-disciplinary education and training in areas of materials science and engineering, surface chemistry, mechanics, nanoscience and nanotechnology. Such broad training diversifies student backgrounds preparing them for US initiatives in high technology, with students supported from this work going on to take positions in academia (e.g. Univ. of Central Oklahoma, Univ. of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, and Univ. of Pennsylvania) as well as in the technology (Intel) and business (USAA) sectors.&nbsp;This project has also involved the development of outreach activities through hands on demonstrations as part of the Chemistry Open House at Texas A&amp;M University, where we engaged elementary school children in experiments on nanoscience.
