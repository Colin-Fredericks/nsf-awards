 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit.  DNA replication is a central process important for proliferation of all cell types.  Because of highly conserved features, the bacterium Escherichia coli provides a useful prototype to understanding replication of all organisms.  DNA replication proceeds bidirectionally on anti-parallel duplex DNA at a branch point called the replication fork.  Because of this, one strand is synthesized as short fragments (Okazaki fragments) on one strand (the lagging strand) at the fork.  Since the replicase that synthesizes DNA is highly processive, meaning that it can proceed long distances without releasing, there must be a mechanism for triggering the lagging strand replicase to release and recycle to the RNA primer for the next Okazaki fragment.  This research seeks to distinguish between two models for Okazaki fragment cycling.  The favored hypothesis is that synthesis of a new RNA primer provides a cycling signal sensed by the DnaX complex that loads both a ring-like processivity factor on DNA and chaperones the polymerase component of the replicase onto it.  The DnaX complex is also thought to chaperone the polymerase off of the old Okazaki fragment and escort it onto the new primer, concomitant with loading a new processivity factor and hydrolysis of ATP.  Macromolecular interactions responsible for this chaperoning reaction will be determined.  The results of the research will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of DNA replication and the role of this important process in the maintenance of genome stability, not just in bacteria, but also in higher organisms.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in the research.  A laboratory module, incorporating hands-on use of robotics equipment for screening for replication mutants, will be implemented for an undergraduate biochemistry course, and details of the module will be published, so that other universities will be able to use it for their curricula. Such training will provide valuable exposure to equipment and procedures commonly used in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, but rarely made available in undergraduate classes, and thus may increase the competitiveness of the students to obtain employment upon graduation.  The PI will disseminate fundamental knowledge on bacterial DNA replication to the scientific and lay public through continued contributions to an updatable online encyclopedia article published in collaboration with the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe made significant discoveries pertaining to protein dynamics at the replication fork as summarized:\n\n1) During the synthesis of the lagging strand at a replication fork, DNA is synthesized discontinuously as 1-2,000 base pair Okazaki fragments that are subsequently ligated into high molecular weight DNA.  Each fragment is primed by an RNA primer and elongated by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE).  The Pol III HE is highly processive and normally incorporates more than 100,000 bases without dissociation.  Two models have been proposed to explain how Pol III HE is rapidly recycled during Okazaki fragment synthesis.  Using model replication forks with an asymmetric base composition so that synthesis of one strand could be selectively slowed by use of a nucleotide analog, we showed that the ?signaling model? is correct.  Each time a new primer is provided, the Pol III HE immediately dissociates and recycles to the next primer at the replication fork.  We showed that it is the presence of a new primer, not the action of primase that provides the signal. A hypothesis was proposed that a new primer activates the DnaX complex sensor and it chaperones the polymerase off of the old Okazaki fragment in an ATP-dependent reaction. Because of the conserved nature of DNA replication our observations are likely to be general.\n\n2) Models have been proposed in several recent high profile journals that the E. coli replicase is a trimeric enzyme, containing three copies of the tau form of the dnaX protein and three associate Pol III assemblies.  We showed these models were incorrect.  Pol III HE contains only two tau dnaX proteins and one shorter gamma dnaX protein.  Gamma is a shorter form of DnaX that lacks a C-terminal Pol III binding domain.  We expressed a form of gamma with a biotinylation site in trans, opposite a chromosomal mutant dnaX that could express only tau.  The resulting cells assembled Pol III HE with one mole of biotinylated gamma per Pol III HE, showing that the presence of gamma was not an artifact of proteolysis.  Furthermore, with Susan Rosenberg?s lab we found a function for the smaller gamma dnaX gene product&mdash;it is required for the error-prone Pol IV to exchange into replication forks. Presumably, having three copies of tau (and bound Pol III) provides an extra Pol III with an effectively high local concentration that out-competes exogenous Pol IV.\n\n3)  A tetrameric single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB) is required for all cellular transactions that involve single-stranded DNA.  An unstructured C-terminal tail interacts with enzymes involved in these transactions.  With Tim Lohman?s lab we showed that SSBs that contain only two tails, support cellular growth while SSBs with only one tail do not.  We showed that the lethality of the single-tailed mutant derives from an increased frequency of replication fork collapse and the inability of PriA to re-initiate replication with only one SSB tail per tetramer.\n\n4) We isolated suppressor mutants that relieved the dominant negative phenotype of a dnaE allele encoding a DNA Pol III alpha subunit that could form initiation complexes, but was unable to elongate.  The function of the mutant proteins confirmed the importance of beta, tau and epsilon interactions for stable imitation complex assembly.\n\n5) In a photo-crosslinking study we demonstrated that the highly studied SSB found in all life forms unexpectedly binds duplex DNA but only at a replication fork. The double-stranded DNA binding site is distinct from the single-stranded site. This work also provided a means of identifying the position of proteins at replication forks and rearrangements that occur upon sequential assembly.
