 "awd_abstract_narration": "The devastation from recent tornadoes in Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 2011 and in Moore, Oklahoma, in 2013 highlight the national vulnerability to these windstorm events.  Direct measurement of tornado wind speed near the ground level is difficult to obtain due to its unpredictable nature and destructive force. Current practice is to estimate wind speed based on observed damage to structures and non-structures using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, which is widely accepted in climatological study, risk analysis, and design of critical facilities.  However, such damage-based methods have a great degree of uncertainty. Critical knowledge gaps exist about spatial and temporal distributions of wind flow near the ground level and how wind flow interacts with the terrain and structures. To address these knowledge gaps, this research will characterize, model, and analyze uncertainties in tornado wind and its effects on buildings. This research will lead to better understanding of the effects of tornado and terrain parameters on near-ground wind field structures, the transient aerodynamic force of tornado wind on building designs, and the uncertainties in building performance subject to tornado wind.  This knowledge will contribute toward the foundation for developing performance-based building code provisions to mitigate the impact of tornado wind loads on buildings.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to make the following three knowledge advances. First, knowledge for understanding the tornado wind field will be advanced through a systematic study of the effects of tornado and terrain parameters. This study will fill an important gap between a tornado's structure aloft and ground level damages and will provide the physics-based evidence critically needed for updating the EF Scale. Fragility functions will be developed to recalibrate the expected, upper bound, and lower bound wind speeds for Degree of Damage in the EF Scale. Second, understanding of pressure and load effects of non-synoptic winds, including tornadoes and thunderstorms, will be advanced with the development of transient aerodynamic force models.  These models will not only enable better characterization of load effects under a non-stationary vortex but also will build a bridge to results accumulated from decades of research in stationary boundary layer wind. Third, a new framework for characterizing and quantifying uncertainties of the tornado wind load chain on buildings will be developed and validated with finite element models and post-storm damage surveys. This framework will permit the integration of uncertainties, including those of building properties and construction quality, in assessing building vulnerability, laying the foundation for performance-based building code provisions for tornadoes. This research is enabled by a confluence of latest advances in tornado simulation, data acquisition and modeling capabilities, full-scale studies of the tornado vortex, near-ground measurements of tornado wind, and theories in non-stationarity, many of which were not available a few years ago.",

The project tried to address critical gaps in the current knowledge about spatial and temporal distributions of wind near the ground level and its interaction with natural and built environments. The ISU project focused on studying (a) the interaction of tornado vortex with surface roughness and topography, (b) the effects of the horizontal motion or translation of the tornado vortex on wind speeds and their distribution near ground, and (c) wind loading effects of tornado wind on low-rise buildings based on the tornado&rsquo;s characteristics and low-rise building parameters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The approach used in this study at ISU involved laboratory simulations using the ISU Tornado Simulator and small-scaled models of terrain, topography and low-rise buildings. A pressure-based Omni-directional velocity probe was used to map the flow field near the ground whereas pressure and force sensors were used to measure the loads on building models. The characteristics of unsteady flow structures of tornado winds and resultant wind loads on low-rise buildings were investigated in detail.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The laboratory simulator was used to simulate a translating tornado passing over three different two-dimensional topographies: a ridge, an escarpment and a valley to assess change in: (a) the maximum horizontal wind speeds in terms of the wind amplification factor, (b) the maximum aerodynamic drag on a building in terms of the tornado speed-up ratio, and (c) the maximum duration of exposure at any location to high wind speeds of a specific range in terms of the exposure amplification factor, all with respect to a flat terrain. Results show that the maximum wind amplification factor of 14%, the maximum speed-up ratio of 14%, and the maximum exposure amplification factor of 110% corresponding to an EF3 (61&ndash;75m/s<em>) </em>tornado winds occur on the ridge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Both stationary and translating tornado-like vortices were simulated using the laboratory simulator to investigate the influence of ground roughness on their flow fields. The results show that, for the stationary tornado, the flow regime transitioned from a multi-celled core structure over a smooth terrain at a higher swirl ratio to a single or dual-celled core structure over the rough terrain. A decrease in tangential velocity and core radius, and an increase in vertical and radial velocities toward the center of the tornado were observed for both the stationary and translating tornadoes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Effects of translation on the near-ground tornado flow field were studied using the laboratory simulator that can physically translate over a ground plane. Two translation speeds, 0.15m/s and 0.50m/s, that scale up to those corresponding to slowly-moving tornadoes in the field were selected for this study. Compared with the flow field of a stationary tornado, the simulated tornado with translation had an influence on the spatial distribution and magnitude of the horizontal velocities, early reversal of the radial inflow, and expansion of the core radius. Maximum horizontal velocities were observed to occur behind the center of the translating tornado and on the right side of its mean path.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The influence of tornado parameters such as swirl ratio and translation speed and a low-rise building&rsquo;s spatial parameters such as its distance from the tornado mean path and its orientation with respect to the tornado&rsquo;s translation direction on tornado-induced wind loads were investigated. A low-rise gable roof building (1:200 scale) with a roof angle of 35 degrees and a square plan area was chosen for this study. Laboratory simulated tornadoes with two swirl ratios with different ground-surface pressure characteristics, and three translation speeds were used. The building model was located on both sides of the simulated tornado&rsquo;s mean path at several locations up to the distance of several tornado-core radii. At locations where maximum loadings occurred, orientation of the building was changed to explore its effect on peak loads. Results show significantly larger peak load coefficients for the tornado with lower swirl ratio and peak roof uplift on the building located at the tornado&rsquo;s mean path to be smaller by 6-19% for the lower-swirl tornado case and up to 16% for the higher-swirl tornado case, compared to the other locations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Tornadoes can produce winds that can exceed 200 mph (89 m/s) causing immense property damage. This project resulted in a better understanding of underlying physics of the dynamic flow field of tornado wind and its interaction with buildings that will lead to a more accurate prediction of wind damage to buildings and improved building code in the future.&nbsp; This project has raised public awareness of wind hazards and benefitted graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students, research scholars as well as public in general through improved curricula, laboratory demonstrations, student projects, publications and news media outlets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
