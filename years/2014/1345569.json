 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR project will determine the feasibility of developing innovative highly adaptive e-learning/hybrid modules for teaching technology transfer and commercialization skills to entrepreneurs throughout the country.  These modules will be based upon a hugely successful instructor-led regional program and feedback from collaborating academic, federal, institutional and national distribution partners.  The objective is to increase the participation by entrepreneurs and small tech businesses throughout the country, in the licensing of federal research for the purpose of developing successful, marketable products.  The latest learning science including adaptive learning methodologies, emerging 3-D/gaming educational technologies, and the firm's years of entrepreneurial and technology transfer experience, and nationwide distribution partnerships will be used to embed these customized technology transfer e-learning modules into entrepreneurship courses offered by various entities throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact is significant.  According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Association of Technology Managers, the federal government spends approximately $250B annually on scientific research - yet very little of it which is intended for commercial use - is ever licensed, especially by smaller businesses. There is compelling evidence that most technology entrepreneurs, not already affiliated with a university or laboratory, are unaware of and do not know how to participate in cooperative research and technology licensing opportunities with federally funded research institutions.  Yet, entrepreneurs and small businesses are in constant search of innovation to help them start or grow their businesses, and serve their customers.  Very few resources are available to small businesses and entrepreneurs to bridge this gap.  This indicates there is a critical national need for a cost effective learning system that appeals to the fast-paced profit oriented perspectives of entrepreneurs and small tech firms to teach them how to leverage this vast federal resource.  The challenge is to craft an e-learning system with the most effective blend of interactivity, instructor involvement and learning community support, for this very demanding, diverse audience, especially those in sparsely populated areas. The objective of this initiative is to advance knowledge and understanding among entrepreneurs, entrepreneur support organizations and federal research laboratories regarding the challenges and nuances of the scientific research/licensing/product development continuum and the important interdependent and evolving roles of each entity.  Ultimately, this project will benefit our country's innovation economy and help federal agencies fulfill their societal mission through increased licensing activity by the entrepreneurial community.",
