Providing exposure and opportunities for in-depth interaction between young U.S. scientists to the leaders in the field is an important part in the young scientists development. \r\n  \r\nThe subjects of this conference (Molecular and Ionic Clusters:  Structure and Dynamics of Isolated Particles) are important in understanding the interaction of solutes with solvents (most of the chemistry taking place in the natural environment) as well as understanding the unique chemistry that takes place in atmospheric aerosols.  The conference provides a unique venue for bringing together both experimental and computational/theoretical physical chemists.",
