 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the collapse of complex societies has long been an important and sustained scholarly research focus, concepts such as resilience and post-collapse reorganization have only recently received significant attention. Current interdisciplinary research has led to novel characterizations and approaches for understanding resilience in social, political, and economic institutions. Rather than static equilibrium-based models, these phenomena are conceptualized as dynamic and cyclical. Archaeology is uniquely positioned to contribute to these studies by incorporating data that cover very large temporal scales. Additionally, archaeological research, steeped in anthropological tradition, provides theoretical tools to evaluate changes in human behavior, such as decision-making strategies, related to adaptive or resilient organizational practices. In this study, Drs. Ronald K. Faulseit and Gary M. Feinman, of the Field Museum in Chicago, undertake research to characterize persistent and/or adaptive strategies in political and economic behavior based on the archaeological record and study its impact on political reorganization in the aftermath of political collapse. In particular, they will study change and/or continuity in organizational strategies (e.g., market exchange vs. controlled distribution) for the production and consumption of material goods before after the decline of the important political center of Monte Alb\u00e1n in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico. The identification of economic strategies that are resilient to political instability and change is relevant to understanding phenomena that confront the United States today, as global economic relations are increasingly connected to politically unstable regions, such as Central Asia. The project incorporates a program of public outreach that is integrated with the efforts of professional Mexican archaeologists designed to share and disseminate research findings with the local indigenous community.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project challenges the long-held notion that independent market exchange played a minimal role in pre-modern political economies. Instead, household production strategies evident in the Oaxaca Valley during the period of Monte Alb\u00e1n's dominance, suggest dependence on regional market systems that functioned independent of the state. The premise of this research asserts that these economic structures were resilient to the subsequent fragmentation of the centralized political system and provided a stable platform for relatively quick political reorganization after its decline. The project team, which incorporates professionals and students from Mexico and the US, will integrate a broad program of intensive survey and surface collection, with a focused program of excavation at Dainz\u00fa-Macuilx\u00f3chitl, a second-tier center situated within the Monte Alb\u00e1n polity that reorganized after its decline into a prominent city-state. The project involves detailed topographic mapping to examine the orientation and layout of architectural mounds and other man-made features at the site, coupled with spatial analysis of the distributions of surface artifacts to identify locations of production activities. These data will be evaluated to characterize the organization of and relationship between sociopolitical units (e.g., households, neighborhoods, residential wards), particularly as they pertain to broad patterns of pre- and post-collapse socioeconomic behavior. To complement these data, comprehensive excavations are designed to examine more closely the evidence for behavioral patterns associated with craft production and specialization activities within a specific production area identified through previous research.",

That is the underlying question behind this research project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometime between A.D. 750 - 900, the poltical atmosphere in the Valley of Oaxaca began to change. The large urban center of Monte Alb&aacute;n, which had dominated the entire valley for nearly a thousand years (200 B.C. - A.D. 750), was in decline as were many of its secondary centers. By the end of this period, most of these sites were abandoned.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Dainz&uacute;-Macuilx&oacute;chitl, once an important secondary city under Monte Alb&aacute;n, reorganized in the wake of this political collapse, emerging as an important minor kingdom, which was fluorishing at the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. The community, now known as San Mateo Macuilx&oacute;chitl, persists to the present day.</p>\n<p>This project was designed to investigate the ancient site in an attempt to identify patterns of continuity in the archaeological record that indicate resilient social structures, which may have provided a stable platform for this political reorganization.</p>\n<p>The project was specifically focused on economic behavior. Today, specialized craft production in Oaxaca is a household activity related to a tiered regional market system. The structure of these production activities, as well as the market itself, are deeply embedded in Zapotec cultural tradition. The market is as much a social event as it is an economic or political one, serving to maintain cultural ties between communities. The premise behind this research initiative is that these economic behaviors have deep roots in ancient times. It was my contention, that not only did this type of market system exist in Oaxaca in the Classic period, but its resilience helped maintain integration between communities after the political collapse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project involved two major components of fieldwork that were carried out between December 2014 and December 2015. The first involved intensively surveying and mapping the entire site. The detailed topographic map (Figure 1) is the result of measuring more than 20,000 points in the field. This allowed us to characterize the site organization, identify areas of production, and refine the time frame of occupation and abandonment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From these data, we recognized that the site was organized into neighborhoods, each containing a civic-ceremonial precinct made up of pyramidal temple platforms with adjacent palaces that were surrounded by residences. Furthermore, each neighborhood seemed to serve varying functions, some religious, some economic, and some administrative. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second part of the project involved excavating a precinct palace to examine more specifically ceramic production that was evident from artifacts found on the surface. The palace complex (Figure 2) included a large and private square patio surrounded by rectangular rooms, adjacent to an open ceremonial platform with a stone floor. Attached to the platform, we uncovered a ceramic kiln, along with thousands of broken mold-made figurine fragments, which appeared to be production rejects. The kiln is similar in design to those used today by Zapotec households in Oaxaca. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scale of figurine production appeared to be limited to the single household, but the large number of figurine rejects found, including faulty batches of identical replicas made from the same mold (Figure 3), suggested they were being produced for exchange outside of the household.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The placement of the kiln alongside the ceremonial platform indicates that the act of firing the figurines carried ritual significance for the family. As this was an open space, these activities would have been visible to the broader community. Moreover, surface evidence from the mapping project indicate other households in this neighborhood were also producing figurines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, the layout of the residential space and domestic offerings found within the residence, indicate a high level of continuity in residential organization and ritual activity among Zapotec households from the Classic period to the present day. These data support the notion that the social norms underlying domestic ritual, residential layout, and specialized production not only had ancient origins, but exhibit incredible resilience in the wake of major political fluctuations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These findings relate to the broader understanding of social structures that enable resilience. I propose that these activities exhibit long-term continuity because they are embedded within social structures that define Zapotec identity, not status or political authority. While the palace was abandoned between A.D. 850 and 900, indicating the end of the political rule, the social norms underlying the household layout, ritual offerings, and organization of production persisted in residences long after the demise of the political system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In cooperation with the community of San Mateo Macuilx&oacute;chitl, we had the opportunity to share our findings with children from their elementary school, through guided tours and presentations. I am particularly pleased that many of the artifacts we recovered during the project will be on display in the town's community museum, as are posters we prepared to detail and disseminate the project findings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/02/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ronald&nbsp;K&nbsp;Faulseit</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353793/1353793_10328894_1472863619738_Ilustraci%C3%B3n2_1a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353793/1353793_10328894_1472863619738_Ilustraci&oacute;n2_1a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353793/1353793_10328894_1472863619738_Ilustraci%C3%B3n2_1a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This map depicts the expanse of the ancient city of Dainz\u00fa-Macuilx\u00f3chitl.
