Specifically participants will be mentored and trained in broad areas of nanotechnology, while delving deeper into their chosen area of interest, including nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, nanomanufacturing, nanomaterials, or nanobiotechnology.  These participants will connect their research experiences to their content areas, including physics, chemistry, biology, math, and engineering.  The specific projects are motivated by grand challenges facing our society and the world in informnation technology/communications, energy, security, health, agriculture, and environment.  More specifc topic areas range from scaling of current electronic devices; creating new electronic or photonic nano-devices; reducing the cost of sequencing the human genome; point of care detection of pathogens and diseases; to creating highly pervasive energy harvesting ecosystems. \r\n\r\nThe Site will leverage institutional knowledge and educational resources developed through the NSF Center for Nanoscale Chemical-Electrical-Mechanical-Manufacturing Systems (Nano-CEMMS). This Site will bring a diverse group of teachers together from three local school districts in an environment serving the University's research, teaching, and learning goals. Participants will benefit from continuous engagement with exceptional faculty and students; access to unparalleled laboratories and equpment; and well-organized, executed, and managed program components.  The Site will provide an in-depth experience for teachers and extend the teacher network established through Nano-CEMMS, from elementary, middle, and high schools to community colleges.",

A total of 41 teachers participated in the program, including many from underrepresented populations (e.g., ethnicity, gender, geography, disability, and/or veteran status) as well as teachers from high need areas (e.g., inner city, rural, low-income, and those with a significant minority student enrollment).  Each summer from 2014-2017, teachers came to the University of Illinois for an intensive six-week research experience under the guidance of a faculty member and a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher.  The experience also included teacher professional development, ranging from teacher-focused lectures by world-class faculty in a variety of STEM fields, ethics seminars, hands-on modules, lab/facilities tours, discussions of STEM educations issues, career choices, and nanotechnology education and research resources.  Teachers developed high quality, multi-day modules over the summer and into the school year.  They implemented the modules in their classrooms and refined them using feedback from their students, peer teachers, and the cohort of RET participants.  These modules have been disseminated widely (see:  http://nano.illinois.edu/education/RETmodules/index.html)  The RET Site also performed formative evaluation and cumulative assessment in order to improve the program and measure the impact of its outcomes.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  Through this program, we explored how to utilize the research facilities and resources available at Illinois to bring long-term impact to STEM education around the country with a nanotechnology focus.  Summaries of the RET research projects and developed teaching modules were presented at two national teacher conferences and at the NSF EEC grantee conference.  As a result of their lab research, three RET participants were named as inventors on a patent application, \"Spectrally and Temporally Engineered Processing using PhotoElectroChemistry\" that was filed in 2016 and a fourth RET participant was a co-author on a peer-reviewed journal article in Nano Letters entitled \"Polymorphic Assembly from Beveled Gold Triangular Nanoprisms\".\n\nBroader Impact:  This Site has brought a diverse group of K-14 teachers together to participate in world-class research in nanotechnology.  Participants benefited from their one-on-one and group engagement with faculty and students, access to unparalleled state-of-the-art laboratory equipment and facilities, and well-organized, executed, and managed program components.  The Site has provided an in-depth experience in science and engineering education and in innovation for participating teachers.  By developing widely accessible teaching modules based on their experiences, the teachers have been able to extend some of the impact to their students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xiuling Li"
