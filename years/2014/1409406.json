 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a diverse range of application areas--including astronomical\r\nimaging, microscopy, wireless communications, radar, sonar, and\r\nmany others--one must confront the problem of estimating or\r\nextracting information from a signal that is governed by a small\r\nnumber of unknown (continuous-valued) parameters. Customized to\r\neach of these applications, unique methods for handling these\r\nunknown parameters have been proposed in the past. This research\r\ninvolves the development of a unified framework for addressing\r\nproblems in all of these areas systematically, efficiently, with\r\nawareness of the fundamental limits, and with provable accuracy.\r\n\r\nThere are two main components of this framework. The first\r\ncomponent involves the development of models where the signals of\r\ninterest lie within or close to a subspace or a union of subspaces.\r\nIn the case where the underlying parameters for the signal are\r\ncontinuous-valued, this is a challenging task. Rather than attempt\r\nto simply discredit these problems (a program potentially fraught\r\nwith difficulty), this research involves the development of finite\r\napproximations for a locally infinite range of subspaces using\r\nefficient local subspace fits whose dimensions match the effective\r\nnumber of local degrees of freedom. The second component of this\r\nframework consists of techniques for identifying the range of\r\nsubspaces responsible for generating a signal from a set of\r\ndiscrete observations, confronting difficulties posed by the\r\ncoherence, by the continuous nature of the parameter space, and by\r\nthe fact that some signals may be synthesized from a narrow (but\r\ncontinuously-indexed and therefore infinite) range of subspaces.\r\nThese components combine to enable the efficient acquisition,\r\nprocessing, and estimation of signals arising from the\r\nparameterized subspaces model.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere were two central themes for the major outcomes for this project.  The first was the development of the Fast Slepian Transform.  The second was an understanding of how a priori information about range constraints in a scene can be exploited in computational imaging.  We describe these below.\n\nThe Slepian transform is a way to represent signals that are bandlimited (i.e. have frequency content limited in a certain range) and observed over a finite interval of time.  While this type of representation has been used in signal processing since the 1970s (especially in the subfield of spectral estimation), its use had never become widespread, mostly because there was no known algorithm for computing it efficiently.  One of the key findings of this research was a suite of algorithms for signal processing with the Slepian transform that had the same efficiency as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the workhorse of frequency-domain techniques.  This work was published as a series of mathematical papers, but the broader impacts include more accurate algorithms for source localization and tracking in radar and sonar applications, and new techniques for time-frequency analysis.\n\nIt is a classical result that the spatial resolution of an active imaging device is directly tied to its aperture and the bandwidth of the signal used to excite the scene --- the scene can be effectively sampled by exciting it with different frequencies and then measuring the return at different locations within the aperture.  Another major finding in this research program was that when the scene is structured, in that the range of the reflectors is very narrow at every angle, then the number of spatial samples we need to measure can be reduced as the bandwidth of the excitation grows.  This was established by posing the problem as a matrix compression (\"sketching\") problem, and developing new mathematics for the type of structures induced by the active imaging scenario.  \n\nThe PIs on this project also developed an open set of lecture notes and exercise problems for an undergraduate probability course.  These materials are freely available, and have been widely adopted both by the PI's institutions and elsewhere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin K Romberg"
