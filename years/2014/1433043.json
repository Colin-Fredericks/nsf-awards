 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central archaeological goal is to understand the mechanisms which permit societies to integrate large number of individuals into functioning social group. Archaeology can provide a unique insight into this process because it can trace - sometimes over millennia - this developmental across time. This project examines the emergence of such social complexity at a prehistoric Mayan site with a particular focus on how uneven distribution of valuable resources serves to establish and maintain the hierarchical structure necessary for large scale social organization. Animals served as objects of value both for the sustenance they provided and for the symbolic functions they served. Animal bones are an excellent source of data because they are well preserved in many archaeological sites.\r\n\r\nThis study addresses the role of animal resources in the formation of the earliest Maya states. Ashley Sharpe, working under the guidance of Dr. Kitty Emery, will analyze animal bones and shells from four Preclassic period (c. 2000 B.C - A.D. 250) Maya sites in Guatemala and Belize. She will address such questions as how and when animals and their products (e.g. meat, fur, feathers, bones, and shells) began to be differentially used among community members for food, crafting, ceremonial rituals, and as markers of status and political authority. This study will also combine traditional zooarchaeological methods with novel stable isotopic techniques to identify past animal management practices and long-distance exchange.\r\n\r\nThe central focus of the investigation is the site of Ceibal, Guatemala, which boasts one of the earliest and longest occupational sequences in the Maya area (c. 1000 B.C. - A.D. 1000). Ceibal became a politically-dominant civic center much earlier than many other Preclassic sites, in part due to its residents' ability to acquire and manage resources, including those of animals. Sharpe will identify animal remains recovered at Ceibal, comparing proportions, diversity, and uses of animals in the site core and periphery to track the development of social complexity. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of mammal and avian bones will identify whether wild animals, particularly deer, peccary, and turkey, were raised in captivity. Strontium, oxygen, and lead isotopes will identify non-local animals at Ceibal that were acquired through long-distance exchange networks established as the site rose to political dominance. To obtain a broader regional understanding of early animal resource use, Ceibal's zooarchaeological data will also be compared with assemblages previously examined by Sharpe for this dissertation project from the neighboring Preclassic sites of San Bartolo, Cival, and Cerros. This is the first large-scale study of animal resource use in the Preclassic period of Maya history. It is also the first study to incorporate lead isotopic analysis of Mesoamerican animal remains, and will establish baseline data for future investigations sourcing archaeological material.\r\n\r\nThe faunal identification and analysis portion of the project will be carried out in the Environmental Archaeology laboratory of the Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, and the Ceibal Archaeological Project laboratory in Guatemala City. These analyses will incorporate the training of US and Guatemalan undergraduate researchers. Isotopic studies conducted at the University of Florida Anthropology Bone Chemistry Laboratory will include undergraduate and graduate researcher training in the fields of anthropology and biology, who will be using these same techniques to address research questions in other disciplines. Results will be published and presented in both English and Spanish in Guatemalan and US venues, including publication in open access journals and presentations to local community members to release information to both scientific and public audiences.",

The study focused on the Maya Preclassic period (1000 BC-AD 250), a time when the Maya began to build large stone monuments under the command of an increasingly stratified society. Previous research from state-level Classic period (AD 250-900) Maya communities has found evidence for the selective use and distribution of animal species among social tiers; like modern societies, the hunting and captive management of animals, as well as their distribution and availability, was dependent on many political and economic factors that elite members of society may have had a role controlling. When and how these activities developed and changed over time remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>The study examined the animal bone and shell remains from four Preclassic archaeological sites in Guatemala and Belize (Ceibal, San Bartolo, Cival/Holmul, and Cerros) to address three major questions:</p>\n<p>1) When does social stratification begin to occur at these four sites, in terms of how animal species were selectively distributed to certain members or groups in each community?</p>\n<p>2) Is there evidence for an increased reliance on domesticated and captive species at these sites over time, indicating a greater degree of intentional control of animals and their products?</p>\n<p>3) Is there evidence for the long-distance exchange of both marine and terrestrial animals during the Preclassic period, suggesting early economic and political interactions among communities?</p>\n<p>Animal bones and shells were identified and analyzed for modifications at the archaeological project labs in Guatemala and in the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, FL. In order to examine what animals were eating, including &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; human-controlled diets focused on corn (maize), carbon and nitrogen isotopes were tested from animal bones from Ceibal, the site with the oldest and longest occupational sequence in the study. Similarly, strontium, lead, and oxygen isotopes were tested from Ceibal remains to determine whether these animals were local to the site or if they came from another region as imports, perhaps as trade or tribute items. Strontium and oxygen isotopes were previously used in the Maya area to detect the movements of humans because isotope baseline maps existed for the Mesoamerica area with which to compare locality. As part of this investigation, a lead isotope baseline map was created using rock samples collected throughout Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and western Honduras. Over 80 animal bone and 40 rock samples were tested for their isotopic content at the University of Florida Department of Anthropology Bone Chemistry Laboratory and Department of Geological Sciences laboratories.</p>\n<p>The results revealed that the socially-selective use and management of animals occurred long before conventional state-level society existed in the region. Commonalities were found at all sites, despite the fact that they ranged geographically across an area of about 200 km. These included a dependence on domesticated dogs and freshwater shellfish, which gave way to a dependence on deer and other large-bodied game at all sites around 200-300 AD. Faunal evidence for intensive dog management, including the quantity of dog remains and breed variety and isotopic evidence for moving dogs between the lowlands and highlands of Guatemala, was greatest in the Preclassic period <em>before</em> the establishment of state-level society, contrary to the conventional expectation that domestication intensifies as state level society develops, as occurred in the Old World. Isotopic results found evidence for captive &ldquo;wild&rdquo; animals consuming mainly maize or maize-fed prey in both the Preclassic and Classic periods (e.g., remains of a jaguar in a Preclassic pyramid, and two Classic period peccaries), indicating that, although these animals were never domesticated, they were still maintained in captivity, perhaps for special elite or ritual functions given their unique contexts. Similarly, examining the marine mollusks at all study sites revealed that specific species were imported inland as ornaments and for ritual caching at different times, hinting at possible ancient trends and changing supply/demand of shells.</p>\n<p>Overall, the results of the study indicate that animal management and exchange was fairly common at the research sites during the Preclassic period. Evidence of captive felines and imported dogs at Ceibal, and cached marine shells at all sites, suggests animals played an integral role in early ceremonies, and these practices may have been what helped establish early social distinctions within communities. These results have been presented in over a dozen conferences in the United States, Guatemala, Panama, Canada, and Spain, and the results of the isotopic lead baseline have been published (Sharpe et al. 2016, PLOS ONE), with other publications forthcoming including one, almost ready for submission, detailing the isotopic results regarding Preclassic animal management. A trilingual (English, Spanish, and Q&rsquo;eqchi&rsquo; Maya) informational poster and pamphlet have also been made for the Ceibal Archaeological Park, detailing the long-term human/animal interactions at the site over the last three thousand years.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ashley&nbsp;E&nbsp;Sharpe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1433043/1433043_10307585_1501163475233_CeibalCarvedSpondyluscopy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1433043/1433043_10307585_1501163475233_CeibalCarvedSpondyluscopy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"&quot;Trophy Head&quot; Spondylus Shell from Ceibal, Guatemala, c. 800-700 BC\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1433043/1433043_10307585_1501163475233_CeibalCarvedSpondyluscopy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Trophy Head&quot; Spondylus Shell from Ceibal, Guatemala, c. 800-700 BC\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A spondylus (Spondylus sp.) valve found in the Group A Central Plaza of Ceibal, Guatemala, dating to the early Middle Preclassic period (Cache 108, c. 800-700 BC).
