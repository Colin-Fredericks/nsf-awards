 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet we do not know many of their properties. For example, we do not know their absolute mass scale or their particle-antiparticle nature. Because of their abundance, even a small mass could have far-reaching consequences for understanding their role in the evolution of our Universe. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles could have implications in understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our Universe. Neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD) experiments address these two fundamental questions. Double beta decay is a rare nuclear decay that has been measured in several nuclei when it is energetically favorable. Some nuclei are stable against ordinary beta decay but are unstable for double beta decay in which two neutrons in the nucleus are simultaneously converted to protons and two electrons are emitted.  Double beta decay can proceed through several modes. The experimentally measured process, the two-neutrino mode in which two electron antineutrinos are also emitted, is completely described by known physics. NLDBD is an as-yet-undetected decay that involves no neutrinos in the final state and necessarily would indicate that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. The rate of such decays determines the scale for the effective neutrino mass. \r\n\r\nCUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is an experiment to search for NLDBD in the isotope 130-Te and is currently being built at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. CUORE is an array of TeO2 crystals used as cryogenic bolometers for the purpose of particle detection. The crystals act as both the source and the absorbing calorimetric material. These kinds of detectors offer good energy resolution and efficiencies and are well-suited for NLDBD searches. \r\n\r\nThis award will enable the PI to continue to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate on the CUORE experiment. This will involve tasks such as monitoring the gluing of thermistors and heaters on the 988 crystals, helping to assemble the calibration system and elements of the electronics and assisting with cryostat alignment, with tests of the various subsystems of the detector and with cryostat cool down or warm up diagnostics. This will give students invaluable experience working with a cutting-edge physics experiment in a world-class underground laboratory. \r\n\r\nAn exciting sector of public outreach that Cal Poly will pursue is to develop an interactive visualization scheme for CUORE physics. This software will serve as a channel for the public to gain insight into the scientific process and explore the mysteries of particle physics. Through Cal Poly's Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education they will help local teachers develop project-based-learning modules for high school physics courses that incorporate the underlying physics of CUORE.",
