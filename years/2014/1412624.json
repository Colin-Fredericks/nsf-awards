 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two fundamental questions about any motor are: 1) how far does the machine travel per turnover of the engine and 2) how much fuel is required? Answering these two questions is essential for understanding how a motor operates in a car or how a motor operates in the cell of a living organism. However, answering such questions for a molecular motor in the cell, which cannot be directly observed by eye, requires substantially different techniques and experimental strategies. Molecular motors that exist in the cell are essential for a vast array of metabolic processes. For example, survival of extreme heat or exposure to environmental stresses depends upon molecular motors that either repair or remove damaged cellular components. If such damaged components were left unattended they would have catastrophic effects on the cell. At the core of this work the researchers seek to answer the two posed fundamental questions of how two representative motors tasked with such repair activities move along their track and how much energy they require to do so. The knowledge gained will be important for gaining a deeper understanding of how these motors and a vast array of similar motors operate and potentially the impact they have on the cell. Moreover, the results will allow others to better propose and test mechanisms for a variety of motor proteins that use similar operating principles and lie at the heart of a vast array of biological functions. Vital to the research infrastructure of our nation is training the next generation of scientists with the ability to apply the thermodynamic and transient state kinetic approaches proposed here. This goal will be achieved by involving graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers in the work; a strategy that has been successfully invoked with previous NSF support. \r\n\r\nIn all organisms reactions such as protein remodeling, ATP dependent proteolysis, and protein disaggregation are essential for proteome maintenance. However, the molecular level events in these reactions remain obscure. This research will advance knowledge by providing a detailed molecular mechanism for ClpA, ClpAP, and ClpB catalyzed polypeptide translocation, which represent model enzymes that catalyze protein remodeling, ATP dependent proteolysis, and protein disaggregation, respectively. In addition, the results will advance knowledge across fields because a variety of homologous AAA+ enzymes are thought to use similar mechanisms to catalyze such disparate reactions as clamp loading in DNA replication, microtubule severing, membrane fusion, and morphogenesis and trafficking of endosomes. This project will promote teaching, training and learning and perform outreach by incorporating high school students and undergraduate researchers through the university's  ChemBridge and Chemistry Scholars programs, respectively. A further benefit of the proposed activity to society is that this work will yield individuals highly trained in the application of an array of biophysical and molecular biology techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn all organisms, molecular chaperones are essential for proper maintenance of proteins within the protein rich environment of the cell, a process referred to as proteome maintenance.  We have been examining three representative molecular chaperones that are responsible for proteome maintenance in cells.  ClpA is a molecular chaperone and an integral component of the ATP dependent proteases, which are responsible for removal of proteins that are damaged or are no longer needed by the cell.  ClpB and Hsp104 are molecular chaperones from bacteria and yeast, respectively, and have the unique ability to disrupt protein aggregates in cells.  We are interested in quantitatively describing how these molecular chaperones couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to macromolecular assembly, polypeptide binding, and energy driven translocation on a polypeptide chain. \n\nThis grant has allowed for twelve published manuscripts and three more are in preparation.  All in all, there will be 15 manuscripts published from this grant.  The published manuscripts have advanced knowledge as follows.  We reported a thermodynamic analysis of polypeptide binding by ClpB.  In this work we reported the strength of the interaction between ClpB and common protein substrates that are used in this field to examine the function of this and similar molecular chaperones.  ClpB assembles into hexameric rings upon nucleotide binding.  We reported a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the thermodynamic linkage of nucleotide binding to macromolecular assembly for ClpB.  The combination of the assembly and binding studies will aid both us and others in predicting the concentrations of active hexameric form of the enzyme in solution that is present and able to interact with the polypeptide.  This will aid in interpretation of both structural and functional studies. \n\nPrior to the work of this grant the dominant hypothesis in the field was that ClpB was able to completely thread a polypeptide chain through the axial channel of its hexameric ring structure.  However, we have shown that ClpB is only able to take, at most, two steps before dissociation from the polypeptide chain.  We have described this as a non-processive translocation mechanism. This grant supported the development of a collaboration that allowed us to apply similar approaches to the yeast homologue of ClpB, Hsp104.  We have also shown that Hsp104 takes only two steps before dissociation from the polypeptide chain.  Thus, we have now described both ClpB and Hsp104 as non-processive translocases.  This is a paradigm shifting model that will allow us to better understand the fundamental mechanisms that these enzymes use to translocate the polypeptide chain. \n\nClpA, ClpB, and Hsp104 are all Class I AAA+ molecular chaperones.  The Class I designation indicates that these motors have two ATP binding and hydrolysis sites per monomeric unit.  Thus, the active hexameric form contains twelve ATP binding and hydrolysis sites.  We have furthered our understanding of how these twelve sites couple the energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to both assembly and processive polypeptide translocation, in the case of ClpA.  Under this grant we have reported a detailed thermodynamic analysis of nucleotide binding to ClpA and the thermodynamic linkage of this binding to hexamer formation.  With this information in hand we and others our now positioned to better interpret mechanistic and structural observations. \n\nThis grant has contributed to the production of human resource.  It supported three female Ph.D. students to completion.  A fourth Ph.D. student will defend his dissertation shortly after completion of this grant. This grant has allowed us to promote teaching, training, and learning. We have hosted eight REU students and two high school students.
