 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthesis is a basic process supporting the vast majority of life on Earth. However, for plants living under water-limited conditions, photosynthetic productivity can be reduced by hotter and drier climatic conditions. To counteract these conditions, some plants utilize forms of photosynthesis that increase the efficiency with which they use water. One such innovation seen in plants that grow in deserts or other water-limited habitats is referred to as CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). The CAM innovation is found in a large number of diverse plant lineages and typically associated with stem (e.g. cacti) or leaf (e.g. agaves) succulence. The proposed research project will use several approaches to address fundamental questions about how plants use CAM and how genes involved in performing CAM are regulated in response to varying environmental conditions. To achieve this, the project will focus on the independent evolution of CAM in the orchid and agave plant families, both of which have species known for their ability to thrive in water-limited environments. This research will provide a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of CAM pathways and potentially transfer to economically important plants for improved water use efficiency under drought conditions leading to improved productivity. Additionally, this project would result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from under-represented groups. There are also plans to integrate the results of the project into classroom learning and broader outreach activities. \r\n\r\nThis project utilizes an integrated research program on two instances of CAM photosynthesis to illuminate the mechanisms that link ecological, genetic and molecular dimensions of the evolutionary processes that contribute to the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Photosynthesis is a fundamental process supporting biodiversity in the vast majority of ecological communities on our planet, while at the same time a physiological challenge for primary producers living under water-limited conditions. The evolutionary history of photosynthetic organisms has included repeated origins of carbon concentrating mechanisms that increase water-use efficiency and productivity in extreme environmental conditions. Crassulacean acid metabolism is one such innovation that has facilitated diversification of vascular plant lineages in an array of habitats. The proposed project will integrate ecological, physiological, phylogenetic, genetic and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions about how plants use CAM and how genes involved in performing CAM are regulated in response to different environmental conditions. The study systems for this project are the species-rich Agavoideae (Asparagaceae) and Oncidiinae (Orchidaceae) lineages, both of which include CAM, C3 (typical form of photosynthesis) and facultative or weak CAM species. These systems will aid in inferring the phylogenetic and environmental context for multiple gains and losses of CAM photosynthesis in both lineages. Comparative analyses of RNA will illuminate the interacting molecular and environmental drivers of shifts between C3 and CAM photosynthesis and the impact of these shifts on the origin and maintenance of species diversity. Furthermore, shifts in gene function associated with the gain and loss of CAM will be tested through genetic analyses of a yucca hybrid, resulting from a natural cross between a CAM and C3 parental species, and experimental manipulations of gene expression in the emerging orchid model species, Erycina pusilla (Oncidiinae).",

However, for plants living under water?limited conditions, photosynthetic productivity can be reduced by hotter and drier climatic conditions. Some plants employ modified forms of photosynthesis that increase their water?use efficiency under extreme environmental conditions. Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) is one such innovation that has facilitated diversification in a wide array of plant lineages. As part of a collaborative grant opportunity we studied the evolution of CAM in the orchid family, wherein many species with an array of vegetative forms thrive in epiphytic niches where water is limited. We used the species <em>Erycina pusilla</em> of the orchid subtribe Oncidiinae as a model species for functional research, with stable genetic modification routine and time to flowering of transformant plants in as few as 17 months. We performed gene expression analysis in Eycina pusilla, a CAM species and <em>Erycina crista?-galli</em>, a C3 (standardly photosynthesizing) species, throughout the 24 hour light?dark growth cycle, and correlated results with physiological evidence for CAM activity. Our overarching project goals were to understand CAM regulatory diversity accompanying its evolution, and the organismal diversity (phylogenetic, morphological, physiological) afforded by CAM in these orchids. Additional research permitted by personnel funds granted to this project led to publications on the genomes of avocado (<em>Persea americana</em>), gardenia (<em>Gardenia jasminoides</em>), silver birch (<em>Betula pendula</em>), the carnivorous bladderwort (<em>Utricularia gibba</em>), and the carnivorous Australian pitcher plant (<em>Cephalotus follicularis</em>). We also generated an as-yet unpublished genome sequence of the critically-endangered lady slipper orchid <em>Mexipedium xerophyticum</em>, which although likely a C3 plant, has succulent leaf features that make it extremely interesting to compare with its thin-leaved closest relatives in the genus <em>Phragmipedium</em>. In another effort to examine water-limiting photosynthetic adaptations in plants, we have sequenced the genomes of three members of the carnivorous plant genus <em>Pinguicula</em>, the carnivorous butterworts. While most butterworts are native to wet habitats, a number of species in Mexico have drought-associated vegetative adaptations that we interested in studying along with their acquisition of plant carnivory. For example, some species are highly succulent (at least their resting winter stages), and we have found that they also display signs of Kranz vascular anatomy, which is a typical morphological trait of C4 photosynthesis, a carbon-concentrating photosynthetic physiology similar in enzymology to CAM. The drought-adaptive features of some of the Mexican species, for which we have generated a chromosome-scale assembly of <em>Pinguicula gigantea</em>, may provide an interesting model system for pursuing the molecular basis for drought-adaptation in these otherwise exquisitely moisture-adapted plants.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/10/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Victor&nbsp;A&nbsp;Albert</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1442190/1442190_10340985_1605024894084_Erycina_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1442190/1442190_10340985_1605024894084_Erycina_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Erycina pusilla in a bottle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1442190/1442190_10340985_1605024894084_Erycina_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Erycina pusilla in a bottle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Erycina pusilla, a miniature orchid that with Crassulacean Acid Metabolism photosynthetic physiology, is so rapid-cycling in its growth and reproduction that it can bloom in a tissue culture bottle.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Victor A.
