 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, nonprofits and corporations have created partnerships to address a variety of social issues. The partnerships can take many forms including philanthropy, cause marketing, brand certification, and collective impact arrangements. Through communication, the contours of the partnership are made known to different stakeholder groups thereby influencing attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism. The research examines both activists and consumers' reactions to a variety of messages about corporate-NGO partnerships by using a series of three on-line experiments to map both consumers and activists' mental models of corporations and NGOs. This project fulfills three important objectives: (1) to further our understanding of the impact of communicated NGO-corporate partnerships on consumers and activists' attitudes, intention to purchase, intention to donate, and intention to engage in activism, (2) to understand the ways that such messages might overcome initially incongruent pairings through the inclusion of or exclusion of certain message characteristics, and (3) to understand how the different forms of NGO-corporate partnership may moderate these relationships. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is three-fold. First, it contributes to the study of semantic networks by investigating factors that shape how individuals' mental models evolve to incorporate new information. Second, this project extends previous marketing research on brand pairings to include a broader spectrum of social issues, stakeholders beyond consumers (i.e., activists), and multiple types of NGO-corporate partnerships. Third, it contributes to a broad-based understanding of the network of NGO-corporate partnerships through its testing of theoretically driven propositions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research offers three broader impacts for educational, policy and industry sectors. First, the project advances social science and computer science interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation by bringing together undergraduate and graduate student researchers. As such, it aims to train a new generation of students in scientific methods. Second, the findings will illuminate why some nonprofits are less likely to be supported by public funding thus allowing  policymakers to make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support. Third, as companies seek to improve relationships with consumers and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings will offer industry leaders information regarding how communication influences stakeholders support of partnerships.",

The project had 2 primary activities. First, we developed a software program (BrANDi) to more accurately collect individual&rsquo;s mind maps of particular objects, in our case nonprofits and corporations. This computer program allowed us to achieve two key objectives of the grant. Through BrANDi, we developed a better understanding of how people link ideas in their mind maps and amend those ideas when exposed to information. This a significant development for the study of persuasion and theorizing in the semantic network area of network science research. The software will become available via open-source at the conclusion of the grant so that other researchers can benefit from its development.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second, we conducted 3 large-scale experiments with a total sample of 2567 from across the United States. Each experiment investigated how messages and types of partnerships moderate stakeholder evaluations of corporate-nonprofit partnerships. The experiments expanded our understanding of how different types of partnerships influence an individual&rsquo;s intention to donate, volunteer, award punitive damages, engage in activism, as well as their perceptions of corporate/nonprofit reputation. We find that pre-existing attitudes about corporations and nonprofits play a significant role in determining how individuals evaluate partnerships. However, these attitudes alone do not explain partnership evaluations. We find that three communication factors influence the perceptions of the partnership above and beyond the effects associated with varying the nonprofit and corporation that are listed as partners: 1) when the nonprofit executive director communicates about the partnership (as opposed to a corporate CEO), 2) when the partnership is a familiar type (i.e., sponsorship), and 3) when a rationale for the partnership is presented. Finally, we find that activists are more persuaded by rationales for the partnership than individuals who are less likely to engage in corporate activism.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This grant makes five contributions to current scholarship by addressing gaps in corporate social responsibility communication, nonprofit research, and semantic network analysis research.</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Semantic network analysis has most often examined the proximity of words in a text (see Shumate et al. 2013), and has found application in the study of big data and online communities.

The first of these impacts is the training of a computer science graduate student in social scientific research methods, namely experimental methods. Such interdisciplinary collaboration is important as it advances both social science and computer science research agendas. Second, this research recruited and trained a group of fifteen undergraduate research assistants to administer the online experiments and conduct preliminary data analysis. As such, a new generation of students was trained in social scientific methods. Finally, this research has important impacts for both economic activity in the US and for the funding of important social issues. As corporate and nonprofit managers seek to discern the best possible partner and how to communicate about the partnership to enhance stakeholder evaluations and limit risk exposure from activists, the findings of this research provide insights. Further, as governments increasingly turn to nonprofits and corporations to address social issues, our research identifies the types of nonprofits that generate more stakeholder support which helping policymakers make informed decisions about which social issues could be turned over to private funding sources and which will continue to need taxpayer support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/05/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michelle&nbsp;Shumate</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359610/1359610_10297829_1530823627548_ScreenShot2018-07-05at2.49.37PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359610/1359610_10297829_1530823627548_ScreenShot2018-07-05at2.49.37PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BrANDi image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359610/1359610_10297829_1530823627548_ScreenShot2018-07-05at2.49.37PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BrANDi image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of the links creation exercise in step 2 of the BrANDi software</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Amy O'Connor, Michelle Shumate, Pranav Dass</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michelle&nbsp;Shumate</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BrANDi image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359610/1359610_10297829_1530823567934_ScreenShot2018-07-05at2.47.24PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359610/1359610_10297829_1530823567934_ScreenShot2018-07-05at2.47.24PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BrANDi image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359610/1359610_10297829_1530823567934_ScreenShot2018-07-05at2.47.24PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BrANDi image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of thought listing exercise in the first step of the BrANDi software</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Amy O'Connor, Michelle Shumate, Pranav Dass</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michelle&nbsp;Shumate</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BrANDi image</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
