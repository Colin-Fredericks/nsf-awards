 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the serious effects of extreme events in the Sun, solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere system has societal urgency as these events are the ones what can cause damage to systems in space and on the ground. Over the past few years it has become increasing evident that the system needs to be studied as a whole.  However, to do so requires combining large amounts of data ranging from solar remote sensing to in situ observations in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.  Large scale models of the entire system are needed to organize and interpret the diverse observations. Just determining how to do this is a significant task.  The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the value of synoptic analyses for producing new discoveries about how connections within the geospace system create new or modified phenomena, for raising new questions about individual processes by looking at things from a different perspective, and for developing innovative ways of leveraging all the information from global models and diverse data sets into the most complete picture possible of the geospace response and the solar drivers. The final outcome of this work will be a review article referencing all of these and previous synoptic work, drawing together the broader picture with lessons learned which will serve as a reference for the details of achieving data/model closure",
