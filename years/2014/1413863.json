 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n The objective of this project is to explore the operation principle of transmitarray antennas. The proposed research will investigate the transmission properties of novel antenna elements inspired by complementary geometries and gradient index metamaterials. Based on these element innovations, this project will address two important concerns in transmitarrays: the bandwidth enhancement and beam shaping. A thorough study will be carried out to understand the bandwidth limits of a transmitarray; and both multi-resonant element and multi-resonant aperture approaches will be applied to increase the antenna bandwidth. To shape the radiation beam, an efficient synthesis algorithm based on the intersection approach will be developed for large-aperture transmitarrays. Using this algorithm, a single-feed quad-beam transmitarray will be developed to demonstrate the advanced radiation capability of the transmitarray. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits \r\nCompared to existing high gain antennas, the transmitarray antenna is a transformative concept with unique radiation principle. Because of the simultaneous magnitude and phase control of the antenna elements, the transmitarray exhibits numerous advantages, such as low profile conformal geometry, high radiation efficiency, and advanced radiation patterns. The broadband performance and multi-beam operation are attractive merits of transmitarray antennas to be studied in this project. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe transmitarray concept has wide applications in many science and engineering missions such as Earth remote sensing and spatial power combining in high energy systems. This project will also provide an exciting learning environment for both undergraduate and graduate students to obtain knowledge in electromagnetics, microwaves, and antennas. It will help to improve the environment for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in Mississippi (an EPSCoR State) and to generate qualified work force, which includes under-represented groups, for future scientific and engineering development.\r\n",

Moreover, detailed analysis of the transmitarray antenna performance considering oblique incidence angles on the off-center elements of the array and the feed polarization state are performed, to study their impact on trransmitarray antenna gain and radiation pattern characteristics.\n\n\nIn order to reduce transmitarray design complexity and cost, three different methods are investigated to design triple-layer transmitarray antennas, while maintaining the overall performance with full transmission coefficient phase range of 360&deg; and avoiding the reduction of the element transmission coefficient magnitude. Based on this analysis, a novel high gain broadband triple-layer transmitarray antenna using spiral-dipole elements has been designed, fabricated, and tested at X-band. The spiral-dipole element has a large range of variation in the element dimensions, creating an ideal linear slope for the phase, which makes the design less sensitive to manufacturing error. The element phase distribution on the transmitarray aperture is optimized to decrease the loss due to elements having transmission magnitude less than one, leading to an average element loss as low as 0.49 dB. This design achieved a measured gain of 28.9dB at 11.3 GHz, aperture efficiency of 30%, and gain bandwidth of 9% and 19.4% at -1 dB and -3 dB below the maximum gain.\n\n\nNew design methodologies are proposed to improve the bandwidth of transmitarray antennas. Variation in the transmission coefficient of transmitarray elements as a function of frequency is first studied. This study clarifies that for quad-layer transmitarrays, elements with transmission phases around 270&deg; suffer from deterioration in both transmission magnitude and phase with the change of frequency. This in turn limits the transmitarray bandwidth. Accordingly, to increase the bandwidth of a transmitarray antenna, a truncation of the full phase range is performed in the element selection routine, which avoids certain elements around this frequency-sensitive phase region. Moreover, an optimization of the phase distribution of transmitarray elements is carried out to keep the ..."
