 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will map glacial deposits and date variations in glacier variability at several ice-free regions in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. These data will constrain the nature and timing of past ice thickness changes for major glaciers that drain into the northwestern Ross Sea. This is important because during the Last Glacial Maximum (15,000 - 18,000 years ago) these glaciers were most likely flowing together with grounded ice from both the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets that expanded across the Ross Sea continental shelf to near the present shelf edge. Thus, the thickness of these glaciers was most likely controlled in part by the extent and thickness of the Ross Sea ice sheet and ice shelf. The data the PIs propose to collect can provide constraints on the position of the grounding line in the western Ross Sea during the Last Glacial Maximum, the time that position was reached, and ice thickness changes that occurred after that time. The primary intellectual merit of this project will be to improve understanding of a period of Antarctic ice sheet history that is relatively unconstrained at present and also potentially important in understanding past ice sheet-sea level interactions. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will support an early career researcher's ongoing program of undergraduate education and research that is building a socio-economically diverse student body with students from backgrounds underrepresented in the geosciences. This proposal will also bring an early career researcher into Antarctic research.",

All participants are or were geosciences students at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, WA. Because of the complex logistics associated with Antarctic field work, our research team was only able to involve one undergraduate in Antarctic field work. This student, Isaac Moening-Swanson, spent a summer studying satellite imagery of our field site and making preliminary maps of glacial geologic features such as moraines, linear deposits of rocks that indicate past glacier margins. These features provide clues about where the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was in the past. Combined with dating techniques performed by colleagues at Berkeley Geochronology Center and Tulane University, we're using these glacial geologic features and their numerical dates to build a history of ice sheet retreat. Isaac and Dr. Claire Todd traveled to Antarctica in November 2014. With our colleagues, we mapped and collected samples from glacial deposits in the northwestern Ross Sea, mostly near Tucker Glacier. Our analysis is still in progress, but when we're finished we'll have a history of ice sheet thinning in this part of West Antarctica. This history helps us place more recent ice sheet change into a long-term context, and also helps us understand how the ice sheet has responded to past climate changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to provide research opportunities to students besides Isaac, we turned to an amazing laboratory for studying glaciers - Mount Rainier National Park, only one hour from our campus. Mount Rainier is the most glaciated peak in the lower 48, and offers many opportunities for students to learn more about glacial processes and to practice scientific research. All told, 11 undergraduate students were supported as part of this grant. They investigated Antarctic ice sheet history using previously published oceanic sediment data, calculated Antarctic and Mount Rainier glacier response to climate change using computer models, measured how snow levels on Mount Rainier have changed with time using satellite imagery, mapped glacial sediments in front of and on top of the glaciers, and analyzed glacial meltwater to see how much sediment the glaciers produce and to learn which glaciers are influenced by volcanic processes! These students practiced using field and laboratory instruments that are commonly deployed in our profession, and they learned different software packages central to geosciences research! Almost all students presented their work at a local or national conference.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of these 11 students, two are currently enrolled in graduate programs in geosciences, three are planning to enroll in graduate school, two are preparing to become teachers, and one is employed by a engineering firm! The other three are still finishing their studies at PLU.</p>\n<p>In addition to involving undergraduates, this grant supported outreach to three high schools, two middle schools, and two elementary schools.
