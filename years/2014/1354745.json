 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal for this investigation is determine how vertebrate sensory systems are integrated to perform complex behavioral tasks.  It will address how multimodal (auditory, vestibular and mechanosensory) sensory input is processed.  The experiments will be performed in the oyster toadfish which possess the identical sensory cells (hair cells) and vestibular system found in mammals, assuring the results will have wide interest to vertebrate sensory physiologists.  The investigator will use a neural telemetry transmitter tag, to record nerve impulses from free swimming fish which will transform the experiments from the bench top into the environment and allow the correlation of neural activity with normal behavior in a natural setting.  The study will address two long standing questions in neuroethology: how fish localize sound underwater, and the effect of self generated movement on bimodal sensory (auditory and vestibular or mechanosensory) organs. The award will support training of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups at a research undergraduate institution and a middle school science teacher.\r\n\r\nThe experiments will delineate multi-modal sensory guidance of a complex behavioral sequence to further our knowledge of the neural mechanisms of sensory integration. Sound localization for fish plays important roles in prey detection, predator avoidance, and intraspecific communication. Although terrestrial animals use interaural time delays to localize sound, the faster speed of sound underwater, combined with very short interaural distances suggests that fish must utilize alternative mechanisms. The role of the mechanosensory lateral line in detecting water movement has been established, however, recent evidence suggest that it may serve an auditory role. The widely spaced neuromasts are distributed throughout the head and trunk in different orientations and could potentially assist in nearfield sound detection and localization. The researchers will investigate acoustic sensitivity in the lateral line in the toadfish to determine if it contributes to sound localization. Toadfish are reliable neuroethological models for bioacoustic studies as males will acoustically attract females to nesting sites. The broad head of the oyster toadfish contains widely spaced and easily accessible neuromasts and cranial nerves. The neural telemetry tag will allow examination of multimodal sensory integration by simultaneously recording from both the lateral line and otoliths during sound localization experiments in free swimming fish.  Phonotaxis experiments will determine if superficial and/or canal neuromasts are necessary for sound localization.  The study will provide clearer understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating behavior and provide training to underrepresented undergraduate students and K-12 teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the project was to investigate how fish detect, integrate and respond to external environmental clues and to determine the effect of self movement on sensory systems.  We concentrated on two multimodal systems, the mechanosensory lateral line that detects water movement and sound, and the utricular otolith of the inner ear which responds to linear movement and auditory input.  To allow us to record from freely swimming fish, we developed an implantable micromanipulator manufactured from a  3-D printer that allowed us to chronically implant electrodes into the nerves of the oyster toadfish.  The fish was subjected to sound, water movement and mechanical vibration while stationary and while swimming.  It was determined that both the lateral line and utricle had directionally sensitive fibers that may potentially contribute to sound localization. The lateral line nerve firing rate was correlated with increases in stimulus intensity, however, many utricular fibers returned to steady state firing levels after the initial stimulus. \n\nIntellectual merit:  These were the first experiments done in freely moving fish while the fish were subjected to additional external stimulus.  This allowed the impact of multi modal input to be determined on two sensory systems which are stimulated by self motion.  Movement caused the lateral line to increase firing rates however it did not saturate at the swim speeds tested and therefore remained sensitive to natural relevant auditory input (male toadfish mating calls) with no evidence of efferent modulation cancelling the self movement input.  In contrast, the utricle quickly adapted to movement and decreased its firing rate which allowed it to remain sensitive to the external stimuli.  However, in this case, it was unclear if efferent modulation was responsible. \n\nAdditional work using passive acoustic provided insight into the male toadfish vocalizations patterns.  A hydrophone array allowed continuous identification and monitoring of vocalizing male toadfish.  This represented the first time individual fish were tracked over the course of the season and changes in signal parameters were determined.  The rate and composition of the call evolves over the season which means female auditory sensitivity must either be sufficiently broad or amendable to change in order to find mates.\n\nBroader impacts:  Five undergraduates received REU support on the project including a community college student, and two students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields.  A middle school science teacher was awarded several Research Experience for Teachers awards and worked in the lab for several summer.  The PI ran the NSF-REU site, Biological Discovery in Woods Hole, throughout the duration of this grant and lead career development workshops for all undergraduate students during the summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allen Mensinger"
