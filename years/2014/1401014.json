 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diversity of venoms within a group of organisms is largely the product of gene duplication and subsequent DNA sequence diversification. The specifics of this process remain obscure in most organisms.  The planned research uses sea anemones (Cnidaria: Anthozoa, Actiniaria) as a model to understand the genome-level processes like gene duplications in shaping venom repertoire.  The incidence of gene duplication and the processes by which duplicated genes diversify or become non-functional can be inferred through the analysis of the sequences that flank functional venom genes and the regions of the genome in which venoms are particularly common.\r\n\r\nSea anemones are part of the oldest and largest group of extant venomous animals. Their venoms exhibit a variety of functions, including disrupting the control of ion channels, destabilizing cellular membranes, or inhibiting synthesis of lipids. The functional and structural diversity of venoms is underpinned by an even greater degree of diversity at the genetic level. This more detailed account of venom diversity thus has potential for studies of function and structure of venom, and may have applications of interest to pharmacological or medical research.  Additional benefits to the broader community include the training of graduate and undergraduate students, outreach to general and technical audiences through presentations, and published scientific studies of gene diversity and evolution.",
