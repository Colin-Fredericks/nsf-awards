 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate a innovative  device architecture (UT-FET: Ultra Thin Field Effect Transistor) for scaling of FinFET devices beyond the 14nm node.  The outcome of this project will be a CMOS device that is scalable and reduce off-state leakage as well as minimize threshold voltage variation.  This project will develop a process technology that is compatible with high volume manufacturing using industrial toolsets.  The main objective for the phase 1 of the proposed SBIR project is to demonstrate prototype UT-FET devices using manufacturing-capable tools and processes.  The UT-FET device architecture involves a novel means of isolation of the device that can reduce cost, reduce leakage and increase speed of electronics systems.  In this phase 1 of the SBIR project, production capable tools and processes will be used to demonstrate scalability of the technology for volume manufacturing. Successful completion of this technology demonstration can allow insertion of this technology into the growing markets for low power mobile communications electronics.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be address and overcome  the current limits to scaling in low power electronic devices. Low  power electronics devices use CMOS technologies and the scaling of these devices have been the driving force behind the communication revolution over the last two decades. Further scaling of these devices will enable faster communication, longer battery life and more energy efficient operation of electronics systems. Additionally in the process of developing and demonstrating this technology new scientific and technological understanding of using thin crystalline devices and the tools to manufacture them in high volume will enable other applications in energy, RF signal processing and power management.",

Rao (Co-PI), Applied Novel Devices, Inc., Austin TX\n\n \n\nResearch Summary and Key Results:\n\nAs part of this NSF SBIR phase I project, it was proposed to develop Novel transistor devices by creating thin crystalline regions in the channel regions of state of the art CMOS and Power MOSFET transistors. When the regions under the channel of these devices are thinned and isolated the Field Effect Transistors (UT-FET) have the potential to substantially improve device characteristics and reduce process costs. These devices are the building blocks of all signal processing and power conversion electronics in use today and commercial viability of this technology will have a significant impact on the semiconductor device technology roadmap.\n\n \n\n Over the last six months beginning January 2014 work on various process, device and tool aspects of this technology have been successfully developed as outlined in this report. These results allow further work to move towards phase II and commercialization and these tasks are ongoing.\n\n \n\nThe key technology required to accomplish the new device architecture is thin silicon regions under the channel. Several experiments were proposed to selectively remove Silicon from under the channel regions of FinFETs fabricated on bulk Silicon wafers. This process can enable significant process cost savings and improve device characteristics.  CMOS and Power MOSFET devices have been successfully demonstrated as part of this phase I project.\n\n \n\n Discussion of Results\n\nPreviously proof of concept of this device scheme had been demonstrated using focused ion beam (FIB) before the SBIR proposal. FIB is a limited experimental technique and not suited for high volume manufacturing.  As part of this phase I SBIR project it was proposed that more industrial process will be evaluated.

The results of these experiments for this module are explained below.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Conclusions of the Phase I findings and how these conclusions contribute towards ongoing tasks and Phase II proposal\n\n \n\nThe conclusions of the Phase 1 findings are as follows\n\n \n\nWe have developed a suite of process technologies for local and wafer scale thinning of Silicon wafers that can be applied to a wide range of electronic devices from  FinFET based CMOS to improving performance of Power MOSFET devices.\nIt is feasible to use industrial process such as polish and etch to form very deep silicon trenches and isolate CMOS devices.\nIt is feasible to produce functional Power MOSFET devices by removing the top few microns of silicon from a  power MOSFET wafer and then complete the devices with metallization on the other side.\n The CMOS devices can be etched stoped using selective etch stop chemistries\nThe Power MSOFET devices can be completed using metal removal selectively after spalling as shown in patent US7749884 .\nThe CMOS devices and Power MOSFET device wafers were further processed and these wafers showed that structural integrity is maintained after the process of forming thin crystalline regions.\n\n\n \n\nThere is a need to fully understand how the thin crystalline power MOSFET devices can be handled after final processing to accommodate for potential curl in the finished wafers.  While these foils have a curl, this curl can be that mechanically minimized in a temporary holder and further processed. Large volume process using these foils needs further experiments.\n\n\n \n\nThese conclusions have significantly de-risked the fundamental feasibility questions that needed to be resolved before further investment ..."
