 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biotherapeutics, such as proteins and DNA, are an emerging field in the treatment of cancer and debilitating genetic disorders. They are currently limited to targets outside the cell because the cell membrane is a highly selective barrier. By facilitating the delivery of biotherapeutics across the cell membrane, the quantities of drug needed, and the resulting side effects on healthy tissues can be significantly reduced. Cell penetrating peptides allow the delivery of biotherapeutics and other biologically active materials across the cell membrane. The mechanism of cellular entry of these cell penetrating peptides remains a topic of debate. This proposal will focus on quantifying the relationship between molecular structure and uptake mechanisms for novel polymer-based cell-penetrating peptides with Dr. Futaki at Kyoto University in Japan. The Futaki lab has a long history of researching uptake mechanisms of CPPs and their synthetic counterparts to develop novel, efficient, and effective means for drug delivery. A fundamental understanding of these mechanisms is paramount to further development and optimization of these delivery agents. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will use a ring-opening metathesis polymerization-based synthetic platform to correlate molecular architecture to membrane translocation. Given the robust protein delivery of our polymer series, this research will investigate the predominant method of cellular entry for these CPP mimics. By varying the ratio of guanadinium and hydrophobic moieties in the block copolymer CPP mimics, the predominant mode of translocation based on molecular structure will be evaluated. This research will provide fundamental insight in design parameters that promote robust uptake and efficient biotherapeutic delivery. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science.",
