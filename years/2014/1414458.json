 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, to Professor Webster L. Santos of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University examines the reactivity of copper boryl complexes, develops copper catalysts (with particular focus on those containing inexpensive ligands), and explores new solvents, including water, for borylation and subsequent cross-coupling processes.  The team conducts fundamental experimental and theoretical studies on the structures and reactivities of well-defined copper boryl, aryl and alkyl complexes as well as associated catalyst screening studies. This research develops novel catalyst systems that replace rare, expensive, and toxic transition metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir, etc.) with earth abundant metals such as copper.  The investigations minimize the production of hazardous waste by utilizing water as solvent rather than an organic solution.\r\n\r\nThis project is conducted in collaboration with Professor Todd B. Marder (Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) and Professor Yao Fu (University of Science and Technology China).  Together, the three groups combine their separate areas of expertise to provide more sustainable synthetic methods for the production of commodity chemicals.  The broader impacts of this work also include leadership training for graduate students and an international exchange of ideas and expertise.",
