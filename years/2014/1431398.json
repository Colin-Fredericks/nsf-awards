She will also conduct a quantitative survey of current students in natural resource fields.\r\n \r\nThe project will help promote diversity in the natural resource career fields and will result in the co-PI  completing theoretically driven research using social research designs, methods and analysis. The researchers will build partnerships with natural resource institutions and agencies that will encourage future collaborations. Research results will be disseminated through presentations at stakeholder meetings, an international conference, through manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and a report to natural resource agencies, non-government organizations and academic programs.",
