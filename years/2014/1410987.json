 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\n\r\nIntracellular bacterial infections are caused by bacteria that reside in host cells such as macrophages and multiply, avoiding detection and destruction by the host immune system. These infections are currently managed by oral or injectable antibiotics, which reach the infected cells only after spreading in the entire body. The therapeutic outcomes of traditional antibiotics treatment have not been satisfactory, because many antibiotics do not enter mammalian cells and access the intracellular pathogens. Moreover, the pathogens tend to develop resistance to the antibiotic treatment as a consequence of persistent suboptimal delivery of antibiotics. For the effective management of intracellular bacterial infections, there is a critical unmet need for new types of antimicrobials, which will effectively eradicate intracellular bacteria without inducing resistance, and an appropriate carrier system that will deliver the new agents specifically to the infected macrophages and the pathogens resident in the cells. In this research the PIs propose to develop new materials that may be of potential use in addressing intracellular bacterial infections. Specifically, the PIs will use positively charged peptides with potent antimicrobial activity to replace traditional antibiotics. The PIs will administer these peptides using pH-sensitive polysaccharides, which will take the peptides to the infected cells and help unpack them where the peptides are most needed. This project has the potential to bring about novel materials that may be of use relative to intractable intracellular infections. In addition, it will create a sustainable research platform for interdisciplinary collaborations and contribute to the next generation science education through active participation in institutional outreach service and joint summer research fellowship programs.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nIntracellular bacterial infections are currently managed by systemic administration of antibiotics. However, their therapeutic outcomes have not been satisfactory, because of the inefficient intracellular delivery of antibiotics and frequent emergence of bacterial resistance to the treatment. For the effective management of intracellular bacterial infections, there is a critical unmet need for new types of antimicrobials, which will treat persistent and multi-drug resistant intracellular bacterial infections, and an appropriate carrier system that will deliver the new agents specifically to the infected macrophages and the pathogens resident in the cells. Ideal treatment of intracellular pathogens should have low potential to induce bacterial resistance and be able to travel across the eukaryotic cell membrane and access pathogens residing inside the cells. To satisfy these requirements, the PIs will develop antimicrobial semi-nanoparticles (SNPs), consisting of (i) cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), a new class of antibacterial agents, and (ii) pH-sensitive polysaccharides, a carrier of CAMPs. The underlying hypothesis of this approach is that CAMPs will overcome the prevalent bacterial resistance through distinct mechanisms of action, and a pH-sensitive SNP system will offer a means to target the organs harboring infected cells (liver and spleen) and traffic CAMPs within the cells to access the intracellular pathogens. This research will bring about three outcomes with broad impact: medical benefits to patients with intractable intracellular infections; sustainable research platform for interdisciplinary collaborations; and outreach activities for advanced science education, including leadership in institutional service programs and implementation of joint summer research fellowships.",

We hypothesize that antimicrobial peptides will overcome the prevalent bacterial resistance through distinct mechanisms of action, and a pH-sensitive SNP delivery system will offer a means to target the liver and spleen and bring antimicrobial peptides into the infected cells to access the intracellular pathogens. Two SNP systems were developed for intracellular delivery of antimicrobial peptides.</p>\n<p>The first system (PpZEV, <strong>Fig. 1</strong>) is developed to deliver vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic. It consists of polymers with distinct functions: poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethylene glycol-PLGA conjugate (PEG-PLGA), Eudragit E100 (E100, &nbsp;a copolymer of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate at a ratio of 2:1:1), and a chitosan derivative with a pH sensitive charge profile. PLGA serves as the main delivery platform, in which PEG-PLGA helps maintain an appropriate level of polarity for timely release of vancomycin. E100, a cationic copolymer soluble at &lt; pH 5, is blended as a minor fraction of polymer matrix to retain the drug. Finally, a chitosan derivative, called zwitterionic chitosan (ZWC), is included to trigger the drug release after cellular uptake of the particles. ZWC is negatively charged at pH 7.4 but positively charged in weakly acidic environment. ZWC is thus expected to neutralize the cationic charge of E100 at physiological pH to mitigate potential toxicity but enhance the drug release in acidic milieu via electrostatic repulsion of E100-bound vancomycin. The NPs were produced in the range of 500-1000 nm to promote preferential uptake by macrophages while avoiding embolism. We demonstrated that PpZEV NPs showed better antimicrobial activity than free vancomycin against intracellular pathogens (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>) and intravenously administered PpZEV NPs rapidly accumulated in the liver and spleen, the target organs of intracellular infection (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). In this follow up study, we examined in vivo pharmacodynamics of PpZEV NPs in comparison with free vancomycin in a mouse model of MRSA infection. Treatments were given one hour after the infection of MRSA USA300. When evaluated 20 h after treatment, the mice receiving free vancomycin showed no difference from the PBS-treated control group in bacterial counts in the liver, spleen or lungs. In contrast, the bacterial counts in the organs of the mice treated with PpZEV were significantly lower than those of the control group.</p>\n<p>The second system (NP-pTA-Ag) is developed for the delivery of pexiganan, a cationic antimicrobial peptide, with an antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria. Pexiganan was encapsulated in submicron PLGA particles, and the surface was decorated with additional microbial agent Ag nanoparticles (Pex@NP-pTA-Ag) with the aid of tannic acid-Fe<sup>3+</sup> coordination complex assemblies. NP-pTA-Ag entered macrophages rather than fibroblasts, enabling selective drug delivery to macrophages. NP-pTA-Ag reduced the toxicity of Ag to non-phagocytic cells by limiting its uptake, while effectively delivering pexiganan and Ag to macrophages infected with different intracellular pathogens. With an average diameter of 600 nm, NP-pTA-Ag were rapidly accumulated in the liver and spleen upon intravenous injection. These results support that PpZEV and NP-pTA-Ag are promising carriers of antimicrobial agents for the therapy of intracellular bacterial infection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impact</strong></p>\n<p>Five undergraduate students did undergraduate research in the PI's laboratory for academic credits and summer fellowship, and three graduate students were supported by the grant throughout the project period.

Findings of this study were disseminated through publications and invited talks in conferences and domestic and foreign institutions. Our study has contributed to increasing awareness of the shortage of antibiotics for therapy of intracellular bacterial infection and the utility of particulate formulations for overcoming such a challenge.
