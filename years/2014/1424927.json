 "awd_abstract_narration": "Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is one water reuse technique with the potential to meet growing water demands. In MAR, reclaimed wastewater is injected into aquifer formations for later use. Although filtration and adsorption in the vadose zone and underlying aquifer can remove some contaminants from reclaimed water, unfavorable soil-water interactions can mobilize arsenic from arsenic-bearing aquifer formations. This work will investigate how the interactions between water and arsenic-bearing pyrite, such as arsenopyrite/arsenian pyrite, impact arsenic mobility during MAR, and investigators will provide new quantitative and qualitative fundamental information on the redox-promoted dissolution mechanisms of arsenic-bearing pyrite and the consequent nucleation, growth, and phase transformation of iron (hydr)oxide nanoparticles, which are closely linked with arsenic mobilization and attenuation. By combining novel multidisciplinary approaches and in situ observations, including atomic force microscopy using an electrochemical control, small angle X-ray scattering, and batch reactor experimental measurements, they will obtain quantitative parameters and clearer qualitative descriptions of the thermodynamics and kinetics of initial iron (hydr)oxide nuclei evolution at the mineral-water interface. For the first time, new information on nucleation will be incorporated into geochemical reactive transport models to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results will also be compared with available data from pilot-scale column experiments at the U.S. EPA's Test & Evaluation Facility in Cincinnati, OH, and from MAR field sites. The results will help determine pretreatment requirements for reclaimed water sources and will provide a basis for developing more sustainable MAR operation guidelines. Beyond this application, the knowledge gained can be applied to related geochemical systems, including regions struggling with pervasive arsenic contamination of groundwater and environments where quantification of arsenic sorption onto nanoscale iron (hydr)oxide precipitates is a source of great uncertainty. \r\n\r\nThe proposed outreach plan will provide educational, research, public engagement, and professional development opportunities for middle school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. It will have far-reaching societal impacts. In addition, the participation of traditionally underrepresented students will be encouraged. To achieve this goal, investigators will develop a \"Hot Topics\" website and related workshops focused on water quality concepts, in collaboration with Washington University's Institute for School Partnership and teachers from St. Louis' middle and high schools. To encourage high school and undergraduate students' early involvement in science and engineering, they will provide scientific research projects and offer public lectures on water quality.",

Over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation, coupled with insufficient aquifer management has led to groundwater depletion, one of the highest threats to global water security. In the past few decades, managed aquifer recharge (MAR), an engineered process of intentionally injecting secondary water sources (e.g., reclaimed water, rainwater, and surface runoff) into ground aquifers, has been applied globally to better manage groundwater and alleviate the severe consequences of groundwater over-drafting. This project supports sustainable MAR by illuminating phenomena at the interface of water and arsenic-bearing pyrite. These phenomena can significantly impact the fate and transport of arsenic in aquifer formations. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we investigated nano- and microscale arsenic mobilization and attenuation mechanisms. To make field scale predictions, this work incorporated experimental data and field site information in geochemical reactive transport modeling. A novel aspect of the project is obtaining new quantitative <em>in situ</em> experimental data on oxidative dissolution of arsenic-bearing pyrite and consequential iron (hydr)oxide formation. The data were incorporated into a reactive transport model by considering nucleation and surface area evolution. Linking multiscale experiments with modeling offers a robust scientific platform for developing better guidelines for sustainable MAR operations and provides quantitative understanding of the impacts of newly formed iron (hydr)oxide nanoparticles on arsenic mobility in aquifers as well as surface waters. The principles and findings from this work can also be used for research on other materials, and for minimizing waste and optimizing outputs in manufacturing processes for nanomaterials. Additionally, the theoretical approach developed in this study can be applicable to other disciplines that require a more accurate knowledge of nucleation phenomena.</p>\n<p>From this project, the PI's team has published 8 peer-reviewed articles, submitted two papers, and will submit at least two more papers in early 2019, for a total of 12 articles. The PI's team disseminated their research outcomes through 16 invited presentations and 13 contributed presentations at national and international conferences, universities, laboratories, and industries. Two doctoral dissertations will result from the project. One dissertation has been published in 2015, and one will be completed by spring 2020. Our published article related to MAR was featured on the <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology </em>(ES&amp;T) Journal's website in its week of publication, and chosen as the Best Science Paper of the Year (2014) published in <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology </em>among 1700 publications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: The project provides educational, research, public engagement, and professional development opportunities for middle school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. To achieve this goal, we developed and continue to offer \"Hot Topics\" workshops focused on water quality concepts, in collaboration with Washington University's Institute for School Partnership (ISP) and teachers from St. Louis' middle schools. To encourage high school and undergraduate students' early involvement in science and engineering, we provide scientific research projects and offer public lectures on water quality and managed aquifer recharge.</p>\n<p>Since 2014, seven participants have been involved in this project, five of whom were from groups underrepresented in science and engineering. Three doctoral students and three undergraduate students participated in this project, enhancing their career perspectives. In the project, the PI and her students have developed, disseminated, and further improved water quality and conservation educational modules and managed aquifer recharge demonstration kits. Through hands-on workshops and Hot Topics workshops on managed aquifer recharge and sustainable water management, the PI's group worked together with Washington University's Institute for School Partnership (ISP) and teachers in the greater St. Louis area. The project team provided raw materials for demonstration kits and helped middle and high school teachers to build the kits during the workshops for use in their classes. In particular, the project activity on aquifer recharge was put into \"Module 13: Cycles on Earth\" in the MySci Science Curriculum. Based on ISP's statistics, in the 2017-18 school year, Module 13 of the MySci science curriculum was used by 23 schools in 18 school districts. A total of 43 teachers received and used this teaching module, reaching at least 4000 middle school students in St. Louis area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
