 "awd_abstract_narration": "Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC) and partners are implementing the Preparing Vehicle Technicians for Advanced Transportation Fuels project. The project advances knowledge of the evolving transportation industry by training secondary and two-year college students, educators and incumbent workers in advanced transportation technologies and alternative fuels.  Further, it provides hands-on experiences that directly correlate to real-life industry concepts through redesigned curricula, summer academies, teacher professional development, and technician training.  Societal benefits include preparing the 21st century workforce in Kentucky and the nation to be knowledgeable of the evolving technologies that are transforming the transportation industry.  Public science literacy is enhanced by offering opportunities for engagement with science and technology through a variety of outreach efforts such as a National Alternative Fuel Vehicles Day Odyssey.\r\n\r\nProject objectives include: (1) providing training in advanced transportation technologies and alternative fuels to a minimum of 150 community college students;(2) exposing 150 high school students, particularly those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines (females, underrepresented minorities, disabled, low-income, and first-generation college students), to the high-tech field of automotive and diesel technology through summer academy offerings; (3) providing training leading to an industry-endorsed certification in alternative fuels technologies to 100 incumbent workers employed in transportation industries; (4) providing professional development training in advances in the automotive and diesel technician industry to 90 high school and two-year college instructors who teach in STEM areas; and (5) promoting increased public engagement and awareness of science and technology used in the transportation industry to 1,000 citizens in Kentucky and surrounding states. Outcomes of the evaluation plan will inform the broader community on issues of innovative and evolving alternative fuels technologies, ways in which competencies in current fuel technologies may be assessed, and how the use of industry-validated certifications in an academic program supports increased skill levels of current automotive and diesel technicians.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDUE 1400422 Project Outcomes:\n\nThroughout the three-year project, the OCTC project team consistently adhered closely to its intended goals, objectives, and activities.  Documentation was exceptional, as evidenced by the extensive reporting and analysis shown in the final report.  Their work is shown in the results of the project team?s surveys of the training and the resultant outcomes, as exhibited in the various appendices, provides evidence of their attention toward professional development for high school and college students (Goal 1); the incumbent workforce (Goal 2) and high school and college faculty (Goal 3).  Documentation of public awareness (Goal 4) is also documented in the appendices.\n\nAs a summary of project work, the following outcomes are provided:\n\nObjective 1  Provide advanced technology training in advanced transportation technologies and alternative fuels to a minimum of 150 college students enrolling in OCTC?s automotive and diesel technology training programs.\n\nThe activities supporting Objective 1 included updating the automotive curriculum, providing faculty training, developing an internship program for students, and establishing a CNG Engine training program.  These activities have been successfully undertaken in support of education and training for students.  Progress within the activities is well-documented and to achieve them, the project staff had commenced their work ahead of the NSF award date.  With the revised coursework and faculty professional development that was undertaken, 244 students were trained, exceeding the objective of 150 college students enrolling in the automotive and diesel technology training programs.  Unduplicated student counts show a 25% increase over the 2014 enrollment baseline.\n\nObjective 2  Expose 150 high school students, particularly those underrepresented in STEM (females, minorities, disabled, low-income, and first-generation students), to the high-tech field of automotive and diesel technology.\n\nThe activities supporting Objective 2 included outreach toward underrepresented groups include a summer academy.  Documentation shows the extensive planning that drew a total of 74 students to the summer academy events.  Considering the summer academies, the dual course enrollment, Cobra Club, and Gateway students, the project team has engaged 199 high school students and 75 middle school students for a total of 274, exceeding their objective to expose 150 students to STEM programming in Automotive and Diesel technologies.  Surveys taken at the time of the events provide further evaluative information of impact and value as reported by the student participants.  The college has plans to continue with its outreach to underrepresented populations as documented in this report.\n\nObjective 3  Provide training leading to an industry-endorsed certification in alternative fuels technologies to 100 incumbent workers employed in the automotive and diesel technology industries in Kentucky and bordering states.\n\nThe activities supporting Objective 3 included a summer training program for currently employed technicians that would lead to industry certifications in alternative fuels.  Outreach to area employers for enrollees and the inclusion of industry partners was extensive. The project team considered alternative approaches to increase the participation such as training presentations at the North American Council of Automotive Teachers conferences in Texas and Illinois. They sought top names in the industry to provide the training to enhance the quality of the training.  A total of 94 incumbent workers were trained out of the 100 worker goal. Data from post-training surveys shows that the trainees can utilize their training on the job and seek industry certification as a result. Data also shows the need to continue providing Advanced Transportation Fuels training to incumbent workers.\n\nObjective 4  Provide professional development training related to advances in the automotive and diesel technician training to 90 current and future high-school and college instructors teaching in areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nThe activities supporting Objective 4 included summer training for both college faculty and middle/high school faculty.  As with the other summer training programs, industry support was exceptional.  With training opportunities for each targeted population, the project has reached a total of 92 instructors, 52 college faculty members and 40 middle/high school faculty members.   The follow-up survey data shows that faculty will be able to utilize their training in their own classrooms and programs, a direct intent of the training.\n\nObjective 5  Promote increased public engagement and awareness of science and technology in the transportation industry to 1,000 citizens in Kentucky and surrounding states through hosting a National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Odyssey Day Event. \n\nThe activities supporting Objective 5 included extensive preparation for the Odyssey Day Event held in the spring of 2017 in conjunction with the International BBQ Festival Held in Owensboro, Kentucky.
