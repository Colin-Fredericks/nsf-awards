 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project include tunable blocks that would allow a range of spectrally- and spatially-agile devices. These may include high-gain directional antennas that can improve performance while reducing power consumption.  The fundamental MEMS varactor technology also offers solutions for critical efficiency and linearity problems as wireless devices employ more complex waveforms. Furthermore, the fundamental switching element in the varactor addresses a significant market need in the $200+ million automated test equipment (ATE) market.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop tunable power amplifiers for handset applications based on an enabling microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) varactor technology. The successful completion of the proposed effort will allow the team to address significant market needs for reducing the cost and part count of smart phones and wireless devices, and high bandwidth testing needed for automated test equipment (ATE). The methods to be employed include optimizing the MEMS varactor and integrating the varactor into a tunable power amplifier.  The proposed tunable approach addresses the high degree of redundancy in wireless designs today. In many cases, a complete front end and antenna, hardwired for a specific frequency, must be replicated for each band. The proposed approach enables tuning a single channel to cover the spectrum, drastically reducing the bill of material and footprints.",
