 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many areas, geomorphology drives species distribution and abundance. On the continental shelf, the sandy plains habitat comprises one of the largest habitats of the north-eastern Pacific yet largely remains unexplored in terms of ecology. This research will investigate how geological and biological structural changes of the seafloor impact biological habitat for the community of the lower shelf (30-200 m). This area of the coastal shelf is of great importance to the U.S. economy, and the results of this research will have value to the scientific community and to coastal managers and policy-makers. The PI will offer internships for undergraduates who will be trained for remotely operated vehicles (ROV) video analyses and surveys conducted in the coastal waters of CA. In addition, a workshop focused on ROV technology will be held at the Northwest Indian College (NWIC) in order to provide background information needed for NWIC to start using their ROV. \r\n\r\nThe host institution for this 2-year Postdoctoral Fellowship is California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB). The PI will conduct research in Monterey Bay, using the CSUMB Seafloor Lab's small vessels, ROV's, multibeam and side-scan sonar. GIS analyses, modeling, and boundary image analysis will take place at the CSUMB Marine Landscape Ecology Lab. \r\n\r\nThis study will determine the geomorphology dynamics of the heterogenous sandy plains ecosystem and how these changes drive changes in the megafaunal community. This research will test for megafauna density changes over time and for how these changes occur with changes of the structure of the sandy plains both in terms of structures caused by physical forcing and by layering from biological structures. It will also investigate how diversity changes with increased structure.",

This study focuses on sandy habitats of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS), a multiuse bay used for recreation, fishing, tourism, and development. Research from this study adds to our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales relevant to the subtidal zone (15-30 m depth). Three sites along a gradient of wave exposure in MBNMS tested whether or not the seafloor shape (geomorphology) changed over a year-long period and examined whether the distribution of inhabiting animals mirrored patterns of the various sandy habitat types. The sites included San Carlos (minimal wave exposure), Del Monte (intermediate wave exposure), and Fort Ord Beaches (maximum wave exposure). Five undergraduate researchers were trained during this project. Findings included:</p>\n<p>(1) Two major sandy habitat types were identified across all seasons and sites. These were the &ldquo;flat&rdquo; habitat (sand-wave period length &lt; 50 cm) and &ldquo;ripple scour depression&rdquo; habitat (RSD; sand-wave period length &ge; 50 cm). Some of RSD habitat changed in winter whereas other areas were resistant. The areas that changed with winter storms likely represent locations that experience currents transporting substantial volumes of sand. Currents transporting sand present significant challenges to seafloor inhabitants such as burial, and sand scour.</p>\n<p>(2) The types of animals along the gradient of wave exposure varied greatly. The site dominated by flat habitat, San Carlos, had numerous and diverse species (e.g. bat stars, market squid, infauna burrows, sea pens, sand dollars). Of the observed animals, only sand dollars had a distribution unaffected by sandy habitat type. Their distribution was similar in both the flat and sand wave habitats. Sand dollars have many features that allow them to persist in areas with large sand transport volumes including an ability to bury themselves rapidly. Other organisms present in the flat habitat can produce mobile young (larvae) that can reach RSD habitat but adults are not present. Young may either be eaten by the numerically dominant sand dollars or be ill-adapted to the harsh environment and perish during storms or stormy seasons.</p>\n<p>(3) This study provides evidence that sandy plains inhabitants do not necessarily become less dense with increased geological complexity as has been supported for most marine and terrestrial habitats. The difference in the sandy plains is that the RSD structure indicates an environment that often is turbulent with large volumes of sand transport. Complexity of structure in most habitats usually increases available niches for organisms however in the sandy plains sand wave habitat structure likely does not operate in the same manner.</p>\n<p>(4) Species-specific findings were as follows:</p>\n<p>Bat stars, squid embryos, and the infaunal burrowing guild of animals were primarily found in flat habitat within the sandy plains. These organisms contracted with increased wave action and expanded when wave action decreased. The infaunal guild of species was most dense in areas lacking surface structure complexity. In contrast to all the other species, sand dollar number and distribution within the sandy plains was independent of habitat type.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most subtidal areas of California are sandy plains. This study improves the resolution of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the seafloor structure of sandy habitats. Further, these findings support that animals respond distinctly to sandy habitat types and changes to these habitats. This study provides data to inform managers and marine use stakeholders for this large and heavily utilized area of the coast. Findings from this study may assist managers to balance mixed-use human activities in the MBNMS and at other coastal locations in California and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;O&nbsp;Navarro</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1421310/1421310_10315414_1514521368079_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1421310/1421310_10315414_1514521368079_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research site and vessels\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1421310/1421310_10315414_1514521368079_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research site and vessels\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
