 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combinatorics is a broad area of mathematics that has found applications to many other fields such as computer science, statistics, physics, and chemistry. Association schemes and coherent configurations give a unified framework for several areas of combinatorics, such as coding theory, the statistical design of experiments, and finite geometry. This work has the potential to shed light on many problems in other areas of combinatorics, including those mentioned above as well as extremal graph theory. This project will further explore the rich connections between algebra and combinatorics, and help demarcate new directions, problems, and questions, thereby stimulating further interest in the area. Broader impacts include a sharpening of mathematical tools for applications in industry, training of highly qualified graduate students for academia and industry, and undergraduate research opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe interaction between linear and abstract algebra and combinatorics has been a very fruitful area of study and continues to find applications beyond pure mathematics, in physics, computer science, and statistics. In this project, the PI and his team study association schemes and coherent configurations. The first part of the project is a study of association schemes with the so-called Q-polynomial property, a property formally dual to the notion of a distance-regular graph. While distance-regular graphs have been well studied, until the last decade little attention was paid to schemes with the Q-polynomial property that did not also arise from distance-regular graphs. Recent results suggest that these objects are of interest in and of themselves, and that the surprising structure of these schemes merits further exploration. The PI will continue the search for new examples of Q-polynomial schemes, with particular emphasis on those that arise from groups. The search will be complemented by work to characterize Q-polynomial schemes. The second part of the project concerns extending results of association schemes to the more general notion of coherent configurations, a natural generalization of association schemes. In particular, the PI will explore further applications of the recently discovered semidefinite bound in coherent configurations.",

This part of the project brings together finite fields, finite geometry, graph theory, group theory, representation theory, and computational experiments.  The project aimed to stimulate interest in these problems and the connections between these fields. \n\nIn association schemes, the focus was on schemes with the Q-polynomial property.  Our biggest result in the project in this area was the discovery and publication of an infinite family of Schurian Q-bipartite schemes with unbounded diameter.  This project supported a graduate student, who used character theory to find several other sporadic examples, and to characterize these schemes as special sets of vectors in Euclidean space.  The project also produced tables of hypothetical schemes to encourage researchers to look for more examples.  Since the publication of the tables online, some 30 new parameter sets have been ruled out.\n\nIn algebraic graph theory, the PI and his coauthors investigated the spectrum of D(k,q), a collection of graphs which should have good expansion properties.  We found the spectrum of D(4,q), verifying this case of a conjecture of Ustimenko on the spectral gap of D(k,q).  One of the coauthors was a graduate student from University of Delaware, who then investigated this further in her thesis. \n\nThe PI also utilized algebraic techniques for the construction of theta-free graphs.  This gave the best known bound for graphs without three disjoint paths of length four between two vertices. \n\nThis project also provided research projects for two undergraduates, and funded visitors to the University of Wyoming and travel for the PI to other institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Williford"
