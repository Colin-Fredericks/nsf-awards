 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this sequence of workshops is to create a community of faculty engaged in the delivery of active, hands-on courses in all the universities in Puerto Rico that offer Electrical Engineering. Faculty participants will be trained on active learning pedagogies through the use of the Mobile Hands-On Studio in the classroom.  The participants in the workshop have committed to transforming their courses with mobile hands-on learning activities. The workshops will be offered by two experienced developers of the Mobile Studio who have successfully offered similar workshops in the past. The first workshop in the Fall of 2014 will introduce hands-on classroom activities using an Analog Discovery board. By the end of the first workshop the participants should have the capacity to start transforming their Spring 2015 courses with a few mobile hands-on learning activities. The second workshop, to be offered in Spring of 2015, will provide a forum to share and discuss initial impressions after having experimented with a transformed classroom. More advanced pedagogical activities will also be presented. To increase the ease of initial implementation, Analog Discovery boards and parts kits will be distributed to each participating institution to provide a seed from which to start growing the course transformation. The boards will be loaned to students at the beginning and returned by the end of each semester. \r\n\r\nThe workshop organizers have retained a well-known engineering education researcher who will assess the success of the workshop itself in terms of the formation of a community of scholars and the diffusion of active learning pedagogies. These workshops have the potential to have an impact on society at many different levels. First, the project includes a research component that has the potential to contribute to our knowledge of how engineering education innovations diffuse. Second, the project is a state-wide level partnership between all the engineering institutions in Puerto Rico. It will directly improve the training and development of Hispanic faculty members in STEM and indirectly improve Hispanic student learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to ignite diffusion of mobile, hands-on teaching and learning in all five engineering schools in Puerto Rico.  The effort addressed engineering courses that have an electrical/electronic circuits component such as electrical networks, electronics, experimental methods, and mechanical vibrations.  This effort relied on constructivist methodologies which are based on the widely accepted principle that students construct their own versions of reality rather than simply absorbing versions presented by their teachers.  The Analog Discovery Board, essentially a circuits laboratory that fits in the palm of one?s hand, was used as the medium to explore course concepts.  Two NSF-funded faculty workshops in Puerto Rico served as the primary means for diffusing the innovation. \n\nObjective: The Diffusion Challenge\n\nDecades of engineering education research have resulted in excellent progress, innovation and understanding of the teaching and learning process; however, diffusion of these developments into the engineering classroom is a challenge that has yet to be resolved at a systemic level.\n\nAs a result, the majority of the engineering faculty in Puerto Rico and the USA still use the traditional model of teaching and learning that is based on the simple transfer of knowledge from teacher to student (\"teaching by telling\").\n\nAdvantages of a Hand-Held Device\n\n- Low cost.  $200 versus tens of thousands of dollars in electronic equipment (oscilloscopes, function generators, spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, power supplies, etc.) typical of circuits/electronics lab.\n\n- Does not require a physical space (lab room) to house all the electronic equipment&hellip; more savings.\n\n- Students may continue experimenting with the device anywhere, anytime, e.g., use is not restricted to a lab room.\n\n- Analytical solutions to homework problems may be checked experimentally, e.g., it builds confidence on the concepts learned.\n\n- Additional educational materials (videos of lectures, experiments, exercises) are available for free in the internet.\n\n- Perfectly adaptable for an inverted (flipped) classroom.\n\n- Perfectly adaptable for distance learning conditions that have a circuits laboratory component.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nI. State wide level partnership between engineering institutions in P.R.\n\n1. Universidad del Turabo (host)\n\n2. Universidad de Puerto Rico &ndash; Mayaguez\n\n3. Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Puerto Rico\n\n4. Caribbean University\n\n5. Universidad Interamericana\n\n\"Liked Best\" Comments by Faculty\n\n- Students participated in the action during the learning process, creating a more entertaining atmosphere than the usual traditional lecturing.\n\n- To see the signals, frequencies, and other parameters that are discussed in the classroom, but are best demonstrated with hands-on activities.\n\n- To see how changing input parameters from the signal generator included in the software reflected different responses at the circuit output.\n\n- May perform the different labs at home.\n\n- Ease of using the board.\n\n- Share experiences with colleagues from different universities in the island.\n\n\"Liked Least\" Comments by Faculty\n\n- Lack of time.\n\n- Some of the connections were a little loose.  The connectors could be improved.\n\n- The multimeter has limited capabilities.\n\n- Some students cannot afford a laptop.\n\n- I wish we could do a longer workshop to learn all the possibilities with the Analog Discovery Board.\n\n- Accelerated rhythm of the workshops.\n\nConclusions\n\n- Related to the Intellectual Merit, this project provided initial data that shows that this mechanism has the potential to provide one satisfactory solution to the problem of diffusing engineering education innovations in the classroom.\n\n- The diffusion mechanism addressed two barriers that have been shown to hinder adoption:  (1) lack of experience with the device, which was addressed through the faculty workshops; and (2) availability of the device (20 boards and parts kits were handed out to each of the five institutions to seed the effort).\n\n- Surveys showed that the 21 faculty in the five engineering institutions in Puerto Rico enjoyed the experience. The workshops were rated as \"Excellent\" (4.9 on a scale of 1 to 5) by the faculty participants.\n\n- Faculty began adopting the innovation in an average of 10% of their class sessions (diffusion rate) after participating in the NSF-sponsored workshops.\n\n- In terms of Broader Impacts this project was successful in initiating an island-wide effort in Puerto Rico to adopt the innovation of mobile hands-on teaching and learning (Broader Impact 2).  The workshops provided training and development that directly benefitted underrepresented Hispanic faculty members as well as their students (Broader Impacts 3 and 4).  The faculty in Puerto Rico also networked with faculty members from mainland universities (consultants in the project), including HBCU?s, that have already implemented mobile hands-on teaching and learning (Broader Impact 5).\n\n- The five institutions adapted well to the framework of the NSF grant that brought them together.  In this framework, the host institution serves as the administrator of the grant and invites the remaining four institutions to participate in the effort, as equals.   This framework considerably simplifies the administration of the grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Juan C. Morales"
