For industry, the Metropolitan Community College (MCC) BAS IT degree option is preparing skilled technicians for a variety of careers demanding strong foundations in IT concepts and skills - from critical facilities operations to advanced manufacturing, network security, energy management, and continuous commissioning. Upon completion of the BAS option IT Associates, graduates are prepared for a wide range of IT-enhanced careers such as managing interoperable facilities systems, advanced manufacturing operations, network security, general IT systems, and critical facilities such as data centers. \r\n\r\nMCC and partners are developing, field testing, and delivering learning resources for technician training through a new Building Automation Systems (BAS) option within an Information Technology Associates Degree. The primary audiences for the developed resources are two-year college students, dual credit high school BAS Academy students, and dual credit high school and college students. \r\n\r\nEight new BAS-contextualized IT courses will be developed, including lesson plans, assessments, hands-on kits, video, and other visual based elements. Access to Automate! resources will be available through the cloud and through open online venues such as YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe project is examining the effectiveness of the process of materials development; the impact of the BAS contextualized IT learning on student enrollment, performance and retention in the BAS option and the IT Associates degree track; and the value of the BAS technician training to industry.",

The <em>Automate!</em> project model was originally designed to provide accessible IT learning contextualized in real world, hands-on experience with Building Automation Systems (BAS). Not only did <em>Automate! </em>achieve the project&rsquo;s original goals to build faculty capacity for interdisciplinary, BAS contextualized IT instruction and provide Education with dozens of new, proven, hands-on, visual, and technology enabled resources for contextualized IT instruction. <em>Automate!</em> served as a key fuel source for a range of impactful educational innovations launched and now sustained by MCC&rsquo;s Workforce Innovation Division, such as the systematic use of job analysis and industry Subject Matter Experts (SME&rsquo;s) to inform curriculum development; deploying new e-tools to develop competency-based instruction and digital badging; engaging women through live, online events and providing high quality teacher education on competency-based education through an open MOOC. Within the region&rsquo;s nationally recognized STEM Ecosystem and beyond, MCC is now seen as a &ldquo;go to&rdquo; resource for interdisciplinary, contextualized learning and competency based education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The intellectual merit of the <em>Automate!</em> project is apparent in the real world, interdisciplinary IT contextualization model used for BAS and extended to Associates Degree programs for data center technicians, prototype design, and critical facilities technicians, with work beginning on the application of the model to advanced manufacturing. Contextualization of IT is a new normal for the College, with influence extending to regional and national partners. MCC also now offers a wide range of hands-on outreach workshops contextualizing IT in areas such as BAS, drones, wearable technology, aquaponics, and more. These diverse offerings attract underrepresented students and introduce students to a range of new and emerging IT enabled disciplines. The <em>Automate! </em>project model is rich and replicable, incorporating strategies for interdisciplinary collaboration among Subject Matter Experts (SME's), faculty and instructional designers; Developing A CUrriculuM (DACUM) or WorkKeys sessions with industry partners to identify priority workforce competencies; electronic tools for building competency based curriculum and assessments; and a blending of technology based instructional resources such as Internet of Things (IoT) enabled control panels, software, and smart phone augmented reality applications, with more traditional learning resources such as videos, personal white boards, and diagrams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The broader impacts of the <em>Automate! </em>model include its influence on a more collaborative Education culture, promoting interdisciplinary efforts among instructional designers, industry SME&rsquo;s, and faculty from both IT and other technical (&ldquo;trades&rdquo;) areas. This shared responsibility for the design, development and delivery of learning experiences is transformational. The <em>Automate! </em>model also shifts faculty roles from communicators of knowledge to facilitators of learning, encouraging collaborative co-teaching and coaching from industry experts and faculty. This is also transformational. The <em>Automate! </em>model has fueled challenging conversations and collaborations in the region as components of the <em>Automate!</em> model are applied across the Omaha region&rsquo;s STEM Ecosystem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The <em>Automate! </em>model&rsquo;s impact on the engagement of underrepresented populations must also be noted. Staff and faculty developed and implemented very targeted, intentional strategies to engage women, high ability learners, and low income, minority individuals. Examples include live, online Facebook events and the recruitment and development of trainers from underrepresented groups through Train-the-Trainer sessions with follow-up coaching and co-teaching. MCC has significantly expanded the diversity of its bench of trainers, including men and women, as well as individuals from income levels and ethnic and cultural backgrounds. No matter who enters MCC&rsquo;s Center for Advanced and Emerging Technology, they will be able to better see themselves and see their own future in STEM.
