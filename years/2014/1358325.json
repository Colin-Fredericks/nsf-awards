 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's continents exhibit striking properties, including relatively thick and low-density crust and a strong, thick, long-lived mantle lithosphere. The continents have played a crucial role in controlling the Earth?s tectonic style and in the evolution of life, but we don't yet understand how continents form or why continental lithosphere remains stable over billions of years. Our understanding of the structure and dynamics of continents in general and the North American continent in particular is improving, enabled in large part by data from the EarthScope program. A major recent discovery is the presence of the so-called mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD): a sharp drop in seismic velocities at a depth of roughly 100 km, internal to the continental lithosphere. This feature has been extensively documented beneath North America and other continental interiors, but its origin remains unknown. The goal of this project is to probe the characteristics of the MLD beneath the central and eastern United States using EarthScope data and thus further our understanding of how continents form and evolve through time.  \r\n\r\nAn intriguing hypothesis is that the MLD corresponds to a sharp contrast in seismic anisotropy, perhaps associated with distinctive regimes of past deformation. This project is testing this hypothesis by studying the anisotropic properties of the MLD beneath eastern and central North America. In Phase I of the project, we are using anisotropic P-to-S receiver function (RF) analysis at long-running seismic stations, including stations of the USArray Reference Network. Characterizing the exact geometry of anisotropy across the MLD will allow us to determine if the MLD does in fact correspond to a change in the strength and/or orientation of anisotropy. In Phase II of the project, we will identify specific regions for a more in-depth analysis using Transportable Array and/or Flexible Array stations, perhaps including the Mid-Continent Rift, the Appalachians, the Interior Plains, and the New Madrid Seismic Zone, with the ultimate goal of understanding whether and how the MLD varies among different tectonic settings. We are addressing four specific science questions with this work: 1) Does the MLD beneath North America correspond to a change in the strength and/or orientation of seismic anisotropy? 2) Is the character of any change in anisotropy across the MLD consistent with inferences on MLD characteristics from previous work? 3) Do we see lateral variations in the anisotropic properties of the MLD within central and eastern North America, and do any variations correspond to geologic or tectonic provinces? 4) What physical mechanism(s) can explain the anisotropic properties of the MLD as a potentially ubiquitous feature throughout cratonic North America? The insights into MLD characteristics gained from this project will have important implications for understanding the structure and dynamics of continental lithosphere, the formation and preservation of continents, and continental deformation.",

Recent results from the EarthScope program and other efforts have yielded surprising new discoveries related to the structure of continents; chief among these is the discovery of the so-called mid-lithospheric discontinuity, or MLD. The MLD is a sharp drop in seismic velocities at a depth of about 100 km, within the thick continental lithosphere. Results from EarthScope have demonstrated that the MLD is a nearly ubiquitious feature beneath North America; however, its origin remains unknown. One hypothesis is that the MLD corresponds to a change in a property known as seismic anisotropy. Seismic anisotropy refers to the directional dependence of seismic wavespeeds; that is, seismic waves often travel faster in one direction than in other directions in the Earth's mantle. This is an important property to study because seismic anisotropy arises when a mantle rock is subjected to deformation or strain, as might happen during tectonic processes such as continental collision or mountain building. In this project, we set out to test the hypothesis that the continental MLD corresponds to a sharp change in seismic anisotropy with depth. We examined seismograms recorded at seismic stations in three regions of the US: the central US, in a geologic region known as the Granite-Rhyolite Province, a region in the central and western US that encompasses the Wyoming and Superior Cratons and contains some of the oldest rocks in North America, and the eastern US, which was affected by two different mountain building events (the Grenville and Appalachian Orogenies) over the past billion years of Earth history. We applied a technique known as receiver function analysis, in which we looked for evidence of the conversion of P waves to S waves at sharp boundaries within the lithosphere. We found that within the Granite-Rhyolite province, the MLD corresponds to a clear change in anisotropy with depth, providing evidence to support the hypothesis. At stations within the Wyoming and Superior Cratons, however, the structure of the mantle lithosphere appears to be different. We found evidence for multiple MLD discontinuties in this region, along with multiple layers of seismic anisotropy with different geometries; however, we did not observe a clear correspondence between the MLD and the anisotropic boundaries. This suggests that there may be differences between how the cratonic regions and the Granite-Rhyolite Province formed or evolved through time; furthermore, this result demonstrates that the MLD cannot be simply explained only by a contrast in anisotropy. Our investigation of the mantle lithosphere beneath the eastern US revealed that the lower crust and the uppermost mantle have been extensively deformed via mountain building events, and that this deformation was likely complex, with spatially varying geometry resulting in multiple layers of seismic anisotropy. This finding may have implications for how we understand the process of mountain building on Earth today in regions such as the Himalayas and the Andes.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Maureen&nbsp;D&nbsp;Long</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
