SEAM 2014 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring five plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (John McCarthy, Stefan Richter) and harmonic analysis (Ingrid Daubechies, Michael Lacey, Camil Muscalu) in one-hour talks. Three junior speakers (Yen Do, Kate Juschenko, Constanze Liaw) will deliver thirty-minute plenary lectures. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
