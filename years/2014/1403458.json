 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portable wireless devices sold around the world number in the billions, and\r\nthey are used daily because of their ability to provide connectivity by\r\nintegrating processing power, touch screens, cameras, and motion sensors\r\nwith multiple radios, many of which can run simultaneously.  Portable\r\nwireless devices used in close proximity to the human body have transmitter\r\npower constraints that are dictated largely by regulatory limits on a form\r\nof electromagnetic exposure called ``specific absorption rate'' (SAR).\r\nSAR, measured in Watts per kilogram, is a measure of the rate of\r\nelectromagnetic energy absorption by the body.  Many portable wireless\r\ndevices sold today operate near the accepted human SAR limit.  This\r\nresearch examines how multiple transmitters on a portable wireless device\r\ncan be modeled, analyzed, and used while subject to a SAR constraint.  The\r\nwork looks at how to model the constraint, and how to realize the\r\nreliability and high data-rate advantages of multiple antennas subject to\r\nthe constraint.\r\n\r\nBecause portable devices are generally small, transmitters will be\r\nphysically close to one another and couple electromagnetically.  Hence, the\r\nresearch requires a blended effort in three distinct areas: (i)\r\nelectromagnetics and near-field exposure modeling with multiple\r\ntransmitters, (ii) wireless communication system far-field\r\ninformation-theoretic performance evaluation with a near-field SAR\r\nconstraint, (iii) the design of SAR codes for optimum performance.  Code\r\nperformance will be determined by simulation and by laboratory evaluation\r\nwith microwave equipment for near-field SAR and far-field error-rate\r\nmeasurements.",
