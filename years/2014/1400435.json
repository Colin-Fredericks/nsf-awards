 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the greatest threats to the health of North America's Great Lakes is invasion by exotic species, several of which already have had catastrophic impacts on property values, the fisheries, shipping, and tourism industries, and continue to threaten the survival of native species and wetland ecosystems.  Additional species have been placed on watchlists because of their potential to become aquatic invasives.  This project will create a network of herbaria and zoology museums from among the Great Lakes states of MN, WI, IL, IN, MI, OH, and NY to better document the occurrence of these species in space and time by imaging and providing online access to the information on the specimens of the critical organisms. Several initiatives are already in place to alert citizens to the dangers of spreading aquatic invasives among our nation's waterways, but this project will develop complementary scientific and educational tools for scientists, students, wildlife officers, teachers, and the public who have had little access to images or data derived directly from preserved specimens collected over the past three centuries. \r\n\r\nThis bi-national Thematic Collections Network of >25 institutions from eight states and Canada will digitize 1.73 million historical specimens representing 2,550 species of exotic fish, clams, snails, mussels, algae, plants, and their look-alikes documented to occur in the Great Lakes Basin. It is one of the first efforts to digitize liquid preserved specimens and to integrate cross-kingdom taxa and these methods could become national standards for cross taxon digitization. Students will be provided with hands-on experience in modern methods of specimen curation and this cross-taxon network will provide greater flexibility to existing web platforms for integration of data. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

The project established a digitization laboratory for the zoology collections in the Bell Museum at the University of Minnesota. The laboratory is used to photograph and digitize specimens from other collections providing valuable data for research in organismal biology. Digitization efforts produced over 15,500 fish specimen records of which 14,000 are georeferenced and 5700 are accompanied by images of specimens. We produced 1700 mollusk specimen records of which 311 are georeferenced. We produced over 77,500 plant specimen records of which over 36,000 are georeferenced and over 77,000 are accompanied by images of specimens. Eight undergraduates were trained in curatorial methods, georeferencing, and specimen photography. The digital databases have become a proven resource for two state agencies, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
