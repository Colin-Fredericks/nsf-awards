Underlying many of these techniques \r\nis the capability to effectively reason about system properties, often by describing the properties \r\nas constraint satisfaction problems and delegating the reasoning to a constraint solver. The most \r\ncommon constraint reasoning engines in use today are satisfiability (modulo theories) solvers (SAT \r\nand SMT). As a rapidly developing field, there is a lack of highly trained users and researchers \r\nthat will sustain and further advance the field. The SAT/SMT summer school addresses this issue by \r\nfamiliarizing young researchers with cutting-edge solver technologies and their applications.\r\n\r\nThe SAT/SMT summer school addresses this issue by familiarizing young researchers with cutting-edge solver \r\ntechnologies and their applications. The lecturers at the school are world-renown experts, and the three day \r\ngathering gives the students the opportunity to discuss the lecture topics, their own research, and the \r\nchallenges and future directions with these experts.
