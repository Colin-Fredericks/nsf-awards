Fluid transport and heat transport in porous media have led to hugely significant advances in thermal insulation, geothermal energy, electronics cooling, biotechnology, environmental protection, energy resources, and food supplies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis workshop will convene world experts in various aspects of the field of Porous Media.The experts in the field will convene in an ideal setting and discuss the state of the art and various controversial and emerging issues in the field. The results of these in depth discussions should be very helpful to both the experts as well as the researchers in the field. This workshop provides an opportunity for researchers from a number of fields and from around the world to share the latest developments related to porous media and to identify future research directions.  A review article based on this workshop will be published in one of the leading journals related to Recent Advances in Porous Media Research and its Future Implications.",
