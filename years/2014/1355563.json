 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this S-STEM project, the University of Saint Mary (USM) is supporting a total of 14 academically talented students with financial need who are majoring in biology, chemistry, or mathematics through scholarships and a coordinated set of student support structures.  The project goals of increasing the number of students enrolled in these majors at USM by 16%, increasing the retention rates in these programs by 12%, and graduating 80% of the Scholars within four years align with the workforce needs in the Kansas City area and statewide. Moreover, USM is leveraging partnerships with local industries to engage students through monthly lecture series, service learning projects, and coordinated internship opportunities. \r\n\r\nUSM is implementing a holistic set of evidence-based interventions and practices shown to increase retention and success, including as a two-semester First Year Experience program that incorporates service learning projects and develops students' study, critical thinking, and writing skills, tutoring, and peer review sessions.  Scholars also participate in bi-weekly individual advising and cohort meetings and professional development activities, which are intended to support student success.  Formal structures that provide scholars opportunities to participate in research or internships are expected to increase the retention of the scholars and provide career preparation.  These professional development and research-oriented activities are strategies for the project to achieve the goal that 75% of Scholars are employed in a STEM field or enter a STEM graduate program within one year of graduation.",
