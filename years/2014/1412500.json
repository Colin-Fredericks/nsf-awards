 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Delmar Larsen from University of California, Davis and Wouter Hoff from Oklahoma State University to study how light is captured by living organisms and converted into biological activity. All organisms use proteins to tune their response to external stimuli but some have developed specialized proteins that are sensitive to light. An example in the human body is the protein rhodopsin, located in the eye, that absorbs light for sight and initiates a cascade of signaling events that transmit the information in that light to the brain. In this research, a protein known as Photactive Yellow Protein, or PYP, is being investigated since it has become a well-studied model for many light-initiated process involving proteins. Understanding the molecular basis for the activity of proteins is important in a fundamental sense. It is also necessary for the development of new tools by which investigators might design proteins with new functions for both biomedical use and industrial use, such as hydrogen fuel generation or waste remediation. The work has a broad impact on a wide array of fields. The investigators are further broadening the impact of their work by developing new modules for their online library ChemWiki, which is currently being used by millions of students every month enrolled in over thirty courses at multiple universities. As part of the current project, the investigators are now constructing UltraWiki and PhotoWiki that will provide new platforms for disseminating information about light-induced biological processes to both students and the general public.\r\n\r\nPhotoreceptor proteins are ideal systems to study functional protein reaction activity since they are triggered with short pulses of light, and their signaling activity may be directly followed via spectroscopic techniques. This project focuses on investigating the photoinduced reaction mechanisms underlying the conversion of photons into biological activity within novel PYP photoreceptor systems via the application of transient spectroscopic approaches. Specifically, the research is examining the photochemical and conformational changes in the PYP class of photosensors. These reaction mechanisms are being characterized through a synergistic combination of molecular biology approaches to generate novel photoreceptor systems and multipulse ultrafast spectroscopic techniques capable of resolving transient electronic, vibrational, and structural dynamics on a timescale of femtoseconds to milliseconds. Interrogation of the electronic dynamics, primarily via pump-probe or pump-dump-probe approaches, is being used to resolve inhomogeneity, excited-state and ground-state evolution, and photoproduct formation kinetics. These signals are complemented with mid-IR probing and novel dynamic F\u00f6rster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments to provide structural insight into the transient changes in molecular interactions and configuration of photoreceptors systems upon light activation.",

Challenges in understanding how protein molecules work are that they are very small (less than one millionth of an inch), but consist of thousands of atoms arranged in an intricate way. In addition, key steps in protein function are very fast (about one millionth of one millionth of a second). To allow studies on such molecules at fast time scales, we used light-triggered proteins similar to those found in our eye (photoreceptors). By using short laser pulses to start the function of photoreceptor proteins, we could detect the fast processes that contribute to their function. By using spectroscopic techniques we could gain insights into the molecular events that occur during these transitions. We used a bacterial photoreceptor called photoactive yellow protein (PYP) as a powerful model system in this work. Intellectual merit: we developed novel tools to study molecular processes in photoreceptors and found both striking similarities and unexpected differences between various photoreceptors. Deriving an appropriate kinetic scheme to describe the light-initiated functional transitions in photoreceptors is notoriously difficult. We developed three approaches to help address this challenge. First, we found that combining room temperature ultrafast measurements with cryokinetics experiments at low temperature is a powerful approach to probe complex photocycle schemes. Using this tool, we resolved a 20-year old controversy in literature about the intensively studied PYP from the bacterium Halorhodospira halophila: is the kinetic scheme of early stage of the photocycle of this PYP bifurcated on not? Our results reveal that at low temperature both a red-shifted and a blue-shifted photoproduct form, but at room temperature the blue-shifted intermediate is almost not populated. Second, we compared subtle differences in PYP photocycle kinetics when using different light colors to initiate the photocycle. These data yielded experimental support for the proposal that the tri-phasic decay of the electronically excited state of PYP is caused by inhomogeneity in its structure. Third, we studied the photocycle of a variety of PYPs. While the PYP family of photoreceptor exhibits a large degree of variability, almost all studies on PYP have been performed using the PYP from H. halophila. We performed the first ultrafast measurements on the photocycle of PYPs from&nbsp; other bacteria, and found a remarkable degree of variability. In some PYPs the intensely studied early I0 intermediate is absent. This result reveals that not all molecular events that occur during the functional cycle of a protein are necessary for biological function, and has important consequences for how to interpret the rich published body of X-ray data on the I0 intermediate. In other PYPs the early blue-shifted intermediate is more highly populated. We observed similar variations in the first photocycle steps in a set of active site mutants of the PYP from H. halophila. These results reveal the fundamental variability in the early steps of the PYP photocycle, with implications for the molecule mechanism of chromophore photoisomerization, and allowed us to obtain a unified kinetic model for analyzing a wide variety of PYPs. We contributed to the development of Raman Optical Activity (ROA) spectroscopy as a powerful experimental tool to determine subtle but important structural features at the active site of chromophoric proteins that are beyond the reach of protein X-ray crystallography. We reported the first experimental demonstration that the ROA spectra measured under resonance and pre-resonance conditions are fundamentally different, showing that pre-resonance conditions are ideal for extracting structural information. Second, using isotopically labeled variants of PYP we assigned a hydrogen out-of-plane vibrational mode in the chromophore of PYP and showed that the ROA signals of this mode provide quantitative information on the structural distortion of the chromophore. These results show that ROA spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations provides a powerful new approach to examining protein active sites. We contributed to the development of an in vivo fluorescence-based system for the in vivo detection of PYP reconstitution and photoactivity. This system can enable the future development of optogenetic systems based on PYP. Finally, by comparing the molecular processes in the six well-studied types of photoreceptors (of which PYP is one), we found that these very diverse systems exhibit a common series of events:&nbsp; a picosecond photochemical event followed by microsecond proton transfer, followed by a millisecond transition involving large protein conformational changes for biological signaling. Therefore, this sequence of event is of quite general importance. We found that changes in electrostatics caused by proton transfer is one of the main driving forces triggering protein conformational changes for biological signaling.
