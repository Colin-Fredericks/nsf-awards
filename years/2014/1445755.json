 "awd_abstract_narration": "The DIMACS Project on Catalyzing and Integrating Research, Collaboration, and Learning in Computing, Mathematics, and their Applications provides a resource for a large community of researchers and educators in computer science and related mathematical and statistical areas as well as their collaborators in fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, public health, business, and the social sciences. The project enhances and encourages programs that emphasize fundamental methods and theory to advance computer science and related mathematics while also encouraging their application in areas with the potential to impact the infrastructure and resources society depends on, including healthcare, environmental sustainability, homeland security, information security, energy, and business. The project also reflects the importance of education at DIMACS and works to build and support communities that facilitate entry into and promote retention and success in computing disciplines.  This award partially supports the DIMACS Center infrastructure required to achieve project goals. The programs enabled by the infrastructure this project supports will directly reach an estimate of roughly 2000 people each year, and through them, many others.\r\n\r\nResearch programs enabled by the project are organized around special focus programs consisting of workshops, research workshop groups, tutorials, and a visitor program, on topics including Cybersecurity; Information Sharing and Dynamic Data Analysis; Algorithms and Energy; Sustainability; Theoretical Foundations and Scalability of Machine Learning; Health and Medical Informatics; Cryptography; and Analytics of Preference, Opinion, Recommendation, and Comparison. Educational programs integrate research and education across levels from precollege through postdoctoral via activities including an extensive Research Experiences for Undergraduates program; a Reconnect program run at satellite locations around the country for 2-year and 4-year college faculty highlighting recent research topics relevant to the classroom; a year-round program of workshops for middle and high school teachers; and development of classroom materials in areas including bio-mathematics, computational thinking, and planning for sustainability.  Connections with researchers in education enhance understanding of the cognitive mechanisms at play when students master computational thinking skills, allowing creation of research-informed materials that facilitate teaching and enhance learning. Several DIMACS programs use multi-layer mentoring models for providing mentoring to students while instilling in them the capacity to mentor, both enhancing their own skills and serving to build excitement for computing and computing-related careers in the next generation.",

Carrying out the ambitious set of research and education programs at DIMACS requires substantial infrastructure in terms of staff, office space, supplies, and equipment. By providing support for the center's infrastructure, this project helped to sustain DIMACS and the broad portfolio of programs that it carries out.</p>\n<p>DIMACS's signature activity is the special focus (SF), a multi-year program of coordinated activities addressing a broad topic, comprising such activities as workshops (WSs), research working groups (WGs), and research visitors. The six DIMACS SFs underway during the CIRCLE project were: 1) Cybersecurity; 2) Information Sharing and Dynamic Data Analysis; 3) Algorithms and Energy; 4) Bridging Continuous &amp; Discrete Optimization; 5) Lower Bounds in Computational Complexity; and 6) Mechanisms &amp; Algorithms to Augment Human Decision Making. Each of these areas has compelling research challenges engaging large numbers of people from various scientific communities.</p>\n<p>During the CIRCLE project, DIMACS held over 90 workshops, working groups, or other research conferences, including the Three Decades of DIMACS Conference celebrating the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of DIMACS, a workshop in Senegal on modeling Ebola, two Implementation Challenges, and four Reconnect workshops. DIMACS was also local host for the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in 2014 and 2016, the Computational Complexity Conference in 2019, the Mixed Integer Programming Workshop in 2022, and it held workshops affiliated with the Crypto conference in 2018 and 2019. We estimate that there were over 4500 participants at DIMACS workshops and related events during the CIRCLE project and many more who participated online.</p>\n<p>In addition to the special foci, DIMACS led an effort to continue activities related to \"Mathematics of Planet Earth\" (MPE) beyond 2013, launched the DATA-INSPIRE TRIPODS Institute to conduct research on using data for more intelligent interactive machines, and it plays an ever-expanding role in homeland security through the Command, Control and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analysis (CCICADA), a DHS Center of Excellence based at DIMACS. CCICADA research projects conducted at DIMACS have led to transition of tools to various government agencies, including a prototype delivered to the TSA for improving the efficiency of processing background checks for special access programs such as Precheck. Through CCICADA, DIMACS is also part of a new DHS Center, called SENTRY, led by Northeastern University. CCICADA, SENTRY, and DATA-INSPIRE jointly sponsor events with DIMACS, enable us to involve more graduate students in research projects, and expand our REU program.</p>\n<p>DIMACS has been a pioneer in integrating research and education, engaging diverse participants at all education levels, from K-12 to postdoctoral. Our SF events typically include tutorials, funding for non-local graduate students to participate in WSs and WGs, and coordination with DIMACS's outreach and educational activities. Key education programs run during CIRCLE included Reconnect workshops to introduce two- and four-year college faculty (many with high teaching loads) to new research topics, an extensive international REU program, a Young Scholars program for high school students, and projects developing instructional materials for use in diverse high school classrooms on topics in biomathematics, computational thinking, and sustainability, including a new online teacher professional development course in computational thinking. During the CIRCLE project, these programs involved roughly 80 college faculty in Reconnect, nearly 400 undergraduates in our combined REU program, 200 high school students in Young Scholars and sustainability workshops, and 170 high school teachers receiving professional development in computational thinking.</p>\n<p>Many DIMACS activities seek to broaden participation by people from groups traditionally under-represented in the computational and/or mathematical sciences. In 2016, DIMACS joined the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences (SAS) and Douglass Residential College (DRC) to launch the Douglass-SAS-DIMACS living-learning community (LLC) for first-year Rutgers women in CS. The LLC offers an immersive educational experience aimed at enhancing the recruitment and retention of women in CS. LLC participants live in a common dorm and are provided with an educational, professional development, and community-building program that supports their progress as Rutgers students and as computer science majors. Other projects with DRC and the Rutgers Computer Science Department include outreach to middle schools and high schools, research on the most effective strategies for recruiting and retaining women in CS, redesign of the two gateway courses to the Rutgers CS major, and development of new co-curricular programming.</p>\n<p>DIMACS research and education projects conducted during CIRCLE involved more than 100 graduate students in a variety of ways. We also hosted 20 postdocs and 54 visitors, who conducted research while engaging in the full range of DIMACS activities.</p>\n<p>CIRCLE helped to sustain DIMACS as a resource for a broad community, and the resulting research and education output has been considerable.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/27/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tamra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Carpenter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1445755/1445755_10335524_1672153267625_2-DIMACS-REU--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1445755/1445755_10335524_1672153267625_2-DIMACS-REU--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students participating in the 2022 DIMACS REU program.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1445755/1445755_10335524_1672153267625_2-DIMACS-REU--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students participating in the 2022 DIMACS REU program.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each year, DIMACS runs a large international Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program that emphasizes the theory and applications of algorithms and related areas of mathematics.

Our SF events typically include tutorials, funding for non-local graduate students to participate in WSs and WGs, and coordination with DIMACS's outreach and educational activities. Key education programs run during CIRCLE included Reconnect workshops to introduce two- and four-year college faculty (many with high teaching loads) to new research topics, an extensive international REU program, a Young Scholars program for high school students, and projects developing instructional materials for use in diverse high school classrooms on topics in biomathematics, computational thinking, and sustainability, including a new online teacher professional development course in computational thinking. During the CIRCLE project, these programs involved roughly 80 college faculty in Reconnect, nearly 400 undergraduates in our combined REU program, 200 high school students in Young Scholars and sustainability workshops, and 170 high school teachers receiving professional development in computational thinking.\n\nMany DIMACS activities seek to broaden participation by people from groups traditionally under-represented in the computational and/or mathematical sciences. In 2016, DIMACS joined the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences (SAS) and Douglass Residential College (DRC) to launch the Douglass-SAS-DIMACS living-learning community (LLC) for first-year Rutgers women in CS. The LLC offers an immersive educational experience aimed at enhancing the recruitment and retention of women in CS. LLC participants live in a common dorm and are provided with an educational, professional development, and community-building program that supports their progress as Rutgers students and as computer science majors. Other projects with DRC and the Rutgers Computer Science Department include outreach to middle schools and high schools, research on the most effective strategies for recruiting and retaining women in CS, redesign of the two gateway courses to the Rutgers CS major, and development of new co-curricular programming.\n\nDIMACS research and education projects conducted during CIRCLE involved more than 100 graduate students in a variety of ways. We also hosted 20 postdocs and 54 visitors, who conducted research while engaging in the full range of DIMACS activities.\n\nCIRCLE helped to sustain DIMACS as a resource for a broad community, and the resulting research and education output has been considerable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tamra J Carpenter"
