 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a project to study the history of standards and standardization in the US. Standards include uniform systems of weights, measures, timekeeping, electrical units, as well as product specifications governing everything from screw threads to paper sizes. They are quite pervasive but rarely appreciated. The project will begin by exploring the challenges faced by eighteenth and nineteenth-century proponents of standardization. It will also examine how and why the US rejected the metric system, parting ways with many other industrial nations in the nineteenth century, and how and why in the early twentieth century it embarked on a comprehensive campaign of product standardization that earlier metrological reforms made possible. The research focuses on developments prior to the postwar era. This emphasis reflects a conviction that much of the important work of standardization (the precedents, the early governing bodies, and the scientific consensus) was in place by the early decades of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nA comprehensive history of standards and standardization in America does not exist, despite the pivotal role the US played in promoting and frustrating the adoption of standards. This project promises to remedy this oversight. The PI will dig deeply into archival sources including the records of the Office of Weights and Measures and the Bureau of Standards held at the National Archives; the personal papers of key players in campaigns for and against standardization;  and the extensive writings on standardization that appeared in scientific, trade journals, as well as the popular press. Though ostensibly driven by scientific and technological needs, standards have often been proxies for larger conflicts in American society. This project will examine how standards became entangled in political and economic struggles over public policy, the power of government, and national security. The history of standards thus connects the history of science and society in new and novel ways.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nOne of the main outcomes of this project will be the publication of a book, which is already under advance publication contract with Harvard. The book will be marketed to both academic and general readers. The PI has an extensive track record of reaching a wider audience. He has written on science, technology, economics, and history in the pages of the New York Times and many other publications. He is well positioned to insure that his research will be read, not only by academics, but by the politicians, policy makers, pundits, and taxpayers who have a stake in contemporary standards and standardization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded research into the history of standards and standardization in the United States.  The project, which covers the period between the late eighteenth and middle of the twentieth centuries, examines the rise of standard weights and measures as well as industrial standards (such as screw threads) and commodity standards (those that govern goods like wheat or oil).\n\nThe research for this project required considerable work in several key sources of evidence.  The first consisted of approximately one hundred industrial trade journals as well as numerous  journals of professional associations that grappled with the challenge of standardization in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The principal investgiator, working in concert with graduate research assistants, reviewed millions of pages of journals using OCR (optical character recognition) technology to identify relevant articles on standardization.  This material has since been printed, processed, tagged and is now being incorporated in the writing of the book.\n\nLikewise, the grant underwrote visits to archives and libraries that held additional material on this subject.  The most important of these was the material held at the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland.  The PI completed a review of the vast holdings of the Bureau of Standards (as well as its predecessor agency, the Office of Weights and Measures).  The PI also reviewed relevant material in the records of the Department of Commerce and the State Department.  This material has also been printed, processed tagged and also being incorporated in the writing of the book.\n\nThis research has generated several key findings, some of which are at variance with the initial assumptions that guided the project.  The first relates to the puzzle of why the United States, unlike most other industrial nations, failed to embrace the metric system.  The research makes clear that it was the organized resistance of the nation's industrialists -- and in particular, a small group of engineers and instrument makers -- who frustrated its adoption.   Cultural chauvinism and national pride are usually held up as the reason, but the research conclusively confirms that resistance to the metric system came from some of the most sophisticated interest groups of the second industrial revolution.\n\nA second key finding is the extent to which private standards setting -- via groups like the American Engineering Standards Committee and later, the ASA -- has such deep roots in the American economy.  While these organizations would dominate standards setting in the early twentieth century, the protocols for setting standards in fact emerged far earlier in the second industrial revolution.  A number of institutions, ranging from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia to a number of almost invisible but qutie powerful trade associations, began building the consensus-based system of private standards setting as early as the 1860s and 1870s.  This helps explain why the American system of standards setting has proven so resilient; it also explains the failure of the Bureau of Standards and other governmental bodies to arrogate this functions in any significant way.\n\nFinally, the project has underscored the degree to which the history of standards in the United States is also the history of global standards, particularly in the twentieth century.  While the United States rejected the metric system, it's striking the degree to which the nation managed to impose its standards on other countries in the years after World War I.  This was part and parcel of the growing power of the United States on the international stage, and the research has revealed the extent to which standardization and a distinctly American version of globalization went hand in hand.\n\nAt the present time, the PI is writing the book based on this research.  It is under contract with Harvard University Press, with a likely publication date of 2019.  He has also spent considerable time already broadcasting some of his findings via popular media -- documentaries, radio interviews, and op-eds -- that will help convey the research to a broader audience.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen A Mihm"
