 "awd_abstract_narration": "Images are rapidly becoming the most abundant, widely available, and cheapest source of information about the natural world. Images taken by field scientists, tourists, and incidental photographers, and gathered from camera traps and autonomous vehicles provide rich data with the promise of addressing big ecological questions at high resolution and at fine-grained scale. Realizing this potential requires building a large autonomous computational system that starts from image collections and progresses all the way to answering ecological queries, such as population sizes, species distributions and interactions, and movement patterns. The system must have methods of extracting the relevant ecological information from the images and of integrating with other ecological data sources, with minimal human interaction, using state-of-the art information management, computer vision, and data analytics technologies. Such a system will advance computer systems and simultaneously enable ecology to develop as a science of connections across spatial, temporal, and biological scales, as well as provide data- and scientifically-grounded support for ecological decisions. \r\n\r\nThis work aims to build a prototype of an Image-Based Ecological Information Software System (IBEIS) that relies on a proliferation of images collected daily on a single facility from many different sources, both human and automatic, to determine both the species as well as recognition of distinct individuals. The system will allow for tracking location and movement while providing a data management system that will allow scientists to better understand, and at finer granularity, behaviors and motivations. The system will include: (1) an infrastructure and a mechanism for collecting images from tourists and other sources; (2) a (cloud) infrastructure and a data management system for storing, accessing, and manipulating the images and the derived data; (3) computer vision techniques for extracting information from the images about the identity of individual units, as well as techniques for combining that information with other relevant data to derive information about meaningful ecological units; and (4) statistical techniques and query structures to support ecological queries of the data, such as population sizes and dynamics, movement history and home ranges, and species interactions. \r\n\r\nThis work will advance computer systems including information management, computer vision, and data analytics technologies, all the while increasing public engagement in science and ecology.",

By involving a cross section of the public, the Cabinet Secretary of the Environment and Tourism accepted the numbers as the official numbers for the nation.  He and other local politicians now use them in developing policy action plans for reducing human-wildlife conflict.\n\nSchool children from a wide range of schools varying in ethnicity and income levels were often brought into the process.  They took photographs and processed them to see how technology is aiding in fundamental and applied science.  While doing so they also by using curriculum enhancements we developed to teach them about a range of methodologies for: estimating population sizes; learning about concepts of home ranges and territoriality and using the data to determine them as well as for understanding sex specific roles in mating and interacting socially.  Enabling them to see and better understand the natural world around them ideally will make them better environmental decision-makers in the future.\n\nOverall, this project has become a benchmark, demonstrating how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for environmental good.  Many presentations to computer scientists have shown them that what they do can reach farther than they thought and this has helped make them aware that while what they do can be used for 'good', they need to be on guard to help prevent AI from being used for 'bad'.  Images scraped from the web can be used to aid cartels engaged in profitable poaching schemes unless they are encrypted, an idea that they flocked to.\n\nIn terms of advances in science, our project has become a flagship demonstrating through our publications and presentations that technology can change the scale and scope of environmental science and conservation.
