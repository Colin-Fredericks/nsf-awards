 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to understand the chemical basis of the venom that very small marine snails use to paralyze much larger and faster prey.  Like scorpions and snakes, marine cone snails produce poison that is fast-acting and lethal. This project entitled \"Killer Snail: An Interactive Marine Biodiversity Learning Tool\" will educate young children on the diversity of venomous sea organisms and the important role they play in marine ecosystems. \"Killer Snail\" is a two-part product: an eBook dramatic story told from a snail's point of view, and a mobile video game allowing players to experience and explore the life of marine snails. The project targets students grades 2 to 5 and will showcase the rich biodiversity of marine organisms. The story and game will also demonstrate concepts and values of sharing, altruism, diversity, planning and other life skills. Predator-prey interaction of marine snails and bioluminescent worms will illustrate an ecosystem not unlike childhood, a time when interactions with others, some of whom are dangerous, can be barriers to development.\r\n\r\nThere are relatively few eBooks or mobile games about marine organisms. The market is, thus, ready for marine biology learning tools that are informative, fun, and visually stimulating. Engaging stories can boost learning. Similar to Aesop's fables or Grimm's fairy tales, \"Killer Snail: The eBook\" will be allegorical, conveying important life lessons, such as dealing with predators and avoiding danger. \"Killer Snail: The Game\" will highlight planning a scientific expedition, from choosing a location, to how much air one needs in one's dive tank. Both story and game will be immersive, allowing readers and players to learn about different snail species (cultural diversity), snail hunting strategies (tool usage), and cost benefit scenarios (planning). \"Killer Snail\" will be a vicarious adventure, built on interactivity, based on compelling visual imagery and age/development-appropriate concepts?all designed to peak the interest of students. The project should find a large audience by appealing to the interests of students, educators, parents, and scientists in the media formats they most enjoy.",
