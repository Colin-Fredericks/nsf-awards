The program will provide professional and leadership development, and networking opportunities for the students from the PREM attending the program. They will be able to present their research in a special poster session. In addition, they will be invited to join the MRS Mentoring Program. The program will also highlight the importance of excellence, integrity, and service in the interest of society as guiding principles in science and engineering careers.",

The students were part of an NSF-sponsored Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program that promotes materials research in minority-serving institutions (MSI) to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.\n\nThe mission of the program is to develop a diverse community of graduate students who are engaged in materials research and who will have the knowledge and skills to become leaders and innovators.  This mission is based on the assertion that diverse talent can be developed through effective mentoring, preparation, and network building through positive involvement in organizations that promote materials research such as MRS.\n\nSeventeen undergraduate students, with more than half of them being women, participated from ten MSIs across the US.
