 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical abstract\r\n\r\nThis project explores the characterization of superfluid helium at low temperatures.  By putting nanometer-sized particles into the flows, the research team observes the motion of the quantum fluid and the tornado like vortices therein. The research serves both to better understand this strange form of quantum matter, and also aids in understanding superconductors and other analogous technologically advanced materials. The project also serves to educate a new generation of scholars in condensed matter experiments, including undergraduate mentoring and graduate student training. The public appreciation of science is a critical component of ensuring our nation's strength in science and technology. In support of public appreciation of science the research team offers lab tours to a very broad range of audiences: middle school girls (annual), high school groups, undergraduate clubs, prospective undergraduate and graduate students, visiting faculty, visiting families of faculty and staff, visiting government staff, and science journalists. In addition the team offers short pedagogical videos, posted on the research group YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/user/n3umh).\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of this research is to characterize the dynamics of superfluid helium, and to apply this knowledge to quantitatively test theoretical models describing the motion of quantized vortices. When quantum fluids, including superfluid helium, are driven far from equilibrium they exhibit quantized vortices with complex and near-singular dynamics. These vortices control the dynamics of and return the system to equilibrium for both superfluids and similar systems exhibiting long-range quantum order. The research team develops world-unique experimental techniques and advanced diagnostics to probe these flows, and develops detailed quantitative characterization of the quantized vortex dynamics. Specific questions addressed are: 1) What are field equations that express the coupling of the ordered and disordered parts of the flow? 2) What do our observations, especially regarding reconnection, imply about analogous systems? 3) What are the similarities and differences between quantum and classical turbulence at small and large scales? 4) How do quantized vortices form through the lambda transition? 5) How does the triangular lattice of quantized vortices (in the near solid-body rotating state) form? 6) Which processes break time reversal invariance in quantum fluids? The observations are used to challenge theory toward a better understanding of a wide array of phenomena ranging from superconductors to trapped ion Bose-Einstein condensates.",
