Conference discussions will highlight the role the database has served in assisting with developing conjectures in number theory, algorithmic and enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, bifurcative and other nonlinear sequences, sphere packing, and many other mathematical fields as well as the tools necessary for identifying those conjectures. The conference will bring these topics to a large audience, with the express goal of making the ideas accessible to a diverse audience of researchers and students.
