 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site to be planned at Drexel University will highlight in its efforts two fundamental challenges are 1) advancing the understanding of how plasmas interact with their surroundings, either through chemical and physical processes on plasma facing surfaces or through their interaction with electromagnetic fields, and 2) advancing the understanding of and modeling the fundamental interactions of plasmas with the external mechanisms (electrical or mechanical) that drive them, thereby providing a means to engineer these systems based on the optimal conditions predicted from a complete understanding of plasma processes.\r\n\r\nThe planned site intends to provide scientific insight to a class of plasma engineering processes that are vital to established and growing markets, and support advancement of plasma engineering technologies in multiple fields. By providing an environment that focuses on fundamental understanding of these systems, combined with industry engagement through collaborative research, industry residencies, and co-operative opportunities, the planned site intends to contribute to filling a manpower void and accelerating the growth of low cost, repeatable solutions for the domestic high-tech industry. The interdisciplinary training environment for plasma research spanning 6 colleges at Drexel will support this end.\r\n",
