 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists are increasingly called upon by the public, media, and policymakers to explain their science, yet training on how to do this effectively is hard to come by. This award to the University of Delaware provides funding for a set of workshops that will help scientists become better communicators. The workshops will be held at the American Society for Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) winter conference, one of the largest conferences for marine scientists, in 2014 and 2015. The proposed workshops will provide training to scientists on a variety of communication skills, including the production of short science videos and communication to the general public. Planned workshop events for the February 2014 meeting include 1) a Video Workshop that provides advice to help scientists create videos that maintain accurate science and are interesting and compelling to a broad audience, 2) two half-day workshops on Science Communication - one for graduate students and one for all meeting participants, 3) a Science Communication workshop for about 24 participants to focus on their specific science communication issues, and 4) a Panel Discussion on public communication as part of the mid-morning plenary talks.",

Increasing numbers of scientists are making short videos for their web pages and open houses to explain their science to lay audiences. Recognizing the lack of knowledge on how to make interesting videos, Randy Olson, as a PhD Marine Biologist, gave up a tenured faculty position and became an independent filmmaker in Hollywood. At the 2010 OSM, we organized a video analysis workshop, solicited videos from scientists and then discussed and critiqued them at the meeting. At the 2011, 2012, and 2013, we organized a similar video analysis workshops. At the 2012 and 2013 meetings, we used a panel approach with Dorie Barton (actress and story line consultant for movie screenwriters) and Brian Palermo (actor and instructor at the Groundlings Improv Theater in Los Angeles) along with Olson. &nbsp;We discontinued the video workshops for the next few meetings and are starting them again in 2017.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MORE THAN JUST VIDEOS. We felt that scientists needed better communication skills in all aspects of their work in outreach to the public, policy makers, the press, and presenting at scientific conferences. With this in mind, we added two additional Hollywood events for the 2013 meeting. The first was an all day workshop titled &ldquo;Scintillation &ndash; a workshop to make your science communication scintillate through &ldquo;critical storytelling&rdquo;. The participants were asked to bring a brief story to the workshop. They initially presented their stories, they then worked on improv exercises and studied storyline development; at the end of the workshop their reworked stories were much improved as 40-60 second short discourses that explained science in simple, compelling, and interesting form. The other workshop was titled &ldquo;Snap it up &ndash; advice from Hollywood for short presentations&rdquo;. It was aimed at the presentations given by scientists to each other at these meetings, to make them more interdisciplinary. We selected several presentations being given on the first day of the meeting and had the Hollywood team attend the talks. At the workshop, the team gave critiques of the presentations and discussed with the presenters and the audience how to make the presentations more interesting to a broad audience of their peers. &nbsp;We also held this Sunday workshop (now retitled, &ldquo;Connection&rdquo;) and the Snap-it Up workshops at the 2014, 2015, and 2016 meetings.
