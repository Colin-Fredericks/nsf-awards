 "awd_abstract_narration": "1351558 (Miller).  Sustainable management of groundwater requires the judicious allocation of resources to meet societal, ecological, and environmental needs, both now and over the long-term. Historically, groundwater sustainability has been narrowly defined in terms of protecting aquifers from contamination and limiting pumping to match groundwater use with recharge. However, a broader paradigm is necessary, one which considers the diverse requirements of multiple, sometimes conflicting consumers of groundwater, including groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs), and one which fosters aquifer resilience to changes in the hydroclimate. In order to develop this paradigm, the PI has the long-term career goals of promoting the sustainable management of groundwater resources by advancing the scientific understanding of groundwater dependent ecosystems and by providing engineering and water resources professionals with tools to incorporate sustainability into their decision making processes. This CAREER grant aims to further these goals through three project specific research objectives: 1) integrate the representation of GDEs into land-surface and groundwater availability models; 2) test and create improved metrics for quantifying sustainability and resilience of groundwater resources; and 3) explore management strategies for optimizing groundwater withdrawals to reduce impacts on GDEs and prevent water system failures. These will be complemented by three project specific educational objectives: 1) teach sustainable engineering practices across the civil engineering curriculum; 2) improve the application of sustainability principles by groundwater professionals; and 3) enhance the diversity of the engineering workforce by using sustainability concepts as a tool to engage those from underrepresented groups. This project addresses critical gaps that prevent a holistic assessment of the sustainability of groundwater resources and their resilience to climate and anthropogenic stressors. It targets to improve the modeling of GDEs, as well as create new metrics for assessing the impact of groundwater management decisions on these sensitive ecosystems. Using these metrics, it will explore new optimization methods to create more sustainable and resilient groundwater systems. The project tests the hypothesis that teaching and researching sustainability is beneficial to the recruitment, retention and engagement of students from under-represented groups in engineering, particularly women. The PI's CAREER plan integrates research and education within the existing framework for the professional development of civil engineers, who are expected to be able to define, explain, apply, and analyze sustainability principles, in relation to engineering design, before they are licensed to practice in the field. At the student level, the project will develop course modules for teaching sustainability throughout the civil engineering curriculum; materials will be drawn from the PI?s research on both groundwater modeling and sustainability metrics. Students will participate in the research through course projects, and student volunteers will lead the publication of these results. These activities will directly impact the education of up to 1900 undergraduates and 50 graduate students at Texas A&M University, as well as that of the one Ph.D. student and five undergraduates funded by the project. Course materials will be disseminated to a wider audience through the PI's ongoing outreach activities and through existing NSF sponsored websites, potentially improving pedagogic approaches for teaching sustainability in civil engineering at universities across the country. At the professional level, the project will create two new continuing-education opportunities for groundwater managers, consultants, and policy makers which will aid in broadly disseminating research to enhance understanding and benefits to society. A workshop on the relationship between desired future conditions and the sustainability and resilience of an aquifer will invite stakeholders to guide this research project at its start and will produce a report on research and education needs for groundwater management. A short-course on groundwater sustainability metrics and modeling will teach professionals about decision making tools available for sustainable groundwater allocation, including those developed by this project.",

The steady decline of water tables in over-exploited aquifers and its impacts on society are well documented. In contrast, impacts on natural systems, especially plant and animal communities that rely on this water, are not nearly as well understood. They are influenced by complex interactions across the water cycle. Being able to predict the behavior of these highly connected systems is critical for sustainably managing water resources under changing climate conditions. The dual aims of this project were to promote the sustainable management of groundwater resources by a) advancing the scientific understanding of groundwater dependent ecosystems and b) providing engineering and water resources professionals with tools to incorporate sustainability into their decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> In this study, we created a new method of describing plant water uptake in computer models and added it to several that are commonly used by the scientific and groundwater management communities. Not only was the method more accurate when tested against field data, it also allowed us to demonstrate how plants could move water both upwards toward the surface and downwards to the groundwater, depending on their needs. After completing these changes, we created two new model instances, which represent important and different aquifers in central Texas: 1) The Edwards Aquifer model demonstrates how deep-rooted plants affect water availability and stream flows in a highly populated area. 2) The Brazos River Alluvium Aquifer model shows why it is important for management models to connect groundwater to other aspects of the water cycle, namely infiltration and stream flow. Both models unexpectedly highlighted the importance of groundwater recharge. We found that large uncertainties in this small rate eclipsed many of the other considerations for management, suggesting that properly accounting for the water balance at the land surface is critical. To complement our modeling efforts, we applied a common sustainability rating system to the analysis of groundwater infrastructure, determining that the exiting tools were adequate but imperfect metrics for assessing them.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> As part of the project, we created and tested sustainability education modules for four courses in civil and environmental engineering and provided support for the incorporation of sustainability materials in others. The new insights gained from our surveys on student attitudes toward sustainability will inform future education efforts at Texas A&amp;M and on other campuses. Our workshops and seminars on groundwater sustainability reached over 275 practicing water management professionals. Eight graduate students and eight undergraduate students were supported by the project; of these, 12 were members of groups underrepresented in engineering. To date, the project has produced five theses, numerous posters and presentations at professional conferences, one book chapter, and the peer-reviewed articles listed above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gretchen&nbsp;R&nbsp;Miller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1351558/1351558_10294644_1632856132570_tbl_groundwater--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1351558/1351558_10294644_1632856132570_tbl_groundwater--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Educational Materials, Example 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1351558/1351558_10294644_1632856132570_tbl_groundwater--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Educational Materials, Example 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example educational materials designed for outreach to the public and the water management community.
