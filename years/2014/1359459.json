 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectives of the Medical Informatics (MedIX) REU Site program are to engage undergraduate students in challenging research projects, encourage them to pursue graduate education and to expose students to interdisciplinary research, especially at the border of information technology and medicine. The MedIX REU Site runs for three summers, with eight student participants doing research ten weeks each summer under the supervision of three mentors dedicated to undergraduate research. The REU Site is hosted by two interdisciplinary laboratories: the Medical Informatics Laboratory at DePaul University and the Imaging Research Institute at the University of Chicago.  The research environment offers the students the opportunity to interact with computer scientists, medical physicists, and medical doctors.  \r\n\r\nAll of the projects are inspired by state-of-the-art research questions in imaging informatics. Students work as part of faculty-undergraduate teams on new problems ranging from traditional image processing (e.g., computer-aided diagnosis, breast density assessment, cancer detection) to structured reporting and natural language processing of radiology reports, to workflow and process re-engineering to the application of data mining and ontology-based means for image annotation and markup (e.g., lung nodule detection and interpretation). Ultimately, each project has the long-term potential to increase the quality of healthcare available to people everywhere. More information on the program can be found at the MedIX REU Site web site (http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDemographics and Student Prior Experience \n\nDemographics: The NSF REU Program in Medical Informatics 2014-2016 provided research experiences to 24 students; 16 students (66%) were women, 2 were African American or Hispanic (8%), 3 were first-generation college students (13%), and 20 participants (83%) were from outside the hosting institutions.  These percentages are consistent across all three years of the program, although our participation by women has continued to improve.  We also hosted two students from Mexico on grants from the Mexican government.  Furthermore, given the interdisciplinary nature of the program, students? background covered a large number of majors: computer science, psychology, statistics, mathematics, physics, computer engineering, electronic engineering, information technology, biochemistry, biomedical engineering and cognitive science.  Most recently, we have noticed an increase in the number of computer science majors; 19 of our 24 students (79%) were CS majors (many of our high-achieving students had double majors; such double majors are counted in the total).\n\nStudent Prior Experience: The MedIX program was the first significant research experience for many of the students.  For the first time, over half reported that they had (other than for course work) previously given a visual (poster) research presentation (58%), although only (42%) had given an oral research presentation. None of the students had authored or co-authored a publication in an academic journal (0%).  When asked how much time they spent in a research environment, none (0%) reported experience in an industrial research environment, and 42% reported academic research experience.  While students in this funding period are reporting increased rates of posters and talks, they are coming to the program less published and less involved in research overall.  This fits very well with one of the goals of the MedIX program: to provide students with limited research resources the opportunity to publish and present their work at a conference.\n\nProgram Effects on Student Attitudes and Self-efficacy\n\nProgram Effects on Student Attitudes and Self-efficacy: An 8-item self-efficacy and attitudes scale was administered at both the beginning and end of the program in order to evaluate the effects of REU participation on student attitudes and beliefs.  Two items measured self-efficacy beliefs and six measured positive attitudes about research.  Students rated their degree of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with ratings of 4 or greater indicating agreement.  The student responses indicate that in the last three years, the MedIX REU greatly increased students' confidence in their abilities to engage in scientific research; the MedIX program is also having a strong, positive effect on students? decision to attend graduate school.  As in previous years, the MedIX program continues to attract students interested in medical degrees; many of them continue to pursue research as professionals.\n\nHighlights on Students? Accomplishments\n\nPublications: The REU students? work from 2014 to 2016 resulted in 4 journal papers and 13 conference papers; 96% of the student participants were co-authors of these papers and all of them presented their work at the conferences where their work has been published.  All REU-related publications can be found at the MedIX website.\n\nContribution within Medical Informatics Discipline: MedIX students have made a number of contributions within the field of medical informatics and these contributions can be seen from looking at the list of publications.  A focus, then, on the summer of 2015 would include contributions such as deformable registration in serial lung CT images, and the classification of lung nodules in the LIDC using many fewer labels that in previous classification systems.\n\nContributions to Other Disciplines: The MedIX program was designed to be an interdisciplinary program, and students have made a number of medical contributions.  In 2015, students used mathematical compression techniques to measure the difference in phylogenetic trees generated from different algorithms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniela Raicu"
