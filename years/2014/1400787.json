The Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future.   This fellowship to Ross Cunning supports research and training to integrate quantitative genetic and modeling approaches to understand climate change impacts on coral symbiosis.  The host institutions for the Fellowship are the University of Hawaii and the University of California, Santa Barbara; the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Ruth Gates and Roger Nisbet.  Training goals include genomics, bioinformatics, and dynamic energy budget theory and modeling techniques to examine the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis.  Educational outreach to students in Hawaii includes students from groups under-represented in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe research seeks to understand the dynamic interactions between reef-building corals and their symbiotic algae in an era of global environmental change. The future persistence of coral reef ecosystems depends on the integrity of this symbiosis; stress disrupts the symbiosis, but the processes underlying its regulation and stability, even in the absence of environmental stress, are poorly understood.   The approach is to extract molecular information from corals and sea anemones with zooxanthellae raised under various conditions, then model the results and test the outcomes of the models, resulting in a mechanistic understanding of the maintenance and breakdown of symbiosis and integrate \"omics\"-based molecular data within a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model for coral symbiosis. The specific aims are to 1) develop a comprehensive DEB framework to model coral-algal symbiotic interactions, 2) assess environmental influences on symbiosis structure and function with quantitative metagenomic and transcriptomic datasets, and 3) integrate these data within the DEB modeling framework to test diverse hypotheses regarding the regulation and control of symbiosis and predict responses to complex changes in the environment.",

This model was developed using open source R code (which is familiar to many biologists) incorporating mechanistic representations of photo-oxidative stress and coral bleaching in response to environmental stress. The model predicts coral growth and symbiosis dynamics (i.e., bleaching and recovery) as an integrated response to multiple, dynamic environmental factors, and reveals coral bleaching as an alternate stable state of the symbiotic system (Cunning et al. 2017b).

PI Cunning developed new bioinformatic pipelines to describe the structure of these communities using high-throughput sequencing data (github.com/jrcunning/SymITS2) &ndash; a critical step to understanding their ecological dynamics. Coral bleaching events in Hawaii in 2014 and 2015 also created the opportunity to study variation in stress susceptibility among coral individuals and temporal dynamics in their symbiont communities, which can be specifically compared with model predictions as an empirical test of this tool.
