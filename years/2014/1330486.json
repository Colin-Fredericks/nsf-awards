Through studies and workshops, the Board's 18 pro bono experts help to ensure that the nation's decision making is based on strong mathematical modeling and analysis and reliable computational simulations. Recent BMSA reports documented best practices for verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification of complex simulations; the health of the mathematical sciences enterprise and steps needed to improve the field's vitality; and research priorities for improving capabilities for analyzing big data. \r\n\r\nThe current grant will enable the Board to oversee new studies on (1) analytical tools for the next-generation electric grid and (2) improvements to the pricing of risk within the National Flood Insurance Program. It will also support the Board's development of new activities of value to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, and National Institutes of Health. The grant will also allow the Board to help stimulate community action in response to challenges identified in its 2013 report on \"The Mathematical Sciences in 2025.\"",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for the General Public \n \nFor Award #1330486\n\"PARTIAL SUPPORT OF THE BOARD ON MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES\nAND THEIR APPLICATIONS\"\n\nPeriod of Performance:  02/15/2014 - 01/31/2017\n\nP.I.  Scott T. Weidman\n\nThe Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications (BMSA) within the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is a broad interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences.  The Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, computational science, information analysis, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance.  In doing so, the Board strengthens the policymaking process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline.\n\n \n\nThe Board consists of 18 pro bono experts from a broad range of quantitative fields with experience in academia, industry, and national laboratories.  The BMSA helps the federal government and policy community make best use of the mathematical sciences by involving leading mathematical scientists in workshops and studies focused on the technical challenges of federal decision-makers.  Some of these decision-makers are found in agencies that fund mathematical sciences research, but many do not have strong existing ties to the mathematical sciences community.  Its position as part of the National Academies (which includes the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and National Academy of Medicine) enables the BMSA also to build links between the mathematical sciences and other fields of science, engineering, and medicine.\n\n \n\nThe subject grant provides partial support for semi-annual meetings of the Board, including preparations for and follow-through from those meetings.  Board meetings provide opportunities to build the interfaces notes above and to help design and oversee BMSA activities, which are generally funded separately.  Topics covered during the grant period include data science education, smart cities, inference for big data, the next-generation electric grid, strengthening the National Flood Insurance Program, linkages between life expectancy and income in the United States, modeling capabilities for assessing threats to national security, data science methods for Department of Defense personnel and readiness missions, methods for analyzing images and videos for fisheries stock assessment, anomaly detection, assessing variables in eyewitness identifications, reproducibility in science, and numerous other topics relating to big data.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott T Weidman"
