 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-1403456\r\nWalker\r\n\r\n\r\nModern microelectronic devices extensively used in telecommunications, computing, and energy conversion applications rely on ever shrinking feature sizes where materials are manipulated at atomic scale and exhibit new and extreme properties.  As characteristic lengths decrease, interfaces between materials begin to dominate the performance of the materials, and hence the devices.  Yet, our understanding of how charge and heat transmit through these interfaces is still limited.  To create better materials and devices, we must study the effects of interfaces on carrier transport that are responsible for the extreme properties these highly scaled structures exhibit.  This project will measure the flow of energy through several carefully controlled interfaces and predict the performance of those interfaces using atomistic-scale modeling.  The combined theoretical and experimental approach will produce new design rules for creating and optimizing future devices.  Consequently, the results of this project have far reaching implications and could lead to a reduced drain on our energy resources, faster computers, and increased communication bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe lack of thorough understanding of interfacial phonon transport is a current bottleneck in microelectronic cooling and thermal design of composite materials. This project aims at understanding the interaction dynamics of van der Waals interfaces between individual nanostructures, which determines the phonon transmission and scattering mechanisms at these interfaces.  The interaction dynamics at the van der Waals interface will alter the phonon transmission coefficient, leading to different thermal conductivities between single and double ribbons.  Therefore, our approach is to measure systematically the intrinsic thermal conductivity of individual silicon nanoribbons, silicon double nanoribbons, and silicon and boron double ribbons, and to perform corresponding atomic scale modeling.  Comparison of results from different samples will provide new insights into how different factors, such as adhesion energy, acoustic impendence mismatch, and amorphous layers affect phonon transmission through van der Waals interfaces, which will provide new insights into manipulating thermal transport through these interfaces.  Since van der Waals interfaces are one of the most common interfaces between individual nanostructures or nanostructures and substrates/host materials, the obtained fundamental understanding will shed light on how to better manage the heat dissipation in microelectronic devices and tune the thermal properties of nanocomposites.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe continued reduction in size of microelectronics means the capabilities of devices such as smart phones and the computers that power the movement and computation of data are ever increasing.   Making efficient and reliable devices, though, depends on the performance of materials at these small scales.  The behavior of the materials structures that make up these devices are dominated by physics that are not always completely understood.  Normally van der Waals interactions at material boundaries are unimportant.  But when sizes are so small, the materials properties are governed less by the constituent materials and more by the interfaces between them.  The work conducted explored the thermal transport between nanoribbons---sructures that are only 20 nanometers in width---to help scientists learn how heat moves in extremenly small materials structures.  This is important because microelectronic devices at current size scales are thermally limited.  That means that, in general, we have the technology to make devices smaller (and faster), but we can't because these devices will destroy themselves with self-heating when made too small.\n\nOne of the primary findings of the project was that when structures reach sizes around 20 nanometers, the thermal transport is governed by atomic softening at the boundary, which is an effect that arises when atoms are exposed to different environments at a materials surface or interface.  Softerning (actually some materials experience hardening) causes energy to move slower through the structures, which results in a buildup of excess heat. \n\nAnother finding involved the understanding of transport through amorphous materials, which are often utlized to provide electrical isolation.  Yet these materials are usually lousy at transporting thermal energy as well, which, again, causes a heating bottleneck.  Based on our results, though, we can better characterize the extent of the thermal perofrmance, which will help designers work around the material limitations.\n\nA third finding (and the last to be discussed here) was not about the transport per se, but a new way to use computers to estimate the transport.  The models used to predict transport in small scales are ironically often more complicated than large systems.  The reason is that atomic scale fluctuations become important whereas in large scale materials, these fluctuations average out.  Our efforts, though, have lead to a customization of atomic approximations that can dramatically speed up calcualtions.  In particular, we developed new pseudopotentials for DFT calculations that result in transport calculations that are an order of magntiude faster.  So not only did we uncover the vital fundamental nature of materials, but we developed a new way to compute the performance of structures that is faster. \n\nUsing this knowledge, designers can select materials or design intefaces that promote, not inhibit, heat transfer thereby creating devices that are more reliable and can be operated faster.  Moreover, they can do the analysis much faster than conceivable before reducing the time to market.\n\nThe project involved the training of three PhD students, two of whom have graduated and gone on to positions that involve materials research, where they design, analyze, measure, and construct nanostructured materials for specific applications including energy production, national defense, and healthcare.  The third is close to graduation, but plans to pursue a research position at a national lab.  In addition, the project employed two undergradaute researchers who are now pursuing graduate degrees in engineering.  Further broadening the impact of the work, the participants were involved in an annual two week summer course designed for talented eight and ninth graders through the Vanderbilt Program for Talented Youth.  The goal of this effort was to spark an interest in the next generation of scientists and engineers in the possibilities of nanoscience and nanotechnology. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Walker"
