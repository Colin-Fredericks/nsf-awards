 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description \r\n\r\nWith the rise in global population and rapid growth of urban and coastal areas worldwide, providing clean water is a major challenge particularly when basic sanitation needs are not met. Water scarcity, poor sanitation, and economic disparity tend to characterize many densely populated urban areas throughout the world. There is no doubt that new solutions are needed to improve the availability of clean water and basic sanitation for underserved populations. Moreover, solutions that also recover energy and resources for net-zero impact have the potential to lessen the burden for communities dealing with water scarcity, and energy and food security issues.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there is a need to improve fundamental knowledge on decentralized wastewater systems technologies (DEWATS) that lead to net-zero energy and resource use. IRES students from San Diego State University and California State Poly-technical University in Pomona will contribute to fundamental research in collaboration with the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) on biological and physico-chemical processes in DEWATS and resource and energy recovery from wastewater. Students will use traditional methods (microbiological techniques, water chemistry and solids analyses) and novel applications of fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the performance of an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) with water reuse for agricultural applications. This IRES project aims to be a transformative scientific and cultural experience for US students that will advance fundamental knowledge of ABR and other DEWATS treatment processes implemented at the full-scale in South African communities.\r\n\r\nBroader Description\r\n\r\nThis project is a unique opportunity for environmental engineering undergraduate and graduate students to visit the UKZN in Durban, South Africa, where they will conduct fundamental research on resource and energy recovery from wastewater, new perspectives on wastewater treatment, and sustainable sanitation. Over the course of the three year project, fifteen US students will be supported to work on novel research at the nexus of water, energy, and food with a focus on decentralized wastewater treatment systems in growing urban centers. Students will be mentored by active research faculty at the Pollution Research Group at UKZN and obtain an enriching international experience on topics highly relevant for environmental scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis research experience will equip upper-level undergraduates with research skills needed to transition to graduate school and strengthen the research and mentoring skills of graduate student participants. The US student cohorts will be recruited from groups, including those underrepresented in environmental science and engineering, at San Diego State University and California State Poly-technical University in Pomona. A pre-departure orientation program is designed to promote team building, cultural sensitivity, and adequate preparation for students to conduct collaborative research internationally. As part of the evaluation of this project and for knowledge transfer from cohort-to-cohort, exit surveys will be conducted and videos of the research and student perceptions will be disseminated to subsequent cohorts. Participants will present their research at UKZN and at local and regional research symposia, professional society meetings, or conferences. IRES participants will conduct outreach for K-12 audiences via after-school programs.",

South Africa has experienced rapid population growth, especially in Durban and other urban areas. The rapid expansion of informal settlements in the region and pressing issues related to water scarcity and provision of sanitation, infrastructure, and other services have given rise to innovative approaches, such as promoting low-cost, low-energy, decentralized wastewater treatment systems for water reuse. The UKZN Pollution Research Group operates and manages a wastewater treatment facility for agricultural water reuse using anaerobic baffled reactor and constructed wetland technologies as well as a test bed facility for a wide range of new and experimental on-site sanitation systems, some funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Reinvent the Toilet Challenge. The prominence of UKZN as a pioneer in decentralized and on-site sanitation systems provided a unique opportunity for IRES scholars to conduct novel research on these systems. Working in collaboration with UKZN faculty, staff, and students, IRES scholars studied fluorescence-based sensors to monitor treatment plant performance, use of duckweed, a floating plant, to recover nutrients from wastewater effluent, application of duckweed as a green fertilizer, hydraulics and operations of the decentralized facility, degradation of trace organic chemicals by sunlight, and recovery of methane from sludge as an energy source. The Sustainable Sanitation Project opened new research avenues, including a new collaboration between UKZN and SDSU faculty that evaluates the persistence of chemicals of emerging concern in centralized, conventional wastewater treatment plants and small, decentralized wastewater treatment facilities. In 2017, the duckweed research brought in new students and colleagues from Durban University of Technology and resulted in the publication of a peer-reviewed journal article on the research, led by a SDSU undergraduate student.</p>\n<p>Results of the Sustainable Sanitation Project were widely disseminated among the scientific community and industry. A second student-led peer-reviewed journal article was published on the use of in-situ fluorescence sensors to monitor of organic waste removal, a peer-reviewed conference proceeding on the performance aspects of the decentralized wastewater treatment plant was published, and multiple conference posters and presentations were delivered by IRES scholars at the Southern California Conferences on Undergraduate Research, American Chemical Society Annual Meeting, WateReuse Conference, American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Conferences, and Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Educational Conference. Each cohort produced a short video of their international research experience, posted on the project website (sustainablesanitation.weebly.com), and conducted outreach activities to area K-8 classrooms, SDSU and CPP undergraduate students in the Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) Program, and Girl Scout tour groups. Bench-scale models of anaerobic baffled reactor systems were used to present the decentralized wastewater treatment systems concept to public and private industry, as a potential sustainable sanitation solution for low-income rural areas in California. Senior design students using the model won first place in the 2017 CPP College of Engineering wide competition and third place in the 2018 ASCE Environmental and Water Resources Institute WSP senior design National Competition.</p>\n<p>External evaluation of the Sustainable Sanitation Program revealed that the international research collaborations increased cultural competencies of the engineering students, many of whom had not previously traveled outside of the US. Research training, professional development, and the international experience itself increased IRES scholars? identity as an engineer, self-efficacy, research skills, and research confidence. Three of the undergraduate IRES scholars went on to pursue their MS degrees, and a fourth student is currently applying to graduate programs. Formative and summative evaluation results were described in two peer-reviewed conference proceedings and one journal article on the impacts of the international research on groups traditionally under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
