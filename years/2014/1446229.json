 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trustworthy operation of next-generation complex power grid critical infrastructures requires mathematical and practical verification solutions to guarantee the correct infrastructural functionalities. This project develops the foundations of theoretical modeling, synthesis and real-world deployment of a formal and scalable controller code verifier for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in cyber-physical settings.   PLCs are widely used for control automation in industrial control systems.  A PLC is typically connected to an engineering workstation where engineers develop the control logic to process the input values from sensors and issue control commands to actuators. The project focuses on protecting infrastructures against malicious control injection attacks on PLCs, such as Stuxnet, that inject malicious code on the device to drive the underlying physical platform to an unsafe state.   The broader impact of this proposal is highly significant.  It offers potential for real-time security for critical infrastructure systems covering sectors such as energy and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe project's intellectual merit is in providing a mathematical and practical verification framework for cyber-physical systems through integration of offline formal methods, online monitoring solutions, and power systems analysis.  Offline formal methods do not scale for large-scale platforms due to their exhaustive safety analysis of all possible system states, while online monitoring often reports findings too late for preventative action. This project takes a hybrid approach that dynamically predicts the possible next security incidents and reports to operators before an unsafe state is encountered, allowing time for response. The broader impact of this project is in providing practical mathematical analysis capabilities for general cyber-physical safety-critical infrastructure with potential direct impact on our national security. The research outcomes are integrated into education modules for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 classrooms.",

These illicit control actions are any actions that can drive the system into a state with reliability violations; examples include violations of voltage magnitude, angle separation, line flow MW and MVA, and stability constraints.  \n\nTo achieve this, the research in this project focused on scalable modeling and formal analysis of the power grid.  The project?s intellectual merit was in providing a mathematical and practical verification framework for cyber-physical systems through integration of offline formal methods, online monitoring solutions, and power systems analysis.  This project takes a hybrid approach that uses symbolic execution of controller code to dynamically predict the possible next security incidents and report to operators before an unsafe state is encountered, allowing time for response; then computing and verifying the new response.  The team developed and used power systems analysis techniques that allow power system impact to be analyzed along with the controller code using symbolic execution.   These models are to be used to assess the potential impact of adversarial PLC execution control flow on the physical components and their safety requirements.   \n\nThe broader impact is that these practically-focused device-centric and physics-aware solutions for verification can enable power systems to prevent any illicit control action from causing security and reliability violations in the power grid.
