 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific data increasingly takes the form of networks, but the ability to collect and process graph data has out-paced our ability to analyze them statistically. Most of the critical scientific questions about networks revolve around comparisons between networks (e.g., over time or across experimental conditions). Such problems arise in fields as different as neuroscience, epidemiology, economics, climatology and criminology. Currently, network analysts compare only basic descriptive statistics (e.g., the average distance between nodes in the graph), ignoring issues of global structure and statistical validity. We will develop a rigorous statistical theory of network comparisons. Our approach rests on recent develops in network theory which show how large graphs approximate continuous geometric objects, so that tools for geometric comparisons can be applied to networks. \r\n\r\nOur project will develop rigorous statistical methods and efficient algorithms for network comparisons. The first step is the flexible non-parametric estimation of continuous network models, where we will pursue three complementary strategies, using regression smoothing, density estimation in non-Euclidean latent spaces, and ensembles of trees. Having represented networks as continuous stochastic processes, we will develop statistical theory and methods for detecting and characterizing differences between such processes. Interdisciplinary proof-of-concept applications, including those in public health (through online social networks), finance (through financial networks), neuroscience (through brain connectivity networks), genetics (through gene regulatory networks), and proteinomics (through protein interaction networks), will demonstrate the power of the geometric approach in comparing large and disparate sample data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNetworks are increasingly important to all areas of science and technology,both as data (what scientists observe) and as models (how scientists organizetheir data).  Most of the interesting scientific questions about networks arefundamentally comparative --- they are about how networks differ over space, ortime, or conditions, e.g., whether the brains of those with various mentalillnesses differ in patterns of connection from those of healthy people (and,if so, how).  This makes detecting and characterizing differences betweennetworks a strategic problem for data analysis.  Before our work, approaches tothis problem were however largely ad hoc or qualitative, without any sort ofprincipled statistical basis.  Our goal was to develop statistical tools fordetecting network differences, drawing on recent advances in network modeling.\nThe research we conducted achieved this central goal: we have developed, andpublished, the first consistent statistical tests for differences betweennetworks.  Some of our tests are quite general, \"omnibus\" tests which can, inprinciple, detect any sort of difference between the processes leading to twoobserved networks (at least with enough information).  Others are more focusedon particular types of differences (e.g., do two networks differ _only_ in thedensity of ties, but otherwise have the same organization?), which increasestheir power to detect differences with limited information, at the cost ofignoring other kinds of difference.  Moreover, when our tests do finddifferences, they provide informative, interpretable descriptions of _how_ twonetwork-generating processes differ.  This all allows comparative scientificquestions about networks to be answered in statistically principled ways, withquantifiable measures of uncertainty.\nTo the prepare the ground for this work on testing for differences betweennetworks, we also had to tackle some quite basic issues in statistical networkmodeling: when popular models of networks are estimated from data, do theestimates actually converge on the truth? what techniques will let us quantifythe uncertainty in inferences drawn from networks? how can we model sparsenetworks in a self-consistent way?  While our work on these topics was drivenby what was needed to do network comparisons, our results will be of broadindependent interest to scientists analyzing network data, even when they arenot dealing with explicitly comparative problems.\nOur theoretical results, and their implementation in open-source code, providea new tool-kit for dealing with fundamental questions of network data analysis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cosma R Shalizi"
