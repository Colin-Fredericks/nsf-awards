Leveraging existing partnerships with employers of STEM graduates, the Baltimore County Public Schools and four-year institutions, the MCIS program will create effective pathways from high school through employment, upon successful completion of a degree in a STEM field.  As individuals from underrepresented minority groups comprise nearly half of the student population at CCBC, the MCIS program will contribute to enhancing diversity in the STEM professional workforce.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, the MCIS program will provide 25 scholarships each semester to students who demonstrate financial need, possess high academic potential and are enrolled full-time in the STEM disciplines of Engineering, Engineering Technology, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Information Technology and Network Technology.  In addition to the financial support through the S-STEM scholarships, students in the MCIS program will receive a personal faculty mentor to provide academic and professional advising, opportunities to network with STEM professionals, supplemental instruction, and special courses in spatial skills development.  Through the use of institutional research data and student surveys, outcomes to be measured include the impact of the project on the enrollment, academic performance, retention and graduation of students from the MCIS program, student perceptions of STEM, employment secured by program graduates and successful transfers to four-year institutions.",

The MCIS program encouraged awardees to continue their STEM studies at 4-year institutions.&nbsp; As stated in the project proposal, 20% of scholarship funds&nbsp;were made&nbsp;available to&nbsp;MCIS awardees who had transferred to 4-year institutions after earning an associate's degree or at least 45 credits in an MCIS-eligible program at CCBC.</p>\n<p>MCIS&nbsp;awardees have been highly successful in graduating with associate's degrees and/or transferring to 4-year institutions where 38 awardees to date have earned bachelor's degrees, and another 27 awardees are now actively pursuing STEM bachelor's degrees at their 4-year transfer institutions. The transfer rate to 4-year institutions is 84% for black awardees and 82% for white awardees. Black awardees have a slightly higher rate of earning bachelor's degrees than white awardees (38% vs. 37%).&nbsp; Associate degree attainment is higher for white awardees (79%) than for black awardees (73%).  Female and male awardees were equally likely to earn associate's degrees (74% vs. 73%). Males were slightly more likely to transfer (84% vs. 82%) to 4-year institutions.&nbsp; Males were also more likley to earn bachelor's degrees than females (40% vs. 32%).&nbsp;No significant differences were found for these comparative outcomes&nbsp;for awardees by race/ethnicity or gender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirty-four percent of bachelor's degrees earned by awardees were in various engineering programs. Eighty-nine percent of bachelor's degrees earned by awardees were in various Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems/Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Game Design major programs combined.</p>\n<p>MCIS scholarship awardees were required to participate in completing the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization&nbsp;of Rotations (PSVT:R). Awardees who scored less than 70% on the test were asked to participate in one hour long&nbsp;weekly to bi-weekly spatial skills workshops to practice their visualization skills for the duration of the semester, and were requested to take the PSVT:R again at the end of the semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in&nbsp;the Spring 2016 semester, CCBC was one of the community college partners to the Spatial Skills Instruction Impacts Technology Students (SKIITS) project. As a result, an online version of the test and spatial skills workshops was used, allowing students to attend skills workshops online through Blackboard, face-to-face, or in a blended format. Materials were based on the Spatial Course Learning Resources (Sorby 2009). Initially taking the PSVT:R spatial skills test, only 46.5% of the MCIS awardees scored above the 70% pass rate set for it. After participating in several spatial skills workshops, students on average improved their spatial skill score by 16 percentage points.&nbsp; MCIS students averaged a 67.6% passing rate overall after
