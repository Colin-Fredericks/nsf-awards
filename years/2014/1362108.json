 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planned center site at Oklahoma State University for the I/UCRC for Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (CEMC) intends to leverage the institution?s scholarly contributions that have been of value to aerospace, naval, and space design applications that have focused on the ability of an external electromagnetic threat to couple current onto wire structures carrying command, control, and communication data. Recent work has been focused on establishing methodologies useful to industry related to enhancing shielding effectiveness of cable assemblies and gasket materials, determining effective absorptive materials to reduce overall available power in an enclosed environment, and the application of absorbing materials to reduce emissions from enclosures containing apertures. The planned site intends to leverage its measurement expertise associated with reverberation chamber applications to complement the CEMC's current capabilities.\r\n\r\nElectromagnetic system interference is an increasingly pronounced problem in electronic systems as system frequencies continue to escalate. The planned site?s personnel have already been successfully engaged in providing translational research to industry (including the use of graduate level internships). The use of \"engineering ambassadors\" will provide an energetic connection to the applications of engineering that will be making a difference in the lives of people. A Student Leadership Council (SLC) will provide ongoing formative assessment of the program through regular SWOT analysis of student related outcomes connected with industry (internship quality) and research (mentoring quality). OSU is in a unique position to reach Native American communities in conjunction with Project Lead The Way and the strong CareerTech Programs throughout the state.",
