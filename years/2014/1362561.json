 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division of the NSF investigates organometallic complexes in order to discover new reaction methods and reactivity.  These advances are sought in order to streamline the efficiencies of chemical pathways for the rapid assembly of complex molecules.  A key aspect of these efforts seeks to define versatile, high-value methods for the construction of bioactive compounds to create a platform for studies of medicinal chemistry.\r\n\t\r\nSpecific aspects of the research examine the development of new reactions involving complexes of iron, indium and palladium.  These studies are applied in the synthesis of natural products which display promising bioactivity toward various cancers and disease models of inflammation.  Because of current limitations of the science, the natural products proposed in this investigation have not been previously prepared by synthesis.  Therefore, success in this program is advancing the design and study of these substances as potential drug-like molecules.  A goal of this research is to create new methodologies for generally useful cross-coupling reactions to produce chemically reactive allenes, and to design new carbocyclization reactions.  These efforts are directly applied toward the synthesis of daphnicyclidin and tetrapetalone natural products, but also have broader applicability.\r\n\r\nThis University laboratory offers state-of-the-art training and mentoring in the field of synthetic organic chemistry with a significant diversity program.  A blend of predoctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and undergraduate participants emphasizes the inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities.  All individuals receive training and mentoring to enable future opportunities as leading scientists of the next generation.  The broader impact of these scientific results benefit society by enabling the discovery of new pharmaceuticals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject outcomes have included new findings of scientific and intellectual merit.  These outcomes are briefly summarized as significant and enabling advances of synthetic chemistry.  We have published the first synthesis of the trichoaurantianolides C and D which are metabolites of fungi that show antibiotic activity.  A collaboration with scientists in Spain also has led to a synthesis of amphidinolide K, as well as biological studies to detect the mechanism of action for its anticancer activity.  Thirdly, we have described the first reports for the synthesis of australifungin, a very unique antifungal antibiotic and the first nonsphingosine-based inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis.  These molecules offer medicinal chemists the opportunity to study selective inhibition of this biological pathway.  In addition, the published reactions and strategies give other scientists new techniques and new ideas.  Specifically, we have advanced new opportunities to control three-dimensional stereochemistry in designing reactions that allow for the efficient preparation of complex molecules.  Our publications have described the stereocontrol features involved in asymmetric Diels&ndash;Alder cycloadditions and asymmetric SE' reactions.  A detailed account of stereocontrol for the preparation of monocyclic &beta;-lactams has also impacted the development of new &beta;-lactam antibiotic substances.  Finally, our discoveries reveal a breakthrough methodology for cross-coupling reactions to produce &alpha;-linked bis-enones which are highly reactive substances.  We have utilized these enones for a one-step preparation of complex tetrahydrocarbazole alkaloids. \n\n \n\nA second aspect of our project outcome describes the broad impact of this research.  During the project period, 9 predoctoral students received support and training for their Ph.D. studies.  Among these individuals, four are women.  Three graduate students have earned Ph.D. degrees, and one student obtained the M.S. degree. Six undergraduates have also participated in our research projects.  In the past 3 years, we have produced 10 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, acknowledging support of this NSF program.  The PI has also authored one book chapter, and he has presented this research in 22 seminars at universities and various pharmaceutical companies.  The PI has also given plenary lectures at six conferences and spoke at the Graduation Convocation Program at West Virginia State University.  The PI was selected as a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in 2015, and gave 18 scientific lectures throughout Japan as well as a short course to undergraduate students at Tohoku University.  This program maintains collaborations with scientists at University of California-Davis, Colorado State University, and Universitat de Barcelona (Spain).  The collaboration at Colorado State MRL Regional NIAID Center features studies of tuberculosis and related diseases.  Outreach also includes duties as the Executive Secretary of the International Society of Heterocyclic Chemistry (ISHC).  The PI also regularly teaches (3 classes) premedical, predental, and chemistry undergraduates, as well as predoctoral candidates at Indiana University.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Williams"
