 "awd_abstract_narration": "The years between childhood and adulthood are universally recognized as a stage in normal human development. But despite the fact that scientists know that adolescence is understood and experienced differently in different cultures and societies, most studies of adolescents have taken place in Western societies. Therefore, much remains unknown about this significant period of human development. For this reason, anthropologists have recently directed increased attention to studying adolescents cross-culturally. This particular award is to a research team who ask a particularly important and timely question about the adolescent years: what are the effects of growing up in a violent environment? Unfortunately, violence is part of the daily reality for many adolescents around the world, including many in the United States. Examining the effects of violence on the adolescent years in a non-Western context will allow social scientists and policy makers to differentiate between effects that are local and cultural, and those that are universal, which is essential for developing effective strategies for buffering the effects of violence on adolescents wherever they might live. \r\n\r\nThe research team is comprised of cultural anthropologist Dr. Bilinda S. Straight (Western Michigan University) and biological anthropologist Dr. Ivy L. Pike (University of Arizona).  The research will be carried out in a conflict-ridden pastoralist zone of East Africa where the researchers have previously collected comparative, longitudinal data on 215 households in pastoralist communities that vary by their exposure to violence. The researchers will build on that data with a sample of 660 young people. They will (1) examine the daily movements of adolescent girls and boys (ages 10-19) between settlement and pasture, cattle camp, and other activity sites; (2) monitor energy expenditure with fitness tracking devices and activity recall combined with nutritional assessments using anthropometry and dietary recall; (3) measure adolescent psychosocial stress through multiple bio-markers, validated assessment instruments, and intensive ethnographic interviews; and (4) elicit the choices, explanations, and emotions of adolescent boys and girls in the context of their varied daily experiences.",

The anthropological literature on childhood and adolescence is still growing and greater understanding of East African pastoralist young people's lives is needed. Pastoralist adolescents contribute the bulk of labor to their communities, often engaging in tasks that involve high energetic expenditure and physical risk during long days spent with inadequate access to water and food in a region subject to recurring extreme drought and chronic intercommunity violence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>intellectual merits</strong> of this study include findings of importance to anthropological theory, ethnography, and biological anthropology. The study's methods integrate epidemiology, ethnography, and also auto-ethnography through the sharing of adolescent participants' photography and extended photo captions. The result is the production of a rich dataset on the livelihood activities, risks, joys, and vulnerabilities of Samburu pastoralist young people ages 10-20 years old. Vulnerabilities have been measured in several ways: ethnographic participant-observation, daily activities (including reports of injuries and corporal punishment), nutritional outcomes (through anthropometric data and micronutrient assessment), immune function (two biomarkers), traumatic exposures, food and water insecurity, and experienced emotional distress. Key findings to date show that pastoralist adolescents, both boys and girls, have body mass index values well below World Health Organization international reference standards and are subject to food and water insecurity, and emotional distress. Girls in remoter areas are particularly vulnerable with respect to food quality, access to education, and emotional wellness. An additional important finding is that, consistent with adolescent experiences globally, both boys and girls among the study's young participants reported experiences of sexual trauma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important to emphasize that, on the whole, these young people do not exhibit depression and desperation but rather, daily moments of joy with their parents and peers, as well as hope for the future. Nevertheless, their challenges are poignant. Young people described periods of hunger in all seasons and lack of access to water particularly during dry seasons. Access to clean water was a particular source of stress, even for those closest to deep wells. During the most recent drought (2016-2017), reports of illness due to contaminated water were highest among girls in the remoter site (80%) and lowest in boys in the site closer to infrastructure, a substantial 37% of whom nevertheless reported illness they attributed to contaminated water. These young people also routinely experience risk from predators such as hyenas, leopards, and lions, as well as risk of intercommunity and domestic violence. In the study site closer to state infrastructure, 33% of girls and 27% of boys reported having to leave a place quickly due to violence, and in the site remote from state infrastructure 51% of girls and 13% of boys reported leaving quickly due to violence. Once young girl said, \"Our cows were all raided by the Turkana and we've been left with nothing,\" while another girl, describing the emotional impact of a death of someone she knew, said, \"Elephants killed someone and made me scared and sad.\" One boy stated, \"During the drought we had to sleep hungry because there wasn't food. Also, all the water we had at home got finished and several times when I was looking after our animals there was no water in the pasture areas...Warriors stole cattle from a [nearby] ranch and as the warriors passed our home the soldiers found them. There was serious fire exchanged and I felt like I would die, I was so scared.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The integration of young people's voices and experiences with interdisciplinary methods that assess their emotional and physical wellbeing provide a rich and important portrait of contemporary pastoralist adolescence. The dataset promises to enrich our understanding of adolescence in terms of potential public health interventions, descriptively and analytically from a culturally-particular perspective rooted in state and global political-economic realities, and analytically with respect to the evolution of human childhood.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The study's <strong>broader impacts</strong> include fostering international collaborations with Kenyan colleagues; training ten U.S. and Kenyan university students in field methods, ethics, and data entry and analysis; and targeting under-represented pastoralist university students in particular for training and field experience opportunities. Students have served as co-authors of national conference presentations and are co-authoring published papers. Additionally, the project has been making an impact on local pastoralist indigenous communities through knowledge transfer to regional health programs concerned with adolescent health and well-being, and free health assessments and referrals of the most vulnerable for follow up care. The study's findings are also being transferred to humanitarian stakeholders in Kenya and the United States. As analyses continue, and as a group of researchers put their eyes on this data set, extremely useful and socially relevant contributions to global health, as well as scholarly literatures are expected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/23/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bilinda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Straight</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025084677_BringingFirewood--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025084677_BringingFirewood--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bringing Firewood\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025084677_BringingFirewood--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bringing Firewood\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Young person brings firewood into the house.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bilinda Straight</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bilinda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Straight</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bringing Firewood</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025229710_Milkingsheep--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025229710_Milkingsheep--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Milking sheep\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025229710_Milkingsheep--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Milking sheep\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Girl milks sheep at dusk.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bilinda Straight</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bilinda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Straight</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Milking sheep</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025361665_Eating--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025361665_Eating--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eating\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430860/1430860_10328183_1543025361665_Eating--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eating\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Children have a midday meal next to the house.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bilinda Straight</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bilinda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Straight</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Eating</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
