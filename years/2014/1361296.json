 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah explores the development of techniques to enhance the ability to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions.  Success in this endeavor has an impact on any pursuit in which the synthesis of molecules and reaction optimization is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industries and their biological and chemical research activities.  In addition to building an internationally recognized program, this project provides excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.  \r\n\t\t\r\nThe ability to predict the outcome of a chemical reaction necessitates the construction of mathematical models relating to physical organic chemical precepts (parameters describing steric and electronic effects) in a limited number of well-designed initial experiments.  The resultant models are used to predict new examples of both catalyst and substrate performance for a given catalytic reaction.  To accomplish this, new physical organic parameters and design concepts are to be developed. This work leads to novel ways to interrogate reactions in terms of extrapolating the models to predict the performance of new catalysts and substrates for a given reaction.  Additionally, the resulting models enhance our understanding of reaction mechanisms, since the parameters are tied to physical organic concepts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA central goal of modern organic chemistry is to develop robust and sustainable catalytic reactions that functionalize a molecule with high levels of selectivity.  The major issue in the development of such processes is the highly empirical nature of the procedure.  Many test reactions are required but only a few are fruitful in improving a reaction.  As chemical processes become more sophisticated (e.g., requiring many ingredients), the desire to streamline the optimization and thus save precious time and resources is significant.  Therefore, our program has sought to develop an alternative data driven strategy by which we describe molecules with various mathematical representations (parameters) and compare these with the outcomes elicited by the molecule in a given reaction.  Comparing these two quantitative outputs allows one to derive statistical models. Evaluating the parameters required to achieve statistically stringent mathematical models leads two different but useful consequences: 1) mathematical prediction of entirely new reaction results and 2) a deeper fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism.  By combining the insight from these disparate goals, one can design and develop new combinations of reactants and catalysts to result in a much more robust and beneficial chemical process.  Specifically, in the last granting period, we reported the development of several new molecular descriptor sets, the application of these to the prediction and understanding of a diverse array of reactions, and, maybe of most importance, the initiation of numerous collaborations both in the academic and industrial realms.  While reporting new methods to streamline reaction development is a clear broader impact, the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the expansive areas (organic synthesis, mathematical modeling, and physical organic chemistry) is the defining broader impact of this program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Sigman"
