Through archival research the co-PI will analyze how professors discussed emerging theories of the body, particularly in anatomical lectures, and how these antebellum theorists helped set the tone for the medical and scientific theories of race that emerged in the post-Darwin world, particularly in eugenics and social Darwinism.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to a dissertation, the co-PI plans to publish his results in a book, and articles including ones directed to non-specialist readers which would link the historical work to more recent examples of how scientific theories of race have affected American society.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits:\n\nThrough research funded by this grant, the co-pi has drawn a number of general conclusions regarding the relationship between racial science and medical education in the nineteenth United States.  First, racial science represented an important part of antebellum medical education.  By the 1850s, students in their anatomy lectures learned about the central debate in American racial science, whether black and white people were the same species dating back to the biblical creation of Adam and Eve or separate species produced by discrete acts of divine creation.  This relationship is best evidenced in lectures by anatomy professors arguing that black and white people were distinct species.  Additionally, medical students parroted this belief in their senior dissertations, quoting their professors and significant scientific works on race.\n\nSecond, this research project has also discovered considerable data that supports the conclusion that professors across the United States taught racial science to their students.  Through research funded by this grant in Philadelphia, New York, Charleston, and Lexington, Ky., the co-pi discovered evidence that scientific approaches to racial difference represented a national concern in the antebellum era, not just a matter of pro-slavery politics as often portrayed by historical scholarship.  This trend points to an engrained relationship between medical thought and racial theories. The implications of this trend were considerable, with tens of thousands of medical students in the antebellum United States being trained to see black bodies as permanently different and inferior.  Moreover, physicians through their practice interacted with citizens across class boundaries, ensuring that these theories could reach audiences that had little access to or interest in expensive scientific texts.  This discovery pushes for greater continuity in discussion of racial science before and after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859.\n\nFinally, this research project has uncovered sources that prove that antebellum medical and scientific racial thought was much more subtle than previous characterizations of it as crass pro-slavery politics masquerading as science.  Specifically, this project argues that racial science and racial anatomy went beyond just skull measuring and skin color as emphasized in scholarly literature.  Instead, race became tied to a whole host of perceived internal anatomical features including the structure of the foot, pelvis, and forearm, amongst other supposed racially different features of human skeletons. This scientific reframing of the black body underscores how theorists argued against the possibility of social elevation of the African American population in the United States, even if slavery were to be abolished. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis research has already been utilized in multiple conference papers and public lectures. In September 2014, the co-pi presented a paper at the Joint Atlantic Seminar in the History of Medicine.  In January 2015, the University of Pennsylvania\u00c6s English Department invited the co-pi to give a public lecture in their series on the History of Material Texts.  Here, the co-pi presented some early conclusions from the data sets generated by the research conducted under this grant.  In March 2015, the Consortium for the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine\u00c6s Medicine and Health working group invited the co-pi to present a paper partially based on this research. Most recently, the co-pi presented a paper in May 2015 at the American Association for the History of Medicine.  Likewise, the co-pi has been accepted to present a paper at the annual meeting of the Southern Historical Association in November 2015. Additionally, a number of publications are currently being written by the co-pi utilizing this research including a scholarly article about antebellum racial scientist Samuel Cartwright (in preparation), an a..."
