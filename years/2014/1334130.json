 "awd_abstract_narration": "SES-1334130\r\nPeter Evans\r\nMalgorzata Kurjanska\r\nUniversity of California-Berkeley\r\n\r\nThis project is a continuation of dissertation fieldwork on how state policies of political exclusion and cultural repression shaped civic society.  The past two decades have seen a resurgence of interest in associational life. Some researchers place civil society at the heart of democratic consolidation. Others cite examples of authoritarian states supported by dense yet uncivil society. Few studies, however, analyze what forces shape the associational landscape?s character. Thus, this research asks: Why do associations arise and what leads them to become civil or uncivil in character? A survey of relevant scholarly literature reveals two types of explanations: state-centered and economic theories. This project tests and builds upon these theories through comparative analysis of associational life in pre-WWI and interwar [1918-1939] Poland.  The project employs cross-regional and cross-time historical comparisons. It utilizes historical narratives and descriptive statistics to examine the development of associational life in pre-WWI and interwar Poland.  In addition to theoretical contributions, this research will contribute to knowledge on civic society in Eastern Europe. Polish civic society has been researched extensively in the post-communist context. Yet there are few studies of pre-WWII associational life in the ethnically diverse societies of early twentieth century Eastern Europe. This dissertation addresses this gap in existing research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe study incorporates research that is often overlooked as it is not readily available to non-Polish speakers. Thus, it will bring to an English-speaking audience studies that have been marginalized due to language barriers. A historical analysis of factors that shaped the associational landscape in interwar Poland will shed light on the implications of social and economic policies pursued by modern, multi-ethnic states with growing civic societies and uncertain paths to democratization. This project contributes to modern debates by helping to identify the types of policies, social or economic, which support the development of civil society.",

In Vilnius, the co-principal investigator located and copied individual state registries of various types of interwar organizations (professional, recreational, service, etc). The documents note the number of an organization\u00c6s members and its members' political affiliation (by percentage). This information has been transcribed into an Excel database, and has been used to conduct preliminary comparisons against similar registration documents collected during previous fieldwork in the Polish National archives in Poznan and Krakow. The preliminary results support the original hypothesis proposed by the co-PI, that state-policies shape liberal or illiberal characteristics of civil society, particularly with respect to domination of associations by elites or political actors.  Once formed, characteristics of civil society are temporarily \"sticky,\" or resistant to change.  Due to state policies of political inclusion (of local elites) organizations in interwar Krakow (in pre-WWI Austria) were, on average, less likely to be dominated by single political parties than either in Poznan (in pre-WWI Germany) or Vilnius (in pre-WWI Russia). On average, 82% of members of individual organizations in Poznan supported the same political party (these results are likely higher than average for all organizations, as this kind of individual-level organizational data in Poznan remains only for professional organizations). In Vilnius, on average, 79.2% of members of individual organizations supported the same political party. In Krakow, on average, 69.8% of members of an individual organization supported the same political party.\n\nIn Lviv, the co-principal investigator was able to locate two crucial sets of data. The first are associational registries for all of Galicia, which list, by county, all of the organizations registered since 1846 until 1914. The registries contain the name of each organization (and in some cases where the name is not informative, a very brief additional description), location, date of registration and date that an organization was removed from the registry. These hand-written registries were copied and are in the process of being transcribed into a database. This database will be subsequently coded and used to provide descriptive statistics about the associational landscape that arose in the Krakow region before WWI. Secondly, the co-principal investigator conducted a random sample of governm..."
