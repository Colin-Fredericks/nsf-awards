This project brought 82 scientists to a rural Alaska Native community over 6 years to have meaningful engagement activities through two primary outlets: Sitka Whalefest, a 24 year old symposium celebrating the marine environment through scientific lectures, community festivities, music, art and classroom instruction, and an Alaska-developed, highly successful model called Scientist in Residency Fellowship (SIRF) which brings scientists to the community for one month to participate in a variety of community engagement activities that expose rural and Alaska Natives, underrepresented the sciences, to polar research and STEM disciplines, and trains scientists how to communicate in rural Alaska.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The SIRF model was extremely successful in connecting Polar researchers with students, teachers, policy makers, representatives of science agencies, Alaska Natives, community members, scientists <em>through a partnership with </em>rural, Southeast Alaskan coastal communities. .
