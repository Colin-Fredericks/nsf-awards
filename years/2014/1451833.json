 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on taking advantage of emerging virtual reality (VR) technology and high-performance networks for collaborative exploration of 3D environments, and on the application of such environments to education. The project is developing an immersive networked collaborative VR environment for education about energy technologies. As part of the project the system will be deployed to assess the value of its tools for high-school STEM education. The overall goal is to explore, and to help spark, the transformative potential of high-performance networks and emerging VR devices for innovative educational and other beneficial uses.\r\n\r\nThe project leverages the City of Lafayette's innovative \"Fiber-to-the-Home\" project that has brought high-speed fiber optic internet access directly to every school and home in the city, including the David Thibodeaux STEM Magnet Academy, the target high-school for the project.  The project also leverages an existing non-collaborative VR tour of a \"Virtual Energy Center\" that was developed to explain solar thermal power and other alternative energy concepts to high school students. It models a real-world facility, the UL Lafayette Pilot Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) Plant in Crowley, Louisiana, a research facility for alternative energy sources.",

The team developed, deployed, and evaluated approaches that allow students wearing VR headsets to be guided through virtual field trips by livestreamed 3D imagery of a teacher, who may be remotely located (Image 2). This approach can provide field-trip-like or lab-like experiences, guided by experts, to students who are unable to visit physical sites because of location, budget, or schedule.</p>\n<p>The approaches were applied to STEM education about alternative energy through virtual field trips of a VR solar energy center representing a real pilot-scale plant located in Crowley, Louisiana. A new VR model of the plant was extended with content such as animations of fluid flow, see-through views into devices, and interactive controls for students (Image 5). Throughout the project, prototypes were deployed and tested at three high schools, at outreach events, and at international events for Smart Gigabit Community (SGC) leaders and researchers.</p>\n<p>The team's main studies were conducted with 223 high school students in high school classrooms (Image 1). About half of these students were involved during studies of prototypes of classroom-deployable VR stations, and the other half during an evaluation of the final networked approach in terms of educational effects (test score gains) and student experiences (questionnaires). The final study found that the networked approach produced promising test score gains and very high student ratings of the VR teacher. Comparison to a non-networked VR field trip showed a benefit of the live guidance. Differences in effectiveness in different classroom types were also suggested. Additionally, over 100 university students participated in studies to assess and improve specific technological aspects such as a teacher interface that allows a networked teacher without a VR headset to more effectively guide students who wear headsets (Image 3). Results of the studies provide knowledge for future development and deployment of VR approaches for education.</p>\n<p>The team worked with national and international gigabit initiatives (US Ignite, Ignite SA, Mozilla Gigabit) to test the feasibility of longer-range networked operation and to inform Smart Gigabit Community leaders about emerging gigabit applications. These efforts included a transpacific networked VR deployment crossing about 12,000 miles of fiber optic cable (Lafayette, LA to Adelaide, Australia, at the launch of the Ignite SA gigabit initiative). A separate week-long interstate deployment allowed a teacher in Lafayette, LA, to remotely guide students and visitors at the Chattanooga Public Library in Tennessee (Image 6). Demonstrations of the work to SGC leaders included floor and stage demonstrations at two Smart Cities Innovation summits and an exhibition in Washington, D.C. to inform federal officials and industry leaders (Image 4).</p>\n<p>Outreach activities exposed thousands of high school students to VR, related career paths, and beneficial uses of VR and gigabit networks. Annually, the team demonstrated the project at the regional Career Connections event (attended by up to 4000 high school students) and to the college's Science Day events. A dozen other events were held for potential students and their families, for college prep groups, for junior leadership groups, and for several visiting schools. In collaboration with the high school that most directly supported the team's studies (David Thibodaux STEM Magnet Academy), the team mentored a group of its students to help develop a project-based high school VR curriculum.</p>\n<p>The project led to longer-term work by the PIs through follow-on and spinoff projects. PI Borst subsequently leads NSF project 1815976 on attention sensing methods in VR, especially using eye tracking in VR headsets to make VR more responsive to students and to help teachers better guide students. He is investigating teacher-guided VR approaches with applications including geosciences exploration and offshore training. Co-PI Chambers and a former Ph.D. student from this project continue working on energy applications and on VR projects that educate middle school students about coastal erosion and its effects on displaced people in coastal Louisiana.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/24/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christoph&nbsp;W&nbsp;Borst</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1451833/1451833_10338663_1548373488665_HighSchoolExperiment--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1451833/1451833_10338663_1548373488665_HighSchoolExperiment--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Networked VR at a STEM academy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1451833/1451833_10338663_1548373488665_HighSchoolExperiment--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Networked VR at a STEM academy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High school students at a STEM Magnet Academy are guided through a VR field trip of an energy center.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicholas G.
