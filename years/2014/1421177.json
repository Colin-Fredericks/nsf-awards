 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer systems process and store information, including\r\ninstructions, inputs, and outputs.  Computers represent, or \"encode\",\r\nthis information with bits -- zeros and ones -- such that a given\r\nsequence of bits can describe a number, an instruction, a character to\r\nprint to the monitor, etc.  The choice of bit patterns used to encode\r\ndifferent types of information impacts the performance, reliability,\r\nand energy-efficiency of a computer.  This project -- which is an\r\ninterdisciplinary collaboration between a computer systems architect\r\nand an expert in information coding -- will develop new information\r\nrepresentations that improve performance, reliability, and\r\nenergy-efficiency.  This project will have both technical impact on\r\ncomputer system design and information coding, and it will impact\r\nsociety through its training of students (both graduate and\r\nundergraduate) and an outreach program that brings under-represented\r\nminorities to Duke for summer research experiences.\r\n \r\nThis project will make technical advances in four main avenues.\r\nFirst, the project will develop new representations for the\r\ninformation that is stored in write-limited storage media like Flash,\r\nwith the goal of extending its lifetime.  A key coding technology in\r\nthis research thrust is coset coding, in which the system has multiple\r\nchoices for which codeword to write to the storage and can choose the\r\noption that incurs the least wear.  Second, the project will develop\r\nnew codes, based on existing locally repairable codes, for writing to\r\nall types of storage that can suffer permanent failures.  These codes\r\ncan enable efficient, local repair of failures by minimizing the\r\nnumber of storage locations that must be accessed to perform the\r\nrepair.  Third, the project will develop new representations of\r\ninstructions to improve performance and energy-efficiency.  In\r\nparticular, the project will develop new encodings of instructions for\r\nGPUs that enable useful work to be done even in the presence of branch\r\ndivergence.  Fourth, the project will develop and apply network coding\r\ntechniques to improve the performance and reliability of communication\r\nbetween processor cores.",

In early work, we took the idea of coset coding from information theory and applied it to the writing of PCM.  Each PCM cell, which can hold a bit, wears out after a finite number of times that cell's value changes.  We use coset coding to give the core choices in what bits to write, and with more choices there are better oppoortunities to write strings of bits in which fewer bits need to change value.  We have also applied coset coding to Flash memory, to prolong its lifetime.

Architects are not aware of the codes or how to adapt them, and information theorists are unaware of the implementation requirements of real computer systems.  By working together, we have developed novel codes that can be used in real systems.  We experimentally evaluate the benefits and the costs of our codes.\n\nThis project has had numerous broader impacts.  For one, we have published our work in both of our research communities, making each aware of key ideas from the other.  Second, we have trained several young researchers, including Dr. Alireza Vahid (was a postdoc with us and is now a professor at University of Colorado, Denver) and Georgios Mappouras, a PhD student who is learning how to perform and present his own research.  We are also transferring our technology to industry in several ways.  Both the PI and co-PI present this work to industrial colleagues.  Mr. Mappouras is on a 6-month internship at AMD, where he is sharing our research as well as learning about real-world industrial problems that need to be solved.  This project has also supported the training of undergraduate research assistants, including a winner of the Duke ECE Department's annual research project award.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Sorin"
