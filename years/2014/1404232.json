 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses current issues of interest concerning the structure of the Universe. The investigator and his students will focus on the study of matter in compact stars, as natural laboratories that provide extreme densities and strong magnetic fields. One of the important components of the project concerns the training of graduate and undergraduate students by involving them into a modern research program in theoretical nuclear physics. The students are expected to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills that will be applied in their future careers in industry or academia. The integration of the principle investigator's research with education at the Arizona State University with a substantial enrollment of underrepresented groups of students will contribute to a high-quality education in science and engineering, as well as to the development of human resources in the region.\r\n\r\nThis project will apply quantum field theoretical methods to study fundamental properties of relativistic matter in magnetic fields. The corresponding relativistic types of matter with strong magnetic fields are relevant for the phenomenology of compact stars, the evolution of the Early Universe, and the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. Therefore, the project will add to a deeper understanding of numerous phenomena in the natural world and will expand the knowledge about the phases of strongly interacting matter and their role in the cosmos. The theoretical methods and research outcomes of this project will also extend beyond the realm of theoretical nuclear physics. In particular, the results of these studies will be useful in the context of quasi-relativistic condensed matter materials, which hold a great promise for future applications.",
