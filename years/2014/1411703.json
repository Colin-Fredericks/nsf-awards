 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial population dynamics and invasions of species in streams and rivers have attracted increasing scientific scrutiny. The purpose of this project is to understand effects of the water flow and inter- and intra- relations in species on population spread and persistence in streams or rivers that may be subject to temporal and spatial variations. Reaction-diffusion-advection equations and integro-difference / differential equations will be studied. Researchers will investigate effects of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on spreading speeds and/or persistence conditions for a single species and for multiple species in different river environments. The relation among hydrological factors of a real river will be incorporated into population models. The optimal control and observer theory will be combined to spatial dynamics theory to study influences of global perturbations of parameters on population invasions of an invasive species. \r\n \r\nReal rivers or streams can never be ideally homogeneous everywhere at all times. It is crucial to introduce temporal and spatial heterogeneity and hydrological relations into population models. It is also interesting to combine the optimal control and observer theory and invasion dynamics. Researchers will derive reliable predictions about influences of the water flow and physical river conditions on population dynamics and provide suggestions on Instream Flow Needs, biological invasion control, river channel design, and water resource management. The following questions could be answered based on the study: How does the total annual flow discharge influence the ecosystem health?  Is it better to have fluctuating flows or a constant flow for population persistence?  How much water can we take from a river without destroying the ecosystem?  How much spatial heterogeneity should be kept for healthy ecosystem while designing a river channel?  Will a species be persistent or extinct in a specific real river?  How to control an invasive species in a river?  More questions than these are likely to be addressed as the project progresses.",
