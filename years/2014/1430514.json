The team will engage in an ambitious and integrated program of research, conferences, public events, and the development of teaching materials focused on the complex, contested, and changing roles of zoos and aquaria in society.\r\n\r\nThere is a dual emphasis on engaging the scientific/professional community and the general public, which not only enables the integration of diverse viewpoints, but also serves as a mechanism for increasing public awareness of the goals, tactics, and challenges of zoo conservation. With regards to the public component, the researchers plan to have a broad impact in two distinct ways; the events will take place in different geographic regions (Arizona, New York), and there will be a virtual public exhibit that will be accessible worldwide.",
