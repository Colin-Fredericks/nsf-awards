 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Greater Philadelphia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, under the leadership of Drexel University, is a senior-level alliance consisting of the following public and private institutions:  \r\n\r\nFour-Year Institutions\r\n\r\nDrexel University\r\nCheyney University\r\nDelaware State University\r\nLincoln University\r\nNew Jersey Institute of Technology\r\nTemple University\r\nUniversity of Delaware\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\r\n\r\nTwo-Year Institution\r\n\r\nCommunity College of Philadelphia\r\n\r\nThe alliance represents a diverse alliance of public and private, two and four year, research and non-research, and minority-serving institutions. \r\n.\r\nThe alliance has established a firm foundation for the objectives of the 2014-2019 project activities as a \r\nsenior-level Alliance with specific attention to: 1) further enhancing inter-institutional connectivity, 2) expanding the coordinated movement of community college students to 4-year institutions, 3) increasing the engagement of undergraduate students in national and international research experiences, as well as graduate school matriculation to continually increase retention and completion of STEM baccalaureate degrees and improve STEM student competitiveness for graduate programs in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts will include enhancing partnerships, research collaborations, and articulation strategies between community colleges, minority-serving and Ph.D. granting universities, within the alliance and beyond and enhancing the integration of research and education.\r\nInternal assessment and external evaluation of the project will attempt to measure program effectiveness by answering questions such as:  (1) how have retention rates and academic performance data changed during the course of the project? (2) how has connectivity with the community colleges changed during the project? (3) what has been the impact of graduate school preparation on students? readiness to engage in graduate studies? (4)  in what ways has the project impacted inter-institutional cooperation and collaboration?",

Through synergistic collaboration, the Philadelphia AMP, as a tri-state, nine institution consortium, has utilized its operational infrastructure to increase the capacity of its partner institutions to recruit, retain and graduate more underrepresented minority STEM students by substantially expanding their capabilities to attract, develop and support STEM student talent.&nbsp; Participating institutions include: Cheyney University, Community College of Philadelphia, Delaware State University, Drexel University, Lincoln University of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, New Jersey Institute of Technology (through February 2019), Temple University, University of Delaware, and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>As a result of the Alliance&rsquo;s efforts, a mechanism has been developed to catalyze changes in institutional, departmental, and organizational culture and the practices that have resulted in significant increases in recruitment (including 2-yr to 4-yr matriculation), retention, STEM degree production, and graduate school entry for underrepresented students, as well as for the benefit of all students. Specifically, under the current project, the Philadelphia AMP initiative continued to substantially increase the number of qualified African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander students receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and subsequently, entering graduate school to attain doctoral degrees. The Alliance exceeded its 5-year minority STEM B.S. degree production goal of 800+ degrees annually by producing 954 degrees in Year 1 (2014-15), and 1,000+ degrees annually from Years 2-5. Despite the loss of the inclusion of degrees from the New Jersey Institute of Technology who transitioned to the Garden State LSAMP as of March 1, 2019, the Philadelphia AMP was still able to produce 838 minority STEM BS degrees in Year 6 (2019-20). During the project, two hundred and fifty-four (254) students also transitioned to graduate STEM programs at both the Master&rsquo;s and PhD levels.</p>\n<p>In addition, Philadelphia AMP students continued to contribute to the advancement of STEM knowledge through their engagement in both national and international research activities, research and technical training from national laboratories, and participation in national STEM conferences. With LSAMP funding, as well as by leveraging funding from partner institutions and other federally-funded programs, one thousand one hundred and fifty-five (1,155) students participated in national STEM conferences, and seven hundred and thirty-six (736) students participated in undergraduate research experiences, of which one hundred and thirty-two (132) were international research experiences. Hence, historically as of July 2019, two hundred (200) Philadelphia AMP students have now engaged in international research experiences in the following countries: Brazil (4), China (61), Austria (2), Switzerland (1), Jamaica (10), Chile (1), Serbia (2), Madagascar (1), Africa (15), Poland (40), South Korea (6), The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (13), Equatorial Guinea (3), Germany (2), Belgium (1), and Greece (24), Columbia (6), Morocco (4), Spain (1), New Zealand (1), Philippines (1), and Argentina (1).</p>\n<p>Twenty-five (25), Philadelphia AMP scholars have also attained a formal certificate from the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) attesting to their new technical skills in Scientific Computing. The Alliance&rsquo;s sustained partnership with the BNL continues to enhance the research expertise of its students, thus making them more globally competitive.
