  "por_txt_cntn": "A major motivation for the study of the Earth\u00c6s space environment and those of the other planets is to understand how they came to be and how these environments are continuously changed by the changing output of the Sun, both in its changing light and particle output.  By understanding how our space environment was created and how it changes naturally, we can better understand the role that humankind plays in changing the environment of spaceship Earth.\n \nOne of the major questions involves understanding the source of the energetic particles that are trapped in the magnetic fields of Earth and other planets.  These particles were originally thought to come entirely from the Sun through a phenomenon called the solar wind.  This \"wind\"  of particles and magnetic fields that flows outward from the surface of the Sun moves outward through the entire solar system.  As a result of this NSF-sponsored AGU conference and previous Chapman Conferences that have take place at Yosemite National Park over a period of four decades, we are now finding that the Earth and other planets themselves play a significant role in furnishing these particles in their own space environments.\n \nThis is a new paradigm that improves our understanding of our broader environment and how it changes.  This knowledge will be of great value in enhancing our ability to predict future changes at Earth and other planets.  This improved knowledge will be crucial in preparing us to protect our sensitive technological systems that operate both on Earth and in space around Earth from our changing \"Space Weather.\"  In addition, the continued development of advanced mathematical models of this coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system will help guide decision makers in taking the necessary steps to protect our Earth and space infrastructure in the future.  This terrestrial-based understanding can and will be directly applied to the broader understanding of planetary systems such as those at Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pranoti Asher"
