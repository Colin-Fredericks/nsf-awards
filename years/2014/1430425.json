The funds will help reduce the travel cost burden on students and thereby improve student participation at the workshop. It is expected that approximately 10 students will benefit from these travel funds. Students will participate in the scientific sessions and also present their work at a dedicated poster session. \r\n\r\nThe workshop provides an excellent opportunity for students to broaden the impact of their work. In addition, it is a unique opportunity for the students to network with peers, leaders in the field, and future collaborators. Through the travel grant, the SES community will be able to increase student participation in the workshop.",
