 "awd_abstract_narration": "Core-collapse supernova explosions from massive stars and collisions of neutron star mergers are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. In these explosions and collisions, the key chemical elements of live (oxygen, carbon, iron etc.) and all heavy elements, including the rare earths metals, are synthesized and expelled into the interstellar medium. The goal of this PRAC project is to simulate core-collapse supernovae and the remnants of neutron star collisions at unprecedented physical detail. The investigators will use high-resolution three-dimensional simulations that include general relativity, fluid dynamics, radiation transport of neutrinos, magnetic fields, and a sophisticated description of the properties of the ultra-high density matter present in the cores of supernovae and neutron star collision remnants. The simulations will yield a deeper understanding of the processes occurring as a star turns from collapse to explosion and will elucidate the role of magnetic fields in both core-collapse supernovae and in the evolution of collision remnants. This will, in turn, yield better predictions for signals (in gravitational waves, neutrinos, and electromagnetic waves, and synthesized elements) from these phenomena. Astronomical observations can then be used to test theoretical models and constrain present uncertainties in nuclear physics and astrophysics.",

These explosions are extremely important for the enrichment of the universe with the chemical elements from which planets form and life is made.</p>\n<p><br />This project used the <strong>NSF Blue Waters supercomputer</strong> to perform simulations to better understand the \"explosion mechanism,\" namely how the initial collapse of a massive star's core is turned into an explosion. The project addressed two specific mechanisms:</p>\n<p><br />The \"<strong>Magnetorotational Mechanism</strong>\" explains supernova explosion with a combination of ultra-strong magnetic field and very rapid rotation (spin) of the newborn neutron star. Magnetic field and spin conspire to launch a strong explosion -- at least this how this mechanism is envisioned to work, but nobody knew how precisely the ultra-strong magnetic field would be generated. The project team carried out a set of extremely large simulations running on up to 150,000 of Blue Waters CPU cores to answer this question. They found that a so-called magnetorotational instability occurs that amplifies the weakest seed magnetic field to ultra-strong magnetic field on small scales (i.e. in a fraction of the newborn neutron star). A \"dynamo\" then takes this small-scale field and reorders it to an ultra-strong global magnetic field enveloping the rapidly spinning neutron star. This explains how the Magnetorotational Mechanism can work and it also explains how so-called \"magnetars\" -- neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic field -- can be formed.</p>\n<p>The \"<strong>Neutrino Mechanism</strong>\" is a strong alternative mechanism. It relies on neutrinos. They are tiny elementary particles that are created in copious amounts when a star goes supernova. They come from the newborn neutron star and pass through the overlying stellar gas. A small fraction of them is absorbed by this gas, heating it up and driving turbulent gas motions. The combination of heating and turbulent gas dynamics is envisioned to drive an explosion. The project team carried out simulations to better understand the nature of the turbulent motions and how the neutrino mechanism works in full three spatial dimensions -- stars may look spherically symmetric, but because turbulence is involved, the explosion can get extremely asymmetric!</p>\n<p>In a first set of simulations, the team targeted supernova turbulence to better understand its properties. In classical turbulence (i.e. as can be generated in a lab), the picture is that turbulent eddies that form at large scale interact with each other, breaking up into smaller and smaller eddies until their energy is turned into heat at very small scales. This is called the turbulent cascade and was first described by the Russian physicist Kolmogorov in the early 1940s. In a supernova, this cascade ranges from scales of several 100 kilometers down to meters or even centimeters. The turbulence simulations showed that supernova turbulence behaves mathematically just like Kolmogorov's turbulence, which was a surprise, given the extreme conditions in a supernova. They also showed that supernova simulations need higher resolution than currently computationally possible to correctly describe turbulent flow. This is be a big problem to be tackled on the next-generation of supercomputers.</p>\n<p>In a second set of simulations, the team focused squarely on the neutrino mechanism and how it works in full three spatial dimensions (3D). Previously the neutrino mechanism was mostly simulated by assuming the star was spherically symmetric (1D) or symmetric about one of its major axes (2D). Using 12,000 Blue Waters CPU cores, the team was able to carry out the first full 3D core-collapse supernova simulations that correctly included the effects of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and handled neutrinos with a great deal of accuracy in full 3D. Neutrino transport is the physical process that describes how neutrinos move through the star and how many of them are absorbed to help the explosion. It's the most computational expensive part of a supernova simulation, so previous work had to rely on many approximations and simplifications. Full 3D neutrino transport became possible only on Blue Waters thanks to the support of this PRAC award.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christian&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ott</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532178842_entropy_vol_rend--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532178842_entropy_vol_rend--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A Neutrino-Driven Supernova at the Brink of Explosion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532178842_entropy_vol_rend--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A Neutrino-Driven Supernova at the Brink of Explosion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Volume view of a 3D core-collapse supernova driven by the neutrino mechanism at the brink of explosion.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luke Roberts et al.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ott</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A Neutrino-Driven Supernova at the Brink of Explosion</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532071750_lessYellow_white--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532071750_lessYellow_white--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MRI Operating in a Proto-Neutron Star\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532071750_lessYellow_white--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MRI Operating in a Proto-Neutron Star\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visualization of the magnetic field built up by an large-scale from small-scale magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Philipp Moesta et al. 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ott</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MRI Operating in a Proto-Neutron Star</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532274111_collapse_for_figshare--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532274111_collapse_for_figshare--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Core-Collapse Supernova Schematic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1440083/1440083_10333852_1508532274111_collapse_for_figshare--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Core-Collapse Supernova Schematic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic describing the process of stellar death leading to a core-collapse supernova explosion.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christian Ott</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;D&nbsp;Ott</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Core-Collapse Supernova Schematic</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
