 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project upgrades the campus network for Juniata College to 10Gbps and establishes a connection to Internet2 via 3ROX. Juniata College hosts a high capacity compute cluster for a consortium of undergraduate institutions working in genomics research. The Genome Consortium for Active Teaching, using high throughput Next Generating Sequencing (GCAT-SEEK), provides sequencing technologies and genomic analysis training to faculty and students to support on-going research projects at 132 partnering institutions. Campus networking improvements enable greater end-to-end performance and reliability for students and research users of the compute cluster, and improves network-based access to central resources for computational biology required for research projects involving analysis and comparison of whole genome data sets. The expanded network is an essential advancement as it allows teams of faculty and students to participate in cutting-edge genomics research projects and provide authentic research experiences to undergraduates at the partnering institutions. The increased network capacity enhances undergraduate classroom teaching, enabling students from multiple institutions to simultaneously access the software and computational resources of the compute cluster. The cyber infrastructure improvements include the expansion of the internal local area network (LAN), an increase in Internet2 connectivity, and connections to resources within larger frameworks at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. This strategy presents a financially-feasible model for increased Internet2 connectivity that may be adopted by other small institutions. Design, manuals and tutorials are made available to partnering institutions. GCAT-SEEK activities also include studies of the broader ethical, legal and social implications of advances in the field of genomics. Addressing these topics is critical for training the next generation of scientists, physicians and healthcare policy experts.",

Juniata College&rsquo;s Collaborative Science Infrastructure (CSI) project upgraded the institution&rsquo;s network infrastructure to greatly increase connectivity speeds, which has allowed us to expand the performance and reliability of the genomics compute cluster and network used by GCAT-SEEK. This was an essential advancement, since small colleges and universities - which provide an undergraduate education for many American scientists - need consortiums such as GCAT-SEEK in order to participate in cutting-edge genomics research activities and to provide authentic research experiences to undergraduates. This cyberinfrastructure improvement has facilitated the ability of GCAT-SEEK members to advance the fields of RNAseq, prokaryotic genomics, eukaryotic genomics, and metagenomics using computational biology and its required high bandwidth interconnectivity. The infrastructure improvements in the CSI project included significant increases in the capacity of the internal LAN replacing 1 Gigabits per second (Gbps) maximum uplinks with 10 Gbps maximum uplinks, an increase in potential Internet capacity, a connection to 3ROX within the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and a 1 Gbps connection to Internet2.&nbsp; These CSI project improvements were comprised of a financially-feasible model that may be adopted by other small institutions. Juniata College&rsquo;s Campus Technology Services Department, under the leadership of Anne Wood, Assistant Vice President and Chief Information Officer, designed the CSI cyberinfrastructure upgrade plan and closely collaborated with the PIs, Dr. Jill Keeney from the Biology Department and Dr. Loren Rhodes from Information Technology/Computer Science Department, to ensure that the resulting network was feasible, sustainable, and addressed the needs of Juniata College scientists and the GCAT-SEEK consortium.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure enhancements increased the networking capability of 132 partnering undergraduate institutions in the GCAT-SEEK consortium as well as Allegheny Branch American Society for Microbiology members.

This improved cyberinfrastructure for GCAT-SEEK allows the consortium to keep pace with the computational needs of its members and to continue to train future scientists and engineers.</p>\n<p>As an example of end-user improved capacity since the infrastructure and connectivity upgrades were put into place, the summer 2017 GCAT-SEEK workshop in Hampton Virginia permitted the two main breakout sessions to remotely connect to the Juniata genomics compute cluster with about 20 participants plus 5 instructors simultaneously. This marked improved access compares to limited support in prior years to only one main breakout session with about 10 participants plus instructors.

This will result in an increase in scientists able to generate, analyze, and interpret genomic data and will help pave the way toward a genomics-literate society.
