 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silicon based solar cells continue to dominate the solar-energy market, accounting for over 85 percent of all solar cell products in the world. The decrease in manufacturing cost of silicon solar cells is extremely important in order for solar-energy technology to be a viable alternative energy source. High-power lasers provide an attractive method to lower the cost of solar cell manufacturing. However, further research is required in order to make high-power laser-based processing viable for solar cell manufacturing and to be adapted by industry. This research focuses on scientific understanding of the high-power laser processes so that high solar cell performance can be achieved at reduced manufacturing cost. Research results will allow the solar industry to easily adapt laser-based processes for the manufacturing of high performance, low-cost solar cells. The growth of alternative energy sources will have an important impact on the society to meet its energy needs and will lower the nation?s dependence on foreign oil.\r\n\r\nA combined experimental and computational investigation will be carried out on the laser-induced defects generation during silicon solar cell fabrication processes and ways to mitigate their effect through control of laser process parameters. Technical objectives of the research include: experimental examination of laser-induced material modification and atomistic modeling of laser interactions with silicon substrate; control of defects through optimization of laser processing parameters such as laser beam profile, laser power, and laser repetition rate; and understanding the effect of post processing steps on defect recovery as well as on solar cell device performance. Education will be an integral part of the effort by involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. Research results will be included in the lectures on solar energy and photonics. Also, the Principal Investigators plan to develop an educational module in photovoltaics and laser applications area, which will target seniors and first-year graduate students. The goal will be to grow this activity further by involvement of teachers and students, as well as display of materials at Science Museum of Virginia and Charlottesville local library.",
