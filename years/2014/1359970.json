 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water quality is one of the world's most valued natural resources. Given recent and predicted changes in both climate (more frequent and intense droughts in some regions) and land use (agricultural intensification associated with increasing global demand for meat, dairy, and forestry products), it is important to understand how simultaneous changes in climate and land use affect water quality. For example, does agricultural intensification during a drought increase sediment runoff into rivers, and at what scales do these effects take place? This project will use remote sensing and computer visualization tools to analyze how interactions between shifting climate and land use affect river water quality across multiple interacting scales: from minutes to decades, and from small catchments to regional drainage basins. The proposed research will demonstrate how these cross-scale interactions affect a natural resource with multidimensional societal relevance: water treatment, recreation, safety, tourism, and ecosystem health. Findings from this research will inform emerging US data monitoring networks as to at which spatial and temporal scales water sampling should be conducted to capture interactions from climate and land use. Project results and data will be communicated to the public through various means, including open-access journals, a public website, and college/high school workshops. \r\n\r\nA fundamental question that this project will investigate is whether simultaneous shifts in climate and land use result in positive feedbacks and cascading events that lead to dramatic and widespread changes in river water quality. Previous studies have not been able to assess the effects of climate-land use interactions on river water quality over multiple spatial and temporal scales simultaneously due to (1) not having a toolkit that can analyze multiple dimensions and spatial-temporal scales simultaneously; (2) lack of resources (i.e., long-term and consistent water quality datasets with fine resolution); and (3) lack of technology (i.e., ability to capture land cover changes with fine spatial and temporal resolution). This project overcomes these limitations by using (1) a sophisticated set of visualization tools to analyze in combination; (2) one of the world's most comprehensive and extensive water quality datasets (25 years with corresponding climate data); and (3) a fused 8-day temporal resolution and 30-meter spatial resolution land cover dataset that has been developed for the entire country of New Zealand. Thus, this research will be the first time that the interactive effects of climate and land use changes on a suite of water quality variables will be assessed over multiple spatial-temporal scales simultaneously. Further, the application of sophisticated visual analysis tools to investigate landscape dynamics across multiple scales simultaneously could be the impetus for a new paradigm in Geography and Spatial Sciences.",

CSI occur when processes at one spatial or temporal scale interact with processes at finer or broader scales. In systems where CSI are connected, a change in an environmental driver such as climate or land use can result in positive feedbacks and cascading events that lead to dramatic and widespread changes in system dynamics. This project used sophisticated geospatial tools to analyze multi-resolution environmental datasets over multiple spatio-temporal scales to assess how CSI between changing climate and land use affect river water quality in New Zealand (NZ) from hours to decades, and from small catchments to regional drainage basins. Using MODIS BRDF-adjusted reflectance data (C6), we created a land disturbance dataset for NZ from the year 2000 to 2017 with 8-day temporal resolution and 463-m spatial resolution. This national-scale land disturbance dataset, the first of its kind, revealed that intense land uses such as livestock grazing and forest clear-cuts leave the land bare for considerable periods. When compared with one of the most comprehensive river water quality datasets in the world, we found that these intense land uses have led to excess sediment runoff and nutrient enrichment in almost half of NZ?s rivers. Over time, the CSI among climate, land use, and river water quality have led to nonlinear patterns where landscapes have switched from supply-limited to transport-limited in terms of sediment runoff. Nutrient runoff has been transport-limited (i.e., a function of rainfall frequency-magnitude-duration) for most impacted rivers. Due to best management practices (and possibly from the conversion of sheep farming to cattle farming), sediment concentrations have been declining in 34 of the 77 rivers we measured, while nitrogen concentrations have increased in 33 of 77 rivers. While clearer rivers are seen as an improvement in water quality; when combined with increasing nutrients, warmer water, and lower flows, the perfect recipe for toxic algae blooms is created, which has only recently been brought to the public?s attention. Our results indicate that this problem could worsen given the increasing trends we found in water temperatures, inorganic nutrients, and water clarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, our research demonstrated how short-term variations in land disturbance and land cover associated with intensive agriculture at local scales affect water quality over broad scales, a natural resource with multidimensional societal relevance, including water treatment, recreation, safety, tourism, and ecosystem health. We also showed with multi-resolution empirical data that broad-scale changes such as climate change can have effects on individual rivers, again through feedbacks and CSI. An essential element of this project was the international collaboration with leading NZ scientists. By combining resources, our interdisciplinary team provided a more comprehensive understanding of how intensive agricultural land uses such as plantation forestry and livestock grazing influence water quality in both NZ and USA. Moreover, findings from this research inform emerging USA data monitoring networks such as NEON and CUAHSI as to which spatio-temporal scales water sampling should be conducted to capture CSI from climate and land use change. Many and various groups of students benefited from this project, including 2 PhD graduates, 2 masters students, and numerous undergraduates (through research experiences and classroom instruction). This research was featured in 4 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals, one book section, 14 invited academic seminars at universities worldwide (including NZ, Sweden, and Armenia), and 26 professional conference presentations. An extension of the work was incorporated in an accepted paper to detect hurricane damage in the Caribbean, and methodology developed for this project will be used to develop a forest disturbance map in the Caucasus.
