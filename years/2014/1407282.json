 "awd_abstract_narration": "The practice of plastic surgery is built on a dual foundation of science and art. In planning reconstructive procedures for either trauma-induced or congenital deformities, the surgeon needs to consider aesthetics, anatomical function and post-operative health as deciding factors. The most important tool at the disposal of a plastic surgeon is the use of topology change as a medical remedy; in fact, most nontrivial repairs are designed as elaborate sequences of cutting, suturing, tissue rotation and transposition. Mastery of this intricate choreography of surgical manipulations is often the most distinguishing feature between an accomplished surgeon and a surgical resident with limited experience. Any opportunities that a surgeon in-training can leverage to develop this cognitive skill away from the operating room have great value in reducing the incidence of errors, minimizing post-operative complications and improving the quality-of-life for patients. Today, the computational capacity of modern multiprocessor systems suggests the strong possibility of computer simulation aiding in this training exercise. In addition, the vested interest on behalf of the visual computing community on functional modeling and simulation of virtual components of our physical world provides a wealth of numerical and algorithmic techniques that can be leveraged towards this goal. However, especially for plastic surgery, a number of challenges remain before cognitive training of plastic surgeons would become as computerized as pilot training on virtual flight simulators: the contributing communities of mathematics, computer engineering and clinical science need to develop a mechanism of intimate collaboration and communication, and the fruit of such collaborative development must become accessible to a broad base of clinicians as opposed to instances of segregated research groups with access to exotic computing resources. This interdisciplinary project seeks to generate an extensible, easy-to-deploy testbed of virtual plastic surgery simulation, tailored to facilitate intimate collaboration between computer scientists and clinical practitioners and provide a foundation for training plastic surgeons in delicate cognitive skills. The activities in this project combine the benefits of specialized, cost-effective parallel computing platforms with the ease of use of lightweight front-end clients, like tablets and mobile platforms, that can be deployed in private practices or training facilities of teaching hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this project are: (i) Defining and constructing a pipeline of algorithmic techniques and system components through which the capability of simulating the mechanics of deformable biological tissues at high resolution will be delivered as a network service to lightweight client platforms, (ii) Refining the analytic governing laws of nonlinear tissue, and leveraging them in a virtual computer-based simulation to assess, in a non-invasive manner, the viability of surgical designs and provide preliminary predictions for the outcome of procedures, (iii) Validate modeling assumptions, and improve the understanding of practical algorithmic needs by performing trial deployments of cognitive trainers for craniofacial repairs on actual users groups of surgical residents and seasoned experts, (iv) Provide a blueprint for delivery of computational dynamics as a cloud service for continuum mechanics applications, by investigating the role of network latency and bandwidth limitations and developing algorithmic remedies for balancing the needs of the software solution to facilitate remote delivery. The projected products of this activity will provide additional benefits to the curriculum of teaching health-oriented institutions, by providing easy and inexpensive access to virtual simulators for students in their early phases of study, without mandating exclusive use or local deployment of specialized parallel computing resources.",

Plastic surgery, in particular, stands apart from surgery at-large due to its focus on using tissue shape manipulation as a treatment mechanism in itself, rather than just an access path to internal anatomy. Fortunately, a few opportunities exist for surgeons to acquire and develop these skills outside of the operating room, including operating on physical proxies such as phantom materials and cadavers. The objective of this project was to increase access to computer-based skill training platforms, as more sustainable and less invasive alternatives to practicing on animal tissues or cadavers, while improving their accuracy and streamlining the experience of the user/learner that employs such a training platform. The development and deployment of such platforms carries significant technical challenges, as it needs to meet strong demands for accuracy, interactivity and visual quality. In addition given that computer-based surgical training is still an exploratory proposition, practical solutions need to be concerned with longevity, extensibility, deployment cost and ease of use. <br /><br />The core product of this research project has been an interactive virtual simulator of surgical reconstructions on the human scalp, and the associated ecosystem of algorithms, computer systems components, and models that support its operation. The user base targeted by this work has been trainee surgeons, and the application focus has been centered on creating virtual reenactments of surgical procedures that exercise cognitive, as opposed to dexterous, skills on the user of the system. The cognitive skills sought to sharpen via this interaction are associated with questions of whether a specific surgical maneuver is physically possible without exceeding the elastic stretch limit of the tissue, or whether a particular repair procedure will generate an aesthetically and functionally acceptable shape on the virtual patient. In addition to these functional traits of the developed surgical trainer, this computer-aided tool was built to be delivered to the terminals used by surgical residents as a web-based application, with a front-end fully hosted within a web-browser and requiring nothing but a simple web-enabled terminal or tablet; all of the computational burden is shifted to a specialized server, to which the training terminals interface via a network connection. As a proof-of-concept, a pilot deployment of this infrastructure conducted within residency program at the Division of Plastic Surgery in the University of Wisconsin-Madison, provided tangible evidence of the technical feasibility and usability. <br /><br />In addition to the integrative product reflected in the surgical simulator, this research produced an ensemble of technical contributions with individual merit and utility that transcends the narrow scope of the application that motivated these innovations. The project demonstrated a representation of the shape and dynamic state of tissue models under manipulation that leveraged uniform grids as an underlying data structure, even though topological features such as sutures and thin incisions posed obstacles to using stock uniform grid-based techniques for this purpose. This representation paved the way for aggressive performance optimizations and commensurate improvements in the speed of interactive simulation. A technique was developed to facilitate the efficient and robust handling of surfaces that collide during simulation, such as the two sides of a newly created incision. While performance overheads or robustness hazards were often associated with such scenarios in earlier formulations, due to the extremely small initial separation of the surfaces generated by a cut of the scalpel, the newly developed provided competitive performance along with robust behavior, while leveraging representations (uniform grids) that were concurrently facilitating efficient simulation of the motion dynamics of the deforming skin. Finally, the newly developed formulations for solving systems of equations associated with the governing laws of the simulated soft tissue included numerical algorithms that provide increased efficiency and scalability for a larger scope of problems in dynamic simulation. These techniques, which operated on the premise of balancing the load of arithmetic computations with the need to transfer data within the memory subsystem, enabled simulations of computational fluid dynamics (e.g. airflow in the human respiratory tract) on a single GPU-equipped server at resolutions that were previously only demonstrated on medium-scale clusters. The impact of these original techniques, captured in peer-reviewed publications and patent applications, is very likely to reach far beyond the driving application of surgical training, while also highlighting the merit of the latter as a forcing function for technical innovation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/13/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eftychios&nbsp;Sifakis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407282/1407282_10319058_1528926919452_CS_SurgerySim_1_web--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407282/1407282_10319058_1528926919452_CS_SurgerySim_1_web--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pilot deployment of surgical trainer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1407282/1407282_10319058_1528926919452_CS_SurgerySim_1_web--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pilot deployment of surgical trainer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Residents in the Division of Plastic Surgery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison interact with a proof-of-concept deployment of our surgical trainer, experimenting with the shape resulting from a given manipulation of a virtual patch of skin.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mitchell et al.
