 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal, NUE: Development of a Computational Curriculum for Undergraduates in NanoTechnology and NanoEngineering (NanoCompute)at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), under the direction of Dr. Andrea Tao, will be to develop a new focus within the nanoengineering curriculum that emphasizes computation, simulation, and modeling. Computation-based learning methods will be integrated into new and existing undergraduate courses in the NanoEngineering (NE) Department, starting with first-year engineering courses and culminating in a two-quarter capstone senior design course. The proposed NanoCompute curriculum is a novel approach to undergraduate education in nanotechnology because it will provide formal hands-on training in computation approaches that is fully integrated with the NE Department's four-year Bachelor of Science curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum for NanoCompute is expected to impact all undergraduates majoring in nanoengineering and chemical engineering at UCSD, which is estimated at 1000+ students over the next two years. NanoCompute will be implemented to meet the Engineering Science Program requirements as laid out by the Accreditation Board for Engineering Technology, and this proposal will develop new pedagogy in computational nanoengineering that we expect to impact all future degree programs in this area. There are currently no established criteria for accredited degree programs in nanoengineering or nanotechnology. To enable impact on a national level, the project team will develop a modular course format that is readily implemented by other academic institutions. As part of NanoCompute, there will be a focus on recruiting and retaining undergraduate students in the NE Department from underrepresented and underprivileged groups. The educational efforts of this proposal will seek to develop human resources in advanced technology, which is vital to economic growth in California and the U.S. as a whole.",
