 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Site \"Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives\" at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T) is an integrated 10-week summer undergraduate research program in electrical and computer engineering (ECE).  The focus of the research projects will reflect the strengths of the ECE department at SDSM&T, namely applied electromagnetics, autonomous/embedded systems, wireless communications and power.  The site is designed to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, particularly veterans and women as well as others underrepresented in ECE, to a research environment.  The recruitment goal is for veterans and women to comprise at least half of the participants with the intent of expanding the national engineering and science talent pool.  In light of evidence that students are motivated to learn when a broader context for the research is established, the students will engage in professional development, research, and historical development seminars on an ongoing basis as well as in collegial activities to foster an appreciation for the historical development and current applications of ECE and the role they play in improving communications and lives.  The weekly professional development activities will feature a strong emphasis on technical communications led by the Communications Coordinator (an English professor) that develop the skills needed to pursue higher level work.  Also, a comprehensive assessment program will be implemented by the Assessment Coordinator to quantitatively assess student gains in skills related to research, the impact of the program on students from differing backgrounds, and their long-term development as professionals.  Further, the students will engage in outreach activities to secondary students, particularly those of underrepresented groups, as well as to active duty service members and veterans.  \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Site \"Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives\" at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM&T) is designed to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, particularly women and veterans as well as others underrepresented in electrical and computer engineering (ECE), to a research environment and help them develop as professionals with the intent of expanding the national engineering and science talent pool. The research projects deal with topics related to improving communications and the lives of people which are of vital importance in our global society as well as in the economic and defense interests of the nation.  These projects led to the unifying theme of the site \"Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives.\"  In addition to hands-on research, the students will engage in professional development, research, and historical development seminars. The purpose of the seminars is to develop the skills needed to pursue higher level work, as well as to foster an appreciation for the historical development and current applications of ECE and the role they play in improving communications and lives.  Further, the students will engage in outreach activities to secondary students, particularly those of underrepresented groups, as well as to active duty service members and veterans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR).\"",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe main objective of the REU Site Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives was to spur the interest of undergraduate students for pursuing careers, especially related to research, in engineering or science. Moreover, the goal is to encourage and prepare them to pursue graduate degrees and conduct research in these areas. This objective was met by increasing student abilities with tools that make them competitive in a research environment, namely, technical communication skills, appreciation for diversity, understanding of historical context, and most importantly, understanding of the research process.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe focus of the research projects reflected the interests of the faculty of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM&T), namely applied electromagnetics, autonomous/embedded systems, wireless communications, and power. In the area of applied electromagnetics, there is a particular interest in printed (direct-write) electronics fabrication of antennas and devices for application in the microwave/RF frequency bands. This research involves developing and testing materials suitable for printed (direct-write) electronics fabrication, and has led to strong cross-disciplinary ties with the Materials and Metallurgical Engineering Department and Nanoscience and Nanoengineering program. In the area of power, research included renewable-energy topics such as the control of wind turbines and hydrogen fuel cells using hydrogen generated by power from wind turbines. In the areas of autonomous/embedded systems and wireless communications, there were research projects on a low-cost teleprescence system and affordable ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance  Broadcast used for aircraft navigation) among others.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the primary focus is on the research experiences, to help develop student research abilities, weekly professional development activities were held in addition to work on research projects. A key development activity was a strong technical communications training program led by the Communications Coordinator; this provided the students with the tools to make them competitive in research environments and attractive to graduate programs and research faculty. To provide context and focus to this training, the students participated in a statewide professional conference which included poster sessions where they presented their research results. Other professional development activities include seminars on research and historical development, as conveyed by REU site title, the role that electrical and computer engineering have played in developing the technologies that improve how people communicate and live is presented to the students. Further activities and presentations included graduate school research, success habits, and career management. Also, the REU students participated in other activities, e.g., field trips, meant to foster collegiality and context for the research.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a major goal of this program was to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Two key student populations were targeted for recruitment- women and veterans. Specifically, the goal was that at least half of the REU site student participants will fall into these targeted groups. In addition, a goal was set to recruit at least half the students from primarily undergraduate institutions or institutions with limited research opportunities. In summary, this REU site funded/served 24 students. This included 6 veterans and 7 women thus meeting the goal of at least 50% from these underrepresented groups. Additionally, we had two participants were from other underrepresented groups- Hispanic and Asian. With regard to our additional goal recruiting students from primarily undergraduate institutions or institutions with limited research opportunities, we had 17 of the 24 students from institutions which fit one or both of these descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research undertook by participants in the REU Site: Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives produced 6 conference/journal publications for faculty mentors as well as 22 conference posters by the REU student participants. The REU student participants hailed from 11 different majors, 12 different home institutions, and 14 states.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ThomasPMontoya\n"
