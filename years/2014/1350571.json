 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between anemonefish (clownfish) and sea anemones is one of the most widely recognized examples of symbiosis. A defining characteristic enabling this interaction is that the fish can swim unharmed among the stinging tentacles of the sea anemone. Despite over 50 years of research, the physiological adaptations enabling this interaction remain a mystery. What is known is that the protection involves the mucous coat of the fish and that sea anemones detect prey by sensing sugar chains that are attached to proteins through a process called glycosylation. The current study will investigate this question from two angles. First, to identify potential physiological mechanisms protecting the fish, mucous glycosylation patterns will be compared between non-symbiotic fish species and several species that have independently evolved interactions with sea anemones. The researchers will then test the effects of these glycosylation patterns on stinging responses of sea anemones. Second, the researchers will investigate the ability of anemonefish to gain protection from sea anemones that are initially hostile. High-throughput methods will compare naive and associating anemonefish to determine if they regulate gene expression, protein expression, or mucous glycosylation during acclimation to a sea anemone. This project also integrates the above research goals with education and outreach approaches tailored to UMass Dartmouth and the surrounding community. UMass Dartmouth is a predominantly undergraduate-serving institution, and over 50% of its undergraduates are first generation college students. An open-ended classroom research experience is being developed to reinforce genetics concepts taught in lecture through molecular laboratory investigations of genes related to the anemonefish-sea anemone symbiosis. In addition, three graduate students and ten undergraduate researchers will be trained on the project. Finally, the researchers are partnering with the New Bedford Ocean Explorium to develop education opportunities and teacher training workshops to enhance regional K-12 science education.",
