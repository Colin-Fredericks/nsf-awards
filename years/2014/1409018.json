 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear dispersive wave equations model a variety of phenomena in fluid mechanics, plasma physics, turbulence, and optics. Analyzing and simulating such equations numerically allows us to make predictions pertaining to the corresponding application. For example, it would be desirable to address the following questions arising in applications: Will signals in optical devices, used for the transmission and storage of data, be stable, or how is energy transferred in turbulent systems?  This project will advance our knowledge in two ways.  First, it will seek to prove, in a mathematically rigorous sense, properties of the equations, an example of which is the stability of optical pulses.  Second, it will develop and justify numerical algorithms for simulating the equations on computers.  Systematic analysis of the algorithms ensures that the computer simulations truly reflect the equations.  Finally, both the analysis and simulation of the equations will determine the regime of validity of these equations as models for the physical applications.  A supplemental benefit of this research is that the numerical algorithms it develops will be applicable to a broad class of equations and physical problems. \r\n \r\nThe equations under investigation in this project are of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger type, including the derivative nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.  Major analytical questions this work will address include the existence and stability of singular solutions and nonlinear bound states.  These problems will be addressed through asymptotic analysis, variational methods, and spectral theory.  Singularity formation will also be investigated through simulation, using adaptive meshing methodology, such as iterative grid redistribution.  Numerical algorithms for simulating the time dependent problems will be implemented by operator splitting methods, treating the nonlinear and linear dispersive parts of the equation separately.  This numerical analysis will be pursued with the intention of constructing efficient energy preserving methods suitable for long time simulation.  An algorithm for computing nonlinear bound states will be studied in a semi-discrete form, so as to be insensitive to spatial discretization.  The bound state algorithms will assist in the construction of initial conditions, which can then be studied using the time dependent algorithms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNonlinear dispersive wave equations can be used to model a variety of natural phenomenon including optics, fluid mechanics, geophysics, and plasma physics.  A richer understanding of these equations can provide additional insight into the physical problem they describe, and computer simulation of the equations can allow us to predict physical behavior.  Important questions that can be addressed include:\n\nDo the equations have solutions for arbitrary data?\nDo the equations have any kind of special solution?\nAre special solutions stable?\nAre the special solutions indicative of anything in nature?\n\n\nOne sort of special solution that is of particular interest in the case of nonlinear dispersive waves are solitary wave solutions, spatially localized pulses which tend to retain their shape as the equation evolves in time and can exhibit particle like behavior.  Solitary waves can transmit mass, energy, and information, depending on the sort of physical problem under consideration, and serve as an elementary unit in the study of pattern formation.\n\nAnother important special solution is that which leads to a singularity, the tendency of some aspect of the solution, such as the amplitude, to tend to infinity.  Singularity formation is of interest not because such an infinity will appear in the physical problem, but rather because it indicates that the equation is ceasing to be a relevant model for the physical problem &ndash; additional physics will need to be incorporated into the equation.\n\nAs nonlinear dispersive wave equations cannot be solved by elementary arithmetic operations, we must rely on computers to produce approximations of the solutions.  Such approximations typically take the form of a series of successive approximations, each a refinement on the predecessor.  This begs the question of how such approximations are produced &ndash; what is the numerical algorithm and what are its properties?  Indeed, fundamental questions here are:\n\nIs it clear that there is a way to tune the algorithm so as to produce arbitrarily accurate approximations that will converge to the true solution?\nHow efficient is the algorithm?\nCan the algorithm be made more efficient?\n\n\nHaving robust numerical methods available then provides insight into the properties of the equations by allowing us to simulate solitary waves and singularity formation.\n\nKey outcomes of this project addressed all of these points on a variety of equations.  This included studies of the well-posedness and potential for singularity formation in derivative nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equations, which are known to model particular problems in optics and plasma physics.  The well-posedness result ensures the existence of solutions, while the singularity study provided systematic evidence that the equations do tend to infinity, in a sense, as they evolve in time.  Again, this latter point suggests additional physics may need to be included.  Well-posedness results were also established for a class of equations used to model partially molten rock in the Earth?s interior, known as the magma equations.  The existence of solitary wave solutions, long suggested by numerical simulations, was also established.  These solitary wave solutions may play a role large scale geophysical process.  In another problem, on the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation which appears in plasma physics, we were able to establish that some of its solitary waves were, in fact, stable to perturbation.  Rigorous numerical methods were also studied and developed both for computing solitary waves and studying a related problem in weak turbulence. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gideon Simpson"
