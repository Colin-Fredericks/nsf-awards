 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the University of Montana (UM) is improving undergraduate and graduate mathematics education by providing a learning environment that gives students the financial means, professional guidance, and community support they need to pursue degrees in the mathematical sciences. In addition the project seeks to develop a diverse student body whose composition reflects that of the state of Montana. Many students at UM are first-generation college students; many more face financial challenges. Thus, the largest part of the budget provides scholarships; however, scholarships are not enough so the project is creating pathways to draw students from all segments of the population into the mathematical disciplines and strengthen existing support structures so that, once on campus, these students can thrive and go on to challenging careers in technical areas of national need.\r\n\r\nBecause Native Americans form the largest minority group in the state, the project draws this population into the discipline by partnering with seven tribal community colleges on the reservation and three public community colleges in Montana. The project is extending the Missoula Math Circle to rural communities through video conferencing. The project provides two-year scholarships for talented, financially-needy undergraduate students; and provides fellowships for graduate mathematics majors who demonstrate financial need. Research opportunities, professional development, extensive mentoring, and peer and faculty mentoring are central to all levels of the program.  Since the mathematical sciences are foundational to all technical disciplines, improved access to high-quality mathematics programs holds promise to improve the learning and research environments in other STEM fields, as the pool of students with excellent quantitative ability becomes larger and more diverse at all levels.",
