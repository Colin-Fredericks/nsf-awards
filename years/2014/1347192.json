 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 1-year, collaborative proposal is aimed at creating a community solution for tectonic velocities throughout the East African region.  This region hosts the foremost example of continental rifting, where Africa stretches and splits into a two pieces, Somalia and Nubia in the East African Rift and beyond.  Observations of the speed and pattern of continental break-up serve as a framework for other geosciences research on continental rifting, including in volcanology, petrology, geochemistry, and solid earth-climate interactions.  They also offer the possibility of general results for the material properties of continents and the basic physics of how plates are formed, move, and change.  Beyond the science, mapping patterns of surface deformation in East Africa informs earthquake and volcano hazard assessments and development of geothermal energy and water resources.  A final contribution of this project is to foster data sharing and community model building among academic institutions throughout the U.S. and East Africa. \r\n\r\nSpecific initiatives we propose include: 1) formally combine GPS results from all available prior studies, along with any other available GPS data in the region for a fully self-consistent, continent-scale solution and to identify future needs and data acquisition strategies, 2) maintain existing geodetic assets developed over the past 6 years to extend GPS time series to reduce rate uncertainties, 3) extend or establish agreements (Memoranda of Understanding) with host-country partners (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, and Malawi) for future joint initiatives, 4) measure a first epoch on nine campaign GPS sites in the Turkana Depression, and 5) develop a framework for data sharing and data product development to serve the broader African Rift scientific community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes: Active kinematics of lithospheric extension along the East African Rift\n\n \n\nThe purpose of this project was to generate a broad-scale and consistent surface velocity solution for East Africa.  East Africa hosts the East African Rift, a structure accommodating the slow separation of Somalia from Nubia by plate tectonics.  Although the East African Rift is a single tectonic boundary, it has almost always been studied in smaller segments.  In particular, scientific GPS studies separately measure the stretching and separation across segments of the rift, such as in Ethiopia or in Kenya and Tanzania.  By combining these regional studies into a single product, we can see the continent-scale deformation patterns.  For example, the style and spatial distribution of rifting is easier to compare between rift segments if the velocity observations are part of a single solution.  Other scientists studying other aspects of rifting, such as the time evolution of volcanism, the structure of the crust, or the balance of forces on tectonic plates can also combine their work within the common velocity framework.\n\n \n\nTwo specific activities were included in developing the community solution.  First, the research team identified and collected all available GPS observations from the entire Rift and then, using standard processing methods, combined them for velocities.  Second, the research team made a small number of new observations in the Turkana Depression of northern Kenya, a region of scientific interest with no prior measurements.  Both efforts not only required specific scientific activities; they also required building strong scientific collaborations for data collection and sharing among a large number of research groups and academic organizations.  These partnerships, spanning Africa, Europe, and North America, provide a foundation just as important as the community velocity solution itself for future scientific collaboration and interdisciplinary integration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca O Bendick"
