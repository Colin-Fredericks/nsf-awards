 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program  in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael C. Leopold at the University of Richmond, is investigating materials and strategies for the development of clinically relevant sensors that incorporate nanomaterials.  As a component within sensors, networks of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) elicit improved performance, including enhanced sensitivity and response time.  Nanomaterials enable miniaturization of sensing devices, allowing advances to be directly applied to needle electrodes - a sensor geometry amenable to implantable or bedside devices.   Greater understanding of NP networks within sensing schemes, allow for the formulation of sensor design strategies targeting molecules that serve as diagnostic markers in emergency room and maternity ward settings, where real time, continuous monitoring would be most beneficial.  Biosensing schemes with NP networks that detect lactic and uric acid, compounds linked to diagnosis/monitoring of serious medical conditions, sepsis and pregnancy-induced hypertension, respectively, are a focus.  This award is also supporting full immersion undergraduate research mentoring and a continuing outreach partnership with the Math Science Innovation Center to introduce nanotechnology to teachers and students of grades 6-12.       \r\n\r\nThis research seeks to identify and understand critical structure-function relationships within amperometric biosensor schemes that incorporate metallic nanoparticles (NPs), establishing greater understanding of the NP's mechanistic role. First generation, xerogel-based amperometric glucose biosensors serve as model systems that feature composite xerogel/enzyme films embedded with a network of alkanethiolate-protected gold NPs or monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs).  Each component of the film, from MPC surface chemistry to the xerogel's silane precursor, is systematically examined to elucidate both the NPs and xerogel structural role in the sensing mechanism.  Those findings prompt rational design of NP-assisted biosensing schemes at \"needle\" or wire electrode geometries with potential in-vitro or in-vivo capability that are also selective for clinically relevant and chemically diverse species.",

The broader impact of the funding were primarily focused on providing intensive and transformative research experiences to undergraduates in order to inspire and train the next generation of scientists and physicians.  Funding from the NSF has allowed for us to make a significant impact in both the lives of a significant number of students as well as advancing the field toward the realization of these diagnostic sensors.    \n\n \n         Biosensors are sensor designs that utilize enzymes to attain selectivity - the ability to detect a targeted molecule within a matrix of many other molecules.
