 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science rarely has the opportunity to study a new language that is in the process of emerging de novo; the study of certain signed languages has provided this opportunity. The emergence of a new language may be crucially dependent on children, as suggested by research on Nicaraguan Sign Language. This project investigates deaf and hearing children who are acquiring -- and perhaps developing -- a young sign language, Chatino Sign Language, that has spontaneously emerged out of a constellation of home sign systems in an indigenous Mesoamerican community. \r\n\r\nWorking under the supervision of Dr. Richard P. Meier and Dr. Angela Nonaka, doctoral student Lynn Hou will conduct ethnographic fieldwork in two neighboring Chatino villages, San Juan Quiahije and Cieneguilla, in the Sierra Madre mountains of southwestern Oaxaca in Mexico. Ms. Hou will examine the language-learning environments of four deaf children of hearing families and four hearing children of mixed deaf-hearing families through a three-pronged methodology that combines language acquisition and language socialization approaches: (1) videotaped, longitudinal participant observation of linguistic, communicative, and interactive practices between children and their families as they go about their daily lives; (2) semi-structured lexical elicitation tasks using culturally appropriate visual stimuli; and (3) extended interviews about the families' beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge about child-rearing, language and cognitive development, deafness, signed and spoken languages, and education. Qualitative and quantitative analyses will describe each child's language-learning environment to show what kind of input the child is receiving and the context in which the input is embedded, and what output the child is producing. Furthermore, analyses will compare the lexical variation within and between the families in order to ascertain whether there is a shared lexicon across these families. \r\n\r\nThis is the first study of an emergent sign language that will pay close attention to naturalistic observations of children and their interactants (whether children or adults). Studying deaf and hearing children's use and acquisition of Chatino Sign Language will shed new insight on how communicative practices in a rural signing community can facilitate the emergence and maintenance of a new sign language.",

However, new sign languages emerge in two circumstances: (1) when many deaf children enter a new school and begin interacting with each other regularly; and (2) when deaf children are born into an extended family in a village and interact with one another and/or their families regularly.</p>\n<p>Such phenomena have prompted scholars to ask: How do new sign languages and signing communities emerge? How are they transmitted to children? What do sign languages look like in their first generation, and how do they change over subsequent generations of users?</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to investigate these questions by studying an emerging sign language and signing community in the San Juan Quiahije (SJQ) municipality in Oaxaca, Mexico. The municipality consists of two neighboring villages, Quiahije and Cieneguilla, inhabited by an indigenous Mesoamerican group called the Chatinos. They speak a Zapotecan language, San Juan Quiahije Chatino. The population of the SJQ municipality is 3,628, including 11 deaf people. The interactions between the deaf people and their families and other community members have led to the creation of San Juan Quiahije Chatino Sign Language (SJQCSL).</p>\n<p>My going to SJQ was no accident. When I entered University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) for graduate school in linguistics, I met two sisters, Drs. Emiliana and Hilaria Cruz, then graduate students at UT Austin. They were born and raised in Cieneguilla, and had a few deaf people in their extended family. They invited me to visit their community. My colleague, Kate Mesh, and I initiated a pilot study in summer 2012. We collected spontaneous and elicited video-recordings of deaf and hearing signers. Our pilot study was unique because I am deaf and Kate is hearing; we thus had different experiences and perspectives about our fieldwork. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For my dissertation project, I spent one year in the field from 2014 - 2015. &nbsp;My project has three significant findings. The first is that the SJQ signing community is primarily based on the social institution of <em>family. </em>There are six signing families, split evenly into two types. The first type consists of deaf children of hearing parents. The second consists of hearing children of one deaf parent and one hearing parent. The social lives of the Chatinos are organized around their families. Deaf people do not seek out other deaf people and do not have meaningful bonds with one another based on their deafness. However, they encounter each other in the center of the town, at community events, and when traveling on the road. I hypothesized that the creation of their sign language mainly occurs within each family and is transmitted to the children within the family.</p>\n<p>The second finding is that the families&rsquo; vocabularies exhibit some variation. Since deaf people mainly interact with individuals whom they consider family, it is no surprise that SJQCSL has variation. The families&rsquo; signs in the semantic domains of tools and foods are similar, as in the case of &lsquo;scissors&rsquo; in Figs. 1 &ndash; 2. However, their signs for animals are more distinctive; Figs. 3 - 4 show different signs for &lsquo;cat&rsquo;. Fig. 4 is also a conventional gesture for small mammals that is used by hearing, non-signing Chatinos. There appear to be more varied iconic bases for signs for animals, as compared to signs for tools and foods.</p>\n<p>The third finding is that there are differences in the language ecologies of individual signing families. In the SJQ community, adults do not directly address their children in dyadic conversations; they do not change their language to accommodate their children&rsquo;s perceived language skills. Children are socialized to learn language by observing how adults use it. Deaf and hearing children learn to sign from watching adults sign and from signing with each other.</p>\n<p>The creation of a new sign language seems to be more robust in families where <em>both</em> deaf and hearing adults sign to each other; these adults serve as language models for their children. One family that best exemplifies this profile exhibits more innovation in their grammar. The family incorporates pointing gestures into some transitive verbs that &ldquo;link&rdquo; the subject and the object. Figs. 5&mdash;6 show a demonstration of YOU-GIVE-ME, with the verb starting at the spatial location of the actor and ending at that of the recipient.</p>\n<p>SJQCSL is a unique case study that will inform our growing understanding of how new sign languages and signing communities form. SJQCSL offers some clues for what happens when new sign language emerges among different extended families within one community: how sign language lexicons and grammars emerge, and how the role of language socialization factors in the process of language emergence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified
