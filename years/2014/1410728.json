 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxy clusters are the most overdense environments in the universe. As such, they constitute an extreme laboratory for studying the physical processes that govern cosmological mass assembly and the formation and evolution of galaxies. This award will enable a pioneering study of galaxy clusters when the universe was approximately 3 billion years old, using valuable legacy datasets and new observations that harness the power of ground-based telescopes (e.g., the Gemini and Keck Observatories) together with space-based facilities (e.g., the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory).\r\n\r\nBy emphasizing the close connections between observations and theory, this work will provide a cornerstone for understanding how galaxies in rich clusters assemble their stars. It will also provide critical tests of cosmological structure formation models, and give fresh insights into how inflows and outflows of gas vary with environment in the distant universe. Ultimately, this research will lead to a better understanding of when, where, and how star formation is quenched in cluster galaxies as they evolve into the passive galaxies that dominate clusters in the nearby universe.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator and her team will also conduct two pilot programs aimed at increasing diversity in the science fields. First, the team will produce an original video series, entitled \"I Am Science,\" which seeks to inspire students by sharing the personal stories of scientists from all backgrounds. Second, they will integrate \"I Am Science\" into the curriculum of the Expanding Your Horizons program at Texas A&M, in order to bring these inspiring stories to 6th to 8th grade girls.",
