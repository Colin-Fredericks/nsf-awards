 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project applies earthquake modeling and seismic wavefield simulations to a new seismic data acquisition in order to characterize a major, yet unknown, fault zone within one of the most active intraplate regions of North America. Located 700 km north of the Alaska-Aleutian trench, the Nenana basin is a 7 km deep, active sedimentary basin aligned with the 200 km long Minto Flats seismic zone. The seismic zone contains the highest concentration of deep (>15 km) crustal seismicity in central Alaska. Two deep events include a 2012 triggered earthquake with a 24 s nucleation phase, and also a 1995 Mw 6.0 earthquake that ruptured a small portion of the fault zone and strongly shook the region. The three-dimensional fault zone structure and the relationship between the active sedimentary basin and the sub-basin faulting are unknown, in part because no seismic station has ever been deployed in this remote region. The Tanana river provides access for a strategic 12-station deployment targeting the fault zone. Seismic waveforms from local earthquakes will be used to develop a catalog of accurate earthquake locations. A new moment tensor catalog for local events will characterize the style of faulting. Seismic wavefield simulations of earthquakes within the fault zone will be used to explore the influences of fault complexity, earthquake ruptures, and basin structure on the regional seismic wavefield. Modeling of the seismic data will help determine whether the anomalously deep crustal seismicity is related to overlying basin formation, to underlying slab-driven processes, or to laterally driven processes.\r\n\r\nThe seismic waveforms collected during this experiment will be the first ever recorded in this active tectonic region, and they will provide a valuable resource for future geophysical studies in central Alaska. Characterization of the Minto Flats fault zone will provide fundamental constraints on the competing tectonic models for basin formation and deformation within central Alaska. The project has a substantial education component that includes high school students from Nenana, as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Field-based teaching modules, classroom-based teaching modules, and annual field trips to science exhibits in Fairbanks will engage Nenana high school students in earthquake science and active tectonics of Alaska.",

Sedimentary basins, including those in Los Angles, Seattle, Tokyo, Mexico City, and many other metropolitan regions, strongly influence the strength and duration of shaking that occurs during local earthquakes. By studying sedimentary basins, it is possible to better understand the strength of ground motion during future large earthquakes. Nenana basin in the Minto Flats region of central Alaska provides a natural laboratory for studying the effects of ground motion from local earthquakes and from low-level continuous background motion known as 'ambient noise.' The primary challenge to this endeavor is that there had never been a seismic station installed in the region, so the influence of Nenana basin was previously unknown. The core component of this project was the deployment of 13 seismometers in the Minto Flats region between 2015 and 2019. Eight of these stations were deployed via boat down the Tanana River, which offered the most natural access within this roadless region. The project (and set of stations) was named FLATS for Fault Locations and Alaska Tectonics from Seismicity, after the objectives to use newly recorded data to obtain a better understanding of the earthquake-generating faults in the region.</p>\n<p><br />Despite the challenges of extreme cold, winter darkness (which inhibits solar power), dynamic river conditions (which resulted in reinstalling some stations), and vandalism from bears, the FLATS seismic stations recorded 98% of the 4-year time period. All of these data were immediately and openly available to the world, thanks to collaboration with the Alaska Earthquake Center. The FLATS data enabled three significant scientific discoveries. The first was the presence of unusual earthquake events occurring in the faults below Minto Flats; one of these events included a nucleation signal that offered insights on how earthquakes begin, a topic that has been elusive in seismology. The second discovery was that the continuous low-level ground motion in the region originated from rivers, wind, and, in some cases, human influences. The third discovery was that Nenana basin has a profound influence on amplifying ground motion, and it is possible to determine how the basin would respond to ground motions from nearby large earthquakes.</p>\n<p><br />The project's scientific pursuits offered a natural connection with the region's indigenous people, whose ancestors have lived on the lands for thousands of years. Project scientists from Fairbanks visited schools in both Minto and Nenana to discuss earthquake science with the students. A group of students from Nenana High School, which serves Native students throughout Alaska, visited University of Alaska Fairbanks each fall for a Science Day that included tours of the Permafrost Tunnel, the Alaska Earthquake Center, and exploration of the campus. In collaboration with the UAF Museum of the North, the project established a special museum exhibit called shAKe Alaska that focused on the history of large earthquakes in central Alaska, including previously undocumented stories from Native Elders, such as for the 1947 magnitude-7 Healy earthquake. After the special exhibit finished its one-year run in 2019, the content was crafted into a virtual museum exhibit (essentially an interactive website), the first to be offered by the Museum of the North.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/11/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carl&nbsp;H&nbsp;Tape</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1352668/1352668_10287912_1668150541692_F6TP_20150903_KyleSmith--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1352668/1352668_10287912_1668150541692_F6TP_20150903_KyleSmith--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kyle Smith with F6TP seismic sensor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1352668/1352668_10287912_1668150541692_F6TP_20150903_KyleSmith--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Smith with F6TP seismic sensor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UAF PhD student Kyle Smith, installing F6TP on September 3, 2015.
