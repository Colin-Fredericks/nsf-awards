 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER Project Abstract: The Impact of Expanded Health Insurance Coverage\r\n\r\nWhile the impact of expanded health insurance coverage has long been of interest to economists, the passage of the Massachusetts health reform in 2006 and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 has brought health reform to the forefront of public discourse. Health spending comprises a growing portion of the U.S. economy, approaching 18% of GDP. At the same time, millions of Americans lack health insurance. These two realities motivate interest in three related projects. The goal of the first project is to characterize the evolution of nonelderly medical expenditures to inform insurance design; the goal of the second project is to examine the long term impact of Medicaid on health and labor market outcomes; and the goal of the third project is to measure the returns to intensive Medicare spending using variation across physicians. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Each project advances the frontier of knowledge by using a different data source that provides a rare level of detail.  Part of the intellectual merit in the use of these data lies in data preparation -- developing processes to access the data, cleaning them, and deriving stylized facts from them. Further intellectual merit lies in the development and execution of simple theory and econometric methods that do not obscure the richness of the data.    \r\nProject 1 uses data on almost all hospital visits in the state of New York from 1982 to 2009 linked to mortality records.  These data include longitudinal patient identifiers, allowing detailed characterization of the evolution of medical expenditures for nonelderly individuals, especially those with high expenditures, mortality, and likelihood of insurance denial.  Project 2 uses data on all federal tax returns filed from 1996 to 2009.  These data permit analysis of the long term impact of Medicaid eligibility on employment, earnings, and education.  Project 3 uses data on 100% of hospital inpatient Medicare claims between 1991 and 2010 linked to American Medical Association data on physicians.  These data can be used to evaluate treatment and outcomes for all doctors who treat Medicare patients.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Building on a wide range of data, the research projects and education plan will aid in a greater understanding of the complexities of the health insurance market and its value in society. \r\nThe objective of this research agenda is to advance the field of health economics by finding empirical answers to key policy questions.  An equal priority will be making these answers accessible to other researchers, students, and the health policy community.",

A major outcome is a publication in the Review of Economic Studies, entitled \"Long-Term Impacts of Childhood Medicaid Expansions on Outcomes in Adulthood,\" joint with David Brown and Ithai Lurie.  This publication is one of the first to use administrative tax records for health economics research, allowing us to examine the impact of Medicaid expansions during childhood on a wide variety of outcomes in adulthood for the population of children eligible for Medicaid.  A key finding is that because children eligible for Medicaid pay more taxes as adults, the government recoups a large portion of its investment in childhood Medicaid.  This finding has received attention in the popular press, nationally as well as locally, especially as states have considered whether to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act.  As a related outcome, we have released a Medicaid calculator, which other researchers can use to determine Medicaid eligibility across states and over time.  The award has also supported work on the value of health insurance over time and the marginal returns to medical spending.  These projects have produced insights regarding insurance design and medical spending that can help future researchers and policymakers to design effective policies.
