 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics and physical sciences.  The Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future.  This fellowship to Eliot Miller supports research and training to incorporate species interactions in species distribution models.  The host institution is the University of Idaho; sponsoring scientists are Drs. Luke Harmon and Scott Nuismer.  Training goals include gaining skills to incorporate currently unexploited mathematics-like network theory into species distribution models.  Educational outreach consists of mentoring and training undergraduate students at the University of Idaho.  A citizen science component includes building a large database of quantitative natural history data to inform the models.\r\n  \r\nCurrent species distribution models use environmental variables to predict where a species occurs but do not incorporate information on the presence or absence of other species with which the focal species might interact. Clear cases exist where one species determines the occurrence of another species but, on a broad scale, there is no general consensus on whether species shape one another's distributions, which has been called the 'Eltonian noise hypothesis.'  Incorporating species interactions into species distribution models takes advantage of quantitative natural history data to calculate pairwise niche overlaps of interacting species.  Two software products emerge from the project, one designed to incorporate species interactions into species distribution models, the other designed to elucidate dominance hierarchies among a group of interacting species.  Implementing such models requires both biological and mathematical knowledge; they offer a strong means of testing the Eltonian noise hypothesis.  Incorporation of species interactions into existing models is needed to forecast community assembly and disassembly in the face of environmental change.",

For example, we wanted to know whether if species A competes with and is socially dominant to species B on a local scale, that results in its impingement of the geographic distribution of species B on a larger, continental scale. We approached this question from a variety of angles, and found preliminary support for the idea. A variety of exciting research avenues presented themselves during our work, and we will first discuss these, then summarize our preliminary support for the hypothesis that species interactions shape their geographic distributions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first research foray of the project was directed at discovering which phylogenetic community structure measures are best suited to detecting non-random community assembly patterns. A wide variety of measures have been developed that quantify the relatedness of co-occurring species as compared with expectations of random community assembly. However, as we showed (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016. Ecography), many are redundant, and an even smaller subset performs well statistically. We offered best practice recommendations for using these measures, and produced a software package for the statistical software R that formalizes our research approach (metricTester, freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second research foray of the project was a citizen science project aimed at collecting species interaction data at bird feeders around North America. While many researchers are interested in species interactions, direct field measurements of how species interact are limited in number and in distribution across time and space. Partnering with citizen scientists is a potentially fruitful way of overcoming this deficit. Thus, in this aspect of the project, we explored to what degree citizen scientists can effectively collect species interactions. We collaborated with the NSF Arbor project (DEB 1208912), with Project FeederWatch of Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and with the citizen scientists of Project FeederWatch to examine this question. Pleased with the quality and quantity of data submitted by the citizen scientists, we explored to what degree we were able to predict the direction of these interspecific species interactions. We found that body mass largely explained which species was dominant (aggressive towards another) in a given interaction, but that there were other, lineage-specific factors that mattered as well. Woodpeckers, for instance, were found to be more dominant than expected based on their body mass (Fig. 1). We also developed ways of summarizing the complex set of interactions submitted by citizen scientists (Fig. 2) into a linear dominance hierarchy (Fig. 3). These methods will be formalized in a software package for release in 2017. The fellow presented the results of this project at the North American Ornithological Conference in Washington, D.C. in August 2016, and a manuscript from the work will be submitted for publication within two months. We were pleased that the interaction project was so well received by participants of Project FeederWatch that it has been permanently incorporated into this 30-year citizen science effort; the species interaction database is poised to become an important long-term, freely available dataset. One scientific goal of this aspect of the interactions project was to develop a network-based set of predictions that could be used to test the question of whether species shape one another&rsquo;s distributions in predictable ways.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our preliminary test of whether local interspecific interactions shape species&rsquo; geographic distributions, we focused on the honeyeaters, a group of Australian birds well-known to the fellow. We honed in on a set of close relatives that the fellow knew from previous fieldwork to be close competitors with consistent dominance relationships. We fit species distribution models to all the Australian honeyeaters, reconstructed ancestral climate niches, then determined whether subordinate species had been shifted away from these reconstructed climate niches in predictable ways. We found strong statistical support for the notion that socially dominant species have pushed subordinate species towards peripheral climate space. The fellow presented the results of this preliminary work at the Evolution conference in Austin, Texas in July 2016. Based on this preliminary support, we have been scaling the approach up from the 75 species of Australian honeyeaters to a much broader sample&mdash;2,470 species of birds, or approximately 25% of the worlds bird diversity&mdash;to test whether these evolutionary processes appear to have been broadly applicable to the generation and spatial distribution of the globe&rsquo;s biodiversity.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eliot&nbsp;T&nbsp;Miller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1402506/1402506_10331071_1482524627585_outcomesReportfig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1402506/1402506_10331071_1482524627585_outcomesReportfig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
