 "awd_abstract_narration": "The view that the upper mantle is universally non-magnetic because it lacks ferromagnetic minerals and would be too hot to carry a magnetic remanence needs to be revisited because converging evidence suggests that some magnetic sources reside at mantle depths. This situation occurs in cold geotherm settings. We propose to carefully measure the magnetic properties of mantle xenoliths using new collections of fresh mantle rocks. The magnetic measurements will be supported by thorough petrologic investigations and by experiments in piston cylinders replicating the rapid ascent of mantle rocks to the Earth surface. The results these investigations will most likely transform the interpretation of data returned by the Swarm mission, deployed in November 2013, which will provide an unprecedented resolution of the lithospheric magnetic field.\r\n\r\nOur understanding of the internal structure of the Earth relies on geophysical approaches including for example seismology, gravimetry and magnetism. The magnetic field at the Earth's surface informs us about temperature at depth because below the Curie depth, minerals become too hot to be magnetic. Up to now, we thought that mantle rocks, at depths of about 30 kilometers, did not carry any magnetic minerals, an assumption based on measurements made in the 1980?s. The proposed research will re-evaluate this non-magnetic mantle concept and provide a far more accurate knowledge base to interpret magnetic satellite data. The information deduced from magnetic satellites provides vital information on regions of the globe where tectonic plates collide and create abundant seismicity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs commercial and military institutions looks to develop alternative navigational systems to global positioning systems satellites, whose function can be compromised by solar storms and by forms of human-made electromagnetic noise, maps of local variations in the Earth\u00c6s magnetic field will play an increasingly important strategic role.  Understanding the source of localized magnetic field variations is therefore essential in developing this resource.  Further, as new high-resolution magnetic data become available from the European Space Agency\u00c6s SWARM satellite mission, it will be important to understand the exact sources of magnetization in the Earth\u00c6s crust and mantle. The goal of this grant was to determine if the uppermost portion of the Earth\u00c6s mantle could contribute to long wavelength magnetic anomalies.  Our best view into the mantle is via samples of mantle rock called \"xenoliths\" that are incorporated into magmatic systems associated with active volcanoes and carried to the surface during eruptions.  This grant allowed researchers from the University of Minnesota (UMN) and Southern Illinois University, Carbondale (SIUC) to collaborate and measure the magnetic properties of a wide survey of mantle xenoliths from around the globe from different tectonic environments.  We found that there are measurable quantities of magnetic minerals in mantle rocks, and that when these magnetic properties are incorporated into models of the thermal structure of the crust and mantle (how temperature varies with depth), that there are certain tectonic environments where the mantle can plausibly contribute to magnetic anomalies as observed by aircraft and satellites.  Regions with depressed geotherms (where there is comparatively little increase in temperature with depth), such as subduction zones, are particularly likely to show magnetic contributions from the uppermost mantle.\n\n \n\nIn addition to sponsoring a new collaborative relationship between UMN and SIUC, this grant also helped provide training and mentoring experience for three female doctoral students in geophysical methods and electron microscopy.
