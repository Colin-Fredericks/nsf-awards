 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a screening method to reliably identify binding agents that can be used to target drugs to specific tissues or cell types.  Targeting drugs can increase their effectiveness and reduce their side effects, thus it is important to develop methods that can screen for binding agents that can be used to enhance drugs that would otherwise have systemic activity.  Existing methods do not attempt to replicate the environment in which binding agents are used, therefore agents that appear promising in the lab often fail in the clinic.  The screening method incorporates a nano-scale drug carrier (i.e., nanocarrier) into the screening process, so that binding agents attached to it that perform well during screening can be expected to perform well in practice.  A reliable drug targeting system of the type proposed could have enormous commercial value. Some analysts believe nanocarriers will account for 40% of a $136 billion nanotechnology-enabled drug delivery market by 2021.  Because the benefits of targeted drug delivery over equivalent non-targeted systems are expected to be substantial, targeted nanocarriers are expected to account for most of this vast market.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR project aims to produce a targeted drug delivery system that is a first-of-its-kind in situ target ligand screening procedure.  Targeted drug delivery is one of the most promising strategies for optimizing drug efficacy with minimal side effects, but current screening techniques for identifying highly specific targeting ligands suffer two drawbacks: (1) they only detect individual, high-affinity binding ligands (whereas well-organized, controllable, multiple, low-affinity/high-affinity binding ligands used in plurality are thought to provide the optimal specificity and inhibition); and (2) the manner in which they present ligands during screening in no way approximates the way ligands are presented in a targeted drug formulation, which leads to a high failure rate. The method developed in this project remedies these issues by (a) producing a screening library that employs precisely controlled nanocarriers, each type decorated with a unique collection of identical targeting ligands, and (b) employing as a targeted delivery vehicle or inhibitor, the nanocarrier with the optimal preferential binding affinity for a given target as identified during screening.  This is the first method for developing a targeted nanocarrier that employs this type of in situ ligand screening.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Parabon NanoLabs (PNL) demonstrated the feasibility of the Panatar&trade; Targeting System (Panatar).  Panatar (a name derived from \"panning and targeting\") is a reliable de novo screening process for developing compounds that can target specific tissues, cells, viruses, or proteins with superior specificity.  Panatar employs a new screening method to identify optimal multivalent targeting ligands for a given target.  Importantly, it uses the same molecular nanocarrier construct during screening as that used in targeted end products, such as drugs that target specific cancer cells.\n\n \nFor years, scientists have believed monovalent DNA aptamers, a particular type of targeting ligand, could serve as effective substitutes for antibodies, which are the most common type of targeting agent in use today.  However, the scientific literature would suggest the promise of DNA aptamers has fallen short.  It is our belief that the binding properties of a single aptamer molecule is not truly competitive with the multiple binding capability of antibodies.  We believe this deficit can be addressed by using multiple copies of aptamers, but this may only work optimally when multiple copies of the target ligand are well organized with respect to their relative address and orientation.\n\n \nIn the SBIR Phase I studies, PNL successfully developed such a multi-aptamer targeting compound for prostate cancer cells using the Panatar screening method.  In particular, the research team (1) developed protocols to screen for individual DNA aptamers, with capillary electrophoresis (CE) and next-generation-sequencing (NGS) methods; (2) produced a small library of distinct Panatar binding complexes for the PSMA surface protein of prostate cancer cells,  each of which carries multiple, identical and uniquely identifying aptamers selected as candidates for collective PSMA binding; and (3) screened the complexes for the most effective PSMA binding complex and demonstrated the superior binding efficacy of the top candidate. \n\n \n\nThese Phase I results provide an important departure from traditional single-aptamer screening methodologies. Instead a plurality of aptamer ligands were organized on a Panatar binding complex. The results will pave the way for PNL\u00c6s future research. The targeting capabilities from Panatar will have many medical applications. For example, if a Panatar complex can bind specifically to a particular virus with Panatar-derived targeting ligands, the complex could be used for the diagnosis or even treatment of a viral infection.  Similarly, using Panatar targeting ligands, a vaccine \u00e6cocktail\u00c6 could be formulated as a combination of compounds, each targeted to a specific type of immune cell, so as to allow \"engineering\" of an optimal immune response. Additionally, antibiotics could be targeted to specific microbe receptors in a multi-dosing strategy to deliver multiple types of payloads to combat drug resistant pathogens.  Beyond these medical applications, Panatar has the potential to revolutionize applications via target ligand screening in a variety of fields, ranging from agriculture to environmental disaster recovery.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hong Zhong"
