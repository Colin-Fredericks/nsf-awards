This will provide travel fellowships to twenty U.S. early career crystallographers to attend the XXIII IUCr Congress in Montreal, Canada, on August 5-12, 2014.  The Young Observers will share their research internationally during 2014, the United Nations (UN)-declared International Year of Crystallography.  The USNC/Cr Young Observers program will pursue the following objectives:  1) support early career U.S. crystallographers in sharing their research at the 2014 IUCr Congress, 2) provide opportunities for interaction between U.S. early career scientists and leading crystallographers, 3) provide a mentoring experience to every fellowship recipient, 4) expose the awardees to new areas of crystallography research, 5) expose the awardees to the field of science policy, 6) build a network of early career and senior U.S. crystallographers, and 7) foster international collaborations between U.S. crystallographers and their international peers.  The fellowship program will enable some early career scientists who might not otherwise be able to attend the Congress to do so through a unique program.",

Funding for this travel award program was received from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the grant CHE 1419806. \n\nThe travel awardees were able to share their research at the Congress, have a one-on-one mentoring experience, participate in the reception to celebrate the International Year of Crystallography in the Americas, observe the IUCr General Assembly, and participate in the U.S. booth. \n\nThe following objectives were pursued and reached:  1) support early career U.S. crystallographers in sharing their research at the 2014 IUCr Congress, 2) provide opportunities for interaction between U.S. early career scientists and leading crystallographers, 3) provide a mentoring experience to every fellow, 4) expose the fellows to new areas of crystallography research, 5) expose the fellows to the field of science policy, 6) build a network of early career and senior U.S. crystallographers, and 7) foster international collaborations between U.S. crystallographers and their international peers. \n\nThe intellectual merit of the USNC/Cr Young Observers program is to facilitate the participation of early career U.S. scientists to the IUCr Congress, enabling them to be part of the largest meeting for crystallographers in the world.  The U.S. early career crystallographers shared their latest research with international crystallographers, and were exposed to new ideas, research, and experiences, thereby getting an opportunity to establish international collaborations.  In addition, the fellows were exposed to the policy aspects of their field and learned how major decisions that affect their field are made.\n\nBy exposing early career U.S. researchers to the international scientific arena, this program had a significant and broader impact.  The Committee improved the diversity of the program participants by placing a special emphasis on outreach to underrepresented groups in this field.  The Committee ensured that the opportunity was widely announced by advertising it in the USNC/Cr website and through a number of professional societies, including the American Crystallographic Association (ACA). \n\n \n\nOverall, all the expected outcomes in the grant were attained:\n\n- Increased the number of U.S. early career crystallographers sharing their research with other international peers.  Nineteen travel fellowships were awarded in 2014; five more than in 2011. The diversity of the fellows has also increased. \n\n- Increased the number of interactions between early and senior career U.S. crystallographers at the IUCr Congress.  In this occasion, the cohort had the chance to participate in the U.S. booth.  Some of them volunteered with their mentors to optimize their time and increase their interactions.  \n\n- Prior to the Congress, every fellow was matched with a U.S. senior crystallographer.  In this occasion, the mentors selected their mentees. \n\n- Increased the level of knowledge on a diverse set of crystallography topics, some of which are not often included in crystallography meetings held in the United States.  All the program participants agreed the Congress exposed them to new areas or topics of research. \n\n- The Young Observers had the opportunity to see situations of disagreement among international experts, and also the politics of a scientific Union.  The U.S. early careers had a unique experience since they observed Marvin Hackert from University of Texas, Austin getting elected president of the Union. \n\n- Built a network of early career and senior U.S. crystallographers by creating a LinkedIn group where mentor..."
