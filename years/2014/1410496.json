 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical: The goal of this project is to better understand the electronic and optical properties of thin sheets of materials with thickness in the range of a few atomic layers.  These properties have practical applications in solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and a wide variety of sensors.  A multidisciplinary approach is used to obtain a more complete picture necessary to use these materials in these applications.  This research involves undergraduate students trained on a wide variety of techniques that involve electronics, optics and chemistry.  Such an environment results in well-rounded students ready for careers in either industry or academia.  The University of Northern Iowa provides an excellent opportunity for this project to have a positive impact on elementary, middle, and high school students from diverse backgrounds throughout Iowa and surrounding states.  Regular contact with high school science teachers allows faculty research activities and student opportunities to be showcased directly.  Such efforts encourage students to explore careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical: The goal of this project is to develop a more thorough understanding of the electronic and optical properties of a wide variety of finite layer dichalcogenide molecular sheets.  Ultrasonic agitation is used to break apart these layered crystals from the bulk into thin nano-sheets.  Those sheets with the smallest number of layers are separated using a centrifuge and studied using scanning tunneling microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and ballistic electron emission microscopy.  Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements serve to study topological features as well as surface electrical properties on the atomic scale.  This includes the zero resistance characteristics associated with charge density waves in two-dimensional dichalcogenides sheets.  Raman and photoluminescence complement the electrical measurements made using the localized probe of the scanning tunneling microscope, providing global information on electronic band structure and vibrational properties.  Transport measurements are achieved by injecting electrons into these structures using ballistic electron emission microscopy, allowing characterization of electron scattering as a function of temperature and energy.  Together, these combined data will enable a more complete understanding of reduced dimensionality on the electronic properties in a wide variety of material systems.  More importantly, broadening the research focus of this field to a more diverse array of layered materials will enhance our understanding of the fundamental physics in two-dimensional systems.  Modifications of current theories to encompass a wider variety of layered materials leads to more robust theoretical models, essential to device design.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA multidisciplinary approach was used to study the electrical and optical properties of thin sheets of materials with thicknesses in the range of a few atomic layers.  Twenty-four students were involved in this project and the results have been published in 22 refereed journal articles.   Faculty and students contributed 32 conferences presentations at the regional and national level.   Below, we briefly discuss the key results achieved with this support.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWe investigated the interactions between stacks of single atomic layer sheets as a function of the type of material and their relative orientation.  These interactions can be used to tune their overall electrical and optical properties with practical applications in solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and a wide variety of sensors.  Injection of electrical current into thin molecular sheets was studied.  Certain voltages were found to be more efficient than other voltages.  This information could be used to increase efficiency in certain electronic devices.  We showed it was possible to move individual carbon molecules located between the molecular layers of a superconducting material with nanometer scale precision.   Because the carbon molecules disrupt the superconducting properties, this ability could potentially be used to build quantum computers.  We also discovered a method to grow atomically flat gold films on certain layered materials.  This method has the potential to grow atomically flat gold over larger areas than can currently be achieved.  Atomically flat gold is often used as the foundation to grow a wide variety of self-assembled monolayers used in nanotechnology devices such as various biological sensors. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nWe have worked to increase the interest in the physical sciences in a number of ways.  The annual statewide High School Physics Competition is held here at the University of Northern Iowa.  This provided us with the opportunity to give lab tours and highlight undergraduate research activities to dozens of high school students with potential interest in a career in the sciences.  Lab tours were also provided to those interested in science and engineering fields when the university hosted career opportunity field trips for students from local high schools and middle schools.  Dr. Stollenwerk and several of his students visited local high school physics classes to talk about our research.\n\nIn addition to our outreach efforts, this project involved 20 undergraduate students, three students as they transitioned from undergraduate to graduate school, and one high school student.  This includes five women, two non-traditional students, one African American, and two high school physics-teaching majors.  Each student received training on a wide variety of electrical, optical, and chemical techniques.
