This will improve Noyce program effectiveness throughout the 15 states of the Midwest region. The project goal will be accomplished through facilitating an annual conference in 2014 and 2015 and a suite of year-round networking opportunities for conference participants that are designed to accomplish four objectives: 1) increase the personal connections among Midwest Noyce project members; 2) utilize these new and/or strengthened connections to share expertise and knowledge across Midwest Noyce projects; 3) support the professional development of Noyce Scholars; and 4) build a community of practice among Noyce scholars. The two conferences - which will be held in Omaha, Nebraska October 2-3, 2014 and October 1-2, 2015 - will continue a 2009 to 2012 tradition of bringing together 250 Noyce investigators, pre-service and in-service Noyce Scholars, school district personnel, and project evaluation and assessment experts from the 62 active Noyce projects in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin so that they may benefit from each others? experiences. Year-round networking and learning activities (e.g., online community, webinars, and workshops) will provide additional opportunities for Noyce personnel and Noyce Scholars to continuously learn from each other. As evidenced by the title, the theme that will unite this two-year project is Building Communities of Practice.",

Prior to the first two conferences, we worked with our evaluator to conduct a needs assessment among Midwest Noyce personnel, to better craft the conferences to meet the needs of our target audience. Throughout the conferences, a focus on equity/diversity was a common thread, to help Noyce teachers better engage all students in math/science teaching and learning.&nbsp;In 2014 and 2015, the conferences were in October of the year, and held in Omaha, Nebraska. In 2016, the conference was held in June in Titusville, Florida, at the Kennedy Space Center. The two Omaha conferences featured nationally-known plenary speakers, a &ldquo;voices from the field&rdquo; panel, concurrent breakout sessions by Noyce PIs, evaluators, and Scholars, a poster session, and other networking opportunities. A highlight in 2014 was the panel on cultural competency, featuring Noyce Scholars from Eastern Michigan University, most of whom were currently student teaching. The panel was able to talk from personal experience about power, identity, stereotype threat, and teaching with cultural competency. A highlight in 2015 was the plenary presentation by Dr. Roni Ellington, <em>Regaining STEAM in STEM Education through Transcending Boundaries: A Transformative Framework for Educating ALL Students. </em>Dr. Ellington is a dynamic and engaging speaker who was able to connect with the audience around issues related to effective teaching in high-need schools through building relationships with students. A highlight in 2016 was the plenary presentation and Q&amp;A time with astronaut Sam Durrance.</p>\n<p>Along with the major conferences, Noyce Connections planned to host local conferences (&ldquo;drive-in workshops&rdquo;) and webinars.
