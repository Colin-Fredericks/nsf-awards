 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project from the University of New Hampshire focuses on a \"living bridge\", which exemplifies the future of smart, sustainable, user-centered transportation infrastructure. Bridges deliver such a fundamental service to society that they are often taken for granted. Typically, bridges only stir the public's interest when they must unexpectedly be replaced at great cost, or, worse, fail. The Living Bridge project will create a self-diagnosing, self-reporting \"smart bridge\" powered by a local renewable energy source, tidal energy, by transforming the landmark Memorial Bridge--a vertical lift bridge over the tidal Piscataqua River, with pedestrian access connecting Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Kittery, Maine--into a living laboratory for researchers, engineers, scientists, and the community at large. The Living Bridge will engage innovators in sensor and renewable energy technology by creating an incubator platform on a working bridge, from which researchers can field test and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of emerging technologies. The Living Bridge will also serve as a community platform to educate citizens about innovations occurring at the site and in the region, and about how incorporating renewable energy into bridge design can lead to a sustainable transportation infrastructure with impact far beyond the region. \r\n\r\nSustainable, smart bridges are key elements in developing a successful infrastructure system. To advance the state of smart service systems and clean energy conversion, this project team will design and deploy a structural and environmental monitoring system that provides information for bridge condition assessment, traffic management, and environmental stewardship; advances renewable energy technology application; and excites the general public about bridge innovations. This PFI:BIC project is enabled through partnerships between academic researchers with expertise in structural, mechanical and ocean engineering, sensing technology and social science; small businesses with expertise in instrumentation, data acquisition, tidal energy conversion; and state agencies with bridge design expertise. The Living Bridge technical areas are structural health monitoring, tidal energy conversion with fluid-structure interaction measurements, estuarine environmental monitoring, and outreach communication. Sensors will be used to calibrate a three-dimensional analytical structural finite element model of the bridge. The predicted structural response from this model will assess the measured structural response of the bridge as acceptable or not. Instruments installed on the turbine deployment platform will measure the spatio-temporal structure of the turbulent inflow and modified wake flow downstream of the turbine. Resulting data will include turbine performance and loads for use in fluid-structure interaction models. Deployed environmental sensors will measure estuarine water quality; wildlife deterrent sensors will deter fish from the turbine. Hydrophones and video cameras will be used before and during turbine deployment to monitor environmental changes due to turbine presence. Outreach efforts will make bridge data, history, and information about new systems accessible and understandable to the public and K-12 educators, facilitated by an information kiosk installed at the bridge. Public awareness will be assessed with survey methods used in the N.H. Granite State Poll. \r\n\r\nThe lead institution is the University of New Hampshire (UNH) with its departments of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Sociology, and the Center for Ocean Engineering. Primary industrial partners are a large business, MacArtney Underwater Technology Group, Inc. (Houston, TX); and a small business, Lite Enterprises, Inc. (Nashua, NH).  Broader context partners are New Hampshire Department of Transportation, NH Fish & Game Department, NH Port Authority, NH Coastal Program, City of Portsmouth (NH), Sustainable Portsmouth (nonprofit), Maine Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard, Archer/Western (Canton, MA, large business), Parsons-Brinkerhoff (Manchester, NH, large business), UNH Tech Camp, UNH Infrastructure and Climate Network, UNH Leitzel Center for Mathematics, Science and Engineering Education, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Changing Places (a joint Architecture and Media Laboratory Consortium, in Cambridge, MA).",

It was re-deployed with the tidal turbine installed in October 2018. The TDP remained deployed at the bridge pier continuously for three years and two months, from October 2018 to December 2021. This the longest continuous deployment of a tidal energy conversion system in the U.S. to date. During this time, the turbine was eventually connected to the bridge grid via a grid-following inverter and the instrumentation for performance, load and environmental was continually upgraded.</p>\n<p>The US Department of Energy has recognized the value that the Memorial Bridge provides as a tidal energy sites for testing of tidal turbines at the 2-3 m scale.

T\n\nThe acoustic emissions from the tidal turbine were  found to be below ambient sound levels and therefore did not have a significant impact on the underwater noise levels of the project site.\n\nGoal 3: Design of modular tidal turbine system with structural and environmental monitoring instrumentation; deployment of the tidal energy conversion system at the Memorial Bridge\n\n \n\nThe design of instrument mounts for the wildlife deterrent system, underwater cameras, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), were fabricated with assistance and deployed at the bridge in June 2017.  The instrument mounts were used with various instruments as they collected estuarine data (ADCPs, CTD+, ADV).\n\nThe TDP was deployed at the bridge pier with instruments for over four months in 2007. It was re-deployed with the tidal turbine installed in October 2018. The TDP remained deployed at the bridge pier continuously for three years and two months, from October 2018 to December 2021. This the longest continuous deployment of a tidal energy conversion system in the U.S. to date. During this time, the turbine was eventually connected to the bridge grid via a grid-following inverter and the instrumentation for performance, load and environmental was continually upgraded.\n\nThe US Department of Energy has recognized the value that the Memorial Bridge provides as a tidal energy sites for testing of tidal turbines at the 2-3 m scale. Under a new DOE-funded \"Atlantic Marine Energy Center\" (AMEC), the Memorial Bridge site will be developed as an accredited test site using the existing infrastructure and upgraded instrumentation for testing under Marine Energy Standards developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC TC-114).\n\nGoal 4: Integrating technologies which enable the Living Bridge to communicate information related to bridge performance and estuarine dynamics to the \u2018citizen-scientist/engineer\u2019\n\nWebsite\n\nA website has been developed (www.livingbridge.unh.edu) to serve as one of the main portals to communicate bridge information to the local community and \"citizen-scientist/engineer\".  Interactive 3D models for users to view and explore the bridge\u2019s structural layout and the turbine deployment platform.\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nRandom-sample telephone surveys (1,500 interviews) explored New Hampshire residents\u2019 perceptions about transportation infrastructure, and support for highway maintenance and environmental protection. Majorities are unaware many road and bridge conditions are worsening, but do support more spending on public transportation, and a limited increase in the gas tax.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erin Bell"
