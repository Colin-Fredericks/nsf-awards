 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund studies to obtain and analyze observations of gas and dust that are found in flattened disks around some stars.  These disks are called debris disks and represent the end stage of circumstellar disk evolution, with stellar ages corresponding to the epoch when giant planets in our solar system were newly formed.  The investigators will use the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array), SMA (Submillimeter Array) and CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimter-wave Astronomy) telescopes and obtain spectra of three bright, nearby, edge-on debris disks that contain higher amounts of gas than is predicted by most models of planet formation.  Their data will be used to test whether this gas is more likely to be primordial or produced from evaporating comets.   The data will also be used measure the dynamical state of the debris disks, which will provide information about collisional velocities in the disk, which will be useful for constraining disk models and for detecting the presence of Neptune-mass planets in the disks.   The principal investigator will buld a new protected infrastructure at Van Vleck Observatory, which is designed to accommodate demand from the surrounding community to learn about astronomical research.  They will also incorporate public-level research talks by students and faculty, and hands-on astronomy explorations with the larger goal of increasing scientific literacy of the community members.\r\n\r\n This project will provide critical tests of the leading planet-formation models of our solar system and other planetary systems.  Spatially resolved interferometric spectra of multiple gas lines and continuum emission will be obtained and analyzed from dust in three disk systems that have the dust properties of optically thin debris disks, yet retain substantial reservoirs of molecular gas detectable at millimeter wavelengths: 49 Ceti, HD 21997, and HD 14159.  They will measure the total mass in each system, estimate its lifetime, and measure the basic chemical composition of each disks through multi-transition analysis of gas lines. In particular, they will observe multiple CO and HCN rotational lines, along with continuum bands. The data will also be used to test collisional evolution models, measure the velocity dispersion and the mass of largest bodies stirring the planetesimal population in the disks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDebris disks are hallmarks of mature planetary systems like our own, and are analogous to the dust generated by our own Solar System?s Kuiper Belt.  This project used observations of the debris disks around nearby stars to study the properties of mature planetary systems.  There were two related approaches that we took.  The first was to study the dispersal of molecular gas within debris disks.  While it has generally been assumed that molecular gas should have dispersed prior to the debris disk stage, recent observations have demonstrated the presence of gas in surprising quantities within some debris disks.  We studied the properties of this gas using several different techniques, ultimately contributing to an emerging picture in which some gas-bearing debris disks appear to be generated by the same secondary processes that generate their dust, for example the sublimation of icy comet-like bodies in scaled-up versions of our own Kuiper Belt.  However, we also showed that some systems are not well explained by second-generation processes, indicating that in some cases gas persists longer than previously thought, which makes it more likely that giant planet formation can occur farther into the lifetime of the star.  The other approach that we used to understand the properties of these mature planetary systems was to study the vertical structure of edge-on debris disks as a way of investigating the prevalence of Uranus and Neptune analogs in a nearby debris disk.  Since planets with the mass and separation of Uranus and Neptune are not currently observable around other stars given the limitations of our current planet-searching techniques, our observations provide the first insight into the commonality of this particular aspect of our Solar System.  Using observations of dust in the debris disk around a nearby star, we demonstrated that there were no planets more massive than 1.8 times the mass of the Earth at radii of ~40au, similar to the separation between Neptune and the Sun in our own Solar System.  By extending these observations across the radio spectrum, we also showed that the collisional velocities between dust grains in this debris disk are much lower than typically assumed, which implies that at least in some systems new theoretical approaches will be needed to connect the amount of observed dust with the physics of the collisions that generates the dust. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the scientific research described above, the project also involved revamping the public outreach program at Wesleyan University?s Van Vleck Observatory.  With more than a thousand visitors per year, and given its location in the heart of a city with one of the lowest median income levels in the state of Connecticut, the observatory?s outreach program serves an important role in encouraging scientific engagement among the general public.  The PI successfully converted the outreach program from an occasional, weather-dependent volunteer telescope viewing activity to a far more consistent and content-rich \"rain or shine\" series of public outreach events designed for both adults and children.  The weekly \"Space Nights\" aimed at adults have involved a ~30-minute presentation on some aspect of space research and exploration given by our astronomy majors, masters students, and faculty, followed by telescope viewing when clear.  Twice-monthly \"Kids? Nights\" aimed at elementary school-age children have involved brief presentations followed by a series of hands-on activities (including observing as weather permits) designed to expose children to the excitement of space.  To support these efforts, the PI revised the curriculum of the existing \"Astronomical Pedagogy\" seminar to train students in presentation and public outreach skills, alternating every other year between preparing students to present scientific information to the general public and to children.  In the \"Kid\" years, the curriculum was organized around our portable planetarium, which we then transported to local public schools.  Students in the course gave presentations to every sixth grader in the city of Middletown, CT, as well as one of the five K-5 elementary schools.  As part of improving communication between our observatory outreach program and the public, the PI created and now maintains a Facebook page with 195 followers as well as an email list with more than 500 addresses. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/08/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meredith Hughes"
