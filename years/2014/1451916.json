 "awd_abstract_narration": "A picture is worth a thousand words; this is especially true during emergencies where images and video can provide better awareness than simple text.   By exploiting community broadband infrastructure and by extending an existing emergency management system to allow for emergency personnel to transmit crisis related information in the form of sensors, photos, and video streams across local, regional, and federal emergency management and law enforcement agencies, this project expands the ability to respond to emergencies.  It also recognizes that communication outages are one of the most broadly shared characteristic of all disasters.  The failure of communication infrastructure creates serious situational awareness gaps for emergency managers that can lead to preventable loss of life, property damage, and serious economic impacts.  The project utilizes advanced networking technology in the form of Software Defined Networking (SDN) to address communication failures.\r\n\r\nThe project builds upon the Next Generation Incident Command System (NICS) - a system developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory with support from DHS S&T.  The NICS platform provides a collaborative situational awareness platform for (1) First responders in the field to report data to incident commanders in near real-time, and (2) Emergency managers and first responders to share map-based situational awareness in near real-time. NICS was designed to operate on low-bandwidth networks and does not support sharing video among users - which is essential to get an accurate assessment of picture on the ground.  This project extends NICS so that it leverages the existing ultra-fast networks available in US Ignite communities.   It builds a situational awareness platform that provides the ability to view and share multiple high-resolution videos, images and documents, and provides reliable network connectivity by using Software Defined Networking technology to reroute traffic in the event of network problems.",

During crisis situations, networks are unreliable and communication channels are typically oversubscribed - especially as multiple people try to use limited communication channels. Live video streaming on these networks makes things worse in terms of not being able to prioritize mission critical video whether it is shared by first responders or the general public. Existing commercial live video streaming solutions and protocols are designed to work well when the underlying communication infrastructure is both reliable and predictable. The overall goal of the NSF funded project \"<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EAGER: US IGNITE: A Virtual Crisis Information Sharing and Situational Awareness Platform for Collaborative Disaster Response</span></em>\"&nbsp;was to both investigate how failures and network oversubscription affect video-based crisis information sharing, and develop methods to improve fault-tolerance for low latency live video streaming.</p>\n<p>The project effort accomplished the following objectives: First, the project team studied how different network failures, failure durations, and network channel oversubscription affects the performance of live video streams. Second, the project team developed fault-tolerance, scheduling, and buffering techniques to improve live streaming performance in the presence of failures and network oversubscription. These techniques were evaluated and implemented on a video-based information sharing platform called CrisisEye<sup>TM</sup> that supports streaming of live video streams from multiple sources (i.e., the mobile phone, field) to the incident commander over a Software-Defined Network (SDN).</p>\n<p>Finally, the project was demonstrated to various stakeholders including researchers at international conferences, various city and state representatives, and industry.

The project was presented in three US Ignite conferences (2016, 2017, and 2018). In 2016, the project was demonstrated as part of the NextGen BEOC presentation on stage and received an award as the app that is \"Most Likely to Have a Big Impact\".
