SOPAC activities include the collection archiving and dissemination of some 800 GPS stations worldwide that are not currently available through the UNAVCO archive.  In addition SOPAC provides daily GPS satellite orbit corrections as Global Analysis Center for the International Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Network that benefit geodetic studies worldwide through improved reference frame determinations.  SOPAC activities also support non-academic users requiring precise (real-time and post-processed) positioning and reference system data including government agencies, the commercial sector, and local, state, federal, and international agencies (e.g., surveying, GIS, agriculture, intelligent transportation, engineering infrastructure).  \r\n\r\n***",
