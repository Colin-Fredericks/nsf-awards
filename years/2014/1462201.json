 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitriles are used extensively in the production of specialty chemicals like the polyamide nylon.  Nitrile hydratases (NHases) catalyze the hydration of nitriles to amides at ambient temperatures in neutral water.  The currently employed industrial conditions for the hydration of nitriles to amides use either strong acids or bases, and are often incompatible with the sensitive structures of the compounds to be produced. NHases have therefore attracted substantial interest as biocatalysts in preparative organic chemistry.  Despite the industrial importance of NHase enzymes, the details of how they work remain poorly understood.  The objective of this research proposal is to fill this knowledge gap.  The interdisciplinary nature of the effort will serve as a platform to increase the participation of women and classically underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students in scientific careers in biophysics, chemistry, and biochemistry.  As part of the proposed project, both PI's will participate in the SMART program that mentors Milwaukee area public high school students in research projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Drs. Richard C. Holz and Brian Bennett from Marquette University to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of NHase enzymes.  An interdisciplinary approach will be used that will incorporate kinetics, spectroscopy, biochemistry, computational chemistry, and both X-ray and neutron crystallography.  The proposed experimental approach is designed to address three key questions:  i) What is the transition-state structure of nitrile hydration?  ii) What are the protonation states of catalytically important species throughout the reaction? and iii) What controls metallocenter assembly in a purported eukaryotic NHase?  The successful completion of this research will greatly benefit society by facilitating the intelligent design and manufacture of nitrile-based chiral pharmaceuticals and industrially important specialty chemicals, with enhanced synthetic flexibility and lower environmental impact, than at present.  \r\n",

Some of the nitrile targets (\"substrates\") are also environmentally toxic compounds, yet some of the products may be valuable intermediates for the polymer and pharmaceutical industries. The reaction can be carried out chemically but requires energy as heat, uses costly and environmentally unfriendly solvents, produces toxic waste, and provides an impure product contaminated by additional undesired byproducts. Most importantly, the chemical reaction does not specify whether the \"right-handed\" or \"left-handed\" form (the \"stereoisomers\") of the moleculular product is formed, and a mixture of both is the usual outcome. The consequences can be tragic if the nominally inactive stereoisomer of a therapeutic drug is found to exhibit unexpected biological activities of its own; such a mechanism has been implicated for the birth defects caused by the anti-morning sickness drug thalidomide. In contrast to the chemical process, the biological molecule, NHase, carries out the reaction with 100 % fidelity, does it in water rather than solvents, does it at ambient temperature and requires no heat, and produces no toxic waste or byproduct. Because of these characteristics, NHase can also be used to reclaim land contaminated with nitrile pesticides. Therefore, we wish to understand how NHase carries out these reactions in order to be able to design catalysts, or engineer new biomolecules, to expand the range of substrates amenable to bioreaction for pharmaceutical intermediate synthesis and for pollution reclamation.</p>\n<p>Our work over the last few years has provided much information on how the reaction proceeds. We know that (i) an organic part of NHase first recognizes the substrate and orients it so that the reaction will ultimately be specific; (ii) the cyanide group on the nitrile is bound to an active site iron atom; (iii) a nearby modified natural amino acid (a cysteine-sulfenic acid, which terminates in an -SOH group), that is also bound to the metal via the S sulfur atom, attacks the bound substrate via its terminal -OH group, now forming a ring that includes the iron, the sulfur, the oxygen, the cyanide carbon of the substrate, and the cyanide nitrogen [Fe-S-O-C-N-(Fe)] (<em>see the <strong>figure </strong>for the crystal structure of a stable analog</em>).
