 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear astrophysics is the application of nuclear physics knowledge obtained from laboratory studies to the universe and its contents.  This is essential for understanding how the chemical elements are produced, the ways stars are powered, what causes exploding stars called supernovae, the origin of cosmic rays, and more.  A key research frontier is based on using neutrinos, subatomic particles that have no electric charge and very little mass, and which barely interact with matter.  This makes neutrinos hard to detect, but allows them to escape from and thus reveal physical conditions in the deep interiors of astrophysical objects.  The unique information they carry will help resolve longstanding questions in nuclear astrophysics.  Research is needed to further develop detection techniques and to draw conclusions from the data.  There is high demand for students and postdocs trained in this research area.  The topics covered, which also include black holes, dark matter, and the universe itself, capture the imagination of the public and attract young people to explore careers in science. \r\n\r\nThis project is intended to lead to significant gains in our understanding of astrophysical objects and neutrinos themselves.  The knowledge of theoretical physics and astrophysics will be applied to help lead to new detections of astrophysical neutrinos and to develop new understandings from that data.  A central focus of this project is on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, the cosmic flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by the explosions of massive stars over the past several billion years.  This flux has not been detected yet, but it is within reach, and careful work is needed to help isolate this faint signal.  Related topics include detecting other astrophysical neutrino sources, the nature of supernovae, and the properties of neutrinos.  Junior scientists supported by the grant will be mentored in the full range of skills needed to be successful in their future careers.  To maximize broader impacts, the work integrates efforts in research, mentoring, teaching, and outreach, with a focus on underrepresented populations, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Division of Physics, the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNeutrinos are a mysterious type of elementary particle.  They are almost massless and almost non-interacting, which makes them hard to detect.  However, when they are detected, it is very valuable, as their unusual properties allow them to escape through dense matter that would stop light and other particles.  A key direction in fundamental-physics research is trying to understand neutrino properties, how they relate to those of other elementary particles, and how they can be used to reveal the properties of atomic nuclei.  A key direction in astrophysics research is trying to use neutrinos to probe the properties of astrophysical objects such as the Sun, other stars, and supernova explosions, all of which emit huge numbers of neutrinos.  The work of this project concentrated on each of these directions and especially their connections.\n\nFor the intellectual-merit component of this project, PI Beacom led studies of neutrinos from the Sun, supernovae, and higher-energy sources.  This work included new predictions of neutrino fluxes, new strategies for detection, and insights gained by existing detections and limits.  Closely related work included new probes of these astrophysical sources based on light, other electromagnetic signals, and cosmic rays.  Other closely related work included new tests of neutrino properties.  These two threads of related work provided important inputs to better understanding neutrinos.  The research results of the project were documented through publications in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFor the broader-impacts component of this project, PI Beacom trained graduate students and postdocs in research and career skills; led cross-disciplinary research that connected the planned work to new topics; carried out an extensive program of outreach to the public, including with the Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and other under-represented populations; among other activities.  The intellectual-merit work was closely integrated with the broader-impacts work.  The training of junior scientists and the outreach to the science-interested public, including children, leads to workforce development that benefits society.  In addition, the development of new techniques to detect neutrinos may eventually lead to new technologies for sensitive detection tools.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Beacom"
