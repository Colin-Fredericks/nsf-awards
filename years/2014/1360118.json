This study will help identify the ways in which Spelman College, a historically black women's liberal arts college designated as an NSF Model Institution, has successfully used federal science education policy to position itself as a national science producer. \r\n\r\nThis project will help increase our understanding of \"how\" to foster inherently inclusive environments for STEM learning utilizing the strengths of the local institution and its historical mission and thus should contribute to NSF's mission of increasing the participation on students from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields.",
