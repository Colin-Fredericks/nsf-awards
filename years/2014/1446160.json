This meeting convenes all Principal Investigators of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Cyber-Physical Systems Program (CPS) for the fifth time since the program began.  The PI Meeting is to take place on November 6-7, 2014 in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia.  The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored CPS researchers, industry representatives, and Federal agencies' representatives to gather and review new CPS developments, identify new and emerging applications, and to discuss technology gaps and barriers.\r\n\r\nThe CPS PI meeting program agenda is community-driven and includes presentations (oral and poster) from PIs, reports of past year program activities, and showcases/pitches of new CPS innovations and results.  The CPS meeting will report on new discoveries in the program and provide networking opportunity between the program PI, invited researchers, government, and industrial researchers.  More broadly, the multiple technology domains that will be discussed and research progress described including medical, transportation, manufacturing, energy, and others are of critical importance to the Nation.",
