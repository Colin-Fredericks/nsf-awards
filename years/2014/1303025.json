 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview:\r\nConceptual model diagrams are frequently used in undergraduate and graduate atmospheric science courses because they allow students to visualize the dynamic interwoven pieces of complex storm systems. These models are visual simplifications of the relationships that govern the system and the use of them in the classroom has been shown to significantly improve student learning. Despite their recognized importance, traditional conceptual models are most often static representations of dynamic systems and often struggle to reproduce the complex and noisy reality of authentic storms. Studies have shown that the educational value of conceptual models is maximized when students are able to compare and contrast the model with real data and identify weaknesses in the simplified model.\r\nThis proposal seeks to develop a series of case study examples of commonly observed storm structures using observational data collected during the FRONT-PORCH experiment. High resolution dual-Doppler reconstructions of the three-dimensional wind field, dual-polarization hydrometeor identification, and surface and upper-air meteorology observations will be combined and displayed side by side to give a complete view of a real example of storm structure that can be compared and contrasted with commonly used conceptual models. These examples will be housed on the web in a case study library where students across the country can choose among different storm types and view the evolution of the storms in a movie whose playback they can control. Additionally, a series of laboratory exercises using the case study library will be written to accelerate bringing this data into classrooms and thus enhance the effectiveness of meteorology courses without significant additional effort on the part of individual instructors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nEducational initiatives in the atmospheric sciences have traditionally lagged several years behind advancements in the teaching of other physical and geosciences. This project will be one of the first in the atmospheric sciences to develop a widely available educational resource that relies primarily on observational data collected during a field experiment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nA broad grassroots reformation is underway in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education as classes shift from a lecture based, professor centric, passive learning approach into one in which students are actively engaged in the construction of their knowledge. The driving force behind these changes is the litany of new studies that consistently demonstrate that lecture based instruction is not as effective as a style that incorporates active learning. The permanent case study library will allow students across the country to examine real data alongside the traditional static conceptual models that are common in meteorology textbooks. The lab exercises involve the students in actively exploring the data and coming to their own conclusions about the way a storm works before being given the answer. By comparing and contrasting real data with conceptual models students will gain a deeper and more complete understanding of complex storm structures. Additionally, pre-packaged exercises that can be easily implemented will facilitate use of this and other educational resources by our academic colleague",

We conducted a dedicated field project on the Front Range of Colorado from 20 May &ndash; 20 June 2014 using two NSF lower atmosphere observing facility radars (CSU CHILL and NCAR EOL S-POL) to obtain radar observations of storms specifically for educational purposes. Prior to this project, there were few vertical cross-sections of real storms available for educational use. The U.S. National Weather Service radars do not vertical cross-section scans.</p>\n<p>The overall goal of the project was to obtain real storm examples for use in instructional materials for upper-level undergraduate and graduate mesoscale meteorology courses. To aid the instructor in finding appropriate materials for their courses, 12 storm cases are categorized by storm type including a supercell, a tornadic supercell, hail storms, disorganized convection, and mesoscale convective systems with trailing stratiform, leading stratiform, and parallel stratiform structures.</p>\n<p>Significant effort went into preparing the data for use in the classroom. Data processing steps included removal of distracting data artifacts and categorization of types of precipitation (rain, snow, graupel, hail) in each scan. We used a 1:1 aspect ratio in preparing vertical cross-section plots to help students to more easily interpret the geometries of vertical airflows within the storms. The short time between repeated scans (usually less than 4 min) produced a series of cross-sections that illustrated how storms rapidly change with time. The non-steady state, fluid nature of airflows within real storms is an important contrast to the idealized schematics of storms represented in textbooks which may show storm stages but not how one stage evolves into the next stage. We developed a computer-based Java application that permits fast and easy access to the sequences of vertical and horizontal cross-sections for the dozen storm cases.</p>\n<p>We also developed instructional activities, including learning objectives and guided illustrations on how hail develops and falls out within storms. The activities were tested in meteorology courses at North Carolina State University and at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology to obtain student feedback on the utility of the materials. The storm case examples for classroom activities are accessible via a web site hosted at North Carolina State University (<a href=\"http://precip.meas.ncsu.edu/rose/petal/\">http://precip.meas.ncsu.edu/rose/petal/</a>) and the full sets of classroom-use plots and radar data sets from both radars are in a long term archive at NCAR EOL.</p>\n<p>This project also gave a cohort of four undergraduates an opportunity to operate weather radars and to learn about short term forecasting and storm evolution.
