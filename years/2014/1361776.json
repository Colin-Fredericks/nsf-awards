 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Leitner of the University of Nevada, Reno is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for the study of heat transport in molecular systems important in biology and technology, including materials adopted in small integrated circuits.  The research combines principles developed in a range of disciplines, including materials science, biophysical and theoretical physical chemistry, and brings together communities of scientists and engineers.  The principal investigator is involved in communicating science to the public through participation in the Telluride Science Research Center and in outreach activities with students in secondary school.\r\n\r\nThis research centers on development and application of theoretical and computational approaches to study thermal transport on the nanoscale, which is often mediated by interfaces between molecules and their local environment.   One aim of the proposal addresses the calculation of thermal conductance in and between large molecules.   A second theme focuses on the computation of thermal transport in nanoporous materials, in particular nanoporous glassy materials adopted as highly electronically insulating materials in integrated circuits.  A third aim of the proposal concerns the calculation of response times of local probes of energy transport in large molecules, in particular proteins, peptides and molecular chains.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDavid Leitner of the University of Nevada, Reno successfully completed a project supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program on the study of heat transport in molecular systems important in biology and technology.  His research group developed computational methods to calculate heat flow through molecules that bridge two materials, each at different temperature.  Laws of thermal transport that apply on macroscopic scales do not generally apply to molecules, and many details about molecular structure and dynamics are required to calculate heat flow in molecules.  The Leitner research group has been able to account for these properties in their calculations, the results of which describe well experimental measurements of thermal conductance of molecular interfaces, provide information about the mechanisms that underlie the measured values, and make predictions for future experimental studies of heat transfer through molecular interfaces.  One prediction concerns the possibility that heat transfer in one direction occurs more easily than in the other, that is, the conditions for a molecular thermal diode, which would facilitate thermal management in small circuits.  \n\nSuccessful calculations of thermal conduction through molecular interfaces have also been carried out for systems important in biology and medicine.  Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) can be remotely heated optically, and applications to drug delivery and thermal control of protein and nucleic acid structure are currently the subject of study in many laboratories.  The GNPs are capped by molecules to reach targets in the cell or to facilitate drug delivery, but there have been few systematic computational studies of thermal transfer from the GNP through the capping layer to its target.  The development of computational methods and calculations by the Leitner group have been filling this gap, providing predictions of heat transfer from GNPs in cellular environments that can aid in applications of GNPs in photothermal therapies.\n\nBroader impacts of this NSF award include training of five undergraduate and graduate student researchers in scientific fields of current and expanding interest, organization of two professional meetings on the subject of the project, and making freely available computer code to carry out calculations on energy transfer in molecules using methods developed for this project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Leitner"
