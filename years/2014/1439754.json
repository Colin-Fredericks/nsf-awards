 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Capacity Building track of the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this project will build the framework for a new STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) teacher preparation partnership program between the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) (a strong engineering school) and the University of Northern Colorado (UNCO) (a strong teacher education school).  The new teacher preparation program will produce more highly qualified STEM teachers in Colorado, with special emphasis on middle and high school teachers.  This program will provide an alternative path for CSM students who may wish to become a science or mathematics teacher.  The project will provide insight in how to increase recruitment and retention of STEM majors while also addressing the shortage of STEM teachers.\r\n\r\nThe collaborating institutions will develop new and revised courses that will best address the integrative nature of STEM learning that is emerging in K-12 education by preparing secondary science and mathematics teachers with the skills to integrate scientific inquiry, technological design, engineering problem solving and mathematical analysis into cohesive and meaningful learning experiences for their students.  The program design will focus on recruitment and effective preparation of future teachers by providing the teacher candidates with strong content knowledge, early field experiences, and supervision of their student teaching by content faculty.  This ultimately will have a positive impact on the students of these future teachers and an increase in science literacy within the greater community.  The innovative model for collaboration between these two universities will be transportable to other similar situations where engineering schools are looking for ways to enable their students interested in teaching as a career to complete their training and certification.  Project evaluation will be conducted primarily through tracking forms developed for each project goal and its corresponding objectives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary outcome of the CO-STEM Capacity Building project has been the successful development of a collaborative program between Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and University of Northern Colorado (UNCO) to provide a path towards licensure in K-12 teaching.  In working toward this outcome, the project identified four main goals:\n\n \n\nGoal 1 &ndash; Conduct a needs assessment to better determine the needs for STEM teachers and the interests among CSM majors to consider STEM teaching as a profession.\n\nGoal 2 &ndash; Design curriculum for CSM majors to allow completion of content majors with teaching emphases. \n\nGoal 3 &ndash; Continue to formalize partnership between the two institutes of higher education (CSM and UNCO) and develop new partnerships with school districts to provide opportunities for teacher candidates.\n\nGoal 4 &ndash; Build the infrastructure between CSM and UNCO for the collaborative teacher preparation program.\n\n \n\nIn the course of our work toward these goals, we identified a potentially large and relatively untapped source of future STEM educators among students at a \"STEM-Only\" degree granting university without any well-designed pathways to licensure to encourage this career option.  Based on both the requirements for math and science licensure in the state of Colorado and the rigorous requirements for the accredited degrees in math, science and engineering at the Colorado school of Mines, we were able to develop a streamlined pathway toward licensure that encourages early field experiences in classrooms, utilizes established curriculum from the University of Northern Colorado, and leverages the content expertise developed within the degree granting disciplines at CSM.  With early advising for students interested in this pathway, it is possible for participating students to earn their secondary licensure from UNCO within one semester of completing their CSM degree.\n\n \n\nThis project addresses the national need for more comprehensive preparation of secondary science and mathematics teachers that have the skills to integrate scientific inquiry, technology design, engineering problem solving and mathematical analysis into cohesive and meaningful learning experiences for their students. By providing the teacher candidates with a strong content knowledge, early field experiences, and supervision of student teaching by content faculty, the teachers are more effective and prepared.

The program is now established, with the second cohort of students beginning their education coursework in the Fall of 2016 and the Colorado School of Mines providing a house on campus to provide a long-term home for the program.  Moreover, both institutions have made great efforts to streamline all administrative processes between the two institutions to insure that the program has a native feel to the participating students at the Colorado School of Mines.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerrald G Greivel"
