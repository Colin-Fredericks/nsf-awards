The document might suggest changes to the available configurations of the ARW.  In addition, NCAR will collaborate with ARL on a studey of the relative performances of the observation nudging in the community ARW and the observation nudging in the 4DWX system developed by NCAR Research Aviation Laboratory. The result will be a written at least one journal article. Furthermore, a white paper will be produced conveying best practices for applying the ARW for simulations at gride intervals less than 1.0km.",
