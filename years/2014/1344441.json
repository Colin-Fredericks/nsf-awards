 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquakes generate hydrological responses, such as increases in stream flow and changes in the water level in wells. Such hydrologic responses are important because they provide unique insight into the coupling of hydrologic and tectonic processes at spatial and temporal scales that are otherwise difficult to study. The origin of hydrologic responses to earthquakes has been the subject of controversy, in large part because there are many models to explain observations and few measurements suitable for distinguishing between hypotheses. We will study responses to earthquakes in New Zealand, Chile, Taiwan, and California to test competing hypotheses by 1) compiling observations, 2) collecting new measurements, and 3) developing analytical and numerical models to interpret the hydrological and related geodetic data. We will address the following questions: Does the excess discharge in streams originate from the shallow or deep subsurface? How do the response of deep and groundwater systems differ? Are there different and understandable responses of fracture-dominated rock and unconsolidated materials? Are there permanent changes in properties of the subsurface such as permeability? Are static or dynamic stresses more important for explaining the observed changes?\r\n\r\nThis project offers an interdisciplinary training opportunity that integrates geophysics and hydrology, and combines modeling and field studies. The proposed work is an international collaboration with scientists in Taiwan, Germany and New Zealand. We will integrate the proposed research with courses taught at UC Berkeley, including freshman seminars, undergraduate-level geodynamics, and graduate level classes. The study of earthquake-induced hydrologic changes has implications for water resources and engineering, including assessing the role of earthquakes in damaging aquifers, affecting underground repositories, and changing water supplies. \r\n",

Examples include changes in water level in wells, liquefaction of soils, changes in the activity of mud volcanoes and geysers, the formation and disappearance of springs, and increased discharge in streams. Earthquakes and water interact with each other through changes in stress and physical properties of rocks. Therefore, understanding the origin of hydrological responses to earthquakes can provide unique insight into hydrologic and tectonic processes at spatial and temporal scales that are otherwise difficult to study. Also, understanding the origin of hydrological responses to an earthquake may have applications to hydrocarbon migration and recovery, Enhanced Geothermal Systems, and have implications for underground waste repositories and water supplies. In this project, we integrated various ground-based and space-borne observations and mechanical models to investigate the evolution of the Lusi mud volcano in Indonesia and the process of induced seismicity in Texas.</p>\n<p>The Lusi mud eruption, in East Java, Indonesia, began in May 2006 and continued to the present. We mapped the surface deformation over this volcano, by applying multitemporal InSAR analysis to a well-populated data set acquired by ALOS L-band satellite between May 2006 and April 2011. We found an exponential decay of the pressure in the mud source, which suggests mud eruption may end soon. We then applied a time-dependent inverse modeling scheme and found that the volume changes occur in two regions beneath Lusi, at 0.3-2.0 km and 3.5-4.75 km depth. We concluded that a shallow source plays a key role by supplying the erupting mud, but that additional fluid does ascend from depths &gt;4 km on eruptive timescales.</p>\n<p>In recent years the eastern and central USA has experienced a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes, with more than 1570 M 3 events between 2009 and 2015. Many of these events occurred near injection disposal wells, and the seismicity was preceded by a high rate of fluid injection over a period of months to years, suggesting a link between seismicity and injection operations. In general, earthquake hazard is proportional to the seismic rate. Thus the current increase in the seismic rate implies an elevated hazard in the central and eastern US. In this project, we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable using radar interferometric data to &gt; 8 km from the wells. Using measured uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we compute the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that a &gt; 1 MPa increase in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes including the M<sub>w</sub>4.8, 17 May 2012 event, the largest earthquake recorded in east Texas. We further showed that the seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. We conclude that induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Manoochehr&nbsp;Shirzaei</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344441/1344441_10299295_1533162355546_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344441/1344441_10299295_1533162355546_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344441/1344441_10299295_1533162355546_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic illustration of mud and fluid sources and conduits sustaining Lusi</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.
