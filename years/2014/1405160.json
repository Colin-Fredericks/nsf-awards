 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), defined as the atmospheric pressure differences between the Iceland Low and Azores High, is a dominant feature of climate in the North Atlantic region and is associated with climate changes at interannual and interdecadal timescales. The NAO is also associated with changes in temperature, salinity, and circulation patterns in the northwest Atlantic, but high-quality instrumental records of these variables are only available for the past 60 years. \r\n\r\nThis project, led by a researcher from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, will develop the first long term record of the ocean's response to the NAO. Specifically, benthic foraminiferal stable oxygen isotope records from sediment cores from the Gulf of Maine, Scotian shelf, and the Newfoundland continental shelf will be used to reconstruct temperature and salinity patterns in sea surface conditions associated with positive and negative phases of the NAO. The project will include a research expedition to collect sediment cores that are not available in existing collections. The results will complement land-based NAO records and together these data sets should provide a holistic picture of the atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere variability in the North Atlantic region over the past few millennia. Funding also supports research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and an at-sea research experience for a high school teacher.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to develop a climate history of waters from the continental shelf off Newfoundland and to do the same for waters off southern Nova Scotia and Maine.  Work by scientists at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (N.S.) has showed that the climate of this region responds to atmospheric forcing (winds, for example) on the interdecadal scale.  This forcing has been quantified by taking the difference in sea level atmospheric pressure (SLP) between the Azores (subtropical high pressure) and Iceland (subpolar low pressure), known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).  When the NAO is in a positive phase, Iceland SLP is lower than usual and in the Azores it is higher than normal.  In the positive case, the SLP gradient is strong, causing more stormy and rainy conditions in the east Atlantic and Europe (since winds are driven by pressure gradients).  In the negative phase, storminess is prevalent along the U.S. and Canadian east coasts.  Since about 1850, the NAO index has oscillated between the two extremes and can account for much of the climate variability in the North Atlantic region.  Because barometer measurements of SLP are rare prior to 1850, it would be important to extend the instrument-based observations of the NAO into the past using geochemical methods. \n\n            Dr. Brian Petrie of the Bedford Institute published a paper about 10 years ago that compiled and synthesized all measurements of temperature and salinity since 1970 from continental shelf locations between the Gulf of Maine and the southern Labrador Sea. Essentially, he found when bottom waters in one region were relatively warmer and saltier, the other region was cooler and fresher.  This has to do with the temperature and salinity of deeper, offshore waters, and to what extent those waters get pushed onto the continental shelf by the atmosphere. \n\n            I proposed that it should be possible to use the oxygen isotope ratio of the shells of bottom-dwelling organisms from sediment cores in the two regions to develop a \"paleo-NAO\" index that could extend the NAO history for thousands of years.  This is possible because the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) of these shells contains varying amounts of the rare stable isotope oxygen-18, and that amount can be measured by mass spectrometry.  It is well known that the oxygen isotope ratio is a function of both temperature and salinity.  The only problem is that there were no suitable sediment cores from the continental shelf of Newfoundland.  At our core repository at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution we already had excellent cores from the Gulf of Maine.\n\n            Working with Canadian colleagues, I identified two suitable locations off Newfoundland for sediment coring.  We departed Reykjavik, Iceland in early June 2014 on R/V Endeavor and headed to Newfoundland.  At the first location, to the east of Newfoundland we found what appeared to be suitable sediment, but the second location to the south on the Grand Bank, was a bust.  Shore-based sampling of the core revealed that there were few to no benthic foraminifera.\n\n            Study of the core from east of Newfoundland had very poor preservation of CaCO3 in the upper 2-3 meters, and no one species was consistently present in sufficient abundance to carry out the project.  For the past few thousand years represented in this core, we have neither enough oxygen isotope data nor radiocarbon dates to compare to the Gulf of Maine sites.  We did find that very deep in the core the preservation of CaCO3 improves, and that there is a record of an important climate anomaly that occurred about 8200 years ago.\n\n            The oxygen isotope data from the past 2000 years from the Gulf of Maine show variability in bottom water temperature of about 2&deg;C.  There is some evidence that the temperature changes are systematic (non-random) on the decade to century time scale from about 1600 to 800 years ago, but the first consistent change occurred about 800 years ago when it seems to have been consistently colder than average by about 1&deg;C.  This was followed by about two centuries of slightly warmer temperatures.  Beginning about 600 years ago, bottom water temperatures steadily decreased by about 1&deg;C to a minimum about 400 years ago.  From that point until about 100 years ago, results are consistently colder on average than the previous 1000 years.  This interval, known as the Little Ice Age, reveals two pulses of cold, centered on about 150 and 250 years ago.  The most striking change in the entire record occurred sometime in the past century when bottom waters warmed to levels not seen in the past two millennia.  This result is very similar to a nearby record close to Halifax, N.S. that is ascribed to both the end of the Little Ice Age and the beginning of human influence on climate.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lloyd D Keigwin"
