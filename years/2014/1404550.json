Professor Braslau and her students plan to develop simple and economic methods to covalently attach phthalate ester mimics to PVC, imparting plasticity to otherwise brittle PVC, while preventing migration of small molecules that can leach out and become metabolized into endocrine disrupting chemicals. Phthalates are currently utilized on the million-ton scale annually, yet are implicated in a number of health problems.  A successful outcome of this project will provide a new strategy to replace phthalate plasticizers using methodology that is scalable to industrial applications, mitigating the buildup of endocrine disrupting phthalates in consumer products and in the environment.  The attachment of the plasticizer to PVC by chemical bonds may also improve the lifetime of the consumer products using flexible PVC. In addition, this research will provide interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of synthetic organic chemistry and materials science, educating them with the tools they will need to make significant contributions in the future.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored by the PI to participate in professional activities, presenting their work at meetings, and taking an active part in the preparation of manuscripts stemming from their research findings. \r\n \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY: \r\n\r\nThis project entails a simple and economic method to covalently attach phthalate ester mimics to PVC, as a substitute for standard phthalate plasticizers.  As phthalate esters are now used on the million-ton scale annually, a substitute is desirable that is chemically similar, but which shows no migratory ability from the PVC matrix. Small molecule phthalate plasticizers leach from PVC products, changing the properties of the PVC with time, and releasing potential endocrine disrupting chemicals into the environment.  A simple Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkyl azides and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates at moderate temperatures in the absence of copper will be utilized to prepare 1,2,3-triazoles bearing ortho-esters containing a variety of alkoxy groups, to mimic phthalate esters plasticizers. These phthalate mimics will be covalently linked to PVC, either by modification of commercially prepared PVC, or by copolymerization of vinyl monomers bearing ortho-diester triazole phthalate mimics with vinyl chloride. In addition, copolymers of monomers bearing phthalate mimics will be prepared as polymeric plasticizers to be blended with PVC. The properties of the modified PVC materials will be extensively evaluated to assess plasticity as indicated by Tg depression, homogeneity as a function of time, migratory potential, polymer morphology, and elastomeric behavior. The polymeric plasticizers will be analyzed for miscibility with PVC.  The stability of these materials upon subjecting them to hydrolysis and subsequent extraction will be tested according to ASTM standards. The thermal and photodecomposition of these polymer-bound triazoles will be studied.",

Traditionally, phthalates are used as plasticizers, but they leach out into the environment and into us. Many phthalates are endocrine disrupting compounds:&nbsp; over 6 million tons are produced annually. To mitigate this world-wide problem, we have developed phthalate mimics which are chemically attached to the PVC polymer chains: these tethered plasticizers cannot leach out, thus maintaining the integrity of the PVC product over time, and preventing environmental contamination. We have explored various methods to attach plasticizers. One strategy starts with PVC, which is treated with a nitrogen species called an azide, followed by mild heating with a second compound: an electron-poor carbon-carbon triple bonded alkyne to give phthalate mimics attached to PVC. Several architectures were investigated, among them \"frogs,\" \"tadpoles,\" \"frog on tadpole\" and \"two frogs on frog.\" The best results are with the easily synthesized single legged \"tadpole,\" which should be scalable for industrial use. Because they are chemically attached, these new plasticizers remain inside the PVC, preventing loss of flexibility over time, and potentially making phthalate contamination obsolete.&nbsp; A second strategy entails attaching a phthalate-mimic \"frog\" to a polymerizable small molecule mixed into the precursor of PVC, vinyl chloride. Polymerization then builds in the plasticizing species as an integral part of the PVC polymeric backbone as it grows into a long chain. Again, the chemical bonding of the plasticizing portion to PVC prevents migration and leaching of small molecules out of the PVC material. One patent has been filed. When adopted by industry, this will prevent contamination of plasticizers into the environment as the consumer products are utilized, as well as after they are discarded.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>Internally plasticized PVC does not leach small toxic plasticizers into the environment, compared to the externally plasticized PVC predominantly in use today. As a result, goods made from internally plasticized PVC will retain their flexibility over time, making them more durable, enhancing the environmental footprint of PVC materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of human resources, over the course of this grant three graduate students completed their Ph.D. degrees (two female, one male), current graduates students (two female, two male, one underrepresented minority) continue to work on extensions of this project, two Masters degrees were earned (one female, one male), and nine undergraduates ((four females, five males, six underrepresented minorities) have received training while engaged in active laboratory work.
