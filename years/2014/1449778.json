The yearly grantees conference helps evaluate the recent progress made in this discipline, and discuss current challenges, while bridging together this diverse research community.\r\nThe conference is planned as a two-day meeting, and the agenda includes keynote speakers, poster presentations and roundtable panel discussions. This will promote dissemination of recent research results to the community, and enable discussions on the impact of the technology on society. The meeting enables networking between researchers and facilitate future collaborations. Specific focused areas include quantum effects, self-assembly, nanophotonics and nanobiology. Additionally the discussions will include potential technology transfer to the commercial sector.",
