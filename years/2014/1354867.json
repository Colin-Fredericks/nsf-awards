 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stream and rivers are being assaulted by myriad environmental stresses, including elevated nutrient inputs, species extinctions and invasions, and loss of biodiversity.  In the contiguous US, nitrogen inputs have tripled relative to levels during pre-European settlement, primarily due to synthetic fertilizer production, atmospheric deposition from the combustion of fossil fuels, and through agricultural practices.  Consequently, many streams have dramatically higher nutrient concentrations than they did historically, which can lead to algal blooms, fish die-offs, and increased export of nutrients to marine ecosystems.  Streams can be important for regulating nutrient exports from continents to oceans, but the functioning is, in part, mediated by biodiversity, and rates of species losses in streams are among the highest on the planet.  Therefore, understanding interactions among changing nutrient inputs, and declining biodiversity are major and immediate challenges for conservation and management of freshwater ecosystems.  The number of available datasets on stream nutrient concentrations, stream flow, and biodiversity has increased rapidly, but many have yet to be evaluated for temporal or spatial trends, analyzed with state of the art statistical and modeling techniques, or compared across regions.  Further, many large datasets are coming online in the near future, and stream ecologists need to develop strategies to best utilize this emerging information.  The  goal of the Stream Resiliency Research Coordination Network is to link stream ecologists with hydrologists, statisticians, modelers, and resource managers to develop a synthetic understanding of how streams and river ecosystems will respond to chronic nutrient inputs and changing species diversity.  The network will meet through a series of workshops and webinars to develop new approaches to analyzing existing and forthcoming stream nutrient and organism datasets, and conduct state of the knowledge syntheses.  An initial one-day planning workshop associated with the 2014 Joint Aquatic Sciences meeting will be hosted to engage the research community.  Following the planning meeting, four three-day workshops will be held addressing topics focused on understanding long-term change in stream ecosystems, how ecosystem processes vary across river networks from small headwater streams to larger rivers, and the interactions among organisms in the context of changing climate, altered land-use, and loss of biodiversity.  Each workshop will include one day focused on training in data analysis and modeling approaches not typically used by stream ecologists, and two days focused on data analyses and synthesis.  In the last year of funding, a workshop will be hosted at the annual meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science to report back to the scientific community the activities of the network, and host a series of presentations about the state of knowledge.\r\n\r\nKey functions of the network include enabling interactions among researchers and managers, and providing opportunities for young scientists to collaborate with established scientists.  The network will focus on developing novel conceptual frameworks and new analytical approaches to facilitate the synthesis of a wealth of existing datasets, as well as to provide the foundations for interpreting and guiding new research projects and sampling, and training opportunities for the next generation of scientists in the methods needed to deal with long-term datasets spanning large spatial scales.  Each workshop will include training of a targeted statistical or modeling approach, provide educational opportunity for both graduate students and established researchers, and produce tangible applied products for natural resource managers and policy makers.  In addition, an online graduate level seminar will be hosted focusing on stream functioning in a changing environment, providing an opportunity for students across the globe to learn about the activities and findings from the network.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Stream Resiliency Research Coordination Network was established to develop a synthetic understanding of the resistance and resilience of lotic ecosystems to chronic nutrient inputs and changing species diversity by linking stream ecologists with hydrologists, statisticians, modelers, and resource managers.  Understanding interactions among changing nutrient inputs, altered hydrology, and declining biodiversity are major and immediate challenges for conservation and management of freshwater ecosystems.  Datasets on stream nutrient concentrations, stream flow, and biodiversity are increasingly available, but many have not been analyzed for trends, and compared across regions.  Our network organized a series of working groups, which focused on better understanding energy flow through stream invertebrate and fish food webs, evaluating changes over time in stream nutrient concentrations and transport in streams and rivers, and better understanding how stream nutrient dynamics are coupled across broad geographical regions.  \n\nFindings from our network include an analysis of how stream insect growth rate was linked to climate across the contiguous United States, and across the globe.  In the United States low precipitation and the resulting low flow conditions resulted in lower insect growth rate.  At the global scale, greater air temperature and the resulting warmer stream water resulted in higher growth.  Our results suggest that climate change will likely lead to change in stream insect production, although the response will likely be variable depending on the changes in precipitation.  In another synthesis project, we detected significant effects of the El Ni?o&ndash;Southern Oscillation on the amount of nitrogen discharge in Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin, but no effect on river flow, suggesting that large&#8208;scale climate phenomena contribute to variation in nutrients across years through biogeochemical mechanisms beyond simple flow of water through the system.  Our group has also developed techniques to characterize broad variation in the timing and randomness in river flows across broad geographic regions in order to be describe flow variation at global scales. \n\nFor broader impacts, our network had over 70 participants, including 12 graduate students, and 14 postdoctoral researchers.  Participants included researchers from research universities, undergraduate colleges, The Nature Conservancy, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ecological Observatory Network, United States Geological Survey, and United States Forest Service.  The network engaged international participations with participants from Australia, Sweden, and Canada.  Participants were trained in cutting edge statistical and mechanistic modeling approaches through several seminar series, and online teaching across institutions.
