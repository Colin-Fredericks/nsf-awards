 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mercury (Hg) is a toxic trace element that bioaccumulates into marine food webs, imposing a health threat to humans through the consumption of seafood. However, controls on the cycling of Hg in the ocean are poorly understood. Most research to date has focused on sun-lit and/or Hg-laden environments, where light-induced chemical and mercury resistance reactions, respectively, have been identified as dominant pathways for Hg cycling. The paradigm that dark Hg reactions are irrelevant is fading and it is now apparent that dark redox reactions, both reduction and oxidation, are important in the cycling of Hg. In this study, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Colorado School of Mines will obtain a better understanding of the biogeochemical reactions responsible for dark redox transformations of mercury (Hg) in marine systems. The researchers will explore the relationship between microbial activity, reactive oxygen species, and Hg speciation in a series of laboratory- and field-based investigations to obtain a mechanistic understanding of dark Hg cycling. By identifying new controls on the redox cycling of Hg in the ocean, this research will help inform global and ecosystem models used to predict Hg bioavailability.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proponents plan to educate high school teachers from Boston Green Academy in South Boston on mercury biogeochemistry and have one teacher participate in the summer research cruises, as well as develop science curricula to engage the underrepresented students at the school in science.  One postdoc and one graduate student from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and one graduate student from the Colorado School of Mines would be supported and trained as part of this project.  It is anticipated that undergraduate students would have the opportunity to participate in the study as summer interns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChemical reactions changing the forms (speciation) of dissolved mercury are important for determining this metal's transport and biological interactions in aquatic environments.  The reactive oxygen species superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are produced both by microorganisms and sunlight in natural waters, and their role in changing mercury speciation is not well understood.  The goal of the Colorado School of Mines portion of this collaborative grant was to quantify rates of mercury reactions involving reactive oxygen species.  The challenge of our experimental design was that we wanted to perform experiments at mercury concentrations near natural levels, and we accomplished this using isotope-labeled mercury.  \n\nDirect oxidation of zerovalent mercury by superoxide did not occur, but an indirect process involving superoxide may have led to some mercury oxidation in one sample.  A significant direct reaction between mercury(II) and superoxide was observed in one water sample, but not in others, indicating that the reaction may depend on other compounds (such as organic ligands) present at variable concentrations in natural waters.  We found no evidence that reactions involving hydrogen peroxide can change mercury speciation.  We also found no evidence that manganese or copper can catalyze reactions of mercury with superoxide.  The enzyme catalase was found to oxidize mercury while the coenzyme NADH was found to reduce mercury, which could complicate interpretation of experiments in which biota are present.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bettina M Voelker"
