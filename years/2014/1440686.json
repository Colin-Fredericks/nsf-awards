 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands access at St. Olaf College to massive, complex datasets and delivers the analytic power they require. The 2-year effort upgrades the current campus network so researchers in physics, biology, economics, computer science and mathematics can accelerate their projects and expand the range of datasets they investigate. In particular, greater network capacity advances the NSF-funded Center for Interdisciplinary Research and the CSinParallel initiative. \"The Network for Big Data\" also enhances formal instruction in data science across the STEM disciplines. Looking ahead, the Network for Big Data will enable St. Olaf researchers to access massive data sets generated via remote sensing methods, including Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR).\r\n\r\n\"The Network for Big Data\" continues St. Olaf's tradition of taking innovative, cost-effective approaches to advanced computing. All data transfer nodes and Big Data enclave devices reside in a single virtual local area network to serve St. Olaf's science and mathematics data management zone. Once core and data center switches are consolidated in one enhanced switch, external connectivity, which includes Internet2, will increase to 10 Gbps. The fiber infrastructure connecting St. Olaf's network border to its core and to key STEM buildings is upgraded to support 10Gbps connections, with IPv6 campus-wide deployment, and continuous performance monitoring performance and outcomes of these upgrades using a perfSONAR node.",
