 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds will support student training at the 2014 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, which will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, July 11-15, 2014. The ISMB conference is the largest and most high profile annual meeting of scientists working in computational biology and bioinformatics. The program presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences. A broad range of sub-disciplines covering the field is represented at the meeting. Each year novel research output using cutting-edge technologies is presented.  The conference serves as a forum for the presentation of novel algorithmic methods and new ways to apply bioinformatics tools to the most important current challenges in biology and the biomedical sciences.The conference has a rigorous focus on computation and methodology coupled with outstanding biology. Leading experts conduct training sessions at ISMB and provide participants with opportunities to learn new tools and techniques not easily gained elsewhere. Students have opportunities to interact with senior scientists on the forefront of technology development. Students and scientists return to their labs from ISMB equipped to apply what they have learned, advance their own research efforts, and initiate investigations in new areas.\r\n\r\nStudents will gain the latest skills in bioinformatics and computational biology. Individuals trained in the latest techniques in these fields are in extremely high demand in a diverse range of research centers and industries including pharmaceutical, agricultural, environmental, consumer products, biotech, software, hardware, and service companies.  Bioinformatics skills have become integral to the analysis of the large volumes of biomedical and agricultural data currently being generated in the life sciences, and to understanding complex biological systems. ISMB has become a forum for reviewing the state-of-the-art advances in the many fields of the growing discipline of computational biology, for introducing new directions, and for announcing technological breakthroughs. ISMB and ISCB continue to contribute to the advancement of biology and build the bridges necessary to support research developments in life sciences.
