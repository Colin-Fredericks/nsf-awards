 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project will examine human dynamics across social media and social networks and will focus on the modeling of information diffusion over both time and space.  It also will study the connection between online activities and real world human behaviors.  Because the research team will employ a broad range of different research approaches to study the processes through which people's behavior is reflected in electronic media, the project will yield new communication theories, knowledge-discovery tools, and computational models.  It will facilitate the convergence of information and insights across a diverse set of fields, including spatial science, social media, communication, computer science, and social behavioral analysis.  The project also will facilitate the adoption of computational applications and modeling approaches in behavioral and social science research.  The investigators will conduct tests of two different scenarios (public response to disaster warnings and alerts and referendums of controversial social topics at state and national levels) to refine a new theory about communication dealing with memes, or reproducible messages.  One product of the project will be a prototype social media outreach platform designed and tested in coordination with the city of San Diego's Office of Emergency Services.  The prototype will facilitate rapid dissemination of official alerts and warnings notifications during disaster events via multiple social media channels to targeted populations.  The platform will be designed to identify and recruit 1,000 social media volunteers based on their social network influence factors, thereby enabling government agencies to communicate more effectively to the public and to be better prepared for both natural disasters and human-related crises.  The project also will provide research and educational opportunities for students in multiple disciplines, including geography, linguistics, computer science, social science, and communication.\r\n\r\nPeople move in time and space, and while they do so, they communicate. With modern communication technologies, they leave traces of and refer to their behavior while they engage in everyday behavior.  These informational echoes have enormous potential to provide insights into people's behavior.  The research team will analyze the diffusion patterns of human messages, activities, and communications using computational methods, such as social network analysis, geographic information systems, and machine-learning, as well as traditional social scientific research methods, such as qualitative analysis, inferential statistics, and behavior analysis.  The investigators will build an interdisciplinary research framework for studying human dynamics and information diffusion from a spatiotemporal modeling perspective.   They will validate and improve the Multilevel Model of Meme Diffusion (M3D) communication theory for online human communications across social media and social networks.  They will analyze the dynamic changes of spatiotemporal patterns with two scenarios of human dynamics (disaster warnings/alerts and referendum/propositions of controversial social topics) using computational predictive methods and agent-based modeling (ABM) approaches.  They also will develop effective and accessible data processing, visualization, and analytical tools for social scientists to study human dynamics and information diffusion by combining high-performance computing, Web-based geographic information system tools, agent-based modeling, and open-source software.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.",

By combining GIScience and geo-locating capabilities in a social media search mechanism, this project created a new approach to information query, retrieval, and analysis methods in the field of big data analytics. During the entire life of this project (five and half years), our team has generated a total 63 refereed research publications, including 46 peer-reviewed journal papers, 9 refereed conference proceeding papers, and 8 book chapters. The following are five key accomplishments derived from our project:</p>\n<p>1.<span> </span>We have created multiple web-based analytics tools and a mobile social app for disaster communication and management. The social media analytic and research testbed (SMART dashboard) version 1.5 was developed in 2017 to monitor the diffusion of social media information (tweets) with keywords. The dashboard has provided valuable information to help the County of San Diego Office of Emergency Services (OES) to monitor San Diego Wildfire in 2017 and several hurricane events in Florida. The GeoViewer Version 1.5 can provide locations of geo-tagged tweets with multiple mapping functions, including marker selection, cluster maps, and radius-adjustable hot-spot maps (heat maps). The ReadySD Social (1.1) mobile app was developed in 2018 as the San Diego OES social media outreach and monitor platform to distribute and analyze the spread of social media messages related to disaster alerts, emergency responses, and public announcements.</p>\n<p>2.<span> </span>Our team hosted four specialist meetings (workshop) with the topics related to Social Media and Big Data in Human Dynamics in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The goal of these workshops was to foster the multidisciplinary collaboration in related research disciplines, including geography, linguistics, computer science, political science, public health, civil engineering, and communication. The meeting included plenary presentations by invited experts, lightning talks, and focus group discussions. Over 125 scholars and scientists participated in these workshops during the last five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.<span> </span>We organized 18 paper sessions at the 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 AAG Annual Meetings and four workshops at the International conferences. Within the 18 organized paper sessions, there were total 79 papers presented and over 820 people who participated in organized paper sessions during the last five years. We also organized four international workshops on human dynamics topics at international conferences, including the 2015 International Conference on Location-based Social Media Data (ICLSM), the 2015 NIH Conference for Harnessing Big Data to Stop HIV, the 2016 International Conference on Social Media &amp; Society, and the 2016 International GIScience conference.</p>\n<p>4.<span> </span>We designed the structure of an agent-based modeling simulation system, including the simulation procedures, agents, actions, and rules, as well as the web-based agent-based simulation tool to simulate the process of meme diffusion in social media over time. The simulated social network generator was developed and uploaded on the public sharable Github website (https://github.com/socialnetworktool/SocialNetworkSimulator).&nbsp; We also created a new web-based Network Analysis and Diffusion Simulations Tool (Kent State) in 2019 (http://sdpmsmn.geog.kent.edu).</p>\n<p>5.<span> </span>During the five and half years, our project has provided training and professional development for 10 doctoral students, 18 masters students, and 3 postdocs. Our students have completed 18 masters theses and 2 doctoral dissertations using the findings derived from this project.</p>\n<p>To summarize, research in this project contributes to sociology, epidemiology, peace and conflict studies, social media, data science, marketing, public relations, risk and crisis management, and communication theories. In particular, the space-time measures (maps, metrics) and analytical tools (e.g., SMART dashboard and GeoViewer) will help domain experts to visualize and track the progress of political campaigns and disease outbreaks. Such measures and tools can also be used to determine the effectiveness of new product marketing. The results of the project may contribute to public welfare by analyzing how ideas spread over space and time for better understanding of sensitive ideas and their connection to social characteristics and current events. There are reasonable expectations of enhancing societal and governmental responses to natural disasters, crises, health threats and disease outbreaks. Furthermore, private industry may well find significant ways of enhancing market needs and dynamics of product diffusion.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ming-Hsiang&nbsp;Tsou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416509/1416509_10339768_1592973326527_01-M3D20--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416509/1416509_10339768_1592973326527_01-M3D20--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A Multilevel Model of Meme Diffusion (M3D) 2.0\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416509/1416509_10339768_1592973326527_01-M3D20--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A Multilevel Model of Meme Diffusion (M3D) 2.0\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Theorizing Big Social Media Data: A Multilevel Model of Meme Diffusion 2.0 (M3D 2.0) created by Dr. Brian Spitzberg.
