Undergraduate student researchers will be engaged in fundamental research projects that span the complex, interdisciplinary facets of materials sustainability, including polymer synthesis from renewable sources, materials with enhanced properties and lifetime, materials to improve utilization of natural resources, reduced energy polymer processes, and biodegradable materials, while gaining the tools to assess the environmental impact of new material development. The research is organized in four major thrusts:  (1) Materials for the Preservation and Extension of Natural Resources, (2) Materials Designed for Zero Waste Using Biobased Raw Materials, (3) Materials Replacement for a Safer and more Secure Future, and (4) Improved Materials during Operating Conditions.  The program includes a thorough training program for the graduate students who are selected as primary mentors of the REU participants.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL PART:  The program will recruit REU participants primarily from regional four-year and community colleges where opportunities for undergraduate research are scarce.  Approximately 50% of the participants have been female during earlier funding periods for this REU, and approximately 30% were underrepresented minorities.  Future recruiting will continue to promote broadening participation in the STEM enterprises.  Housing and meals will be provided on campus for the participants, and funds have been allocated to support participants' travel to the Site.  An expert evaluator will evaluate the program using instruments known to provide meaningful information about REU Site effectiveness, and the program will conduct systematic follow-up with program participants.  Based on data from past REU experience, approximately 90% of participants subsequently enroll in graduate or professional study.",
