DISC is one of two premier conferences in the foundations of distributed computing, and is a forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks.\r\n\r\nDistributed systems are becoming increasingly indispensable in our day to day lives. The functioning of basic communication infrastructure and services relies on our understanding and correct implementation of distributed systems. The broader impact is that attendance of students in DISC will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.",
