 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds travel support for students to attend the Eleventh Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2014) that will be held in Seattle, WA, on April 2-4, 2014. The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems and, in particular, challenges that are shared across systems as diverse as internet routing, peer-to-peer file sharing, sensor nets, scalable web services, and distributed network measurement. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community -- including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems -- to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student participation.  The awards permit a more qualified and diverse group of student attendees than would otherwise have been possible.  Students attending the conference benefit from both the technical content of the conference and the professional interaction with senior researchers from other universities and with industry. \r\n\r\nParticipation in NSDI 2014 is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work in the field. This project will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend NSDI. NSDI 2014 will offer many opportunities for students to meet, interact, and exchange ideas in an informal atmosphere including members of the program committee, speakers and organizers who are on site; a poster session; small evening birds-of-a-feather sessions.",
