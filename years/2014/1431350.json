 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is initiating transformative change in the faculty culture and behavior regarding teaching and learning within and across the departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.  The success of this project is being judged and guided by the resulting enhanced student learning and improved success in completing eight gatekeeper courses in these three departments. The key processes are coordinated activities that will encourage and support a broad collection of faculty instructors in these disciplines to utilize the full breadth of research-based instructional strategies in their teaching of these lower division courses.  Individual participating faculty instructors are choosing and adapting their own research-based strategies.  In this way they are participating directly in this key aspect of faculty culture. \r\n\r\nTwo university resources are particularly important in supporting this change.  Technical guidance and assistance are being provided by departmental Teaching and Learning Liaisons (TLLs).  The TLLs are faculty members within each department who have received special training and are prepared to encourage and support the department and individual faculty members as they increasingly incorporate research-based instructional strategies into a core of 8 gatekeeper courses.  Secondly, a unique faculty development component is being tailored by the Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning (CET&L) to provide support both for the Teaching and Learning Liaisons (TLLs) and for individual faculty. This project is proceeding with the full support of the Provost (who is a PI), the Dean of Arts and Sciences, and the three department heads. Change strategies are being detailed that will respond differently and appropriately for the local environments found within specific departments. Collectively these efforts will provide increasingly supportive environments or, viewed more broadly, an increasingly supportive ecosystem that will be the foundation for sustainable increased and increasingly effective use of research based instructional strategies. A series of assessments will guide and improve the impact of this effort, and provide useful research knowledge about the effectiveness of this approach to change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnhancing Student Success in Biology, Chemistry &amp; Physics by Transforming the Faculty Culture\n\nPI  Howard E.  Jackson, University of Cincinnati\n\n \n\nThe major goal of this effort was to transform the faculty culture across the four STEM departments of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics in a way that enhances student learning and student success.  More explicitly the three specific objectives of this project were to support faculty changes in their use of research-based instructional techniques, to enhance STEM student learning and success reflected in their performance in lower division courses, and to support a culture change in the STEM departments resulting in a new appreciation for the central role of teaching excellence in enhancing student learning and success.\n\nThe central elements of our approach involve (1) identifying and appointing departmental Teaching and Learning Liaisons, who are informed faculty champions who can provide both departmental and individual faculty support for teaching changes within each department, (2) a faculty development collaboration with our university teaching center, (3) a vertical integration of leadership from faculty members, to department heads, to the Dean, and to the Provost, and (4) the explicit acknowledgement that change happens locally. \n\nThe appointment of two Teaching and Learning Liaisons (TLLs) for each department was carried out each year by the Head of each of the departments.  These individuals (the TLLs) were departmental leaders or faculty champions who led the changes in teaching and learning in each department. These individuals also had the direct support of the university's Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning. The TLLs organized a Teaching and Learning Lunch series with a pedagogical focus for each department. These meetings were a central and effective component for the evolving change in departmental cultures with respect to teaching.  The TLLs were also involved in mentoring of individual faculty concerning the use of specific active learning modalities and led several peer observation efforts using several protocols.  The use of specially trained Learning Assistants increased each year and provided an important supporting role in the effective use of active learning efforts in the classroom.  Data showed that active learning efforts were successful in enhancing student learning in multiple large foundational courses.\n\nOne simple objective measure of enhanced student learning is the change in DWF (grades of D or F or W for withdrawal) rates in the foundational STEM courses over time.  On this measure we have achieved much progress as the adoption of active learning modalities and close attention to course coordination in these courses has increased.  We report dramatic reductions in the DWF rates for the foundational courses in  Biology, Chemistry, and Physics with selected reductions in Mathematics.  The TLL luncheons have resulted in a sharp uptick in the knowledge of teaching literature broadly across the faculty and have increased faculty participation in active learning.  Among our findings is that locally produced pre-class videos are hugely more effective than publisher offerings, interactive video vignettes are effective, laboratory modifications are appreciated by students, and concept inventories, including one locally crafted, provide helpful guides to instructors. Our recent efforts in metacognition more generally, and in one more specific intervention, appear to be strikingly effective and worth pursuing further.  As a result of this NSF-IUSE grant, student learning in the STEM departments at the University of Cincinnati has been notably enhanced, the faculty cultures in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematical Sciences and Physics have been dramatically transformed, and student learning will continue in the future on an upwards trajectory.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Howard E Jackson"
