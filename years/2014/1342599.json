 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the element iron (Fe) is the most abundant transition metal in atmospheric aerosols, it can be a limiting nutrient in large areas of the surface ocean. The availability of Fe as a biological nutrient depends on its particle size, solubility and chemical speciation, all of which are source dependent.\r\n\r\nThe set of questions presented in the proposal are focused on the physiochemical production and measurement of atmospheric soluble Fe (Fesol), forms.  In particular, these studies will be directed towards the valuation of soluble Fe emitted by automobile vehicle exhaust. As well as comparing the total Fe (Fesol) associated with combustion from different motor vehicle types (e.g. gasoline, diesel and compressed natural gas fuels) under well characterized (chassis dynamometer) driving conditions, an effort will be made to characterize the quantity of fuel borne Fe.   A second part of the project will look at the speciation of solubilized Fe that result from the dissolution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both a fraction of common hydrocarbon fuels and a combustion fuel by product.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMotivation\n\nWater-soluble iron in the atmosphere is important from a human-health effects and environmental chemistry standpoint.  For example, when inhaled, soluble iron leads to lung inflammation.  Additionally, soluble iron helps to fertilize about half of the world's oceans, resulting in algal blooms in the non-coastal waters.  Due to the resuspension of soils and sand, total atmospheric iron tends to be more concentrated in crustal and agricultural areas, relative to urban centers.  The amount of iron that is water-soluble in those terrains however, is starkly different.  In soils, only about 0.2% of the iron is water-soluble.  However, in urban areas, that soluble iron fraction can range from 20-80%, and thus is available for chemical reactions.\n\nGiven the disparity in water-soluble iron levels, the main goal of this study was to understand why the water-soluble iron fraction dominates in urban areas.  We hypothesize that either 1) atmospheric chemistry acts on the airborne soil particles during transport through urban areas or 2) inherently different forms of iron are being emitted in urban centers.  To this end, to primary experiments were carried out: 1) a field study, focusing on automobile emissions and 2) a laboratory study, where we seek to understand precisely what chemical compounds lead to creating water-soluble iron from otherwise insoluble iron.\n\nField Study\n\nAs automobile emissions are a major pollution source to many urban areas, the investigators collected vehicle exhaust from about 40 low-emitting gasoline-burning vehicles.  A majority of the particle-phase exhaust consists of carbon-containing compounds, mainly a class of compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).  Most chemical components of the exhaust showed no correlation with the water-soluble iron emitted.  The only chemical components of the exhaust which trended with soluble iron was a class called intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOC) and the PAH naphthalene (otherwise known as \"mothballs.\" This was the first study to have correlated water-soluble iron with any fraction of carbon in real samples.\n\nLaboratory Study\n\nIn support of the field study, the investigators used very controlled laboratory conditions to specifically test whether the PAH identified in the field study has the capability to create water-soluble iron.  An additional variable (sunlight) was also tested in order to understand the role of light as particles are transported through the atmosphere.  Briefly, it was found that naphthalene was able to increase iron solubility by a factor of eight in the dark, with this factor significantly higher under sunlight.  In fact, other, larger, PAH were also able to produce water-soluble iron under simulated sunlight.\n\nIn addition to the simulated exhaust acting on the iron, it was also observed that the iron acts on the exhaust components.  Particularly under sunlight, compounds were formed which can actually pull otherwise insoluble iron into the solution, which at least partially explains why water-soluble iron is more prominent in urban environments. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis study supported three graduate students in Chemistry and Biochemistry: including one first-generation, disable Chicano student, and one female student.  To date, one student has completed his Ph.D. through this study.  A second will complete his Ph.D., and one will complete her M.S. within the next six months.\n\nOver the course of this award, the PI and students have participated in library programs and outreach at local schools, exposing science to learners, young and old.\n\nSummary\n\nThrough the results of this study, we determined that vehicle exhaust plays a major role in the solubilization of iron in urban environments, and the specific components of the exhaust responsible for this enhanced iron solubility were identified.  In addition, sunlight plays a role in this process, through creating compounds from exhaust components which can further enhance iron solubility.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Majestic"
