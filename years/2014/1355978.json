 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advancing Scholarship Program Initiatives and Resources for Engineering and Science (ASPIRES) program at Ca\u00f1ada College, a California community college, is addressing challenges in the retention and success of undergraduate students in STEM disciplines by providing S-STEM scholars both financial assistance and academic enrichment activities.  Through the ASPIRES program, 137 scholarships are being awarded to students to facilitate their transfer to STEM programs in four-year institutions.  The ASPIRES program is also contributing to the national imperative to broaden participation in STEM, as underrepresented students comprise a significant proportion of the Ca\u00f1ada College student population.\r\n\r\nTechnical aspects of the ASPIRES project include providing the S-STEM scholars with peer instruction, mentoring from faculty members and industry professionals, summer research opportunities and field trips to transfer institutions and industry sites.  The project is contributing to the body of knowledge of how strategic academic interventions and enrichment opportunities promote the retention and success of STEM undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups.  Insights gained from the ASPIRES project are shared with the broader community of scholars at venues such as national meetings and conferences of professional STEM societies, with no fewer than eight S-STEM scholars also participating in these events annually. Outcomes being measured include the impact of the project on student enrollment and retention in STEM majors, the level of student preparation for success after transferring to a four-year institution and the degree of student engagement with Ca\u00f1ada College faculty members, industry professionals and STEM scholars at other academic institutions.",
