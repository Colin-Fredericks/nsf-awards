 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of scientists from the Chicago Botanic Garden, The Morton Arboretum, and partner institutions will conduct research at the intersection of evolutionary biology and ecological restoration -- the repair of damaged and degraded habitats. Their research investigates the practical implications of a fundamental finding of evolutionary biology: plant species that are less closely related to each other tend to be more distinct in their traits and in the ecological roles they perform. This is important, as groups of plants that encompass greater trait diversity better support key goals of conservation and land management, such as carbon storage and support of wildlife. This project will test whether selecting an unusually diverse (evolutionarily unrelated) set of plant species to use in prairie restoration is a good rule-of-thumb for achieving better outcomes in restoration of degraded ecosystems. In addition, the project will contribute to scientific engagement of high school and college students and the training of early career scientists. Outreach to the public will be performed through the lead institutions? broad networks of members and visitors.\r\n\r\nA key challenge for restoration science is to guide the development of diverse, resilient systems that provide the full suite of services associated with natural communities. Incorporating phylogenetic diversity into restoration is an underexplored, potentially powerful tool to help meet this challenge. This project will address questions important to both basic and applied ecology through observational and experimental approaches that test the influence of phylogenetic diversity on restoration outcomes in prairie ecosystems. Decision analysis will be used to determine how restoration managers can incorporate phylogenetic considerations into multi-objective restoration efforts. Results will be translated into practical tools for restoration, including web-based tools for guiding species-selection decisions.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Ecological restoration is the task of helping a degraded biological community heal or creating a functional ecological community in a place that has been damaged. It may entail enriching a plant community with new plants; removing weeds; introducing natural processes such as fire or grazing, when those processes are understood to improve the biotic community; or making physical changes to the landscape that allow biotic communities to function better. Humans have been undertaking active land management for a long time, in all the ways described above. In only the past 90 years or so, however, ecologists have turned their attention to the particularly challenging project of trying to create prairies from scratch where the land has been so badly damaged by agriculture or development that we need to start over. The resulting prairie restorations&mdash;which can be found on public lands, parks, schoolyards and private land&mdash;provide habitat for insects, mammals, birds, and soil microorganisms.</p>\n<p>Our project, &ldquo;Testing the effects of phylogenetic diversity on restoration outcomes in tallgrass prairie,&rdquo; asked a question that is fundamental to successful restoration: how does the diversity of what we plant in a prairie restoration affect the success of that restoration? We partnered with local ecological practitioners to design an experimental prairie restoration on our site at The Morton Arboretum. We established the prairie restoration in nearly 400 2m x 2m plots, varying the evolutionary diversity and trait diversity of each plot: that is, how many different lineages of the tree of life were planted into each plot, and how varied the planted species were in how they obtain and compete for resources. We expected that the most diverse plots would resist invasion by non-native species, produce the most plant material (biomass), maintain species richness over time, and have the strongest effects on soil physical properties and microbial diversity.</p>\n<p>We studied the experiment over the course of 5 years and discovered, contrary to our expectations, that high evolutionary and trait diversity did not preserve species diversity or promote productivity: the plots all settled to a similar species diversity by the third year of observation, and plant productivity was dictated more by the most productive species in the plots than by diversity per se. But diversity had an important effect that we had not expected. The most diverse plots changed more quickly over time. Why? Because the site conditions favored traits that make plants highly competitive in general, and these traits had evolved multiple times in parallel on the plant tree of life. The consequence of this is that each plot had its own set of species that could do particularly well, and the most diverse plots&mdash;the ones that had representatives from across a wide range of the tree of life or high diversity of traits&mdash;had the most opportunities to pick those competitive traits. Success of a small number of common traits across the site resulted in higher diversity among plots over time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Evolutionary diversity, then, may be a kind of insurance policy for a prairie restoration. Plant high diversity, and you buffer your restoration against an uncertain future. Plant low diversity, and you may do well, but you leave the restored community less wiggle room if you estimated the conditions incorrectly, or if conditions change. We also found that plots established from seed maintained as high a level of evolutionary diversity as those established from young plants (plugs). Given the lower cost of seeds than plugs, this is good news for prairie restoration. But we also found a second, seemingly contradictory diversity effect: high diversity plots appear on average to be <em>more</em> susceptible to invasion by unplanted species than lower diversity plots. The way to plant for weed-resistance appears in our experiment to be by planting high abundance of daisy family (Asteraceae) species and species with dominant traits.

While we are doing this, the prairie will continue to develop, and we will continue to study how plant composition is changing. And as we do, we are analyzing soil and biomass data gathered in this experiment to understand how the prairie is changing in many dimensions. At the same time, we are working in our prairie with local high school biology students, providing them an opportunity to study a prairie restoration up close and learn how to conduct ecological research, and sharing our results with colleagues in the restoration field. Our hope is that our work can help make ecological restoration more efficient through a better understanding of biodiversity effects.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hipp</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1354551/1354551_10334242_1639951055672_nsf-report_2021-12-19--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1354551/1354551_10334242_1639951055672_nsf-report_2021-12-19--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1354551/1354551_10334242_1639951055672_nsf-report_2021-12-19--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This caption from a recent paper by postdoc Nisa Karimi et al. shows (C) our experimental prairie and illustrates (A) the plant tree of life we used to calculate evolutionary diversity, and (B) example plots with both high and low trait diversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Morton Arboretum</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hipp</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Experimental design</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
