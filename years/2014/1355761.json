Both in vitro and in vivo (with mouse models) experiments have been successfully performed demonstrating the efficacy of this technology. These molecules are synthesized via Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP), which allows high fidelity over the chemical composition and structure. These PTDMs do not require covalent attached of the cargo, making this innovation applicable to various biomolecules and extremely easy to use. This innovation gives potential access to many intracellular compartments and functions thus offering new research and therapeutic opportunities.\r\n\r\nAccessibility to the human body and its highly regulated functions has always been one of the biggest challenges for biomedical sciences. The human genome and proteome projects have greatly contributed to elucidate many biological and molecular functions of the human body and to advance treatment of diseases by discovering new cellular targets. Unfortunately, this important knowledge cannot yet been fully applied because of the lack of permeability and the high selectivity of the cell membrane which makes these targets inaccessible. The delivery described in this proposal has the potential to enable many new research and application opportunities, especially, but not exclusively, in the immunology field where it will finally become possible to manipulate the so far impenetrable T-cells. T-cells play a critical role in cell-mediated immune response, for example against infections, cancer and HIV. The ability to control their activation, in a more efficient and safer way than the traditional electroporation and virus infection, will have a big societal and commercial impact.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe delivery of macromolecules inside of cells is a fundamental technique which enables basic scientific questions to be answered and ultimately new commercial opportunities to be developed.  At the same time, the routine delivery of biologics, particularly proteins and antibodies, is non-trivial.  We developed a novel, robust technology that enables delivery of siRNA, proteins, and antibodies into previously difficult-to-enter cell types.  During the I-Corps program, we focused on getting this technology into the market place to gain customer validation.  Our approach to customer development was two-fold:  (a) widely disseminate our information and (b)  work closely with a selected number of customers to extend the list of applications for this innovation.\nThe technology is based on the discovery of a new potent class of polymeric molecules with the unique ability to intracellularly deliver a large variety of biomolecules (small molecules, nucleic acids, proteins and even whole, intact antibodies).
