 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Louisiana at Lafayette is creating a dedicated high-speed science DMZ network infrastructure to support science and engineering faculty on campus. Various current and future research projects within the university have computational and data transfer needs that dramatically exceed beyond what existing infrastructure can support. The science DMZ delivers a next-generation packet transport service with better traffic identification, security, and application controls, and offers a 40Gbps data transfer capacity that connects all major research laboratories on campus. The infrastructure also links this campus wide connectivity to the statewide Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI), and Internet2. This infrastructure addresses major bottlenecks to scientific discovery, and provides researchers with better access to visualization venues at Louisiana Immersive Technology Enterprise (LITE), and High Performance Computing (HPC) systems available on both LONI and XSEDE. \r\n\r\nThis upgraded next-generation network infrastructure also provides increased capacity for remote visualization, telepresence, and bandwidth-intensive data transfers between computational clusters. This will be of great benefit to multiple science and engineering programs across campus in the areas of computational biology, bioinformatics, computer vision, cybersecurity, and data science. The infrastructure also supports research areas such as coastal wetland loss, epidemiology, alternative energy, and medicine that have high economic and societal impact. The project also creates exposure for students at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette to leverage this network infrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project has reached its goals in several areas for the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.  From a networking infrastructure perspective, the installation of 4 x 10 Gbps connections to the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI) was completed to reach High Performance Computing (HPC) resources in the State of Louisiana and on Internet2, at higher data rates.  The Science DMZ network was extended from its edge peering with LONI and Internet2 to connect research buildings together with multiple 40 Gbps and 10Gbps connections and delivered immediate benefits in terms of enhanced network capabilities to various research activities across campus.  Fiber extensions, to connect additional research buildings, were constructed to allow direct connections of research laboratories and computing equipment.  The work is ongoing with the University's research community to align their research activities to make use of the new Science DMZ network.  Four high-performance, monitoring tools have been installed to monitor and improve network performance.\n\nThe University has active Science DMZ connections installed in eight research centers around campus.  The comprehensive installation brings Science DMZ services to all buildings within five, separate ?campus or city block? zones.  In summary, the Science DMZ can extend 40Gbps and 10Gbps connections to more than 24 buildings across campus.  The University has ?sandbox? configurations starting up in the Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering departments.  The networking infrastructure also connects the visual analytics sandbox &ndash; an NSF MRI development effort that was commissioned in early spring 2016.  The GENI rack is now connected directly to the Science DMZ and has a direct Internet2 peering via LONI. \n\nThe infrastructure has had a positive impact on campus in terms of enabling research initiatives that take advantage of the network connectivity and offers excellent scope for innovative networking applications.  The new Science DMZ network is also helping to promote collaboration across and outside campus.  For example, the infrastructure provides research opportunities for various researchers and students that are part of the NSF Center for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) &ndash; a multi-university NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center.  Several faculty have done various training activities that leveraged the Science DMZ network for research experiments.  University faculty members have also delivered training tutorials to various international workshop participants as part of the Web Intelligence conference on visual analytics of time varying graphs &ndash; a key outcome of the MRI project that helped researchers from multiple universities.  Moreover, faculty members have supervised several graduate students and one undergraduate for the project that provided ample training and professional development opportunities on various aspects of the Science DMZ project.\n\nSeveral researchers at the UL Lafayette campus continue to develop various big data tools and methods that leverage the Science DMZ network for data storage, data pre-processing, mining, analysis, and visualization of large datasets. Without the expanded networking capacity of the Science DMZ, a lot of big data research would have been very problematic.  The upgrades to the University?s research, networking infrastructure provides distinctive benefit to the NSF CVDI and various research efforts that involve industry partners, government agencies, faculty, research staff and students. The new bandwidth and connections points within the Science DMZ will provide opportunities for enhanced data science and big data collaboration both within campus and across institutions.\n\nThe Science DMZ enabled by this project will facilitate the sharing and use of data, along with computational techniques that work across the network, amongst researchers at the University in several disciplines, including information technology.  At present, the project has directly aided two NSF funded projects for US IGNITE: these are a project for \"Collaborative Exploration in Networked VR Environments and Application to Remotely-Guided Classroom\" and \"A Virtual Crisis Information Sharing and Situational Awareness Platform for Collaborative Disaster Response.\"  It will also be used to support the research activities within CVDI via the facilitation of sharing data and resources through a high-speed network among disparate sets of researchers.  Finally, we are actively promoting the capabilities of the Science DMZ; hence, it is expected that the researchers, staff, and faculty in the School of Computing, Informatics and the Informatics Research Institute, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering will increasingly utilize the capabilities of the new network.\n\nIn the near future, it is expected that the Science DMZ infrastructure would allow the University researchers to create dedicated pipes to move data to and from the computational infrastructure of the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI).  In particular, the goal is to connect with QB-2, which is currently ranked as the 83rd fastest supercomputer in the world.\n\nIn the longer term, the Science DMZ infrastructure would permit UL Lafayette to extend its ability to (a) share data and (b) perform joint execution of software with partner organizations that are on the Internet2 system.  Target organizations include Drexel University, which is part of the CVDI.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ben Blundell"
