 "awd_abstract_narration": "While tectonic activity, climate, sea-level fluctuations, and anthropogenic activity are most often cited as important agents that control sediment transport and depositions, the role of earthquakes as agents of sediment dispersal and accumulation at active margins may be underappreciated. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake at the Japan Trench was one of the largest megathrust ruptures this century. Because the Japanese subduction system is exceptionally well instrumented, an unprecedented wealth of data are accumulating that document pre-seismic, co-seismic, and post-seismic conditions, providing the first opportunity to quantify environmental changes resulting from a megathrust earthquake. This project will integrate the analysis of existing sediment cores and geophysical data collected in the rupture area of the 2011 earthquake to unravel the contributions of coseismic sedimentation to the stratigraphy of the Japan Trench slope. The Japan Trench is the focus of a coordinated, long-term research program in Japan, and results from this study will contribute usefully to future investigations as well as strengthen an existing international collaboration. Japanese colleagues have already provided the Principle Investigators with recently acquired geophysical data and invited one of them to participate in two coring cruises. This project will further the development of underwater paleoseismology, an emerging field compared to land-based paleoseismology. Results from this study will be highly societally relevant as they are expected to contribute to the assessment of seismic hazards at the Japan Trench. They will also be applicable to the assessment of seismic hazards at other oceanic trenches, including three GeoPRISMS's focus sites (Cascadia, Aleutian, and New Zealand trenches) and the deep Puerto Rico Trench.\r\n\r\nThe Principle Investigators have already initiated collaboration with Japanese scientists to investigate the 2011 event, due to a previously funded NSF-RAPID grant. One of the Principle Investigators participated in two sediment sampling expeditions to the Japan Trench in 2013 aboard the R/V NATSUSHIMA. The preliminary analysis of 31 piston cores collected across the trench slope suggests that some of them sampled deposits from the 2011 event and from prior events. Close inspection of multibeam bathymetric data also suggests that variations in sediment characteristics along the trench are systematically correlated with variations in the morphology of the small frontal prism, the feature at the lower trench slope that absorbs most of the tectonic deformation. This project aims to further explore these results. Specifically, the combined analysis will address the following two questions:\r\n\r\n- What are the sedimentary signatures of great earthquakes across a trench slope?\r\n- How do seafloor morphology and tectonic structures affect coseismic sediment dispersal and deposition?\r\n\r\nBy analyzing the sedimentary record of past earthquakes and their relation to seafloor morphology and tectonic structures, this project will contribute simultaneously to two distinct fields of geoscience: the characterization of coseismic sedimentary processes at active margins and submarine paleoseismology.",

Where next? A few similar prior events are known (M9.4 Alaska 1964, M9.6 Chile 1960, Cascadia 1700 AD) but instrumental and historic records are clearly too short to characterize the megaquake occurrence and impacts (Figure 1). The urgent challenge is reconstructing and characterizing such events from their submarine geologic signatures, at least through the Holocene, to establish where such events are possible, to date the most recent ones, and to establish their recurrence. Available results suggest that much of the sediment deposited at active margins, has been resuspended by earthquakes and that at least some of the variability in the sedimentary features derives from differences in the earthquake excitations.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Our work characterized the signature of the 2011 Tohoku tsunamogenic super-earthquake by: 1) Quantifying for the first time the spatial extent of sediment remobilized by the earthquake and the variable thickness of the deposits. This was obtained my measuring the excess (xs)<sup>210</sup>Pb inventories obtained from 24, 10 m long piston cores and radioisotopes (<sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>134</sup>Cs) emitted by the Fukushima reactor. For the first time, our results quantified that the upper few centimeters of surface sediment had been remobilized over an area of ~10,000 km<sup>2</sup> and for 100&rsquo;s of kilometers along the strike of the Japan Trench (Figure 2).&nbsp; 2) We found that the thickest deposits (50-200 cm) were associated with the area of maximum slip as documented by previous models. 3) The great enrichment of xs<sup>210</sup>Pb measured in the cores recovered from a mid-slope terrace at 4000-6000 m of water depth revealed that only the upper few centimeters of sediment had been remobilized by the shaking of the earthquake. This discovery revealed a previously unrecognized process in subaqueous sedimentation. The spatial distribution and characteristics of these deposits may typify Tohoku 2011-like large fault slips but also other earthquake deposits in other subduction margins. These observations have the potential of characterizing the sedimentary signatures of megaquakes and of linking its extent with a rupture zone permitting to reconstruct prehistoric earthquakes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"ProposalText\"><strong>Broader Impact: </strong></p>\n<p class=\"ProposalText\"><strong><em>Benefits to Society:</em> </strong>Earthquake and tsunami hazard research is societally relevant, particularly one that addresses the class of huge events with the greatest damage potential and the least understanding. Our sediment analyses and geophysical interpretations enhanced our understanding of sedimentation processes related with extreme Mw~9 earthquakes and tsunamis and thus developed the knowledge necessary to reconstruct the prehistoric record of such events from the sedimentary record. Our results have provided new knowledge that will improve earthquake and tsunami hazard assessments and will provide scenarios helpful in informing society on risk. The results will also contribute to other hazards-related research programs including International Ocean Discovery Program and focus sites for GeoPRISMS.</p>\n<p class=\"ProposalText\"><strong><em>International Collaborations</em></strong><em>: </em>This grant allowed for the participation of US scientist (McHugh) in Japanese (<em>R/V Natsushima 13-02,13-19</em>) and German (<em>R/V Sonne 251</em>) led expeditions (Figure 3). These expeditions made available to us a wealth of core and geophysical data from the Japan Trench margin. Results have been published in peer-reviewed journals (3 papers) and presented at national and international conferences (25 abstracts). This project benefited from costly critical data that was collected and financed outside the USA. Our international collaborators are very interested in our results and future efforts because they will help them in focusing their observations along diverse active margins and in developing location-specific linkages between the stratigraphic and the earthquake records and thus addressing hazards. This project has also permitted to expand international relations, which are key to understanding earthquake and tsunami hazards for diverse tectonic settings. An international workshop sponsored by IODP and ECORD was held in Zurich in 2015 and attended by the international community working in earthquake geology (Figure 4). The workshop was held in preparation for submission of an IODP proposal. The IODP 866Full2 proposal is now on its latest stage of evaluation by the IODP panel and we have high expectations that it will be accepted for drilling in the Japan Trench. The workshop results were published in Ocean Discovery Journal and in ECORD Newsletter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Teaching and Training</em></strong><em>:</em> This project promoted teaching and training across disciplines (seismology, sedimentology, marine geology, geophysics). Two MA students and two undergraduates from Queens College, City University of New York were involved in this research. Our findings have been incorporated into the curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Queens College and The City University of New York. McHugh is in the PhD Committee of T.
