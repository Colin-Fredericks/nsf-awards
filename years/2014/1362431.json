 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Janet Braddock-Wilking of the University of Missouri-St. Louis is developing synthetic strategies for the preparation of fluorescent molecules containing silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge).  These molecules have structural features that promote strong light emission in the solid state.  Modification of the structure of these compounds allows for the development of air-stable molecules that emit blue, green, or red light for solid-state applications, for example, as components for screen displays (organic light emitting diodes) and solar cells.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the synthetic pathways for the preparation of cyclic compounds containing silicon and germanium centers incorporated into five- and six-membered carbon-based ring structures of Si and Ge derivatives of metallaloles, dibenzometalloles, and fluorescein.   The unique optoelectronic properties of the molecules are associated with their structures and are fine-tuned by incorporating a variety of conjugated peripheral groups attached to the ring structure.  The new molecules are being characterized by multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray crystallography, when possible.  Professor Braddock-Wilking continues to devote efforts to train and mentor female undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, she is currently the co-chair of the St. Louis ACS Section Women Chemists Committee.  The broader impacts of this work include societal benefits resulting from the discovery of stable and efficient luminescent compounds for components in electroluminescent solid-state applications as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students on the synthetic and characteristic techniques utilized in the preparation of the luminescent silicon- and germanium-containing cyclic compounds.",
