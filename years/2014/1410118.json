 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:   \r\nDespite decades of promise regarding renewable, environmentally safe, and highly efficient power generation, the practical realization of hydrogen and alcohol-powered fuel cells remains elusive.  The main reason that the few fuel cell powered vehicles on the road today are heavily subsidized by manufacturers is that a suitable replacement for expensive metal Pt bulk catalyst has yet to be identified.  The research effort seeks to minimize the use of Pt by confining it to only the topmost atomic layers where it is actually needed.  To achieve this; understanding of how matter transitions from an initial state consisting of clusters of individual metal atoms to the final nanocrystalline state of which catalytically active metals are composed will be developed.  New physical properties manifested at this small size range can be harnessed not only for fuel cell electrocatalysis, but for emergent technologies such as redox flow batteries (RFBs) and thermoelectric power generation (TPGs).  The educational aspect of this project aims to: (i) Enhance pre-college education and minority outreach via initiatives with local high schools. (ii) Upgrade chemical engineering curriculum with new laboratory modules that integrate recent progress in sustainable energy technology. (iii) Introduce undergraduate cross-disciplinary activities within professional societies (AIChE, ACS).\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this research is to develop safe, sustainable, and scalable chemical syntheses that produce metal nanoparticles (NPs) having bismuth as their core component.  Bi is an earth-abundant element with low toxicity and water-stability that has yet to be exploited to enhance material durability in clean, efficient power generation. The noble character of Bi makes it an attractive support for precious metal electrocatalysts required for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and fuel oxidation (hydrogen, alcohol, etc.) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).  The most efficient use of precious metals in catalysis is achieved by their surface segregation on dispersed NP cores of base metals so as to maximize their surface to volume ratio. Prior attempts in the field to implement this strategy with metals other than Bi (e.g., Ni, Co, and Fe) have failed due to their dissolution in the fuel cell environment.  In addition, Bi NP formation has proven difficult due to the use of toxic organic solvents, difficult-to-synthesize organic precursors, and dangerous hydrazine or lithium reducing agents. \r\n\r\nIn direct contrast to prior results in the field; this research will examine all-aqueous, all-inorganic synthesis processes for the growth of NPs in which SnCl2 is used as a simultaneous surfactant and reducing agent.  Bi is well known to be unstable in the high salt, low pH environment required for SnCl3- surfactant formation and therefore, these colloidal synthesis routes are unexpected.  Previously, the potential for SnCl3- ligand attachment to Bi has not been recognized.   Consequently, our initial successes with Bi-Pt NP synthesis using this unique inorganic ligand approach were very surprising.  To more fully understand these phenomena, detailed experimental characterization of the NPs will be conducted using time-resolved, in-situ X-ray and 119Sn M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopies  to study the kinetics of pure Bi and Bi-alloy NP formation and SnCl3- ligand shell evolution from the initial complex.  \r\n\r\n",

Specifically, our investigations have revealed how the ligand structure of primary particles composed of inorganic complexes in aqueous suspensions is altered during the formation of pure metal and metal alloy nanoparticles.  We have for the first time in the field provided direct evidence that Pt, Bi, and Pt-Bi alloy metal nanoparticles synthesized through redox reaction with Sn are colloidally stabilized via electrostatic repulsion of charged,  surface-adsorbed Sn ligands.   The local geometry of the Sn surface complex is a distorted tetrahedron oriented with the charged chlorides away from the nanoparticle core.

To the best of our knowledge ours is the only work since the early investigations of Sn-Pd colloids at the former Bell Laboratories over four decades ago to have examined such highly acidic suspensions at 78K in a 119Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy measurement. These materials certainly pose challenges in sealing and insuring that the seal remains intact upon cooling from 300K to 78K.  \n\nIn addition to providing stability, the surface complex serves as a capping agent with which to finely tune nanoparticle size and associated metallicity.  We have determined that such ligand formation can occur with Bi and that the Bi-Sn complexes undergo autocatalytic redox reaction which reduces Bi to its metallic state.  The resultant nanoparticles may be intercalated into flexible bi-functional electrode designs with graphene through electrostatic assembly.  These electrodes exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance relative to state-of-the art in redox flow battery (RFB) reactions. Furthermore, the presence of Bi during Pt nanoparticle synthesis is found to substantially distort Pt structure (shortening of Pt-Pt bond distance) at the nanoparticle surface relative to that of pure Pt.  This distortion occurs regardless of whether or not the Bi is alloyed with Pt.  Evidence for this phenomenon is revealed in 119Sn M&#1255;ssbauer Spectra that show a chemical shift in the local Sn environment indicating that ligand formation with Pt is favored over that of Bi, but at the same time large quadrupole splitting indicating significant impact to the local symmetry when Bi is present during synthesis.   Independent and complementary XAS measurements show that this ligand structure is associated contraction of Pt-Pt bond distance.   These structural changes yield substantial enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of practical electrode assemblies fabricated through electrostatic assembly of these nanoparticles.   Both enhanced fuel oxidation and oxygen reduction activity in redox reactions of importance to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is observed.  Our work has demonstrated that inorganic ligand redox synthesis can be used to produce Pt, Bi and Pt-Bi alloy metal nanoparticles possessing a rich variety of structure and chemistry that can be systematically tuned to produce macroscopic electrodes with exceptional electrocatalytic performance.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anastasios Angelopoulos"
