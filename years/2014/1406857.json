 "awd_abstract_narration": "Welding: Wisconsin's Ultimate Rural STEM Pathway is contextualizing math with hands-on exercises applicable to welding in order to better prepare students--both those at the high school and college level--for welding careers. Activities include professional development for high school career and technical education (CTE) and math instructors, educational materials development, welding lab equipment upgrades, and industry exploration. It provides learning communities among high school math and career and technical education instructors and college math and welding faculty, which will strengthen the quality of teaching in both the academic and technical courses. Innovative nature of integrating workforce preparation with retention in STEM disciplines is the main intellectual merit of the project.\r\n\r\nAs Wisconsin's number one producer of welding graduates in the state, NWTC is well-positioned to build a pipeline of students by intersecting math and welding curriculum. Upon successful implementation of the project in the pilot year, the Welding project aims to expand to additional rural high schools and disseminate best practices to the State's technical schools and, potentially, broader regional and/or national audiences for replication within the high-growth welding states. By the end of three years, the project aims to impact 560 undergraduate students, 162 pre-college students taking undergraduate courses, 11 college faculty, and at least 14 pre-college teachers. The contribution of the project towards workforce preparation is the main focus in terms of broader impacts.",

Through this project, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC), a two-year technical college, partnered with rural high schools (i.e., Bonduel, Kewaunee, Oconto Falls, Marinette, and Wrightstown), the NEW (Northeast Wisconsin) Manufacturing Alliance, and local industry to help increase the number of skilled workers in the welding industry and help prevent rural <em>brain drain</em>. To meet these objectives, the goals of the project were to: 1) Change perceptions of the welding industry through outreach to high school students, their parents, counselors, and teachers; 2) Strengthen the K12 welding education pipeline; and 3) Improve retention through the development of contextualized mathematics activities. The disciplinary foci were math and welding education. Activities included professional development for high school career and technical education and math instructors, educational materials development, welding lab equipment upgrades, and industry exploration to expose parents, students, and instructors to the needs and benefits of local industry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit. </strong>Math skills are essential for careers in welding; however, employers are finding applicants do not have the math skills necessary for the occupation. While NWTC is a top producer of welding technical diploma graduates in Wisconsin, the College graduates fewer than 61% of its welding technical diploma students. Instructors hypothesize math is the hurdle for most of these students, as only 73.9% of students majoring in welding passed the course with a C or better in 2013, lower than the college average. Through this project NWTC contextualized a required math course and piloted it with hands-on exercises applicable to welding to better prepare students, both those at the high school and college level, for welding careers. Data gathering across multiple years indicated that students performed better in courses that were contextualized.&nbsp; A learning community was also established among high school math and career and technical education instructors and college math and welding faculty. All learning community participants reported that these meetings were meaningful. In fact, the learning communities were originally slated to occur for one year, but because of the feedback from instructors, were held all three years of the grant due to their perceived utility. In addition to the perceived utility, cross-functional knowledge also increased. Prior to the beginning of the learning communities, a measure related to welding concepts was given to math instructors and vice versa for welding instructors.
