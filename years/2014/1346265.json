 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to create an RCN-UBE network for the purpose of providing faculty development activities at several historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Alabama. The HBCU-Alabama Biosciences Network (HBCU-ALBN) will be a community of biologists and life scientists from all ranks, diverse experiences, pedagogical approaches and scientific training who will be willing to adopt and explore recommended curriculum changes in undergraduate science education that are much needed in the HBCU system.\r\n\r\nVirtual and in-person planning meetings by the Steering Committee will proceed a workshop planned for the summer of 2014 at Alabama State University. Network activities will provide a forum to exchange examples of reforms that are underway and will challenge other faculty to incorporate active learning approaches in their classes to better engage students.  For example, faculty will consider using case studies to demonstrate the everyday relevance of what students learn in life science courses, encourage cooperative learning among students, and explore the use of new technologies in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project lie in forming a network of faculty at HBCUs who want to adopt student-centered approaches in the classroom to better engage students.  Courses for both majors and non-majors will be the focus of network activities to improve biological literacy of all students and retention of students interested in biology. Currently there is no central association of life science faculty at HBCUs in Alabama for them to share resources and information to improve undergraduate biology education.  This RCN-UBE network plans to form such a network that could serve as a model for other HBCUs and community colleges in other states.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/",
