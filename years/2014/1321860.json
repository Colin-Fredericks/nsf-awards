 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will quantify the temporal and spatial variation of the global reconnection rates for a large range of solar wind conditions. The reconnection rate will be calculated by using the change in the magnetic flux that crosses the open-to-closed field line boundary. The calculation will make use of satellite images to determine the polar cap boundary and its changes while SuperDARN observations and the AMIE technique will be used to calculate polar cap convection. The AMIE technique uses ground magnetic observations. The calculations will give the reconnection rates for both magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection. They will be carried out for a wide range of magnetospheric activity including steady magnetospheric convection events, substorms and CME and CIR storms. They will create in SuperMAG a repository of the observations and code that will allow calculations of reconnection potentials for any solar wind and magnetospheric conditions. \r\n\r\nThe work will support a graduate student and the team at APL will continue to be active in STEM education at all levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study enabled a broad range of statistical analyses, establish a basis for mode-data comparison, and create opportunities for testing current theories of circulation in the magnetosphere.  To provide these capabilities it was required to develop global gridded solutions of both the ground level magnetic field, through SuperMAG, and the global ionospheric plasma convection (or convection electric field), through SuperDARN.  Past solutions for SupreDARN observations were based on a cause-and-effect relationship between solar wind conditions measured upwind at L1 (the cause) and the ionospheric plasma convection (effect).  A relationship that require the inclusion of unknown delays as well as a series of other assumptions.  To avoid these assumptions we developed a technique that allows the derivation of gridded solutions for both SuperMAG and SuperDARN although some non-trivial solutions were required due to the differences of the datasets.  The SuperMAG solution is now available to the community through the SuperMAG website.  Several Ph.D. level students were involved in this proposal and are listed as aurthors or co-authors of the published papers and the presentation given at international scientific meetings.  As such this project had a real impacts on the individual students but also on the community as they embrace the new tools.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jesper W Gjerloev"
