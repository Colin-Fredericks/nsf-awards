 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Blue Waters system, the largest and most powerful NSF system, provides computational science and engineering teams with an effective, scalable, sustained-petascale computing platform at unmatched levels. NCSA has established a comprehensive support and outreach program by working closely with the teams that are using Blue Waters and with the larger computational science and  engineering community, to enable them to take full advantage of the extraordinary capabilities of Blue Waters as well as those provided by similar systems such as  Kraken, Stampede, Keeneland, Titan, and future petascale computing systems. \r\nThis program, named NCSA/Illinois Enhanced Intellectual Services for Petascale Performance (NEIS-P2), includes a significant community outreach component aimed at enabling the general NSF computational science and engineering community to make effective use of petascale systems. The Community Engagement component includes activities to help prepare the next generation of petascale computational experts through a coordinated set of courses, workshops, fellowships and internships.\r\nThe newly launched Blue Waters Graduate Fellows component of NEIS-P2 Community Engagement Program received more outstanding applications than can be funded with the budget available for this activity. This RAPID proposal is a request to support an additional four fellows during the 2014-2015 academic. The net result will be ten fellows supported during the first year of the Blue Waters Graduate Fellowship Program.",

Two of the four RAPID fellows were women, and one of the RAPID fellows was from an EPSCoR institution.  Each of the fellows was able to focus their scientific research on an important scientific problem utilizing the computational resources of the Blue Waters Supercomputer system.  Each of the fellows was assigned a point of contact from among the Blue Waters Science and Engineering Application Support (SEAS) group.  The SEAS staff provided the fellows with persistent consulting and advice throughout the fellowship period. \n\n \n\nThe fellowship provided an opportunity for all of the fellows to gain expertise in their chosen scientific field as well as in the use of the computational modeling that is a key to modern scientific research and development.  All of the fellows made significant progress toward their doctoral degrees and gained expertise that allowed them to qualify for internships and post-doctoral positions in industry, DOE national laboratories, and university centers.  The award contributed to increasing the diversity of the workforce in these highly technical fields.  The award has also helped to fulfill the need for a workforce with expertise in these fields that will contribute to the advancement of science and engineering in the U.S.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William T Kramer"
