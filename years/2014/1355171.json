 "awd_abstract_narration": "All organisms, including humans, cannot live without the vast microbial menagerie that lives in and around us.  Critical to understanding the vital functions of these communities is knowledge about the processes responsible for microbial species. How microbial species are generated and maintained over time, and whether they are even independent units is not known. Whitaker and colleagues combine genetic and genomic tools to define the rules of speciation in the model microorganism Sulfolobus. Their goal is to better understand the evolutionary and ecological parameters that govern how genetic material moves between individual cells and result in the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity on which we depend. \r\n\r\nA more robust understanding of microbial biodiversity will help propel discovery and innovation in a host of scientific fields, ranging from emerging infectious diseases to climate change modeling, that are being transformed by the microbial revolution.   Whitaker will extend an understanding of the microbial world and its impact on daily human life through Project Microbe, a curriculum designed to integrate microorganisms into the national K-12 education, in the college setting at the University of Illinois, and outside of the classroom through the Osher Life Long Learning at Illinois program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlthough the unseen impact of the microbial world is vast there, is a limited understanding of diversity at scales too small for the eye to see.  Until 50 years ago an entire microbial Domain of life (Archaea) that share ancestry with our own cells was undiscovered.  Through this project we have examined the origins of species in Archaea that live in the dynamic but relatively simple environment of acidic hot springs.  We have found that in Nature, genetic material is shared between individual cells through the action of infectious mobile motors making some strains more successful at spreading their genes than others. We have discovered that once DNA moves from one strain to another, genetic variation is introduced as very short pieces with equal frequency across the whole genome.  Interestingly, genes essential to archaeal life are highly localized in parts of the genome leaving other parts free to vary.  Diversity is maintained by warfare and movement of genes among individuals asymetrically.  Through this work we have brought microbiology into view for disciplines of Biology from which it is usually obscured (ecology and evolution).  We have also disseminated a broad understanding for the impact of biological diversity through Project Microbe a curriculum for high-school science teachers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rachel J Whitaker"
