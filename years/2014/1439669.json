Topic areas include hybrid and hybrid electric powertrain systems, lightweight structures, high performance computing tools for vehicle architecture optimization, conventional powertrains, frictional loss management, and advanced automotive manufacturing methods. \r\n\r\nThe University of Louisville J.B. Speed School of Engineering has committed to developing and launching an interdisciplinary graduate certificate program in automotive engineering by the end of the planning period, followed by an interdisciplinary Master of Science program in automotive engineering one year later. The university and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) plans to establish a professional chapter in this region in support of the industry. Finally the UL site will sponsor an REEGV research seminar series, student projects, and an SAE Supermileage team.",
