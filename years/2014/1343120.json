The Integers conferences, held bi-annually since 2003, serve to bring together mathematicians and students interested in combinatorics and number theory. The 2013 Integers conference will focus on the area broadlydefined as combinatorial number theory, a field in which Paul Erdos was vastly influential, and will pay tribute to his legacy. The conference will include talks on such topics as additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, combinatorial games, Ramsey theory, elementary number theory, and sequences.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature several plenary speakers and about fifty additional speakers.  In addition to the plenary speakers, a major portion of the funding will support a good number of graduate students, younger faculty, and female mathematicians. The conference will include at least ten student research talks. It will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career stages from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished researcher. The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the journal Integers.",
