 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect flight has motivated many research studies in the biology and engineering communities.  For biologists, such studies provide critical insights into sensory/motor coordination in animals.  For engineers, such studies have potential applications to autonomous micro-aerial vehicles.  The objective of this research is to develop a simulation model of insect flight that incorporates the major contributing components of the insect anatomy, as well as accommodating realistically large wing rotations. This significant advance in the analysis and modeling of insect flight will be possible only through an integrated interdisciplinary effort by engineers and biologists.  Many attempts have been made to understand the structural dynamics of insect flight, however the results are far from complete.  For example, most previous flight research isolates the wing dynamics, and ignores the supporting anatomy that real insects need to generate and transmit wing forces.  Previous studies of insect muscle and exoskeleton consider only very small movements.  However it is almost certain that extrapolation of very small movements is insufficient to capture the large wing rotations and muscle and thorax contractions of a real flying insect.  The results of this project could enable future autonomous machines of great benefit to society, such as micro-aerial vehicles for disaster relief. \r\n\r\nThis project will advance the state of the art in insect flight modeling by three major research tasks. The first task is to model large 3-dimensional rotations of the wings. This will be done using finite element analyses of a static wing followed by a correction for 3-dimensional rotation effects, such as Coriolis coupling. The second task is reduced-order modeling at the system level, by conducting component-mode synthesis from the wing and thorax. The third task is to validate the models by conducting calibrated experiments using an artificial wing in a vacuum chamber. This research is transformative and translational. It transforms the research area of insect flight/structural dynamics by injecting novel ideas, such as system-level modeling, capability to incorporate 3-dimensional finite rotation, and reduced-order modeling to abstract sensori-motor coordination. It will also allow understanding of how muscle activation affects flying conditions and strain receptors in the wing and vice versa. The knowledge gained from insect flight/structural dynamics can be transferred directly to micro-aerial vehicle applications.",

This study not only provides critical insights to sensori-motor coordination of movement in animals, but also has potential applications to realize autonomous flying objects, such as micro-aerial vehicles.  There were three specific goals to achieve. \n\n \n\nThe first goal was to model a compliant wing that undergoes finite, 3-dimensional rotation (i.e., roll, pitch, and yaw) at the wing base.  We achieved it by conducting finite element analyses of a static wing and subsequently incorporate possible 3-dimensional rotation effects (e.g., Coriolis coupling).

The contribution of the Coriolis force to the total response is substantially larger than the contribution from the other two forces in both forward and hovering flights.\n\n \n\nThe second goal was to validate the compliant wing model by conducting calibrated experiments using an artificial wing in air and in vacuum.  We built a test rig consisting of two coupled servomotors in a vacuum chamber.  The coupled servomotors held the artificial wing, and provided dual axis angular control among the three rotations (i.e., roll, pitch, and yaw).  A strain gage was attached to the wing near its base to measure the wing response.  Aerodynamic forces were found to have a maximal contribution of 15% to the strain.  The theoretical predictions were very closed to the experimental measurements in vacuum.\n\n \n\nThe third goal was to obtain a reduced-order model at the system level.  We achieved this goal by integrating the compliant wing, steering muscles, and thorax.  First, we developed an integrative multi-physics flapping wing flight model to (1) identify the role of steering muscles and stroke deviation angle on insect posture control, and (2) determine the relative magnitude of aerodynamic and inertial torques during insect steering maneuvers.  The most significant outcome was the notion that inertial torques may have a nontrivial effect on insect steering.  Previous to this work, it was widely believed insect steering was dominated by aerodynamic forces. We then developed a general reduced-order model to prove that compliant insect wings abate the energetic costs of flapping-wing flight.  Wing kinematics and fundamental frequency determined through energy expenditure optimization agreed closely with experimentally measured values for the Hawkmoth Manduca sexta.  Finally, based on the relative magnitude of wing-generated reaction forces and measured power muscle forces, we believe the thorax likely behaves as a harmonic source driving the compliant wings.\n\n \n\nFor dissemination of research results, the award led to 4 journal papers: three published and one in preparation.  The award also led to publication of 2 conference papers, and one of the conference papers won a best paper award.  For engineering education, the award had partially supported 1 postdoctoral associate, 1 PhD student, 1 MS student, and research experience for 2 undergraduate students.  One of these students was female.  For research infrastructure, this research had established a close collaboration between the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Biology. Research results were also publicized annually in University of Washington Discovery Day to educate K-12 students how knowledge of vibration, dynamics, sensors, and actuators could improve our life.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: I.
