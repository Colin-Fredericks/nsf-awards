 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the advances in science in the last 400 years come not merely from researchers working by themselves, but rather from a community of scholars cooperating and competing in pursuit of shared goals.  Critical components of this community are built from scholarly citation, which turn isolated works into a network of scholarship that can be navigated and mined.  For centuries, the outcome of such scholarly endeavors were written publications.  With the coming of the digital age, new forms of scholarly output, such as data collections and digital publications have become commonplace. Unfortunately, the practices of citation and attribution that have been the mainstay of written publications are insufficient for this new digital world.  A citation for digital data needs to be more descriptive than a reference to the location of the item; it needs to describe what the data is, where it came from, and how it was produced. This research will yield new techniques, tools and demonstrations of an extended citation service that uses data provenance, a formal record of how an object came to be in its current form. This extended citation service will facilitate activities such as research reproduction and attribution.\r\n\r\nThe provenance-enabled data citation system developed in this work will both be embedded in an existing data platform (specifically, Dataverse) as well as functioning as a standalone service.  The system addresses the following set of specific data citation challenges: It directly includes executable transformations for a limited, but important set of tools: R and SQL.  For other tools, it provides a standardized documentation capability to describe transformations.  The system is sufficiently flexible to serve either as part of a publication workflow, where data is part of a more conventional publication, or in support of a standalone publication.  It also provides data summaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nData provenance is a record of how digital items, such as documents, data, spreadsheets, or programs came to be in their present state.  In the context of computational science, digital provenance enables researchers to reproduce others' work and provides a description of the scientific process.  Without data provenance, many experiments cannot be reproduced and validated.  While there exist many ways for researchers to share their programs and data, it is surpring that making the programs and data available is insufficient to allow others to reproduce and/or extend the work.  Existing archival solutions do not provide any way for researchers to provide the data provenance that would enable others to work their programs and data.  This research addresses exactly this problem.\nThe Dataverse Network software project started at Harvard?s Institute for Quantitative Social Science is a framework to publish, cite and preserve research data. Instances of Dataverse allow researchers to archive and publish their digital products, such as data and software, as citable artifacts. This project extends Dataverse to include storage and management of data provenance.  When researchers archive data and the programs that manipulate that data, they can now optionally upload data provenance, describing the process that produced the published results.  There are several benefits that arise from this capability.\nFirst, the presence of data provenance should make more research results more reproducible.  This means that different researchers can validate research, providing more confidence in the reported results.  Second, data provenance allows more precise tracking of changes to data and processes.  It is not uncommon for researchers to release new versions of data sets.  However, when they do so, it is frequently difficult to determine precisely what has changed and why the changes were made.  Data provenance documents what changed and may provide insight into why it changed as well.  Third, researchers whose data sets are particularly valuable and get reused can get credit for their contribution through citations more readily.  For example, if all researchers took advantaqge of such data provenance tracking, it would allow someone to answer the question, \"What other studies used this particular data set?\"\n\nThe software produced for this project is available in open source from GitHub and is integrated into the Dataverse source code, which will be publicly released in the second quarter of 2018.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Margo I Seltzer"
