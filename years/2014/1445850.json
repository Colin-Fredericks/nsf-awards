The project aims at formalizing and enhancing the coordination of a2dc members through the coordination of a network that will bring the data facilities together on an annual basis. This will support new coordinated outreach to the science community to help researchers identify and use the services that are available to them and for the centers to ensure they are more effectively serving the widest possible audience, including international stakeholders.",

Out of this self-organizing effort came the recognition that while each data facility serves a different segment of the polar community, improved coordination and better integration of our data resources would significantly benefit the broad and multi-disciplinary community engaged in polar science.

The overall goal of this project was to formalize and enhance the coordination of a2dc members through workshops, outreach and engagement at AGU Fall Meetings, and identifying other mechanisms to better serve and support the polar science community.\n \nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe actual funding amount for the a2dc RCN was reduced significantly from the original proposal (we received less than 25% of the requested amount, and notably no funding support for the project CoPIs), and in turn the scope of work had to be altered. Despite this scaling back, we were committed to improve coordination among the a2dc facilities, and the effort was very successful.
