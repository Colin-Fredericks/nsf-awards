 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jack Saltiel of The Florida State University is determining the response of molecules of biological interest to excitation by light absorption. The research focuses on (i) processes involved in the photobiological and industrial formation of vitamin Ds, (ii) the photochemical properties of resveratrol, a molecule found in the skin of grapes that has many medicinal qualities and is thought to be responsible for the \"French Paradox\", the beneficial effect of wine drinking, and (iii) the chemical behavior of certain arylacetylenes that are attractive candidates for use in light induced cancer cell death. The research is performed by students at all levels and Professor Jack Saltiel has a proven record of attracting many of them to highly successful scientific careers.\r\n \r\nFindings from this project provide the experimental foundations which test theoretical predictions of the behavior of electronically excited states. The theory of electronically excited states is a scientific frontier whose progress relies on valid experimental conclusions such as those provided by this project.  Sophisticated computer-based quantitative chemometrics analyses of spectral matrices are being developed which are widely applicable in chemical research. Detection of resveratrol photo products in nature has medicinal implications. Research on the arylpyridylacetylenes is in collaboration with Professor Igor Alabugin whose research group has synthesized them and shown them to be highly effective as DNA double strand photocleavers.",
