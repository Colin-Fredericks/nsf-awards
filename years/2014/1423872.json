 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several misconceptions about language are pervasive in our culture. For example, it is common for people to think that American English is uniform, except for some differences in pronunciation (\"accents\"). This is not true: in addition to lexical and phonological differences, American English also exhibits morphological and syntactic diversity across its varieties.  It is also common to think that, for any language, there is a variety that instantiates it at its best, while other varieties represent departures from the norm and are somehow inferior (less pure, rich, sophisticated, etc.). This is also not true: research in linguistics unambiguously shows that every language comes in many varieties, both diachronically and synchronically, and that such varieties have similarly rich and sophisticated grammatical systems. Creating broader awareness of these findings of linguistics can help to correct these misconceptions, and lead to a broader understanding and acceptance of diversity, linguistic and otherwise.\r\n\r\nMany facets of syntactic diversity in American English are still not fully understood. This project aims to clarify some of them to better understand a variety of complex properties across different grammatical systems. The research has two main goals. One is to build an atlas of varieties of American English based on syntactic differences, providing graphic representations of areas where people use different syntactic constructions. The other goal is to shed light on an issue that is important to our understanding of human language, namely syntactic differences between pronouns (e.g. \"they\") and noun phrases (e.g. \"the students\"). The researchers will administer surveys designed to elicit acceptability judgments on sentences using Amazon Mechanical Turk. They will analyze the results of these surveys, plot the distribution of various constructions on maps, and conduct interviews with a subset of survey participants. The results will contribute to our understanding of pronouns as well as our broad knowledge of how speakers of the relevant constructions are distributed, geographically and socially, across the United States. The surveys will also include numerous other test sentences, which will serve as pilot studies to plant the initial seeds for a syntactic dialect atlas of the United States. This latter sub-project, we expect, will promote greater communication and cross-fertilization between dialectologists and theoretical syntacticians.",

This construction turned out to be widely accepted in the South, but generally rejected in the North and the West. (See Map 1.)

Contrary to our expectations, we discovered it is distinct from sentences like&nbsp;<em>I need me some jeans,&nbsp;</em>which has a very different&nbsp;geographic distribution. We discovered Dative Presentatives are part of a larger pattern, including related constructions like&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;ll be right back with you some tea&nbsp;</em>&lsquo;&hellip;with some tea for you&rsquo;, which have a similar geographic distribution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">New Methodologies for Studying Geographic Variation in Syntax</span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We aimed to develop new ways of studying syntactic dialect variation, including an online survey methodology and new geographic analysis techniques. The surveys asked participants to judge sentences for acceptability from of 1-5. We asked where participants were raised to place their judgments geographically. We mapped the results using techniques that have not previously been used on this kind of data. We used the&nbsp;<em>G<sub>i</sub>*</em>&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;&mdash;to determine where judgments are especially high or low. We used &ldquo;interpolation&rdquo; to visualize the expected judgment for every part of a map. Beyond visualization, we used interpolation to average across similar constructions and create &ldquo;meta-regions&rdquo; to compare the judgments of different populations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We also used interpolation to measure/compare the geographical &ldquo;markedness&rdquo; of constructions. Compare the maps (attached) for&nbsp;<em>Here&rsquo;s you some fun ideas</em>and&nbsp;<em>Here are you some books</em>. (Green dots indicate participants who accept a sentence, black dots participants who reject it; red borders indicate hot spots, blue borders cold spots.) Both are most highly accepted in the South. However, interpolation tells us that&nbsp;<em>Here are you some books&nbsp;</em>is more marked: the dark shade covers approximately 1,000,000 square kilometers, whereas the dark shade for&nbsp;<em>Here&rsquo;s you some fun ideas&nbsp;</em>covers 1,600,000 square kilometers. We hypothesize that the difference is connected to the agreeing/non-agreeing verb (<em>are/'</em><em>s</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Using these methods, we collected data for over 20 other constructions. We also discovered systematic variation in sentences like&nbsp;<em>I have yet to eat</em>&nbsp;and in the use of&nbsp;<em>that&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>as a relative pronoun like&nbsp;<em>whose&nbsp;</em>(<em>a book that&rsquo;s cover is ripped</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">Resources for Studying American English</span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We developed resources for further study of American English.
