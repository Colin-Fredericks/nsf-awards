 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tri-state region of Pennsylvania (PA), West Virginia, and Ohio has a high density of industries that require a technologically skilled workforce; in particular, highly-skilled and well-educated process technicians. To address this need, the Community College of Beaver County in collaboration with local high schools, the Beaver County Career and Technical Center, five community colleges in Texas, and four regional industry partners are developing an associate degree in process technology. Regional assets to support this effort include the necessary infrastructure for expansion of the types of industries that employ process technicians, abundant natural resources, human capital, and existing industries. The college is geographically located in the center of two prime shale natural gas resource areas and close to a chemical, energy, and manufacturing corridor. Existing petrochemical facilities include NOVA Chemicals and BASF and a site targeted by Shell Oil for the construction of an ethane cracker plant. The goal of the project is to identify and prepare a diverse human capital stream to meet the current and future process technology industry needs in the tri-state region. Specific objectives are to (1) enhance and develop industrial and community partnerships; (2) adopt, customize, and implement a Texas-based process technology curriculum; (3) develop a Career Pathways Program for high school students, and articulation agreements with four-year colleges and universities; and (4) increase enrollment and retention of women in process technology programs.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum is being made available to 14 community colleges in PA and other institutions in the tri-state region.  The Career Pathways Program and articulations may be adapted and adopted by other process technology programs across the nation at high schools, community colleges and universities. In addition to regional and state-wide partnerships, the college has strong networks across the United States through the Strategic Horizons Network, Achieving the Dream, the American Association of Community Colleges and the League for Innovation in the Community College. Project knowledge is being shared through presentations at regional and national conferences and by hosting delegations with similar program interests. In collaboration with the National Institute for Women in Trades & Technology, the college is developing outreach and recruitment efforts to increase enrollment of female students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to benefit society as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe Texas-based North American Process Technology Alliance curriculum, developed under an ATE grant, is being adapted to include an associate degree, stackable credentials, and non-credit articulations to allow graduates to start or stop out at different points. It is being customized for competency-based, hybrid delivery for inclusion of incumbent workers. The project is also developing a Career Pathways Program for middle-school and high-school students through the creation of Career Awareness Workshops and dual enrollment opportunities for recruitment. Networks of support from higher education, industry and government are critically important to the recruitment and retention of all students in technology and engineering programs. The curriculum is designed to provide a broad base of mathematics, science, computer literacy, process technology, soft skills (reliability, leadership, communication, and conflict resolution) and hands-on mechanical aptitude development.",

Also, the College has established a 40 member industry advisory board for the process technology program (PTEC) that meets quarterly to review curriculum, identify equipment needs, identify training/hiring needs, and serve as guest lecturers and part-time instructors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Adopt, customize, and implement Texas-based process technology curriculum for the tristate region ? </strong>In collaboration with college partners in Texas and the North American Process Technology Association (NAPTA), CCBC was able to adapt industry-recognized curriculum into an applied science associates degree in Process Technology. With the help of approximately 40 industry partners, the College was able to identify the core competencies of the curriculum in nine core courses. The first cohort began in January 2015; the program has one full-time and six part-time faculty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Develop a Career Pathways Program (career awareness workshops, dual-enrollment courses, and four-year articulation agreements)</strong> - CCBC expanded partnerships with area high schools and created a PTEC STEM High School Academy (dual enrollment). This academy allows high school juniors and seniors to attend classes on campus and earn up to 28 college credits upon high school graduation. Also, CCBC utilized relationships with workforce agencies such as Job Training of Beaver County, Inc. and PA Careerlink to train dislocated workers and veterans. In addition, the project assisted in the development of articulation agreements for PTEC with four-year institutions regionally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. &nbsp;<strong>Increase enrollment/retention of women in process technology programs</strong> - Enrollment has steadily increased, with a total of 123 students, over a three year period, including 26 females (an average of 20% during the project). Six female students have been hired by area downstream manufacturing companies. &nbsp;CCBC and its industry partners have committed to recruiting/retaining female and minority student populations. To date, Nova Chemicals and Shell have committed over $100,000 in scholarship funds for PTEC students, with a focus on underserved individuals.&nbsp; Also, CCBC completed training for faculty, staff, and administrators through the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology and Science that helped inform recruiting and retention plans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Accomplishments/next steps include:</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As of August 2018, 33 students have graduated from CCBC?s Process Technology program, 26 are employed in the industry, 1 has continued his education, and 6 are unconfirmed.</p>\n<p>The outreach and awareness initiated with this project has led to additional funding from the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, Chevron, and ARC to support a coalition of educational institutions, workforce and economic development organizations, industry and non-profit entities entitled, the Tristate Energy and Advanced Manufacturing (TEAM) Consortium. This CCBC-led consortium covers a 27 county area in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and Northern West Virginia. The goal is to partner to support clear and accessible pathways to jobs in energy and advanced manufacturing, increase career awareness, develop and share curricula across state and institutional boundaries, and build a pipeline of skilled workers.</p>\n<p>CCBC has been able to expand the PTEC training space with an externally funded five million dollar renovation project that includes new training labs, a pilot plant, simulation software, and hands-on trainers.</p>\n<p>As a convener and educational leader, CCBC has assisted workforce agencies in placing dislocated and diverse individuals. The program has also allowed high school students to earn college credit in high school. Industry partners have benefited from hiring CCBC graduates.</p>\n<p>The success of CCBC's Process Technology program has led to additional funding to further develop the program. The TEAM Consortium and Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit program model (new NSF grant) are examples of this growth. The curriculum modification and tristate partnership will now allow the College to build program capacity, educate the technician workforce required to meet the needs of the region, increase program accessibility for non-traditional students and incumbent workers from the Appalachian Region interested in an associate degree in process technology, and expand partnerships to increase collaboration
