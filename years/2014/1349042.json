 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basic questions remain unanswered about the cognitive and neural processes that underlie language processing. One issue that all cognitive and neural theories of language processing must answer is how a speaker is able to quickly and efficiently retrieve a given word during spoken language production, from the tens of thousands of words that she knows. The goal of the proposed research activity is to test hypotheses about i) how the system resolves which word should be uttered, and ii) how the system determines when that word should be selected for speech. The proposed research activity involves a series of experiments in which response latency is used to test hypotheses about the cognitive processes involved in language production. Experiments are conducted with native English speakers at the University of Rochester (USA) as well as with native Italian Speakers at the University of Padova (Italy). In addition, an Electroencephalography (EEG) study of the processes underlying overt language production will be conducted at the University of Padova and a parallel functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study will be conducted at the University of Rochester. These two neural studies will answer basic questions about the temporal and anatomical organization of the processes involved in retrieving words in overt speech production.\r\n\r\nFulfillment of the aims of this research activity will address the fundamental nature of the cognitive and neural processes that support word retrieval spoken language production. This will have implications for rehabilitation of language abilities in brain damaged patients, improvement of protocols for facilitating the acquisition of second languages, and will place important constraints on computational models of language processing. Furthermore, undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to participate in an international exchange program to expand their research skills and interests.",
