 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-agent robotics is increasingly important as society moves toward greater automation. Because they are more inexpensive than more complex robots and can cover a greater area, teams of simple robots (also known as swarm robots) can be very useful for applications such as mapping, search-and-rescue, or precision agriculture.  In many situations, human control of a robot swarm is necessary; however, the method in which this happens is difficult to define.  The question about how the operator should control the swarm (individual vs controlling the leader) remains unanswered.  If the operator controls the leader, it becomes difficult to understand how the operator could also control other factors, such as the formation of the swarm.  Solutions to this problem will be situation-dependent, and the problem becomes more difficult as the number of robots in the team increases. This project will explore control strategies for large-scale multi-agent robot teams and analyze the corresponding effect on the controllability of the system.  This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jun-Ichi Imura of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, an expert in large-scale networked control systems who has developed novel model reduction techniques that will be used in this project.\r\n\r\nWhen working with a complex networked system, ideally the system should be reduced to a more manageable model in order to assist human comprehension and facilitate interactions with the system.  However, when standard methods are used for this process, the input-output relationship is approximated and the internal network topology is lost; this would be detrimental for applications of multi-agent systems such as formations or mapping in which the network structure is very important. Thus, clustered model reduction methods were developed, resulting in a nested network model which is more easily understood while still retaining the underlying network topology. The project will apply clustered model reduction to large-scale robot teams for ease of control by a human operator. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

Because they are more inexpensive than more complex robots and can cover a greater area, teams of simple robots (also known as swarm robots) can be very useful for applications such as mapping, search-and-rescue, or precision agriculture.

Solutions to this problem will be situation-dependent, and the problem becomes more difficult as the number of robots in the team increases.  This project explores control strategies for large-scale multi-agent robot teams and analyze the corresponding effect on the controllability of the system.  Specifically, clustered model reduction was applied to robot swarms in order to make them more manageable for human control.  The use of clustered model reduction results in a nested network model that preserves the internal network topology, an essential aspect of a multi-agent system.  The research was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jun-Ichi Imura of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, an expert in large-scale networked control systems who has developed novel model reduction techniques.\n\n \nThe PI learned two methods of model reduction during the award period.  The first, for use on first-order systems, requires positive tridiagonalization of the system.  Then, the nodes or agents are clustered following the algorithm developed by Ishizaki et al.  The PI worked briefly with this method, creating examples and simulations in Matlab, before switching to the second-order method for applications in robotics.\n\n \n\nThe second-order model reduction method requires first finding the first-order representation of the original system.  Then, the controller-Hessenberg form is used to provide a serially cascaded structure that aids in clustering.  The aggregated model is then obtained by characterizing the system in the frequency domain.  The strength of clustering depends on a parameter, theta, that can be varied to obtain different aggregated systems.\n\nThe PI attempted to use the second-order reduction method to simulate a large multi-agent robot system.  The aim is to determine whether the aggregated model can provide the desired results.  For instance, given a certain goal, a control input can be calculated for the aggregated system, saving computation time compared to the original, much larger system.  However, if the same input is applied to the original system, does it show the desired results?  Using control systems analysis, the PI was able to show that the control input calculated for a reduced system will also control the original system as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shelly Bagchi"
