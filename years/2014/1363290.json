The HPCA Symposium, a top-tier conference on computer architecture related research, has enjoyed a rich history of success. The research results presented at HPCA conferences have shown strong impacts in this research field and are highly regarded among the computer architecture community. Students have much to gain from attending HPCA such as learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of expertise.\r\n\r\nThe importance of formal verification is becoming widely accepted. Increasing the attendance of students in HPCA will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.",
