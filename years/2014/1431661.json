 "awd_abstract_narration": "Databases are important in many disciplines for the storage and retrieval of information. However, database courses for undergraduates are typically only available as an upper-level elective course for computer science or business majors. This project builds on the successes of an earlier research project that introduced database concepts to students in many majors through animations using a visual and dynamic presentation with images and color. Visualization is an effective technique for instruction because it engages student interest and enhances their learning. In the earlier project, two animations were developed: one to introduce what databases are and a second to introduce how to retrieve the information stored in a database by asking questions, called queries. The goal for this project is for educators in diverse academic disciplines to incorporate the animations in their existing courses. To support this goal, the animations are customizable to different examples for various majors. Another goal is to develop an additional animation on how to organize data for storage in a database using visual diagrams. An enhancement to all animations is planned to provide a built-in quizzing mechanism so that the student can receive immediate feedback on what they are learning. The quizzes encourage student to learn and review the animation and do not to provide a grade to an instructor. Another goal of the project is to develop visual tools to assist instructors with the customization of the animation example to their discipline. As part of this project, the animations will be customized to additional STEM domains, specifically statistics, forensics, and ecology. \r\n\r\nThis research is expected to provide valuable contributions for improving STEM learning by providing customizable animations with self-assessment that introduce students from many majors to various database concepts. Another significant contribution is the investigation of a customizable self-assessment framework to incorporate within it the extensible animations for these database concepts. This self-evaluation is a necessary component for providing formative feedback to a student progressing thru these database concepts using the animations to improve their comprehension. Finally, the ability to customize the animations and the assessment questions is an important component of the research. This customization process uses XML technologies within the development environment, thus developing visual tools to assist in the customization of the animations for other disciplines.",

However, database courses are typically only available as an elective for computer science undergraduates at the upper level. This project builds on the successes of an earlier one in using the pedagogical tool of visualization for introducing database concepts to diverse majors. In the earlier project two computer visualizations, with color and images in a dynamic presentation, were developed. The first, \"IntroDB,\" introduces relational databases and how they differ from spreadsheets. The second, \"QueryDB,\" covers querying of databases. Further, these animations were customized for two different disciplines: Geographic Information Systems and Computational Molecular Biology.</p>\n<p>The current project's goals continue that established framework. One goal is the development of a third visualization, \"DesignDB,\" also customizable, which explains how to model data and then map the model to a relational database. Another objective is the design of a framework within all three animations that provides students with an opportunity to assess their understanding. A third goal includes the development of tools to assist in the customization process, again for all three animations. A final goal is to extend the customization domains to include new disciplines. Naturally, the investigators also intended to evaluate and assess the success of these goals.</p>\n<p>In order to confirm the intellectual merit of the project, the investigators would disseminate their findings among quality venues, including fairly competitive ones. Further, their outreach and creation of a community of like-minded scholars and educators would make a convincing case for the project's broader impact.</p>\n<p>This report describes below how they succeeded in meeting these goals. Several figures, typically sample screen shots from visualizations, illustrate specific accomplishments. First, the investigators did indeed produce a third animation, DesignDB. &nbsp;Figure 1 presents the Entity-Relationship Model for a database's conceptual design and demonstrates visually how to map it to e relational database schema. Along with this third visualization, the project incorporated \"checkpoints\" in all three visualizations. This feature allows learners to test their understanding and includes a running progress report as well as explanations of all questions (Figure 2). Next, several scholars customized the visualizations to their own respective domains, including such new ones as Astronomy, Environmental Science, Forensic Science and Statistics. For example, Figure 3 shows the QueryDB customization to Astronomy.&nbsp; A related goal that was achieved is the creation of a friendly, graphical interface to assist in the customization process. Figure 4 shows one step in that CreateDB tool.</p>\n<p>Further accomplishments of the project include ongoing improvements to all created visualizations. These improvements reflected feedback by the project staff and by the general community. Of note is the revised color schemes in order to make the visualizations more accessible to users with color vision deficiency (Figure 5 shows a \"before\" and \"after\" scheme).</p>\n<p>For demonstrating its intellectual merit, this project's investigators' papers and presentations appeared in several strategic venues, including IEEE's Transactions on Education (2015), American Society for Engineering Education Conference (2017), ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education's (\"SIGCSE\") Technical Symposium (2018), and ACM Inroads Magazine (accepted, to appear); in addition, further papers are under review and in preparation to continue disseminating the project's results. The PI's were also invited to participate in the NSF Showcase at SIGCSE (2016, 2017). Further, their posters were accepted at the NSF Symposium (2016), ASEE (2017), and Consortium of Computer Science in Colleges- Eastern (2017), where their poster (Figure 6) was awarded first prize among faculty submissions. Finally, several of their colleagues presented their customization accomplishments at their own professional meetings in Ecology, Statistics and Forensic Science.</p>\n<p>The Principal Investigators' efforts to broaden the impact of their project also met with success. This included both the creation of two significant web sites and the offering of several workshops and tutorials for their colleagues.
