 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Master Teaching Fellowship (MTF) Phase II proposal, involves adding 18 Master Teachers to an ongoing project at Math for America Los Angeles (MfA LA), a collaborative program sponsored by the University of Southern California, Claremont Graduate University and Harvey Mudd College.  The MTFs will work with a cohort of 12 early career teachers to create teams of teacher leaders within a middle or high school who can foster reform efforts that raise student achievement.   MTFs will also team teach with early career teachers.  This novel strategy will accelerate the transfer of expertise from experienced teachers to novice teachers, while allowing both groups to develop their leadership capacity. The project will be conducted in partnership with the Los Angeles, Claremont, Pomona, Hacienda/La Puente, Chaffey Joint, Union, Duarte, and Glendale unified school districts.\r\n\r\nA key idea of MfA LA's MTF program is that there is no better way for teachers to develop their leadership capacity than to directly engage in the work of designing and orchestrating student-centered changes in their schools and districts. Applicants will identify some critical need in their school and propose efforts to bring about improvements; student learning outcomes will be a central part of these proposed projects. Master Teachers from the same school site must apply to the program in pairs so that they will have a greater chance of bringing about real, sustained change. This project integrates the common features of teacher professional development that translate to the highest levels of student performance.  These include (a) a coherent framework combining pedagogical content and assessment knowledge, (b) alignment with the teacher's school curriculum and learning goals for students, and state or district, and (c) the integration of learning with coaching, mentoring and participation in communities with colleagues among others.  Data generated through assessment and evaluation should support the rationale that this strategy will enhance the preparation and commitment of the MTFs and their students.  Formative and summative evaluation will focus on whether or not the project objectives have been met and the effectiveness of project activities.  Assessment will include both qualitative and quantitative data collected through student surveys (the Minnesota Math Attitude Inventory), classroom observations, and teacher surveys.  Dissemination of the project results will provide a model for using small teams of teachers to lead reform efforts within a school.  The work will be presented at annual regional and national meetings of the Mathematics Science Research Institute.",

Supported by a fundingfrom the National Science Foundation (NSF# 1439917), the MfA LA MTF program was developed to attract experienced and highly educated math teachers improve the teaching of mathematics in their schools and districts. The MfALA EC program was developed to provide mentoring and coaching to beginning teachers to facilitate growth into effective instructors and school leaders. The four (EC) and five-year (MTF) program involved multiple program activities, such as professional development (PD) meetings and support for regional or national conference attendance. Program activities for MTFs also included participating in a partner based school site project; an additional common planning period to enact school site project; and support for National Board Certification. ECs received coaching support from experienced teachers who provided additional mentorship and feedback. With the support of NSF, MfALA supported 19 MTFs and 15 ECs. However, three ECs continued into the MTF program therefore 31 individual Fellows were supported over the grant period.</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual Merit</em></p>\n<p><em></em>MfA LA has helped teachers deepen their mathematics content knowledge and pedagogical skills as well as provided teachers with resources and support to carry outmeaningful change in their schools and district.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fellow Retention. </span>The MfA LA EC program sought to retain the new teachers and facilitate the development of leadership skills to improve student outcomes in mathematics.

ECs and MTFs consistently reported the community and support provided by MfA LA was one of the greatest benefits oftheir participation the program. The facilitation of community and support provided by MfALA was a primary reason Fellows attributed to remaining in the program and the teaching profession. Almost all of the supported ECs and MTFs (30 out of 31, 97%) taught with another MfALA Fellow at least one year during their participation. Only four Fellows supported by the grant did not complete their full commitment to the program and all Fellows who completed the program were in the classroom during the 2020-21 school year. At least one year after completing their commitment, a total of 25 (80%) Fellows had or will continue to remain in the program in some capacity including either renewing their commitment or continuing their involvement in program activities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Teacher Efficacy and Leadership.</span> Self-reported survey data indicate that MTFs? teaching efficacy and attitudes about PD notably increased throughout their time in MfALA.
