 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a fundamental biological question of basic and practical importance: How does the genome of an infectious RNA virus evolve to infect a host? The proposed activities will contribute new knowledge to answer this question. In the long-term, such a knowledge base may enable development of new methods for predicting the emergence of new infectious agents and for developing new anti-viral therapeutics. A universal structural feature of viral and subviral RNAs is the presence of many loops and bulges flanked by stems. These are often described as unpaired regions without specific structural and functional definitions. This project seeks to demonstrate that these regions in fact display structural features and mediate key functions. These include viral replication and systemic movement throughout the host. The project provides interdisciplinary training for undergraduate/graduate students and postdocs. Through collaboration with an inner-city high school, the project will also greatly enhance secondary education by involving participation of high school students from underrepresented groups including African American, African, Hispanic/Latino and women. \r\n\r\nRecent crystal structure studies on rRNAs and some other RNAs demonstrate that the vast majority of loops/bulges are highly structured three-dimensional (3D) motifs with well-defined geometry formed by non-Watson-Crick base pairs, and that these motifs often mediate RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and RNA-small ligand interactions. This project will test the hypothesis that 3D motifs in an infectious RNA function as a critical constraint on the evolution of RNA sequence variants. Towards this end Aim 1 will test whether Potato spindle tuber viroid RNA 3D motifs mediate replication and systemic trafficking and constrain the RNA sequence evolution. Aim 2 will test whether specific RNA motif-protein interaction is a major mechanism for the 3D motif constraint. The new principles and research tools developed from this project may significantly advance research in a number of emerging frontiers of RNA-based gene regulation in different organisms ranging from bacteria, to plants to humans. These include (i) mechanism and evolution of recently discovered noncoding RNA-templated transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to regulate gene expression, (ii) structural basis of gene regulation by recently discovered cellular noncoding circular RNAs, and (iii) mechanisms of RNA structure-mediated intercellular trafficking of cellular RNAs to regulate gene expression at the organismal level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addresses a biological question of basic and practical importance:  How does an infectious RNA genome evolve to infect a host?  A feature of all viral and subviral (e.g. viroid) RNA secondary structure models is the presence of loops and bulges flanked by stems comprised of canonical Watson-Crick (WC) A/U and G/C base pairs.  These loops/bulges are often dismissed as unpaired regions lacking specific structure or function.  However, recent crystal structures of ribosomal and other RNAs have revealed that most are highly structured three-dimensional (3D) motifs formed by non-WC base pairs and other interactions.  These 3D motifs often mediate RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and RNA-small ligand interactions.  In addition, G/U pairs are found in stem regions of many structured RNAs, and the functions of these uniquely flexible base pairs are incompletely understood.  We hypothesized that most, and perhaps all, loops/bulges in an infectious RNA genome represent 3D motifs that regulate distinct functions during replication and systemic infection, and thus constrain the evolution of RNA sequence variants.  Likewise, G/U pairs in stem regions are also likely to play important roles in replication and RNA trafficking between cells and systemically through the vascular system.\n\n      This hypothesis was tested by infecting Nicotiana benthamiana plants with Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), an infectious, non-coding subviral RNA.  Because PSTVd does not produce proteins, all functions required for replication as well as cell-to-cell and systemic spread are mediated by RNA sequence and structure elements that interact with host proteins.  The highly structured, 359 nucleotide PSTVd genome contains 27 \"unpaired\" loops/bulges and 17 G/U pairs.  Functional mutagenesis was performed to investigate the structure and function of each of these features.  We learned that all loops/bulges do in fact have distinct 3D structures, and that essentially all are essential for replication and/or spread of PSTVd RNA.  For example, loop 27 structure is necessary for passage of PSTVd RNA from inoculated leaf epidermal cells to underlying mesophyll cells.  Similarly, all 17 G/U pairs are essential for replication and/or trafficking of PSTVd RNA.  For example, two G/U pairs (76:283 and 156:205) are individually required for PSTVd RNA to enter the vascular system.  Further, we found that two regions of PSTVd RNA that are essential for replication, both containing critical loops and G/U pairs, are replicated with higher fidelity (i.e., with ~5-fold fewer mutations) than the remainder of the genome.  Such biased fidelity suggests a novel strategy to ensure population success while maximizing adaptation potential. \n\n      In conclusion, the G/U pair and 3D motif constraint hypothesis provides a new paradigm to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms of viral and subviral RNAs.  Knowledge of processes and genomic features that constrain the emergence of new variants is necessary to evaluate adaptation potential and the probability that mutations conferring expanded host range, immune evasion, or increased virulence may arise.\n\n      The broader impacts of this project include the development of principles to guide new frontiers in RNA-based gene regulation in organisms ranging from plants to humans.   These include regulation by long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, and mechanisms of RNA structure-mediated intercellular and systemic trafficking of cellular RNAs to modulate gene expression at the organismal level.  Improved understanding of RNA 3D motifs and G/U pairs may also enable development of novel tools to predict the emergence of new infectious agents and variants, and may also suggest antiviral strategies to enhance agriculture and medicine.  The project was also an outstanding interdisciplinary training vehicle for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs, including female and minority students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Bisaro"
