 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whenever equations model the world around us---whether describing how the gross domestic product depends on different sectors of the economy or predicting the trajectory of a spacecraft or a hurricane---those equations also describe a geometric object.  For a simple system of equations like the line x+y=1, geometry might not seem very useful.  When we have complicated systems with dozens of equations in hundreds of variables, methods from geometry can be one of the few ways to analyze important quantitative and qualitative aspects of the system, like where it has a maximum or how many pieces it has.  This research project develops important geometric tools for describing complicated systems of equations.  It then applies these tools to specific systems of equations with important applications in mathematics, physics, computer science, and other fields.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to solve three linked questions in modern Schubert calculus: the first studies the cohomology of the affine Grassmannian; the second studies the intersection homology of Schubert varieties; and the third studies the cohomology of a family of subvarieties of the flag variety called Hessenberg varieties, in order to answer major open questions about the flag variety.  To do this, the PI will use GKM theory, a combinatorial and algebraic algorithm to describe equivariant cohomology, as well as a recent extension of GKM theory called generalized splines.  The goals of the project will be 1) to develop theoretical tools and algorithms in generalized splines and 2) to apply these tools to perform specific computational and combinatorial calculations in the various cohomology rings we study.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA geometer studies geometric objects, both familiar ones like spheres and inner tubes, and stranger ones in higher dimensions. The most concise way to describe geometric objects is as the solutions to polynomial equations; for instance, the unit circle is set of points (x,y) that solve the equation x2+y2=1. The solutions of seventeen polynomial equations in forty variables is too complicated to visualize: What dimension is it? Does it have holes? How many pieces does it have?  Yet this is the kind of system one encounters when modelling the behavior of the national economy (GDP, interest rates, etc.) in terms of different variables (wages, performance of different sectors of the economy, etc.). An algebraic geometer uses the algebra of polynomials to analyze the geometry of these objects.  This research project used combinatorics--techniques to count or describe the very large numbers that enumerate problems--to analyze complicated systems of equations.\n\n \n\nSpecific mathematical goals that this project achieved include: improved understanding of geometric objects called Hessenberg varieties, which encode a key step in the so-called QR-algorithm (an essential tool in many computations using data that depends on multiple variables); enhanced description of the linear algebra associated to the geometry; analyzing the geometry and combinatorics of Springer fibers, a special case of Hessenberg varieties that has been of enormous importance to a mathematical field called representation theory; developing foundational results on generalized splines; and using combinatorics to describe RNA mutations in mathematical biology. \n\n \n\nThis research bridges the gap between far-reaching and important recent work in combinatorics and long-standing results in geometry and representation theory, as well as mathematical biology.  In addition to results that have advanced the frontier of knowledge in several different areas of theoretical mathematics, this project also developed mathematical tools for the advancement of research in splines.  Splines are central to applied mathematics and used in fields like computer graphics, airplane and automobile design.  Splines also play an important role in data interpolation, whose goal is to fill in missing data, for instance in the case of noisy cell phone signals or weak satellite transmissions.\n\n \n\nBroadening participation in mathematics, especially by students who do not have the family resources or training to guide them to and through higher mathematics, is a key component of this project.  Students were integral to the research the PI conducted, including (during this grant period) one high school student, nineteen undergraduates, fourteen postbaccalaureate students, and one postdoctoral student. Students received explicit coaching and mentoring in general quantitative and professional skills, from interviewing for jobs to reading technical papers.  The PI also co-directs a longstanding postbaccalaureate program, which trains women who want to go to graduate school in mathematics or statistics but do not have adequate background (e.g. changed majors late, attended a too-small school that lacked required courses, did not realize that mathematics could be a career until after graduating).  Mathematics as a profession suffers from a well-known \"leaky pipeline\" in which there is disproportionate loss of women and underrepresented minorities at each stage of their professional advancement; the postbaccalaureate program provides a path to bring some of those women back into the pipeline through more mentoring and technical training.  \n\n \n\nThis project connected people across mathamtical fields. The PI conducted various projects to expand understanding among different mathematicians, including organizing conferences (for both students and researchers) and writing several expository articles that explain results in one area to different mathematical audiences.
