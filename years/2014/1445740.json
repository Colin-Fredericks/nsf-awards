 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expertise is needed to develop immobilized enzyme preparations that are cost-effective, enhance enzyme activity and allow multiple reaction cycles. Surprisingly, large enzyme producers are not organized to provide this capability. Their focus is to efficiently manufacture enzymes that meet demands in high volume markets. Similarly, few chemical manufacturers have the internal capability to develop efficient enzyme catalyzed manufacturing processes.  The commercial development of immobilized enzyme biocatalyst systems has the potential to provide transformational new technologies to the chemical industry that lower process energy input and avoid protection-deprotection steps. This team has developed deep insight and practical experience in creating superior performance immobilized enzymes.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed technology will develop a deep understanding of how enzyme properties, including activity and stability, are influenced by the surface chemistry and physical parameters of immobilization resins. By identifying optimal combinations of enzymes and immobilization resins, important improvements in enzyme activity and stability will be achieved. The proposed new company will also develop insights into resin-enzyme combinations that improve immobilized enzyme biocatalysts for multiple cycle use. A key approach to gain knowledge in the development of high performance immobilized enzyme systems will be the implementation of a high throughput screening process.",
