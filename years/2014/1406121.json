 "awd_abstract_narration": "Homotopy theory is a branch of topology; it arose as the study of certain invariant properties of spaces, namely those left unchanged by continuous deformations.  The most powerful tools for studying such properties are what are called \"cohomology theories\".  Cohomology theories are illuminated by the theory of formal groups, which in turn are closely related to problems in number theory.  The aim of this project is to understand aspects of  this relationship, with the prospect of creating new computational tools in homotopy theory.  \r\n\r\nThis project concerns the theory of power operations in equivariant cohomology theories.  Several interrelated projects are proposed, which aim to draw connections between the theory of ultracommutative ring spectra, which generalize commutative ring spectra to the equivariant setting, and the algebraic geometry of isogenies of elliptic curves and formal groups.  These connections will advance  understanding of topological invariants such as elliptic cohomology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe results of this project contribute to the understanding of several\naspects of homotopy theory, which is a branch of the mathematical\ndiscipline of topology.  Homotopy theory is the study of properties of\nabstract spaces which are unchanged by continuous deformations.\nBetter understanding  such invariants has direct application to many\nproblems in geometry.  One such invariant is called elliptic cohomology, which relates properties of spaces to a family of objects called elliptic curves, and with families of functions which parameterize elliptic curves, called modular forms.  An ongoing program in the study of elliptic cohomology is to relate known phenomena about elliptic currves to properties of elliptic cohomology. \n\nThis project is an example of this idea.  In particular, the goal is to relate certain geometric structures related to elliptic curves (namely, isogenies of elliptic curves, and the action of Hecke operators on modular forms) to natural operations in elliptic cohomology called power operations.  Two pieces of the plan were successful: we can describe the theory of power operations for a particular type of elliptic cohomology related to the Tate curve, and we can also give an analogous relation between Grojnowski's complex analytic elliptic cohomology and Hecke operators on complex valued modular forms.  The results of the project give support to the idea that there is a uniform construction of power operations for topological modular forms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles W Rezk"
