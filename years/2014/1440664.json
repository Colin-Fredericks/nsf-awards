The purpose of the conference is to report on recent important advances in the mathematical subject of partial differential equations.  This is a subject that has considerable importance both for its intrinsic mathematical interest as well as for its centrality and uses in the modeling of physical phenomena and its applications in engineering and other important fields. \r\n\r\nThe conference is dedicated to the subject of partial differential equations. Topics will include stochastic partial differential equations, nonlinear Schrodinger and parabolic equations of paraxial optics, mathematical methods and computer simulation of tumor growth and therapy, mathematical physics, mathematical biology, and optimal control.  Plenary and invited speakers will give presentations on the modern trends and results in partial differential equations in the morning, with a collection of contributed talks given in parallel sessions in the afternoon.  There will be ample opportunity for the participants funded from this grant to present their work and to engage other experts in productive discussion.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  https://math.la.asu.edu/~copde2014/",
