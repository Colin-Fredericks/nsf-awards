 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term volcanic hazard assessments aim to forecast the timing and nature of future, potentially dangerous, volcanic activity. Such assessments need to account for the dynamic nature of volcanic systems, such as migration of eruptive vents, variations of eruption frequency, and magma focusing in various tectonic settings. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team to improve our understanding of how volcanic systems evolve in space and time due to complex magmatic processes within the Earth's mantle and crust that cannot be directly observed. In this project, researchers will concentrate on the distributed volcanic system around Lassen Peak, California, as a test for statistical models of spatial intensity (vents per unit area), volume intensity (erupted volume per unit area), volume-flux (erupted volume per unit of time and area) and recurrence rate models (number of eruptive events per unit of time). They plan to enhance these models by integrating data that provide clues to subsurface magmatic processes, such as geophysical, geochemical and tectonic data. They will make new age determinations of past volcanic eruptions and assess geochemical trends in the Lassen volcanic system. Together, these data and models should provide more accurate tools for assessing the potential impacts of future volcanic activity. Researchers then plan to generalize this model to consider diverse volcanic systems in the western United States and their potential hazards.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, existing data on vent location and erupted volumes will be used to develop nonparametric kernel density statistical models of the spatial intensity and volume intensity at Lassen and for five other well-studied volcanic systems in the western U.S.A. These statistical models cast the discrete processes of dike injection, sill development, and eruption as continuous density functions. Uncertainties in these statistical models (e.g., uncertainty due to vent burial; uncertainty in geochronology) will be tested by gathering additional data in the Caribou volcanic field, east of Lassen. There, new radiometric age determinations and additional volume data will be collected to test statistical models of field growth using stochastic recurrence rate and lava flow inundation models that we have previously developed. Using radiometric age determinations of vents and erupted units, recurrence rate of volcanism and associated uncertainty will be calculated using a Monte Carlo approach. Stochastic solutions to differential equations governing magma production and transport will be implemented to model subsurface processes of magma ascent. Using this continuous formulation, additional complexities that influence magma migration such as complex sources, magma generation, magma rheology, tectonic stresses, and/or anisotropic/heterogeneous behavior of the porous medium, can be simply implemented by varying the choice of source and conductivity parameters. In this way physical processes that may give rise to heterogeneous flux in numerical models can be tested and be related to observed vent distributions and volume flux at the surface,  creating stronger links between statistical models of volcanism and observed geophysical, tectonic, and geochemical data.",

But when they erupt they can have widespread impacts, including burial of vast areas by lava flows, destructive volcanic debris flows, and disruption of airspace by volcanic ash. Where are future volcanic eruptions likely to occur, when will they occur, and what are their potential magnitudes? Our goal is to answer these questions long before the Earth shows signs of volcanic unrest.&nbsp; To do this, we invented new methods to integrate geochemical information into statistical and numerical models of the likelihood of volcanic eruptions.&nbsp; To our knowledge, this is the first time geochemical data and models have been used to improve a spatial density model of distributed volcanic hazards. The results are dramatic. In the Lassen region, we have shown that it is crucial to separate the regional mafic vents, which rise rapidly from the mantle, from the hybrid and contaminated magmas, which stall and differentiate in the crust before they erupt. By proving that these different types of magmas are classified appropriately, and by proving that they erupted synchronously, we are able to vastly improve the hazard model. Namely, the \"felsic\" volcanic hazard is extremely tightly clustered, with a different statistical kernel function, and hence different hazard, than the regional mafic volcanism. We think this is a key outcome because it uses the Lassen area to demonstrate how geochemistry can improve our understanding and assessment of volcanic hazards in distributed volcanic fields, the most widespread type of volcanism on Earth, and the most widespread type of volcanism in the western US.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">To obtain these results, we conducted new radiometric age determinations (to determine the ages of past volcanic eruptions), new geochemical analyses to determine the depth and water contents of magmas, and gathered new geophysical data to understand the structure of the crust and its influence on magma ascent and the locations of potential future eruptions. We concentrated on two volcanic regions. The first is the Lassen volcano area, in northern California. For this region we created new multi-hazard maps of the volcanic system, and demonstrated that some types of volcanism are much more widespread and recent than previously thought. Much of the Lassen results were presented in a workshop attended by an international group of scientists that was hosted by the US National Park Service at Lassen in the late summer, 2017. The second area of focus was the Springerville volcanic field (AZ), the location of over 400 volcanic vents formed in the last 2 million years. We demonstrated for the first time that the location of volcanic vents is strongly influenced by the chemical composition (and density) of the crust, formed during the accretion of the North American continent more than one billion years ago.
