 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research training group at the University of Georgia in the areas of Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Number Theory. Many aspects of the program that have been planned by the University of Georgia Algebra and Number Theory research group will be suitable for and open to all undergraduate and graduate students in the department. Thus these activities will have a broad impact on the life of the department. The training  proposed will run year-round. Keeping the undergraduate, graduate students, and postdocs engaged continuously will help with retention, shorten the time to degree, and boost productivity.\r\n\r\nThe Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Number Theory group at the University of Georgia proposes a comprehensive program designed to recruit, engage, and train students and postdoctoral associates, and to prepare them for successful careers in the mathematical sciences. The First Year Undergraduate Seminars will draw UGA students into careers in the mathematical sciences. The Graduate Student Boot Camp will ensure success for graduate students in the program.  Vertical Research Training Groups (VRTG) will give students and postdocs the chance to engage early in collaborative research projects. The computational VRTG will provide online tools for computations in the three research fields. The Oberseminar will act as educational training tool for graduate students, catalyst for intra-area discussion, and community builder for the group.",
