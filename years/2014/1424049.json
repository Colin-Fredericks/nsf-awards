 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study evaluates a critical question about the causes of partisan resurgence: Is this phenomenon driven by heightened ideological sophistication or more intense partisan group-centrism? Answering this question is crucial for understanding how partisanship affects the ability of the public to constructively participate in democratic politics. This project develops a survey experiment to adjudicate between competing explanations of the resurgence in mass partisanship on a representative sample of the electorate.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project's theory suggests that polarization has made partisanship more capable of providing core psychological benefits, such as uncertainty reduction, to group members. An implication of this theory is that strong psychological motivations to identify with social groups should increase partisan intensity. The study will directly evaluate competing arguments about the underpinnings (psychological or ideological) of partisan resurgence. It advances the polarization literature by specifying the psychological underpinnings of heightened partisan intensity. The project also offers a new perspective on the effect of personality on political evaluations. By evaluating the personality basis of partisanship and partisan strength, this project extends research on personality and politics in a new and fruitful direction.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This study addresses crucial questions about the quality of democratic citizenship and whether polarization contributes to or undermines the quality of political decision-making. By evaluating the causes of the public's heightened ties to parties, this study will assess how actions on policies are driven by representational concerns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant was used to fund a large survey of 1,200 American citizens using the survey firm YouGov. \n\nThis survey measured citizens' attitudes toward a number of public policy issues, views of the two political parties in America, levels of political knowledge, vote choice in the 2014 midterm elections, as well as a number of measures of personality or psychological style, including: authoritarianism, need for cognition, need for closure, and need to evaluate.  One broader impact of this grant will be the availability of this survey to researchers interested in the link between psychological traits and political orientation.\n\nAs a part of this survey, I also conducted an experiment to investigate the conditions in which citizens blindly follow party elite cues when forming political opinions.  One primary research question was whether polarized political environments strengthened partisan bias or ideological coherence in public opinion formation.  By manipulating perceptions of political polarization, this experiment provided an opportunity for assessing this question.\n\nIn my own research, this survey is being used primarily for three papers.  The first examines the effect of certain psychological predispositions in Democrats' and Republicans' feelings toward the two major parties.  Specifically, this research shows that Democrats and Republicans high in the need for closure identify the most strongly with their party and are most intolerant of the opposite political party.  The second paper makes use of the experiment and shows that both polarized political environments and need for closure increases partisan bias in public opinion formation.  Finally, a third paper examines various correlates of vote choice in the 2014 midterm elections, focusing specifically on the role of racial resentment.   \n\nThese papers contribute to a number of intellectual and theoretical debates in the fields of American politics and political psychology.  More broadly, these studies illuminate the nature of partisanship and political conflict in American politics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Luttig"
