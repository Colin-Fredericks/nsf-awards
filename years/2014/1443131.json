It will address research areas in the field of interaction of THz radiation with micro- and nanostructures and advanced solid-state THz emitters and sensors, including novel device concepts. This conference will foster advances in the leading research on various types of Terahertz technology, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. The program provides the opportunity for scientific exchanges and discussions on exciting breakthroughs in the terahertz field and the understanding the underlying physical mechanisms. It will promote interactions between leading researchers in USA, Japan, and Russia on terahertz devices and technologies and will focus on the technical challenges and barriers of transitioning the research results into the THz system-level applications. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through the symposium proceedings.",
