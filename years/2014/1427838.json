It also contributes to establish an appropriate environment to broaden students' knowledge and research experience, and encourages participation of underrepresented minorities/women, Furthermore, research results will be integrated into the curricula in CS and water resource education, as well as introduced to a large number of low-income and minority students within their communities in grades 6-12.",
