 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to data from 2008, nearly 5 million Americans age 50 or older suffer from moderate to severe dry eye syndrome (DES). Symptoms include discomfort and reduced visual function. The dynamics of the tear film is thought to be critical in the development of DES; rapid evaporation and/or insufficient tears are thought to cause chronic irritation leading to DES. Both of these mechanisms can lead to elevated saltiness (osmolarity), which is believed to be a key variable in understanding the irritation to the eye surface. The results from this project will yield quantitative insight into tear film flows and osmolarity dynamics that may impact how ocular scientists interpret their data.  The team, which is based at the University of Delaware and the Rochester Institute of Technology, will work closely with leading optometrists to achieve this goal. The investigators will train mathematical scientists with advanced knowledge of and experience with physical and biomedical modeling, advanced computation, and physiological application. These trainees include five undergraduate and two graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow. All trainees will participate extensively in dissemination of results to the applied mathematical and biomedical communities, via publication and travel to scientific meetings. New information discovered as part of the activity will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate training through lectures, discussion in group seminars at the participating universities, and future research projects.\r\n\r\nInvestigators based at the University of Delaware and the Rochester Institute of Technology will collaborate to study the dynamics of the tear film on the human eye in an effort to understand its function and to help clarify causes and consequences of dry eye syndrome (DES). The results will help explain and visualize the complex tear motion during blinking and to quantify the variability of critical quantities such as tear saltiness (osmolarity). To do so, new tear film models consisting of nonlinear coupled high-order partial differential equations on moving, two-dimensional eye-shaped domains will be formulated using a variety of methods from applied mathematics and mechanics. The team will then develop two new computational techniques to solve the models.  Current tear film models will be advanced by incorporating increasingly challenging effects of evaporation and lipid layer motion on complex moving domains. The project will draw upon the thin liquid film literature and from close consultation with experimental optometrists to make informed decisions about mathematical modeling, comparison with in vivo experimental data, and sensible interpretation of the results.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences is co-funded by the Fluid Dynamics Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen a blink occurs, the opening of the upper lid paints a thin liquid layer on the surface of the eye, called the tear film.  The tear film is a critical element for clear vision and eye health; a smooth tear film provides a good lens surface for entering light and it helps protect the ocular surface.  The tear film is very thin, only a few microns in thickness away from the eyelids.  When the tear film fails, sight may be degraded and irritation may occur forcing a blink.  Chronic malfunctioning of the tear film can lead to a common condition called dry eye, which affects millions of people. \n\nIn this project, we developed mathematical and computational models for tear film dynamics on the human eye.  One model computed tear film dynamics all over the open eye surface.  In this model, evaporation and surface tension were the main effects causing changes in the tear film.  Evaporation of water in the tear film causes the osmolarity (or saltiness) to increase, and our model could find where the osmolarity was highest; see fig. 1.  We found that the highest osmolarity occurred over the cornea near the eyelids in this model.  This is the first detailed estimate of the tear film osmolarity all over the open eye. It is an important result because it puts clinical measurements of tear film osmolarity in context:  clinical measurements of the osmolarity are close to the outer corner of the eye where the osmolarity changes relatively little.\n\nThe tear film can fail in small localized spots or lines called tear break up, or TBU.  TBU may be fast or slow, and we have found different mechanisms are responsible for these different speeds of TBU.  When small areas of increased evaporation drive localized thinning and TBU, the process is relatively slow. Commonly the times to evaporative TBU can be 5 or 10 seconds or more.  The essential ingredients of an evaporative TBU model are sketched in fig. 2.  We found that the osmolarity could be elevated to levels well above seawater; humans can detect levels at about half the level of seawater.  Thus TBU can be quite irritating even if the areas are small relative to the size of the cornea.\n\nWe also developed models for TBU that agree well with rapid TBU observed in vivo.  The essential elements in our model is sketched in fig. 3.  In this case, there is an elevated surface concentration of lipid that drives rapid outward flow of the tear film.  The tear film thins quickly, and TBU can be reached within a second or two.  This short times do not allow evaporation to increase the osmolarity to any significant degree.  As a result, for rapid TBU there is essentially no increase in osmolarity. \n\nThe two different mechanisms and models for TBU are important because they give strong evidence that there are at least two mechanisms of TBU.  But in the ocular surface and tear film literature, nearly all papers discuss TBU as being from the evaporative mechanism alone.  Realizing that there are different mechanisms and analyzing experimental images keeping this in mind is very likely to help clear up interpretation of what seems like confounding data in the eye literature.\n\nWe wrote some major reviews for the eye literature with our optometry collaborators to (1) summarize existing results, (2) present new results, and (3) spread the word about our results.  One of them included original results visualizing one of the layers of the tear film during blinks (the lipid layer); particularly beautiful images of the lipid layer were obtained (fig. 4).  These images show the thickness and dynamics processes of the lipid layer during the blink.  The fate of the tear film after blink is in no small part affected by the dynamics of the tear film during the blink.  These and other results appeared in Braun et al, \"Dynamics and Function of the Tear Film in Relation to the Blink Cycle,\" Progress in Retinal and Eye Research 45:132-164, 2015.  We also published another major review about mechanisms of TBU (King-Smith et al, \"Mechanisms and Structure of Tear Film Breakup,\" The Ocular Surface 16:4-30, 2017). \n\nWe developed new mathematical models for commonly-used a commonly-used method of imaging the tear film based on fluorescence.  Our models illustrated both successes and challenges for using this method to deduce what happens in the tear film.  These results were presented in a series of papers in both eye journals and mathematical medicine and biology journals. We also published results for model problems on blinking eye shaped domains; this work will continue for tear film models.\n\nWe presented our results in both poster and talk formats at a variety of conferences that focused on eyes, math, or fluid mechanics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard J Braun"
