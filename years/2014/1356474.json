 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a total of 120 scholarships to high-achieving financially disadvantaged undergraduate and masters students enrolled in computer science and mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras (UPR-RP).  Since 98% of all students at UPR-RP receive some form of financial assistance, and 56% of undergraduates receive Pell grants, the need for these scholarships is great. Scholarship amounts range from $2,500 in the first year of study to $4,800 in the last year. The project is a model program which can be replicated to support financially disadvantaged students from underrepresented groups in different regions.  Students will be recruited in the program through a series of presentations by the PIs and S-STEM Scholars.  The PIs, with help from the S-STEM scholars, will host an event for middle and high school students that will highlight the impact of CS/Math in society.  Graduate students will be recruited from within UPR-RP and at national meetings.\r\n\r\nIn addition to scholarship support, the project sponsors activities 1) to increase the awareness of scholars about opportunities for further studies and careers in industry, 2) to strengthen academic and professional skills of scholars, 3) to build a sense of community, 4) to highlight the social and applied aspect of computer science and mathematics, and 5) to support student learning through tutoring and mentoring.  The overall goals of the project are to improve recruitment, retention, and preparation for employment or graduate school.  The project prepares Puerto Rican students to work in two high demand disciplines, which helps meet the expanding need for computer science and mathematics professionals both locally and nationally.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of this project will look at the retention to graduation rate, time to degree completion, and student progress after graduation.  This data will be collected for recent graduates, current students (non- S-STEM Scholars), and S-STEM scholars.  The rates will be compared for each group of students each year of the project to determine whether or not the program is effective.",
