 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the development of energy-saving window products that are aesthetically pleasing.  Aerogel window products have the potential to be transformative to the fenestration industry, due both to the high translucency and low thermal conductivity of the aerogel materials and the particular advantages of the fabrication method to be employed. The rapid supercritical extraction process is an environmentally friendlier approach to aerogel preparation than other methods currently used. Due to the high thermal insulating ability of silica aerogels, constructing windows from these materials will result in considerable energy savings compared to conventional windows. The fact that the optical transmission properties of aerogel materials can be tailored by varying the recipes used to prepare the aerogels can be exploited to further improve energy efficiency. The energy savings resulting from implementation of aerogel-based windows will be significant.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will fund research in aerogel-based window commercialization.  The specific market opportunity addressed by this proposal is in daylighting, where the goal is to provide window systems that allow natural light to be used instead of electric lights. A key challenge in such applications is to also reduce the heating and cooling costs.  The low density, good optical translucency and low thermal conductivity of silica aerogel materials make them particularly attractive for these applications. The rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) method to be employed for fabricating aerogels has the following advantages: (a) it can be easily automated; (b) it is fast; (c) it is environmentally friendlier than other methods; (d) it minimizes the use of solvents; (e) it is potentially less expensive than other methods, and (f) the process can produce large intact aerogels. During the project, a range of window prototypes based on the RSCE approach and tailored for desirable properties will be produced, and the enhanced performance of these window prototypes demonstrated.  The resulting aerogel window products will offer end-use customers a higher value than current daylighting products.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project is to introduce a cost-effective window system that incorporates monolithic silica aerogel in order to reduce heat leakage. In monolithic form, as manufactured by the RSCE process (see below), the aerogel is highly transparent and has high thermal resistance.  Therefore, there is the potential for a very effective window system that will introduce significant amounts of daylight while reducing heating and cooling costs in buildings.  During this phase of the project, Sunthru LLC achieved significant outcomes as follows:\n\nDemonstrated that the one-step patented rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) process for manufacturing aerogels is capable of producing silica aerogel monoliths suitable for application in windows.  Figure 1 shows a prototype window.\nDeveloped processes and methods for manufacturing monoliths that do not require any internal supports and are more thermally resistive.  Figure 2 shows a succession of window prototypes fabricated using decreasing amounts of internal supports.\nProduced monoliths as large as 5.5\"x5.5\"x0.5\" that have high light transmission and high thermal resistance consistent with published results for aerogels prepared by other (more complicated and time-consuming) methods.  R-values for the 0.5\"-thick samples were measured to be in the range of 4.9 &ndash; 5.1 hr-ft2-F/BTU.  \nDeveloped a method for sealing and evacuating monoliths placed between two panes (glass or polycarbonate) in a frame.  Samples evacuated to moderate vacuums (0.07 atm) show significant increase in thermal resistance, up to 8.8 hr-ft2-F/BTU.  \nSamples with high clarity have been produced using TMOS (tetramethyl orthosilicate) as the silica precursor.  Since TMOS is relatively expensive in laboratory quantities, we explored using alternate precursors.  Studies using sodium silicate instead were not successful. \nMethods to increase hydrophobicity of the monoliths were also investigated.  TMOS-based recipes that incorporate the organically modified precursor methytrimethoxy silane (MTMS) were investigated.  Small additions of MTMS increase hydrophobicity significantly, although they reduce clarity somewhat.  See Figure 3 for the effect of MTMS on clarity.\n\n\nThese outcomes show that monolithic silica aerogels produced by the RSCE method, as optimized in this study, are promising candidates for use as daylighting windows.  To fabricate a window unit, the monolith needs to be encased between plates of polycarbonate or glass and then packaged in a frame.  Our Phase II proposal seeks to scale up the process so larger monoliths could be made and then used to make window prototypes for demonstration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bahram Keramati"
