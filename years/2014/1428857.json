The Raman microscope would have automated x-y-z translatable stage, dual-wavelength laser excitation sources, and variable temperature (-196 to 600 degree C) sample chamber.  Specific studies that would take advantage of the Raman system would include in situ observations of fluid alteration and weathering processes at mineral surfaces, studies of gas clathrate formation and dissociation processes in permafrost and deep-sea environments, studies of biologically mediated material corrosion processes, and trace metal speciation and oxidation/reduction mechanisms in natural and contaminated systems.  The instrument would serve faculty and their students across several departments at Oklahoma and the PIs intend to engage underrepresented students in experiential learning through an extant Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program at the University.  \r\n\r\n***",
