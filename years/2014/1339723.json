 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ADCIRC coastal circulation and storm surge model has a long standing track record of extremely high societal impact. It has been used to define risk (e.g., 100-yr, 500-yr coastal flood levels) for the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program in coastal states from New York to Texas, it has been used to design the multi-billion dollar Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System around greater New Orleans and southern Louisiana by the Army Corps of Engineers, it is currently run operationally by NOAA/NWS National Center for Environmental Prediction to forecast storm surge, to name just a few of its current and recent applications. Thus there is a well-established user network in place to convert improvements in ADCIRC into significant broader impacts. The proposed research provides transformative intellectual contributions that focus on applying new parallelization schemes to enable major advances in the algorithms, implementation and utilization of the ADCIRC model. The broadening of ADCIRC to a multi-algorithmic framework and the resulting performance gains that are anticipated will help ensure ADCIRC's sustainability as a core community model for at least the next 20 years. In addition, the proposed collaboration will impact computer science by serving as a high impact use case to inform the design of new approaches to efficient scalable computing. Together, the advancements in coastal modeling and parallelization technology will make a significant contribution to the science of modeling and HPC. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated to a wider community through ongoing educational outreach activities at the participating organizations as well as through refereed conference and journal papers, and invited presentations. The involvement of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will be crucial towards the success of this project. The PIs have a long history of training and mentoring students and post-docs in computational science and engineering, coastal engineering and marine science. The recruitment and involvement of underrepresented groups in these efforts has always been a high priority. In addition, aspects of the proposed research will be incorporated into the curricula of several courses taught by the PIs in the areas of finite element methods, scientific computation, hydrology and oceanography.\r\nThe aim of this project is to broaden the ADCIRC coastal circulation and storm surge model from a successful, but somewhat static coastal modeling tool that is tied to a single solution algorithm and the MPI parallelization paradigm, to a dynamic computational platform that is comprised of multiple solution algorithms, that readily admits new solution algorithms and that is built on a transformational new parallelization scheme that will allow us to scale to at least 256k compute cores on modern high performance computing (HPC) systems. We will do this by creating a living, evolving coastal modeling framework that will continue to lead the community in merging physical science / engineering and high performance computing and we will make the framework available to the broader community as a sustainable long term solution for its coastal modeling needs. In addition we will utilize these advancements in the highly demanding coastal storm surge forecasting system that we presently operate to demonstrate both improved robustness and speed of the model solution. We expect this effort will shorten the time required to provide reliable forecasting results and improve our ability to provide highly resolved, accurate, and physically complete predictions on an unprecedented scale. Concurrently, it should enable the use of smaller resources for simulations of increased scale which improves the usability and widens the applicability of ADCIRC in a broader community. The development of tightly integrated web-oriented products like CERA (www.coastalemergency.org) will enable the wide and timely dissemination of forecast modeling results to reach a broad audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe STORM project was conceived to support the advancement of the ADCIRC coastal circulation and storm surge model (https://adcirc.org).  ADCIRC has been and continues to be widely used for process-based studies, forensic studies, hazard assessment studies and design studies related to storm surge and coastal flooding.  More recently it has also been adapted for event-based forecasting of storm surge and flooding both for extratropical and tropical storms.  Accurate physics, numerics and optimization for high performance computing architectures have kept ADCIRC at the forefront of this societally critical field.  Partners in this collaborative project have advanced both the numerics and the HPC optimization of ADCIRC, ensuring it remains a leader in these areas.  The UNC roles were to apply ADCIRC for forecasting applications to help illuminate existing limitations in these nascent applications and to broadly disseminate the forecast results for the public good; to advance the process representations in ADCIRC to address the identified limitations and to serve as a hub for communications, training, and outreach associated with ADCIRC.\n\nDuring the course of this project, many hundreds of ADCIRC forecasts were executed for the major tropical cyclones to impact the US East and Gulf coasts from 2016-2020, including Hermine and Matthew (2016); Harvey, Irma, Maria, Nate (2017); Alberto, Chris, Florence, and Michael (2018); Barry, Dorian, Humberto and Nestor (2019); and Cristobal, Hanna, Isaias, Laura, Marco, Sally, Beta, Delta, Zeta, and Eta (2020).  Highly significant broader impacts were achieved as results were disseminated to numerous federal, state, local and industry emergency managers in addition to the general public.  Products were developed to assist with storm gate closures around greater New Orleans and to allow future ADCIRC forecasts and hindcasts to be ingested directly into FEMA's HAZUS storm damage assessment software. \n\nThese forecast activities helped to identify two aspects of ADCIRC in need of better process representation: the meteorological model used to drive the storm surge and the representation of low frequency processes that are not explicitly included in ADCIRC physics.  In response, we developed an advanced tropical cyclone vortex model that allows the construction of complete wind velocity and atmospheric pressure fields from the storm information provided in the best track and forecasts released by the National Hurricane Center.  We also developed a novel approach to data assimilation that generates highly efficient corrections to ADCIRC to account for processes such as steric heating, ocean currents and large-scale antecedent meteorology that are relatively slowly varying in space and time but that can have a significant impact on coastal water levels.  In the process of this work, we came to appreciate how significantly a major storm, such as hurricanes Matthew or Florence, can impact ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream.  We also came to realize the frequent role that large scale wind patterns play in setting up coastal water levels prior to the direct impact of a tropical cyclone, and therefore the value of blending tropical cyclone vortex wind fields with wind fields from larger scale meteorological models for forecasting applications. \n\nFinally, the STORM project provided support for the annual ADCIRC community users group meetings and ADCIRC boot camp training sessions to assist with the exchange of successes, problems and new ADCIRC features as well as the training of graduate students, government researchers and practicing engineers and scientists on the use and promulgation of the ADCIRC model.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard A Luettich"
