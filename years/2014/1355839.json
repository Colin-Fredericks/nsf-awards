 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tech Scholars program at the Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College) is providing scholarship support to twenty School of Industrial, Computing, and Engineering Technologies (ICET) students in majors of Information Technology, Electrical Technology, Automated Manufacturing and Machining, Engineering Design Technology, Electronics/Computer Engineering Technology, Plastics and Polymer Engineering Technology, and Welding and Fabrication Engineering Technology.  Recruitment strategies for the Tech Scholars program target students who may not be aware of the array of technology-based majors in ICET at Penn College and the employment opportunities in these fields.  Many of these students are the first in their family to attend college.  This strategy, coupled with student support services and career education, is increasing student retention, leading to a greater number of graduates from ICET programs. In turn the project is helping to address a high demand for technology graduates and contributes to the diversity and improved capability of the technological workforce.\r\n\r\nIn addition to financial support through the S-STEM scholarships, technical features of the project include academic and professional support that promotes student retention and advances career education through establishing a learning community, offering peer and faculty mentoring, tutorial services, internships, field trips and guest speakers from industry. Furthermore, comprehensive approaches are employed to encourage students to select a four-year ICET major, to support them academically and financially until graduation and to increase their workforce preparation and skills.  Penn College is building a cohort experience for the Tech Scholars through common seminar sections, designated study and networking spaces and a living/learning community.  These strategies are implemented under the direction of an industry-focused Advisory Committee. Aided by this committee, Penn College is strengthening existing relationships with industry by involving industry partners in multiple program components, such as workshops, internships and participation in Advisory Committee activities.  Further, through the Tech Scholars program, Penn College is establishing new relationships with community colleges through its outreach activities to transfer students.",

There were four major goals for this project:  (1) to recruit and enroll 20 academically talented S-STEM scholars with unmet financial need who are well-informed about career options and job demand in Industrial and Computer Engineering Technology (ICET) fields, (2) to encourage these academically talented students to complete a bachelor degree program in one of the ICET majors, (3) to provide scholarships that ease the financial burden of attending a four-year program, and (4) to improve retention and graduation rates.\n\nThe first two cohorts (2014-2015) started as incoming freshman and the second two cohorts (2016-2017) started as juniors after completing an associate degree from Penn College or some other institution.

The high-demand majors include building automation, engineering design, software development and information management, information assurance and cyber security, mechatronics, advanced manufacturing, electronics and computer engineering technology, welding and fabrication, and plastics and polymers engineering technology.  The benefits of earning a bachelor\u2019s degree, including earning potential, was also highlighted in the communications. The School of ICET saw steady enrollment growth for much of the timeframe coinciding with the scholarship program.  The aggressive advertising of a well-organized academic support program with financial aid backing bolstered the School\u2019s growth during a time span when the student population at the College was in decline.\n\nEach Tech Scholar was assigned a faculty mentor that they met with bi-weekly or monthly as needed to monitor progress and assist with any adjustments or academic difficulties. The faculty mentors also paired a junior-year student with each freshman scholar to be their peer mentor. Social gatherings were planned several times each semester, some of which showcased the projects each scholar was working on and gave students and mentors a chance to see each other\u2019s workspaces.\n\nPenn College promoted a cohort experience through common seminar sections, designated social gatherings, faculty and peer mentoring, and an active learning community. A first-year experience (FYE) course provided an orientation to the college and covered college preparatory skills such as time management, writing skills, career education, critical thinking, and communication for project leadership.

This workshop introduced incoming transfer students to the S-STEM cohort and focused on interdisciplinary teamwork, oral and written communications, critical thinking, problem solving, interview skills, building career e-portfolios, writing resumes, internships, and job search preparation.  Both the First Year Experience and Junior Year Workshop provided employability skills the students used to be successful in getting jobs in their field.  Most of the students had multiple job offers upon graduating.  \n\nIn the end, 80% (20 of 25) of the students entering the scholarship program successfully earned one or more Baccalaureate degrees.  One of the proposed objectives was to retain 90% of the S-STEM scholars until their second year.  The second-year retention rate was a respectable 88% (22 of 25), marred by two students withdrawing for personal reasons and one removed for academic reasons. This retention rate was accomplished through financial assistance, a cohort-based first-year experience course, academic and social supports, peer mentoring, monitoring academic progress through faculty mentors, field trips, and guest speakers.\n\nNinety percent of the students completed their degree program within four years, or two years if they were a transfer student, thus exceeding the 80% benchmark set in the original proposal.
