 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to its extraordinary complexity, research on non-human animals will be necessary to efficiently explore the design of the human brain.  A central problem in understanding the origin of the human brain concerns the role of social life and the demands it places on the brain to generate adaptive behavior.  As humans evolved complex societies, it is thought that the brain increased in volume to enable advanced cognition.  Social insects are outstanding models to examine brain evolution in light of social complexity.  This research project employs ants as an ideal model system to analyze the relationship between sociality and brain evolution because different species form colonies that vary in size and the degree of complexity.  This research will also help us understand how exceptionally small brains are able to process complex social information.  The project will analyze differences in the size and organization of worker brains, and their metabolic costs to determine if complex social life has increased the efficiency of energy use in the brain.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate who will become skilled in designing scientific studies and will acquire techniques that enable brains to be imaged.  Students will also learn data analysis, and scientific writing and publication. The researchers will develop a curriculum to enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to the study of behavior and neuroscience.  The researchers will recruit diverse participants from the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago to encourage minority students to become activity engaged in science. The project will broadly support science outreach in the Chicago STEM Pipeline, Arizona Assurance, Brain Awareness, and Boston Upward Bound programs to address the critical national need to improve science education and train the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nTo determine how social complexity has influenced brain evolution, the researchers will quantify neuronal metabolic requirements, neuropil investment and scaling, behavioral plasticity, and synaptic organization in brain regions considered key to cognitive function.  Pairs of species representative of major ant subfamilies that accentuate variability in social complexity will form the sample groups.  The researchers will: 1) quantify energetic requirements of functionally specialized neuropil using cytochrome oxidase staining to assess ATP use; 2) determine if brain development is experience-dependent; 3) quantify synaptic complexes associated with cognition; and 4) couple behavioral performance with neural and metabolic metrics.  The researchers will determine neuron number and size and variation in peripheral sensory structures, and examine brain compartment scaling patterns.  Controlling for phylogeny, analyses infer how independent evolutionary events associated with collective intelligence shaped brain evolution. All original images will be freely available upon publication, in the absence of copyright issues.  Organismal data (specimen and colony collection data, phenotypic data, etc.) will be maintained in individual labs, and will be made freely available upon request.  Voucher specimens will be deposited in the ant collection of the Field Museum.",

To accomplish this, social animals (and humans in particular) have large and complex brains ( this is referred to as the ?social brain hypothesis). For a long time, this hypothesis was also thought to be true for social insects (e.g. honey bees, paper wasps, ants, termites). However, while social insects live in often large colonies, they do not know each other ?personally? ? they typically recognize colony members by their distinct scent (?nest odor?), which does not require particularly advanced cognitive abilities. Moreover, individual colony members specialize on certain tasks and don?t need to be able to perform all the behaviors required for maintaining the colony: queens only lay eggs, foragers provide food, ?nurses? care for the brood, ?soldiers? fight when necessary. Hence, we thought that individual social insects might potentially have smaller, rather than larger brains compared to solitary insects, and we wanted to test this idea.</p>\n<p>We dissected, measured and analyzed brains of different ant species as well as bees and wasps (see Fig. 1), and we also studied their learning and foraging behaviors (Fig. 2). Comparing five related species of ?odorous ants?, we found that socially more advanced species invest less in the brains of individual colony members, and that workers in socially less advanced species appear more independent and less specialized.</p>\n<p>While an animal?s brain size may give certain hints at its cognitive capacities, much more important is the number of nerve cells in a brain (Fig. 3), just like the physical size of a computer does not tell us much about its capacity ? it is the number of transistor functions that determines a processor?s capacity. However, counting nerve cells was traditionally very tedious and therefore almost no cell numbers exist for insect brains. A new method developed for counting cells in vertebrate brains has rapidly transformed our understanding of brain processing power in vertebrates, and we have for the first time adapted this technique to work on tiny insect brains.</p>\n<p>Previously, insects were thought to have relatively smaller brains than vertebrates (an imaginary insect the size of a rat would have a smaller brain than a rat, or an imaginary miniscule dog the size of a bee would have a larger brain than a bee). We have compared the body size, brain size and brain cell number for many solitary and social insects, and we found that insect brain size and nerve cell number follow the same general rules established for vertebrates (Fig. 4). In this respect insect brains are not different from vertebrate brains (the miniscule dog would be expected to have a similar sized brain size as the bee, and a similar number of nerve cells).</p>\n<p>We also found that <strong>social</strong> insects do not have larger brains than <strong>solitary</strong> ones, in contrast to social vertebrates. Figure 5 suggests that social insects may have fewer nerve cells than solitary ones, although this difference is not statistically significant. &nbsp;Interestingly, we found that ants have smaller brains and fewer nerve cells than bees and wasps of the same body size (Fig. 6). This does not suggest that bees and wasps are ?smarter? than ants. Rather, we think this is because ant workers don?t fly: bees and wasps need a major part of their brain cells to rapidly analyze a large amount of visual information during visual flight control. Ants don?t need to do this and they can get along with much fewer visual nerve cells, which are energetically expensive .</p>\n<p>Besides the actual scientific findings, over the years this project allowed 38 undergraduate students and 11 high-school students to get hands-on experience in laboratory research.
