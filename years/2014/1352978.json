 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects are second to no animal in their importance to humans; consider their roles in pollination, devouring crops and transmitting diseases.  Our success in living with or without insects depends upon the depth of our understanding of insect biology.  Molecular and genome sciences are revolutionizing our understanding of human biology and medicine, and it can do the same for the study of insects.  There is a major problem; developing advanced molecular and genetic technologies for one species, humans, has been challenging but developing similar technologies for hundreds of important insect species currently studied intensely by scientists is immensely more challenging.  For some insects the technologies are well developed and knowledge of their application is deep (fruitflies), while for other insects the technologies are nonexistent and technical knowledge is shallow (honeybees).  This NSF-Research Coordination Network fosters the development and sharing of molecular and genetic knowledge and technologies across diverse research groups. The Network fosters cross-disciplinary interactions by convening training workshops and classes, sponsoring symposia, promoting collaborations and assembling an online knowledge emporium for insect scientists.  \r\n\r\nThis project will have four major impacts:  1) enabling solutions to society's most vexing insect-related problems, e.g. overuse of insecticides and reemergence of insect-borne diseases, 2) maximizing the value of research-dollars by encouraging collaborations and leveraging existing resources, 3) preparing for the future by training students, 4) enhancing participation of underrepresented groups in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInsects are the most abundant, diverse and impactful animals on earth and their study is critical to our understanding of everything from evolution and ecology to neurobiology and human diseases.  Since the beginning of the 21st century there has been a rapid expansion in the generation and availability of the DNA sequences of insect genomes.  With them came an increasing demand for technologies that enabled insect biologists to experimentally determine the function of those DNA sequences.  The Insect Genetic Technologies Research Coordination Network was a knowledge building and-sharing enterprise designed to foster the growth in technical knowledge and expertise within the insect science community so that the accumulating insect genomic data could be fully leveraged against the many important unanswered questions regarding insect biology.  The creation of this Network followed reports of major technical breakthroughs in our abilities to alter genomes -so-called gene editing technologies.  These reports further fostered interest in insect genetic technologies. \n\nThe project undertook four approaches to accomplish its objectives.  First, it created a project website and started publishing a weekly newsletter that pointed project participants (~1200 by the end of the project) to recently published scholarly research related to insect genetic technologies.  Included was a 400-word synopsis of the published report.  These \"Technology Topics\" newsletters helped subscribers keep up on technical developments of likely relevance to them and, in additions, because each research synopsis was written by a young professional (grad student, postdoctoral researcher), the newsletter provided a training opportunity and a chance to interact with a larger peer group.  While simple in its purpose and execution, the Technology Topics literature awareness newsletter was one of the two most popular, impactful and successful activities of the project based on feedback from network participants.\n\nSecond, the project supported small training grants of up to $4000 to support peer-to-peer training.  These trainings usually involved a trainee (who could be at any professional level) partnering with and visiting another laboratory to learn a new technology. \n\nThird, the project regularly organized symposia on topics related to Insect Genetic Technologies that were convened at national and international scientific conferences.  Resources from the project were used to enable speakers to participate who were leading experts.\n\nFinally, the project, in collaboration with the University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology\u2019s Insect Transformation Center, created a 5 1/2 &ndash; day technical training course that was offered 5 times.  Each course served 24 \u2018students\u2019 who ranged in their professional development from first year graduate students to established professors, along with about 6 visiting instructors.  The course covered theory and practice of insect genetic technologies with the objective of providing participants with sufficient knowledge and experience to enable them to return to their home institutions and confidently pursue their interests in using insect genetic technologies to address questions in insect biology that most interested them.  This course was very popular based on feedback directly and indirectly from course participants.\n\nOverall, the project actively engaged with a broad cross section of the insect biology community and successfully enabled and promoted the creation and sharing of knowledge related to insect genetic technologies.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A O'brochta"
