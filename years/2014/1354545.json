 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Overview\r\n\r\nThis award supports doctoral dissertation research focuses on the politics of deciding what sustainability means in renewable energy systems, particularly solar and wind energy. It aims to understand how assumptions about the environmental and societal benefits of solar and wind energy are built into sustainability best practices and policies. The PI will provide a broad conceptual analysis of \"sustainability engineering\" in the US that aims to understand its epistemological and political roots. He will also develop two case studies of solar and wind project development in California?s West Antelope Valley, to understand the politics of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in renewable technologies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nThe project will build on insights from Environmental Science and Technology Studies and on Engineering Studies. It will map the connections between professional identity-formation and conceptualization of sustainability as they reflect a spectrum of normative worldviews that increasingly challenge American engineering. It will explore the politics of how and why LCAs have become more dominant in defining sustainability, and it will explore the potential for different views of LCA to be advanced by communities, regulators, activists-engineers, and NGOs. Finally, it prompts reflection on the broader question:  Who is a green engineer?\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will be disseminated broadly through publications in leading STS, engineering, and energy policy journals and through presentations in multi and interdisciplinary conferences. Through reports and publications, the data generated by this study will be made available in a timely manner to STS, engineering and policy researchers. The PI plans to partner with federal, state, and local agencies to analyze his results in formats useful to policy makers. Based on these results, he will create an interdisciplinary, internet-run project, aimed at improving the comprehension of sustainability from an engineering perspective.",

It explores the interplay among technology ethics, energy systems, and how engineering cultures foster sustainability by adopting normative assumptions and problem-solving practices&mdash;particularly LCA&mdash;as part of their professional identities. Specifically, I provide a broad conceptual analysis of \"sustainability engineering\" in the US (1989-present) to unpack its history, epistemology and politics. I first show that the 1990\u00c6s produced two distinct engineering ideologies of sustainability&mdash;one emphasizing engineering creativity and innovation, and the other emphasizing normative ethics and socio-cultural change. I find that the dialectic between sustainability and engineering has been defined largely by an ideology of technological change. I argue that engineering ideologies of sustainability not only affect how professionals imagine LCA as a medium of technological and environmental transformation, but also how they conceptualize sustainability as a vehicle to renegotiate engineering knowledge and identity in addressing some of the most pressing existential dilemmas facing their discipline.\n\n \n\nNext, I investigate the politics of engineering identity formation in relation to social, political, regulatory and community pressure to reshape the ethics and boundaries of LCA. I show that starting around 2000, a small group of engineers and, vitally, companies and consulting firms with an eye to addressing technology\u00c6s \"social impacts\" have laid a basis for developing an interesting sustainability tool called Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA).

I describe how LCA became embedded in narratives and decision-making concerning renewable energy in the US&mdash;in their design, as well as in their regulatory, economic and environmental planning. California\u00c6s inaugural utility scale solar and wind projects were trumpeted as conforming to principles derived from LCA.

Seen through my ethnography in the WAV, I present material on the internecine politics of renewable energy project development that took place locally and at the Los Angeles County level&mdash;a local-regional scale perspective that is often not seen in the literature. I describe how the fractured relationships between stakeholders and the disparity between rural and urban mechanisms of governance facilitated the diminishing fairness and participatory democracy in renewable energy project dispute resolution.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas Sakellariou"
