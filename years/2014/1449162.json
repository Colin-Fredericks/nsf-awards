 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every country in Western Europe has become multicultural in the most fundamental sense of the containing multiple cultures.  But is far from obvious how to go forward.  Universalism in the French style has not been successful.  Neither has the approach taken by Great Britain or the Netherlands.  If mutual accommodation is desirable, how can it take place.  This purpose of this study is identify terms under which a national majority will willingly include Muslim immigrants as full members in their new societies on terms acceptable to both the majority and the minority populations.  This will be done by conducting a series of experiments in the Netherlands and Denmark. The results of this study could be of use to policy-makers across the globe who are dealing with growing minority populations.\r\n\r\nMutual accommodation is a topic that has just begun to be examined by social scientists.  The usual manner of studying this topic is to either use limited ethnographic studies or to use national surveys to measure attitudes.  While the ethnographic studies allow one to examine causal factors, they are limited in the scenarios that can be examined.  The national surveys can uncover attittudes towards groups, but it is difficult through standard survey questions to get at what actions are possible.  In this study the principal investigator will be using a series of survey experiments on two surveys that will be national in scope.  The survey experiments will allow the teasing out of causation in a much larger population than usual ethnographic methods.  In addition, it will allow the examination of what levels of accommodation are acceptable to both sets of parties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the biggest contemporary issues is the challenge of inclusion in Muslim minorities in liberal democracies.  It is a challenge because, as scholarly research and mass media, there are prejudices against them and nativist anti-immigrant parties are gaining political power, particularly in Western Europe. \n\nThere is also, of course, terror attacks by Islamic extremists.\n\nResearch and media understandably focus on these negative factors.  But the focus is one-sided.  The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there are also positive factors at work. \n\nTo find out, we conducted studies of public opinion in five countries &ndash; Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  We also developed some new methods to assess public opinion and to test the robustness of public opinion results.\n\nOur working assumption has been that whether national majorities will support inclusion depends on what supporting inclusion asks of them.  This is a simple idea, of course.  But it has been overlooked.  It means that how demanding the terms of inclusion is a vital consideration.\n\nThe objective of the study therefore has been to explore how far national majorities are willing to go in being inclusive of Muslim minorities, where they draw the line, and why they draw it there and not elsewhere. \n\nThe focus has been on three critical considerations.  How willing national majorities are to acknowledge the worth of cultural diversity in general of Muslim culture and traditions in particular; to widen the boundaries of national identity to include Muslim minorities; and to put limits on offensive speech.\n\nAmong the project?s findings: majority citizens support recognizing, including public recognizing the worth of cultural diversity and Muslim culture and values.  However, many draw a line at taking an active part in doing so.  They also support widening the boundaries of national identity to include Muslim minorities, provided that doing so not imply a rejection or strong criticism of its past history and established identity.  And contrary to many claims, majority citizens do not rush to support speech that is critical of Muslims and their faith; distinguish sharply between offensive and hate speech; and, perhaps most interestingly, also distinguish between their own views about what should or should be said about Muslims and what should be allowed to be said about them. \n\nOur findings are not all positive.  For example, there is a much deeper distrust of the leadership of Muslim communities than of ordinary Muslims.  But all in all, putting the results of this study alongside those of previous research provides a more balanced picture of the thinking of majority citizens.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul M Sniderman"
