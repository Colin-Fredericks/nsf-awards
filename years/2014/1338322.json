 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the principle investigators to establish, manage and operate a new Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO).  Drilling and coring are essential for directly accessing the Earth?s subsurface. Drilling generates samples where lack of exposure or alteration by weathering limit scientific inquiry and understanding of the Earth system. It further allows assessment of materials at depth through in-situ measurements and long-term observation and monitoring of deep earth processes, providing a means for validating observations made from the surface. Core samples drilled from sedimentary archives generate a four-dimensional perspective on the earth-life system.  Current and future drilling targets enable research on an enormous variety of topics, including paleoenvironment, biological evolution (including hominid evolution and dispersal), deep-earth biosphere, fault mechanics and seismicity, magmatism, meteor impacts, and groundwater contamination.\r\n\r\nThe CSDCO will perform the following critical functions for the scientific community: 1) engage with interested researchers to develop projects, engineer optimal drilling solutions, solicit bids and secure contracts for efficient drilling operations that meet project goals; 2) support complex project-specific domestic and international logistical requirements; 3) provide an experienced drilling-science interface and sample and data management during drilling operations; 4) provide an open and well-equipped laboratory with all appropriate infrastructure for rapid and thorough initial processing of all types of core samples and management of derivative data; 5) curate all types of cores and data/metadata in physical and virtual repositories; 6) foster the development of an engaged, active, and technologically advanced drilling community; and 7) broaden participation of underrepresented groups.",

The facility performed ten main functions in collaboration with investigators, students, and the partner LacCore Facility: \n\n\nProject development. Translate scientific goals into actionable plans and budgets, selecting optimal techniques for field and lab activities based on project requirements. Solicit and align bids from academic facilities (including this facility, as appropriate), commercial contractors, and other service providers for project components. Prepare budgets and other documentation for proposals to be submitted to project sponsors. Advise investigators regarding funding strategies and sponsor priorities.

Stewardship of cores and other physical samples, data, publications, field operations performance data, reference collections, and community best practices and standard operating procedures in all aspects of project design and execution; capture and distribute data and metadata; distribute samples and connect researchers seeking samples with cores stored at other institutions; provide templates and boilerplate for project documentation.\n\n\nSample preparation and analysis. Provide facilities and services to process and analyze core subsamples, and submit subsamples to other labs for specialized analyses on behalf of researchers.\n\n\nData Management and Cyberinfrastructure. Develop and maintain software, tools, and data systems to support facility needs for integrated data management at each of the above steps, and community priorities.\n\n\nPhysical Infrastructure development. Develop equipment, tools, instrumentation, facility spaces, and other physical infrastructure based on community priorities. \n\n\nCommunity coordination and science planning. Provide a focal point to advance community priorities and develop long-range science plans, to document the vision of scientific communities requiring drilling and coring and provide a roadmap for funding agencies.\n\n\nIn the years funded by this award, a minimum of:\n\n5,252 scientists from 1,154 institutions received facility support through more than 68,029 total contacts (includes all visits, meetings, remote consultations, etc.).\n1,327 scientists from 267 institutions worldwide visited the facility for 6,122 total visits.\n1,001 graduate students, 797 undergraduate students, and 62 primary/secondary students received training and mentorship in geoscience research.\n1,432 scientific projects were supported in total.\n477 peer-reviewed research articles were published by projects receiving LacCore support.\n52 projects received a total of 745 staff-days of support for field operations.\n189 projects rented field equipment from the facility.\n11,857 meters of new core samples were scanned and analyzed.\n488 requests for samples from archived cores in the repository were filled, for 188,170 samples total.\n14,953 samples from cores were analyzed for mineral, chemical, and biological components.\n1,191 sales of specialized field and lab supplies were filled.\n164 orders for specialized field equipment were filled. \n8,356 sites are now represented in the repository core sample collection. \nTens of thousands of scientists worldwide used software developed at the facility to support their research. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anders J Noren"
