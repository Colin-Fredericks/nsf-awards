 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps team has developed tools to forecast energy demands for buildings in cities and for cities as a whole.  The application of forecasting energy demands has high commercial value for a range of users including building operators, utility companies, data center managers, and many others to prepare their facilities and/or take advantage of energy savings. The proposed technology can have a large impact on industries and government entities that provide information, management controls, equipment, and energy resources for the built environment by accurate forecasting of their energy demands. Heavily urbanized regions offer some of the greatest opportunities for this technology to have a significant impact across this broad range of applications areas. New control and HVAC technologies may be envisioned that make use of forecasted energy information to optimize their operation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed concept is based on the existing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model that considers real time temporal fluctuations of local weather and specific characteristics of buildings, neighborhoods, and cities, including building heights, materials, optical properties,HVAC and energy generation systems used, and usage by occupants.  Significant energy savings could be possible due to a range of possible scenarios including but not limited to safety in the grid, anticipated preparation of large HVAC equipment based on refine forecasted weather and/or demand, better planning of production stocks, or long-term energy efficiency planning based on improved understanding of the energy activity of facilities.",

Institutional buildings such as universities, hospitals, corporate campuses, and government offices are particularly susceptible to these costs due to their large occupancy rates as well as numerous large buildings.   Under this NSF I-CORPS project, a team of students and faculty explored the market value of energy forecasting tools for demand response markets. \n\nThrough a market discovery effort where more than 90 companies in US and abroad were contacted and interviewed, a deep understanding of the demand response markets needs was possible.  The team narrowed the market value proposition of energy forecasts to a reliable product for building operators and building managers in demand response markets located in large cities.  The market size for improved building energy management is estimated at $20B and growing very rapidly. The market need is for a reliable and low cost energy forecast solution at the individual buildings with future window of 24 hrs or longer. \n\nThe team developed and tested a system to forecast energy demands up to 72 hrs in advance with no required hardware installation.
