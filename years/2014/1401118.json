The theme of the conference will be on theory, modeling, and applications of Bayesian statistics. It is anticipated that the conference will be attended by an international group of academics, researchers, professionals, government employees and students, from countries around the world. The main focus of this project is on funding for junior researchers that reside in the U.S. \r\n\r\nBayesian methods provide a coherent framework that facilitates blending information from different sources and communicating findings and conclusions using probabilities.  ISBA-2014 is a scholarly conference where new Bayesian statistics ideas will be exchanged. It is a truly international meeting for the dissemination of state of the art statistical methods that use the Bayesian approach. The meeting will promote the development of statistical theory and its applications to engineering and the sciences.  It will provide participants with the opportunity to interact with colleagues from different countries, working in a variety of fields of application of statistical methods.",
