 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing an advanced technological workforce hinges on successful academic and industry partnerships that provide students with hands on experience with cutting edge technology. The Research-Infused MALDI Modules (RIMM) initiative is a collaboration between Anoka-Ramsey Community College (ARCC); the University of Wisconsin-Stout; and Ever Cat Fuels, a renewable fuels company. By integrating research and education, the RIMM modules are transforming the curriculum to include vibrant inquiry-based experiences that incorporate the use of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, a sensitive technology that excels at the molecular analysis of biomolecules. Students are gaining hands-on experience in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and exploring scientific questions that include: biomolecule extraction methods, microchromotography, renewable fuels, and biodiesel synthesis.\r\n\r\nMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is particularly well-suited to undergraduate research. Acknowledged as important in biomedical research and chemistry, MALDI-TOF applications are still emerging in many applied areas, including environmental studies, polymers, and food science. Yet, despite the wide-ranging utility of MALDI-TOF methods, it is rare that an undergraduate would have hands-on experience operating a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. This project is integrating MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry first into the chemistry curriculum followed by the biology curriculum to enhance the undergraduate learning environment and empower undergraduates to enthusiastically pursue science. The partnership with Ever Cat Fuels also provides students with career opportunities in the renewable fuels field.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the partnership serving as a model for how institutions can collaborate to enhance research and instrument access to students, and the infusion of undergraduate research at the community college supporting the retention of under-represented groups (first-generation college students and women). It is also expected that exposing this population to the opportunities at UW-Stout offers an exceptional potential to improve diversity at UW-Stout while promoting retention of students into a four-year program.",
