The hypersaline-adapted group of archaeal microbes, hereafter referred to as halophiles, hold significant promise because they naturally produce chemicals attractive to industry (isoprenoid lipids for fuels, polyhydroxyalkanoate for biodegradable plastics). Strategies that engineer halophile gene regulatory networks (GRNs) or swap gene circuits between halophile strains are attractive for biofuel or other industrial applications. However, before halophile networks can be customized and controlled, additional basic understanding of GRNs and transcription factor (TF) function is required. This plan has three objectives: (1) Characterize the topology, dynamics, and phenotypic output of small-scale GRN motifs that regulate stress and metabolic responses in halophiles. GRN motifs known to regulate important metabolic pathways and extreme stress resistance across four related halophile species using time course gene expression and TF-DNA binding measurements. (2) Build predictive genome-scale statistical models for each halophile to quantify and compare GRN motif architecture and dynamics. Data generated from objective 1 will be integrated into predictive models at two levels of detail: small-scale dynamical models and genome-scale gene regulatory interaction network models. Models will be compared across organisms. (3) Test model predictions in proof-of-principle synthetic biology experiments. Model tests will include three stages of molecular biology experiments: promoter-reporter fusions to test predictions regarding TF-cis-regulatory sequence interactions, high-resolution time course gene expression experiments, and building prototype synthetic biology circuits for increasing production of polyhydroxyalkanoate in halophiles. The products of this research will include predictive GRN models for four related species and prototype synthetic circuits. These gene circuits will test model predictions and increase the production of biodegradable plastic in halophiles. In the long term, the PI aims to exploit halophile GRNs to extend options for biotechnology and bioenergy.",
