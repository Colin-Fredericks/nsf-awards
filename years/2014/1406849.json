 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taking to the air afforded the ancestors of modern birds access to a previously unheralded range of environments, a fact that underlies their remarkable diversity (>10,000 known species). A significant part of this success is thought to have stemmed from the independent evolution of a mammal-like, hyper-inflated brain. Such a brain structure has long been considered necessary for coordinating the many aspects of powered flight, but this hypothesis that has not yet been tested. This study examines evolutionary changes in avian brain development using a wide range of techniques, including high-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging, 3-D visualization of whole brains, and statistical shape analyses. By digitally sampling developmental series of brains from birds and other vertebrates, this project will test for coordinated shape changes in brain regions that share key functional pathways. This data will be used to determine whether evolutionary shifts in brain development have driven important structural evolution in adult avian brains. Correlation with the early evolution of flight behavior will also be investigated.\r\n\r\nData generated for this study will be archived on online repositories and made available to scientific and public spheres. For educational purposes, brain models will be 3-D printed and implemented in museum and school programs. The broader developmental patterns identified here will also be synthesized into the larger findings of the national \"BRAIN\" initiative, which seeks to greatly enhance the understanding of the complex, inner workings of the brain across all species and through evolutionary history.",

First, did evolutionary shift(s) in conserved developmental pathways drive the evolution of enlarged brains in birds from the ancestral dinosaurian condition? Second, do modern birds demonstrate distinct modality in brain development and evolution? And to verify the use of cephalic endocasts (internal molds of the braincase) as proxy for brain morphology in extinct species, what are the morphological biases inherent in endocasts and does this discrepancy change through development? To accomplish these goals, the research employed high-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging and 3-D statistical shape analysis (geometric morphometrics), combining data from both modern and fossil archosaur specimens. The NSF funding led to the examination of the developmental and evolutionary changes in brain shape to elucidate the interplay between these two dimensions of morphological changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The investigators completed all objectives specified in the grant proposal. Due to the NSF funding, the Co-PI was successful in securing and imaging a robust developmental series of two model archosaurs: the American alligator and domestic chicken. Specimens were CT scanned twice&ndash;&ndash;once to reconstruct the endocasts and second time on specimens stained with Lugol&rsquo;s iodine solution to digitally reconstruct the actual brain and other soft-tissue anatomy. The use of soft-tissue staining technique on an extensive size series, spanning 10,000-fold differences in weight from embryos to mature individuals, led to further refinement of the protocol, which was featured on a dedicated website (https://dicect.com/2016/08/11/clahe/) and special symposium at the 2016 International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology meeting. As a result, the funding through NSF enabled a collection of comprehensive craniofacial atlases of osteological and soft-tissues in chickens and alligators (Fig. 1). In addition, the densely sampled shape information extracted from these endocasts and brains allowed the visualization and analysis of shape changes within major functional subdivisions (Fig. 2). These imaging and shape data will offer other investigators a resource for comparing and contrasting vertebrate craniofacial anatomy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From analyzing shape data, the project yielded three main conclusions on brain development and evolution in archosaurs. First, endocasts differ significantly in shape from brain shape, particularly in the rear areas of the brain, and this morphological bias diminishes as alligators and chickens age. Nevertheless, endocranial and brain shape correspond closely in chickens. Therefore, the use of endocasts, at least for birds, is justified when either the endocasts or brains are sampled exclusively, especially when sampling only adult individuals. Second, there is no morphological evidence of evolutionary shift in brain development along the dinosaur-bird transition. Despite their spatial proximity and shared developmental pathways, this pattern is discordant to the previously reported trend of increased juvenilization in skull shape during this major transitional period in dinosaur evolution. Finally, group comprising all modern birds (Neornithes) exhibit a distinct, and potentially unique, developmental-evolutionary modality in brain morphology compared to other archosaurs, pointing to a marked shift in neurogenesis that contributed to the evolution of greatly expanded brains that characterize the birds today. Interestingly, the observed pattern does not mirror mammalian, including primate, brain evolution, implying that enlarged brains can be obtained via multiple routes in vertebrates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Both the Co-PI and PI disseminated the contents of the funded and related research at diverse educational and public programs, including TEDxYouth Day (geared towards middle and high school students), New York Area Educators Evening (over 300 science teachers in attendance), Greenwich Series (to adult public), &ldquo;Meet the Scientists&rdquo; program at the American Museum of Natural History (Age 7 and up), and invited sessions for multiple educational programs at the AMNH. In addition, the PI, Co-PI, and colleagues developed and featured data and products from the broader research program on avian brain evolution in the special exhibit &ldquo;Dinosaurs Among Us&rdquo; at the AMNH, where five million people visit annually. Moreover, the Co-PI and PI were members of the organizing committee for &ldquo;Hack the Dinos&rdquo; hackathon event at the Museum, which utilized data from avian brain projects. With support from the AMNH Education department, some programmers are continuing to develop broadly applicable tools, such as the creation of an online repository system for CT imaging data and automatic segmentation of endocasts from CT image stacks. Ultimately, these codes will be accessible freely and openly through GitHub. Finally, the funded research provided mentorship opportunities for a female high school student, who performed a student-focused project stemming from the Co-PI&rsquo;s dissertation research.
