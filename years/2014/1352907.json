 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists have long known that traits and gene sequences evolve at different rates in different lineages of organisms, but it has been difficult to understand the causes for these shifts in evolutionary rate. For example, the Caryophyllales contain ~6% of all flowering plant species and exhibit extreme life history diversity, including tropical trees, temperate herbs, long-lived succulent cacti, and a diverse array of carnivorous plants. The rate of DNA sequence evolution among these lineages differs greatly. This project will leverage recent advances in genome sequencing technologies and computational methods to evaluate the extent to which changes in life history and ecophysiology in plants are correlated with changes in the evolutionary rate over the entire genome. In collaboration with researchers worldwide, key traits will be characterized and >10,000 genes will be sequenced for 300 representative species of Caryophyllales. Analyses of evolutionary rate shifts in both traits and the genome will be used to assess how life history and ecophysiology have influenced genomic evolution, and vice versa. \r\n\r\nThis project provides the first rigorous assessment of the relationship between shifts in ecology and life history and genome-wide changes in evolutionary rate. It will yield unprecedented insight into the evolution of several genetic pathways of fundamental importance in flowering and crop plants, including those associated with flower development, photosynthesis, and pigmentation. Furthermore, this research will include the development of new and refined bioinformatic tools of broad use to biologists. The project will support the mentorship and training of a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and numerous undergraduates on all aspects of the project, and will fund professional development workshops for high school teachers and plant biologists.",

These rates of change are rarely uniform among species or through time, and can vary dramatically even among close relatives. Various causes have been proposed to explain differences in mutation rate over evolutionary time, including differences in DNA repair, metabolic rate, and life history. In land plants, life history attributes such as annual vs. perennial or herbaceous vs. woody have been suggested to be particularly important in determining evolutionary rate, based on studies with relatively limited DNA sampling. Dissecting the causes and extent of shifts in mutation rates across the genome is of broad significance to evolutionary biology because analyses of genomic evolution are known to be sensitive to cases where evolutionary rates are heterogeneous. However, the extent to which shifts in evolutionary rate were uniform throughout the entire DNA code of an organism (its genome) was unknown prior to this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The primary goal of this project was to test the extent to which shifts in mutation rate in plants are correlated with shifts in life history and whether mutation rate changes occur uniformly across the genome. To accomplish this, we took advantage of improvements in DNA sequencing technology to generate and analyze the sequences of DNA for all proteins present in more than 300 representative species of the large flowering plant group Caryophyllales. The Caryophyllales, which contain 6% of all flowering plant species, represent an ideal group for evaluating fundamental questions in evolution because they possess exceptional diversity in life history, ecology, and physiology, ranging from arid-adapted succulent cacti and salt-loving plants to rainforest trees and carnivorous pitcher plants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project was able to show clearly that shifts in life history, and particularly those related to changes in generation time, are by far the most important cause of changes in mutation rate across Caryophyllales. Moreover, and equally importantly, we found that these changes in evolutionary rate are in fact uniform across the genome, with rare exceptions related to extensive structural rearrangements in the order of genes in the chloroplast. These findings are particularly robust due to our relatively dense sampling; at present, no large group of flowering plants has more genomic data available across its evolutionary breadth than Caryophyllales, as a result of this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consequently, the data generated from our project have also led to key insights into the evolution of several phenomena of broad importance in plant biology. For example, we have demonstrated that doubling of chromosomes has happened at least 27 times across the entire Caryophyllales during its over 100-million-year history, confirming the importance of chromosome doubling as an important force in plant evolution. We have also identified key genes in the synthesis of the betalain pigments, which are color compounds that are unique to certain Caryophyllales and are of significant economic interest. Moreover, we have demonstrated that these pigment compounds evolved only a single time, settling a long controversy. We have also demonstrated that certain genes known to be associated with environmental stress have been duplicated extensively in the cacti and their closest relatives, many of which exist in extreme environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has had diverse broader impacts. In total, twelve research articles have been published, almost all of which are in high-impact research journals. To analyze the large amount of data generated during this project, key new methods in analyzing large DNA data sets were developed that have become increasingly utilized by other researchers in diverse fields. Numerous personnel were trained in research techniques during the project, including a postdoctoral associate and many graduate and undergraduate students. For example, the project led directly to the training of six undergraduates (five of whom were women) at Oberlin College in transcriptomic and bioinformatics research techniques. Educational outreach was also extensive, and included a ?Genes &amp; Genomes Workshop? that trained 24 Ohio high school biology teachers in basic genome biology. Data generated as part of this project were also incorporated into laboratory exercises in an upper-level Biology course at Oberlin College. In addition, a workshop on phylotranscriptomic methods has been offered multiple times to plant biology researchers at the national Botany conference each summer, resulting in over 60 biologists receiving training. Finally, the project has led to the establishment of international collaborations between researchers in the US and in Mexico, China, South Africa, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Spain, among diverse types of institutions ranging from large universities to botanical gardens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/27/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Moore</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352907/1352907_10290530_1556377392771_Escobaria--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352907/1352907_10290530_1556377392771_Escobaria--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Escobaria (Cactaceae)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352907/1352907_10290530_1556377392771_Escobaria--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Escobaria (Cactaceae)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cacti such as this Escobaria cactus are a key group of plants within Caryophyllales.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael J.
