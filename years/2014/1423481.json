Rigorous evaluation is performed by augmenting OpenStack, widely-deployed open-source cloud IaaS software, with ABAC and studying its expressiveness, user-friendliness and performance on large-scale physical infrastructure. The expected outcome of this research is to gain consensus in the research and practitioner community that ABAC would be a standard and viable approach for effective access control in the multi-billion dollar cloud IaaS industry.",
