The objective of the conference is to reflect new developments in the frontiers of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics.  The conference will cover a broad range of current research topics, including high dimensional data analysis, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and next generation and sequence data analysis.  The invited speakers will include leading experts and outstanding young researchers. The workshop will provide opportunities for exchange new ideas and research collaborations. Graduate students and postdocs will gain valuable research experience by attending the workshop and making poster presentations. \r\n\r\nThis award supports the participation of approximately 16 people.  The conference organizers are making special efforts to provide travel support for a diverse group of researchers to attend the workshop.  Underrepresented groups are encouraged to attend and apply for travel support through this award. For detailed information, go to website: http://www2.gsu.edu/~matyiz/2014 workshop/.",
