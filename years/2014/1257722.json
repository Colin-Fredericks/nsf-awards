Robertson McClung\r\n\r\nIOS 1257722 Reciprocal regulation between the circadian clock and the iron homeostasis network in Arabidopsis\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to understanding the role of circadian regulation of iron homeostasis in plants, which is important for two reasons. First, iron often limits plant growth and agricultural yield. Second, although most people acquire iron from plant sources, plant-based diets are poor sources of iron, and iron deficiency represents the single most common human nutritional disorder, affecting approximately one-half of the world's population. The circadian clock integrates temporal information and coordinates many aspects of biology, including metabolism and responses to stress. Specifically, the plant circadian clock regulates the iron homeostasis gene network and, in turn, iron status modulates clock function. This project should help to shape a temporally integrated picture of iron homeostasis; the goal is to understand the network of genes responsible for integrating information about iron status and orchestrating a coordinated response that is temporally as well as spatially regulated. This should transform efforts towards sustainable improvements of crop yields in terms of plant productivity and nutrient content. The project will test the hypothesis that impaired circadian function adversely affects iron homeostasis and thus contributes to reduced fitness and, in agricultural settings, to reduced yield and reduced nutritional quality of food. Understanding the circadian regulation of iron homeostasis may contribute to crop productivity and to nutritional quality of food, particularly in crops grown over broad latitudinal ranges.\r\n\r\nThis project will implement Genetics teaching modules in middle school classrooms in Vermont and New Hampshire in collaboration with the Montshire Museum of Science. \r\n\r\nGenetic resources (mutant lines and constructs) will be deposited with the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Molecular data will be deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.",

Therefore, understanding plant iron acquisition and homeostasis is an important goal in terms of plant growth and yield and, ultimately, human nutrition. \n\n \n\nIron is typically acquired from the soil by plant roots, and that iron must then be transported to the shoots.  Iron stored in the root can impact long-distance iron transport by altering the amount of available for root-to-shoot transport. We have identified a key root protein that defines the balance between root iron storage versus root-to-shoot transport.  This root protein can now be targeted by traditional breeding or by genetic engineering to optimize the balance between root storage versus transport to the shoot.\n\n \n\nWe have also sought to characterize the key proteins that regulate the iron deficiency response in both roots and shoots.  A family of key basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor proteins play critical and overlapping roles in regulating the iron deficiency response, and we have identified one of those, bHLH38, that plays an essential role in iron acquisition.\n\n \n\nWe have observed that time-of-day plays a critical role in limiting the iron deficiency response, which indicates that the circadian clock, an endogenous time-keeping mechanism, plays a role in regulating the iron deficiency response.
