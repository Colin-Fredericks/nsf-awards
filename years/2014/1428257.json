 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, part of the NSF Major Research Instrumentation Program, supports the acquisition of a new instrument at the University of Minnesota (UMN) - Twin Cities for making highly accurate measurements of organic compounds in the atmosphere. The instrument will be used both in the field and in the laboratory. Field sites where data will be collected include the UMN Tall Tower Observatory and the PROPHET tower at the University of Michigan Biological Station. Newly acquired data from the instrument will be used to improve scientific understanding of the biogeochemistry of organic carbon in the land-atmosphere system, with an emphasis on atmospheric composition, land-atmosphere coupling, and the processes driving air pollution and global change.\r\n\r\nThe instrument, a Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS), will be used to address important scientific issues including: \r\n(1) Land-atmosphere carbon exchange and volatile organic compounds (VOCs); (2) Chemical properties and aging of gas-phase organics; (3) Organic gas-aerosol interactions; and (4) Organic carbon biogeochemistry in soils. The instrument will also support the education of graduate and undergraduate students in Land and Atmospheric Science (LAAS) Program at the University of Minnesota.",

It also supported laboratory development of new sampling and calibration procedures for operating the instrument, and of new computer codes for analyzing the measurements. The instrument permits the measurement of a very wide range of volatile organic compounds, with high time resolution (10-times per second) and sensitivity. These volatile organic compounds play a centrally important role in atmospheric science, environmental science, and other areas. Some example research projects that have employed this instrument are given below.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Understanding the emissions and uptake of organic compounds by forests.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Forests are the largest source of reactive organic chemicals to the atmosphere. At the same time, many chemicals are taken up by forests from the atmosphere. This emission and deposition exchange has important effects on the formation of air pollutants and on forest health. The PTR-QiTOF has been used in a multi-institution field study to directly measure the exchange rate of organic chemicals between forests and the atmosphere (see Figure 1). The results are being used to assess how well our current atmospheric models are able to simulate that exchange.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Identification of new fingerprints for disease screening.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Human cells can emit and consume organic compounds as part of their metabolism, and diseased cells may emit and consume different compounds or at different rates than non-diseased cells. Measurement of these compounds (for example, from human breath) may thus offer a way to rapidly and non-invasively screen for the possible presence of a particular disease. The PTR-QiTOF instrument is being used in laboratory trials to investigate this approach. Figure 2 shows an example, illustrating that different types of diseased and non-diseased cells can be separated in this way.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The importance of volatile organic compound emissions by crops.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Crops take up a significant fraction of the global land surface. The PTR-QiTOF instrument has been used to directly measure the emission and deposition of reactive organic chemicals from an agricultural landscape over the course of a year. These measurements are being used to better understand the importance of this emission and deposition exchange for the composition of the atmosphere.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ozone pollution around Lake Michigan.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Despite significant recent reductions in ozone precursor emissions, the Lake Michigan shoreline continues to experience ozone pollution levels of major concern for human and ecosystem health. Understanding the main factors causing this high ozone pollution is important for crafting effective control strategies. The PTR-QiTOF has been used in a large-scale field study to investigate this issue. Volatile organic compound measurements from this instrument are being used to better quantify the main ozone sources in this region and to test and improve air quality models.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sources of atmospheric acids.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Formic acid is one of the most abundant acids in the atmosphere and affects the chemistry of clouds and other processes. Its budget is not currently well understood, as there is more formic acid in the atmosphere than expected based on its known sources. The PTR-QiTOF has been used to better understand the natural source of formic acid from forests as well as how forests remove formic acid from the atmosphere. Figure 3 shows some example data, illustrating the amount of formic acid in the forest atmosphere over the course of a day.
