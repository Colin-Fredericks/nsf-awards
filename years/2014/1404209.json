 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview: The principal goal of experiments in modern particle physics is to uncover new physics that underlies the Standard Model.   Possible approaches include the study of physics processes at the highest available collision energies at accelerators or through studies of the very rare interactions of neutrinos.  The Columbia Particle Physics group tackles both directions.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of physics at the highest available collision energies: A goal of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (the LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is to understand the nature of the Higgs Boson, recently discovered there in 2012, and to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model.  \r\n\r\nThese goals are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. \r\n\r\nThe next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 TeV data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia team is one of the leading groups participating in the ATLAS experiment at CERN.  Their contributions include extensive involvement in the scientific and technical management of the experiment, substantial contributions to the maintenance and operations and upgrades of the key detectors for energy measurement, the Liquid Argon Calorimetry.   In the search for new physics, the group is deeply involved in QCD (jet) studies including boosted jet technology, Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model studies of events with pairs of vector bosons (WW, ZZ and WZ) in the final state to search for new resonant states, gravitons and supersymmetry.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of Neutrino Physics:  Another major question is what happened to all the antimatter in the universe?  Fundamental symmetry arguments suggest that matter and antimatter should have been produced in equal abundance in the early universe, but now all we see is matter.   A key to unraveling this mystery may lie with elusive particles called neutrinos, which are abundant in the universe, but which barely interact with matter.  There are three of these particles known.  Why three? And what are the masses of these particles?  Are there more? Experiments are underway to understand these phenomena and to see if more than three neutrinos exist.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia group is completing is contributions to an earlier reactor-based neutrino experiment called Double CHOOZ and is now heavily involved in a new experiment named MicroBOONE, which is coming online at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois.  This program will address several of the key questions in neutrino physics including the search of additional neutrinos as well as advance an important new technology for the field, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber.  The Columbia group has major responsibilities for the readout electronics of the Time Projection Chamber and triggering system, detector simulation, data acquisition software, and physics analysis.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  A principal focus of the Columbia group over many years and strengthened with this award is the training of undergraduate students through their highly successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer program. This program has demonstrated a commitment to the inclusion of under-represented groups, including many students from undergraduate-only institutions. Follow-up tracking has shown an impressive rate of success for graduates of their programs to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA main part of the program is associated with physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, where Columbia scientists work in the ATLAS collaboration. The LHC is the world?s highest energy particle accelerator, and scientists use the collisions of very high-energy protons produced there to search for answers to fundamental questions about the universe, including the origin of particle masses, the nature of the so-called Dark Matter that accounts for most of the mass in the universe, the reason for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, and the possible existence of new particles and forces.  The Higgs boson, one of the key building blocks of our understanding of how particles interact and the origin of particle masses, was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2012 and resulted in the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize to theoretical physicists Peter Higgs and Francois Englert.  Going beyond the discovery of the Higgs boson, the Columbia group is deeply involved with searches for new particles and phenomena, including using the Higgs boson as a means to search for them.  Our current understanding of particle physics is believed to be only an approximate theory, and these new physics signatures will hold the key to making progress in understanding the ultimate, underlying theory.  To date we have been able to rule out possible new signatures but the increasing intensity of LHC upgrades coming online in the next decade opens a wide region with great discovery potential for these searches. The increasing LHC intensity necessitates that we upgrade the ATLAS detector;  the Columbia program has focused on the development of upgrades of the ATLAS detector electronics, as well as the overall management of the upgrade program.  The LHC has been an unquestioned success and resource for making progress in understanding the universe and clearly will continue to be one of the most important scientific endeavors for the next several decades.\n\nAnother key part of the Columbia program is neutrino physics where the group is studying the phenomena of neutrino oscillations.  Neutrinos are one of the most elusive particles since they interact very weakly being the only matter particles that have no strong or electric charge.  There are three types of neutrinos associated with the three types of charged leptons including the well-known electron.  In the standard theory, neutrinos are massless but, as of 20 years ago, we know that they do have very small masses, which cause the neutrinos to change their type as they move, a phenomenon called neutrino oscillations.   The 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Takaaki Kajita (Univ. of Tokyo) and Arthur B. McDonald (Queen?s University) \"for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass.\"\n\nBy studying the patterns of these neutrino oscillations, we are trying to answer several of the key questions in particle physics: Why is the neutrino mass so small?  Are there new types of \"sterile\" neutrinos?  Are neutrinos (normal or sterile) the reason for the matter to antimatter asymmetry in the universe?  The Columbia group has a major role in exploring all of these questions.\n\nSpecifically, the group is actively involved in the MicroBooNE and MiniBooNE experiments at Fermilab that are searching for indications of a fourth type of sterile neutrino.  Establishing the existence of sterile neutrinos would be a major result for particle physics and is now a priority for the neutrino community.  The Columbia group have been leaders in the MiniBooNE analysis that showed significant anomalies that could be interpreted as sterile neutrino effects.  In 2018, MiniBooNE showed new results that doubled the total data and continued to show these anomalies.  More recently, the group has been working on the MicroBooNE experiment detector readout and the data analysis software.  MicroBooNE has already collected a large amount of data, has shown some preliminary results and will be able to address the MiniBooNE results in the near future.\n\nThe Columbia group places a high priority on education and outreach and has integrated these activities into the ongoing research program. The activities have ranged from individual faculty outreach efforts (lectures, tours, etc) to structured programs like the NSF supported Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU).
