The investigator will conduct archival research and oral-history interviews, and she will develop a geo-spatial database.  She plans to link her historical research with contemporary policy and regulation issues, and to engage with local communities, including Native Americans in the region.\r\n\r\nThe investigator is a well-known environmental historian whose previous work has drawn on multiple disciplines and generated significant media interest; she has a network of contacts that includes a documentary filmmaker and relevant stakeholder groups. The project will produce a narrative of environmental history with the potential for overlap with important questions of technology, culture, and society. It will be of interest to citizen scientists, a wide-array of scholars, and the general public. The most important broader impact of the project is that it might very well influence contemporary policy and law-making.",
