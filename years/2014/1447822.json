 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops theory and algorithms for automatically discovering multiple low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional data, and evaluates these algorithms in image clustering applications. The developed techniques enhance our ability to handle big data problems from multiple sources and modalities, and advance the knowledge on how to interpret massive amounts of complex high-dimensional data. The techniques developed in this project can significantly broaden the applicability of existing results in sparse representation theory to subspace clustering problems, which have found widespread applications in image processing (e.g., image denoising, compression, representation, and segmentation), computer vision (e.g., motion segmentation and face clustering) and dynamical systems (e.g., hybrid system identification).\r\n \r\nThis research develops provably correct and scalable algorithms for learning a union of low-dimensional subspaces from big and corrupted data. The algorithms are based on the so-called self-expressiveness property of the data, which states that an uncorrupted data point can be well approximated by an affine combination of other uncorrupted data points. This research shows that by imposing a structured sparse and low-rank prior on the coefficients, one can discover multiple structures in the data. In the case of uncorrupted data, the research team studies conditions on the data under which a perfect clustering is possible. In the case of data corrupted by outliers, the research team studies conditions under which perfect clustering and outlier rejection are possible. In the case of data with missing entries, the research team studies conditions under which perfect clustering and data completion are possible. The project also develops efficient and scalable algorithms that benefit from distributed and high-performance computing for solving the various subspace clustering problems. These algorithms enable solving large-scale problems in computer vision, including image clustering.",

Traditional methods for discovering structure in high-dimensional data rely on the assumption that high-dimensional data can be well approximated by a single low-dimensional manifold (e.g., a subspace).

The following is a summary of the intellectual merit for this project. 1) Three new scalable approaches for subspace clustering were designed.  The first is a greedy strategy for obtaining subspace-preserving representations.  Being a greedy approach, the amount of computation performed may be bounded in advance, thus allowing for scalable implementations. The second uses the structure of the problem to formulate a new strategy for efficiently identifying subspace-preserving representations.  The third is a divide-and-conquer strategy that can handle datasets distributed among multiple computers.

The exemplars selected were proved theoretically and verified computationally to be balanced among the different subspaces, provided the dimensions of the subspaces were balanced. 4) To handle datasets that arise from affine spaces, an additional modeling constraint is commonly used.  We established that, when the dimension of the ambient dimension is large relative to the dimension of the subspaces, the addition of the affine constraint has no significant impact on the clustering performance.  In the complementary regime, our results show that the affine constraint may significantly improve the clustering performance.  \nBroader Impacts.  The techniques developed in this project significantly broaden the applicability of sparse representation theory to manifold clustering problems, which have widespread applications in image processing (image denoising, compression, representation and segmentation), computer vision (motion segmentation and face clustering) and dynamical systems (hybrid system identification).
