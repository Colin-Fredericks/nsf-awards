 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enterprises rely on specialized network appliances or middleboxes such as load balancers, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and WAN optimizers in order to meet critical performance optimization, security, and policy compliance requirements. With the advent of cloud computing, such middlebox processing will play an increasingly critical role in cloud deployments due to two key factors: 1) As enterprises move their IT infrastructure to the cloud, they want to leverage the same performance and security benefits for applications running in the cloud; and 2) Enterprises want to reduce their infrastructure and management costs by offloading middlebox functionality to cloud providers to leverage the elastic scaling and migration benefits offered by cloud computing. \r\nUnfortunately, cloud customers and providers today lack the necessary abstractions and mechanisms for enabling this transition. At a high-level, the problem is that these workloads are drastically different from traditional computation and storage services for which cloud computing has been extremely successful. This raises fundamental challenges along several dimensions: the need for flexible composition or chaining of network services; the increased impact of network-level performance on such workloads; the inherent difficulty in identifying bottlenecked resources in multiplexed cloud deployments; and the inability to reason about correct and consistent operation of stateful network processing in dynamic deployment scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis project will bridge this disconnect by addressing foundational issues in the design and implementation of (1) policy frameworks, elastic scaling algorithms, and software-defined controllers for enterprise administrators to translate their requirements into an actual physical realization; (2) algorithms for intelligent network-level placement, traffic engineering, and topology design for cloud providers to support such workloads; and (3) new abstractions for managing and manipulating the middlebox-associated state of the network. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This work will inform the critical industry evolution as enterprises and cloud providers are attempting to realize the benefits of ?network virtualization?. Furthermore, the project will enable new dimensions of flexibility for network deployments that do not exist today---democratizing the benefits of middleboxes to small businesses; providing the ability to elastically scale network-level services to meet application demands; and enabling live migration of entire enterprise deployments across physical infrastructures.  The project will generate new course materials on software-defined networking and cloud computing and tightly integrate research with education to help students become experts in these emerging domains. The software tools and benchmark measurement data produced by the research will inform the industry transition and future academic work on such middleboxes-in-the-cloud deployments. Finally, while the project focuses on middleboxes in cloud deployments, the technical foundations developed therein will apply to traditional enterprise and ISP networks as well.",

In parallel, industry  trends that suggest such middlebox processing are playing an increasingly critical role in cloud deployments as well. \nThe overarching goal of this project was to enable enterprises to move the middlebox functionality that they run locally inside their today as part of their internal applications or customer-facing services, and move these to make these in-the-cloud middlebox functions in the same way that they have transitioned their traditional IT infrastructure and virtualized their compute and storage services.  \nSpecifically, this project addressed fundamental challenges for both cloud providers and cloud customers in efficiently delivering \"virtual network services\" with the same degree of flexibility as traditional cloud services. The key challenge here arises both as a consequence of new application requirements for flexible composition of network services and unique network-level effects that arise as a result of these middleboxes lying on the critical data path for applications. \nMore concretely, the research focused on the following key thrusts and outcomes:\n\n\nControl plane orchestration capabilities: The project led to the design  and implementation of novel SDN/NFV orchestration capabilities including new APIs for enabling dynamic service chaining of middleboxes (e.g., FlowTags NSDI\u201914), new state management mechanisms to ensure correct operations when stateful  middlebox functions are migrated,  (e.g., OpenNF, SIGCOMM\u201914), new  efficient and scalable provisioning mechanisms for combining middlebox-specific traffic engineering, placement, and horizontal scaling strategies (e.g., Stratos, arxiv), as well as novel policy graph abstraction to support natural expression and automatic composition of high-level policies from diverse sources (e.g., PGA, SIGCOMM\u201915), as well as new mechanisms for ensuring correctness of the deployed NFV service chains in the cloud (e.g., CHC, NSDI\u201919). \n\n\n\n\nData plane capabilities:  To complement the aforementioned novel control plane features, the project also led to the development of attendant data plane capabilities including: mechanisms for diagnosing network problems in virtual network data planes (e.g., VND, IMC\u201915),  new capabilities to enable the automatic modification of middleboxes to support the new  management APIs (e.g., StateAlyzr, NSDI\u201916), new machine learning mechanisms to model the performance interactions across virtual NFs running on a shared hardware platform (in preparation),  and capabilities to leverage emerging hardware features in smart NICs and programmable switches to support the cloud-scale middlebox functions  (e.g., UNO, SOCC\u201917). \n\n\n\n\nNew application scenarios enabled by these capabilities:  In addition to the above building blocks, the project also demonstrated new kinds of networking and security functions enabled by the flexible cloud processing, including: (a) a  new  architecture for fine-grained security policy enforcement  that can capture dynamic and context-dependent security postures (e.g., PSI, NDSS\u201917), (b) new mechanisms for offloading and scaling up expensive intrusion prevention functions (e.g., SNIPS, ICISS\u201914), and  (c) new architectures future cellular core networks that can benefit from the new autoscaling features (e.g., KLEIN, SOSR\u201916)\n\n\nThe project also had a substantial industry and academic outreach component, through the creation of the HotMiddlebox workshop as well as numerous other workshops and industry engagements.
