 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Dakota State University's (SDSU) strategic plan, Impact 2018, challenges segments of the university to be high performing; research and innovation was singled out as one such area that would take up that challenge. In order to achieve this level of performance, the plan specifies that information technology be the foundation on which this success is built. With this in mind, the Division of Technology and Security has targeted the construction of a Science DMZ to enhance current end-to-end science data transfer scenarios and position university researchers to take advantage of the next generation in network connectivity for cross-institutional collaboration. The Science DMZ project is designed according to the architecture and practices established by the Energy Sciences Network (ESNET) to enable fast end-to-end transfers of scientific data and optimize network components for high-performance scientific applications. Specific elements of the Science DMZ include support for virtual circuits, software defined networking, network testing and enhancements in high-speed data transfer processing. The need for these cyberinfrastructure improvements are driven by increased levels of scientific activity across campus research areas, namely big data users found within the Geographic Information Science Center of Excellence (GSCE), the Image Processing Lab, and several groups within the Biology and Plant Science departments involved with state-of-the-art genomics processing and applications. This effort promises to transform SDSU's infrastructure, providing a coordinated resource to systematically process, transfer and analyze large science data sets, resulting in enhanced collaborative opportunities for the research community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSouth Dakota State University created, with NSF funding, a reliable and frictionless high-speed infrastructure segment for science data transfers.  Today, researcher's work with very large data sets, collaborate with, and use technologies from other universities.  Our completed Science DMZ project allowed us to remove the data transfer barriers for our researchers so that they can spend their time working on solutions to the problems related to their discipline.\n\nThis has allowed our scientists to work with their colleagues across the United States and internationally on research that is of mutual interest.  One example is a scientist who is researching cold tolerance of grape plants in northern climates in order to provide growers in our region access to the best quality grape varieties available.  The work is based on mapping the grape genome and understanding what genes impact cold tolerance in the plant.\n\nAnother scientist is looking at land use in the United States related to agriculture and forestry.  One specific outcome was to help other scientist analyze the data in order to benchmark the amount of native prairie grasses currently in South Dakota.  This will allow land managers to help manage land use resources under their control and local governments with future policy development.  Such initiatives have provided a stimulus for a growing understanding of fundamental questions about how the Biosphere functions.\n\nOur researchers who work with large satellite image files from national and international sources are able to move these files in a much shorter period of time than previously.  This has allowed the South Dakota State University Image Processing Laboratory to enhance collaboration with Federal Labs in efforts to develop novel techniques that account for atmospheric anomalies and adversely impact spectral reflectance signatures measured on land features.\n\nFinally, a broader impact of the grant involves providing educational opportunities for students through the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.  The REU program provides a series of HPC training sessions, a programming workshop, and a training session on the use of South Dakota State University's Science DMZ. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Adelaine"
