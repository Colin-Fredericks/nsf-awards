 "awd_abstract_narration": "From a macroeconomic perspective, one of the most puzzling aspects of the 2007-09 financial\r\ncrisis and the ensuing slow recovery is the relative stability of inflation. Despite a large and sharp\r\ncontraction in output in the second half of 2008 and the persistently high level of resource slack\r\nover the past several years, the U.S. experienced only a modest degree of disinflationary\r\npressures-both at the wholesale and retail levels-behavior that is difficult to explain with\r\ncanonical models of aggregate inflation determination. This project studies the extent to which\r\nthe massive tightening of financial conditions at the height of the crisis in the latter part of 2008\r\nmay help explain why inflation did not fall as much as expected during the financial crisis and the\r\nsubsequent recovery. The underlying hypothesis posits that some firms may strategically set low\r\nprices to attract customers, behavior implied by the \"customer-markets theory,\" which\r\nemphasizes the idea that price setting is a form of investment that builds the future customer base.\r\nAccording to this theory, firms will in normal times maintain low prices relative to their\r\ncompetitors in order to attract new customers. In turn, this implies low current mark-ups and\r\nhence lower cash flows.\r\n\r\nHowever, in times of widespread financial distress-when external finance becomes prohibitively\r\ncostly or even unavailable-financially vulnerable firms will sacrifice their customer base by\r\nraising prices to stabilize current revenues and bolster their liquidity positions. Thus in periods of\r\nacute financial distress, inflation may actually rise despite a drop in economic activity and the\r\nemergence of a significant degree of resource underutilization. The possibility that inflation and\r\noutput move in opposite directions in response to an adverse demand shock also challenges\r\nconventional thinking regarding the appropriate course of action for monetary policy during\r\nfinancial crises.\r\n\r\nTo examine this hypothesis empirically, the project merges firm-level financial data with the\r\ncorresponding firm-level inflation rates computed from the confidential price data collected by\r\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Preliminary results indicate that financial factors had a\r\nsignificant effect on inflation dynamics during the 2007-09 crisis. Consistent with the hypothesis,\r\nfinancially \"weak\" firms raised prices in the latter part of 2008, whereas their financially \"strong\"\r\ncounterparts lowered prices in response to a drop in aggregate demand. To date, the implications\r\nof this mechanism for aggregate inflation dynamics have remained largely unexplored, and this\r\nstudy provides some of the first systematic evidence on how financial conditions influence the\r\nprice-setting behavior of firms through the incentives to set prices in a manner that preserves their\r\nliquidity and balance sheet capacity.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that this channel is quantitatively important, the analysis in this project has a direct\r\nbearing on gauging the likelihood of destructive large-scale disinflations during financial crises. It\r\nalso has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy by arguing that policy makers\r\nshould take into account the interaction between changes in the quality of the firms' balance\r\nsheets and their price-setting behavior when deciding on the future course of nominal interest\r\nrates. In addition to developing the matching algorithm that links BLS' researcher databases with\r\noutside firm-level data sets, the project also provides a new measure of local bank credit-supply\r\nconditions based on the GPS coordinates that may be used in conjunction with future BLS\r\nstudies, opening up a whole new set of research possibilities on the spatial interaction between\r\nfinancial conditions and firm behavior.",
