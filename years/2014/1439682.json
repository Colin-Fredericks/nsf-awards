 "awd_abstract_narration": "NDWI is conducting research in the area of emerging wireless technology, economics, and regulatory policy challenges. Addition of NDWI site to BWAC facilitates the transfer of knowledge from these areas to industry members. Close collaboration with industrial partners will ensure that problems of practical relevance are studied, resulting in direct technology transfer into innovative and practical wireless systems. The diverse research team, with expertise ranging from RF circuit design and electromagnetics, communication systems signal processing and coding, spatial statistics, visualization, and application development, will ensure that many critical aspects of wireless system design are addressed cohesively. Basic research will be combined with robust experimental validation from the hardware level up to large-scale field studies.\r\n\r\nTechniques and solutions developed through NDWIs cooperative research program will potentially impact worldwide wireless standards, software and hardware components, and network deployments. The basic and applied research activities will involve undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research, training them in multiple disciplines relevant to modern wireless networks. Early exposure to the concerns and the approaches in industry will be invaluable in students? education and career development. Several mechanisms will be utilized to attract underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to the program, e.g., REU program in Experimental Research on Wireless Networking (ERWiN).",
