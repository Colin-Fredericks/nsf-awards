 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Steven M. George of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and his students aim to grow novel hybrid organic-inorganic films using molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques and then study the post-processing of these MLD films to form metal oxide/carbon composite films.  Prof. George and his students are developing tin alkoxide films (tincones) and iron alkoxide films (ironcones) using in situ FTIR spectroscopy to study the surface chemistry during MLD film growth and the subsequent spectral changes during pyrolysis to form metal oxide/carbon composite films.  In other studies they grow the MLD films in a hot-wall viscous flow reactor and then anneal the MLD films under vacuum in a tube furnace to form the composite films with metal oxide and carbon nanodomains.  The electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties of these composite films are measured using four-point probe and potentiostat methods.  \r\n\r\nThis research project is focused on: surface chemistry of film growth; characterization of film growth; thin film processing; and measurement of film properties.  The project consists of the development of new hybrid organic-inorganic materials and their post-processing to obtain conducting metal oxide/carbon composites.  The resulting new class of nanocomposite films may have a number of important electrochemical applications for energy storage as Li ion battery electrodes or pseudocapacitance supercapacitors. This project is providing laboratory research experience for graduate and undergraduate students with exposure to state-of-the-art experimental methods and instrumentation.  The students are gaining expertise in vacuum technology, thin film growth, materials processing, spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical characterization.  The students also have the opportunity to present their results at scientific conferences and participate in educational and outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have been pioneering the atomic layer controlled growth and etching of thin films using sequential, self-limiting surface chemical reactions. Our approach for the atomic layer controlled growth of thin films is called atomic layer deposition (ALD).  Our approach for the atomic layer controlled etching of thin films is called atomic layer etching (ALE).  ALD and ALE together provide the ability to add and remove material for atomic layer processing (ALP).  ALP is required for the fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices and other devices important for nanotechnology.\n\nOur NSF project started by using molecular layer deposition (MLD) which is a special version of ALD involving organic reactants.  MLD can deposit organic or hybrid organic-inorganic thin films.  Upon heating under vacuum, the organic component of these films can be reduced to conducting carbon.  This conversion is called pyrolysis and leads to the formation of electrically conducting films that may be important for electrochemistry.  One possible application is creating conducting films on high surface area supports for high energy storage battery electrodes.\n\nDuring our research on MLD, we made a surprising discovery that sequential, self-limiting surface chemical reactions could also lead to the atomic layer controlled removal of thin films.  This discovery convinced us to change our research plans and explore this new process known as thermal ALE.  We determined that the thermal ALE was defined by fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions that led to the formation of stable and volatile reaction products.  Thermal ALE is the reverse of ALD.  We discovered that some of the same reactants that are used in ALD could also be used for thermal ALE.\n\nWe identified a variety of metal precursors that led to thermal ALE via fluorination and ligand-exchange reactions.  We also showed that the ligands on these metal precursors could etch some materials and not other materials.  This ability to selectively etch particular materials is extremely valuable to semiconductor device fabrication.  Selective etching via ALE, as well as selective deposition via ALD, is especially important to develop \"maskless\" patterning that is required for the fabrication of the smallest electronic devices.\n\nOur goal has been to develop a fundamental understanding of thermal ALE.  We have employed a variety of in situ experimental tools including quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) vibrational spectroscopy.  We have also used various ex situ analysis techniques such as x-ray reflectivity (XRR) and x-ray photoelectron (XPS) analysis.  These techniques have allowed us to identify the surface species and quantify the thickness changes during ALE.\n\nWe have also identified some new mechanisms for thermal ALE based on a novel process known as \"conversion-etch\".  During \"conversion-etch\", the metal precursor is able to convert the surface layer of the substrate to a different material that can then be easily etched.  The \"conversion-etch\" process will open up new pathways to etch a wide range of materials.  We are excited about the many new possibilities that are on the horizon for thermal ALE.\n\nThis research conducted by this NSF grant has led to numerous publications and presentations.  We have also written two patent applications based on our research results.  The research has also trained a variety of graduate students and postdoctoral research associates.  The research performed under the NSF grant has also led to additional funding from companies that are interested in particular applications of the research.  The NSF research has provided the fundamental foundations that have enabled a number of additional research projects that will benefit U.S. companies and the U.S. economy.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven M George"
