 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The biological information that defines an organism is stored in its genetic material (DNA), which must be converted into myriad proteins to assemble a live, functioning cell. Many molecular steps are involved in going from DNA to protein, with the biomolecule RNA playing a central role. Indeed, RNA is now thought to be the ancestral molecule at the dawn of life, as it can both store information (like DNA) and act as chemical catalyst (like protein enzymes). A remarkable, evolutionarily conserved family of Sm proteins plays key roles in RNA processing, in organisms ranging from humans to ancient single-celled organisms from the Archaeal branch of life. Sm-mediated pathways vary in scope from mRNA splicing in eukaryotes to RNA-regulated inter-cellular communication networks in bacteria. In each of these pathways at least one key step is mediated by a molecular assembly built upon Sm proteins. Given the ubiquity of the Sm family in contemporary RNA biology, ancient Sm proteins may have played a role in the pivotal transition from an ancestral RNA World to the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) world of modern life. This NSF project focuses on Sm systems from deep-branching archaeal and bacterial species. Leveraging both experiment (biochemistry, proteomics, crystallography) and computation (bioinformatics, simulations), the project will explore what ancient Sm-based RNP complexes look like (structure), their assembly pathways and dynamical behavior (function), and the interrelationships amongst the many Sm systems and their RNA partners (evolution). The work will help discover how the Sm family evolved into a pervasive scaffold for the construction of RNA-based molecular machines. The project's long-term objective - to decipher the biochemical roles of Sm proteins in the early evolution of RNA-associated molecular machines - also will illuminate, in molecular detail, the potential roles of the ancient Sm family in facilitating the transition from a primordial RNA world to our modern RNP world.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Beyond its scientific impact, this project will educate and train over a dozen under-graduate and graduate students in primary research. Because the project overlaps several disciplines, including biology (RNA, evolution), chemistry (crystallography, molecular simulations) and computer science (bioinformatics), students will learn the biological sciences in a truly integrated and interdisciplinary manner: The driving questions are biological, while the tools and approaches are physical/quantitative. This same multidisciplinary approach, uniting biology and computation, is the basis for the project's central educational plan, dubbed UVaCompBio. The basic model of the UVaCompBio project is that undergraduates from the biosciences and the quantitative sciences (physics, chemistry, CS, etc.) will be paired into teams that work together on active learning exercises and mini-projects over the course of an academic term, and in several areas of computational biology (physics- and informatics-based). This effort will (i) prepare students from the biosciences for quantitative biology, and (ii) give undergraduates from the quantitative sciences a working appreciation of the fascinating nature of complex biological systems. That two-fold goal will, in turn, achieve the ultimate goal of empowering students to be fearless learners who can work at the interfaces between seemingly unrelated scientific disciplines. Thus, over the course of the project period this educational initiative will train scores of undergraduate students and, with an emphasis on quantitative biology and a minority outreach component, will simultaneously and directly address these two major goals of modern science education.",

We consider the Sm family as a useful model system for how a complex, cellular-scale physiology (RNA processing) might emerge from the structures and interactions of its relatively simple molecular components (Sm proteins).&nbsp; This Project specifically focused on Sm systems from three evolutionarily ancient species: the archaeon <em>Pyrobaculum aerophilum</em> (<em>Pae</em>) and two primitive bacteria, <em>Thermotoga maritima</em> (<em>Tma</em>) and <em>Aquifex aeolicus</em> (<em>Aae</em>), that optimally grow at high temperatures (exceeding &asymp;160'F). We targeted these species for various reasons, including that they are deep-branching ('basal') lineages that bracket major evolutionary events in the dispersion of the archaeal and bacterial clades. To supply basic, much-needed information about ancient Sm systems, this Project's first goal was to elucidate the functions and structures of primitive Sm-based assemblies. In the next two stages of the Project, we sought to decipher (i) the dynamical bases by which Sm proteins assemble into rings and bind/anneal RNAs, as well as (ii) the enigmatic sequence/structure/function riddles posed by the Sm family. In pursuing these goals, the Project leveraged both experimental and computational approaches. What follows is but one vignette from our Project's findings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To expand our knowledge of Sm&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;RNA interactions, via comparative analyses across phylogenetically diverse lineages, we characterized an Sm homolog, known as 'Hfq', that we bioinformatically detected in the taxonomic family <em>Aquificae </em>(specifically, the aforementioned species <em>Aae</em>). This Sm interested us because (i) <em>Aae</em> is a hyperthermophilic, Gram-negative species that is among the most deeply branching and slowly evolving bacterial lineages; (ii) any <em>Aae </em>Hfq RNA-associated pathways could be among the most ancient in extant life; and (iii) partly because of its 'streamlined'&nbsp;genome, we suspected that <em>Aae </em>may feature novel Hfq-based RNA regulatory networks. In undertaking biochemical, proteomic, biophysical and crystallographic studies of <em>Aae </em>Hfq, we determined two 3D crystal structures---one of the protein alone ('apo') and another as a co-crystal structure wherein we resolved a bound RNA. Both structures were refined to high resolution; taken together, the apo and RNA-bound <em>Aae </em>Hfq structures revealed a pre-organized RNA-binding site on the lateral rim of an Hfq hexamer.&nbsp; This exciting finding advanced our high-resolution view of RNA-binding at Hfq's lateral face, with implications for the evolution of Sm-facilitated RNA function: Previous structural work on Hfq had focused exclusively on more phylogenetically modern species, from a limited range of bacterial phyla (e.g., <em>E. coli</em>).&nbsp; The new structures determined in this Project revealed that Hfq's lateral RNA-binding mode likely existed in the last common ancestor of the Bacteria (the <em>Aquificales</em> are exceedingly deep-branching, likely more so than all other bacterial phyla). We made similarly exciting discoveries in studying <em>Tma</em> and <em>Pae</em> Sm proteins, e.g. a <em>Tma</em> Hfq that binds 'nanoRNAs', and a novel <em>Pae</em> Sm protein that self-assembles into cubes consisting of a 6x8 arrangement of 48 Sm subunits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To distill the scientific impact of this work (including pedagogical studies) into a single metric, note that we published 26 peer-reviewed articles which cite funding from this Project award. And, as an integral part of these efforts, this Project trained many undergraduate and graduate students in primary research. Specifically, (i) one student finished her PhD after the start of the Project period (Spring 2014); (ii) six graduate students completed the bulk of their research with funds from this Project (three PhDs, three MSc degrees); (iii) one student began a PhD near the end of this Project (pioneering the application of deep learning methods to questions raised by the Sm family); (iv) six MSc in Data Science students worked on problems related to this Project in the 2018-20 timeframe; and (v) seven undergraduates conducted research on this Project during 2016-20 (several went on to graduate programs, including at Columbia, MIT, UCLA and beyond). Thus, in summary, this Project positively impacted the scientific training and education of over 20 undergraduate and graduate students.&nbsp; Because the Project overlapped several disciplines---including biology (RNA, evolution), chemistry (crystallography, simulations), and computational sciences (bioinformatics, machine learning/A.I., etc.)---these students learned the biological sciences in an integrated and multidisciplinary environment, uniting biology and computation. Finally, this Project also helped fund our development of a brand new upper-undergraduate level course, entitled \"<em>Introduction to Computational Biology</em>\"; first taught in Spring 2018, this semester-long course was driven by both active-learning--formatted lecture sessions and student-led projects, and covered both the statistics-based and physics-based streams of computational biology.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Cameron&nbsp;Mura</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1350957/1350957_10285917_1703884734869_PattRandMura_TmaHFq_ActaF_Fig_S_structureOverview_v3cm_4tpack--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1350957/1350957_10285917_1703884734869_PattRandMura_TmaHFq_ActaF_Fig_S_structureOverview_v3cm_4tpack--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Crystal Structure of an Ancient Bacterial Sm (Hfq)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1350957/1350957_10285917_1703884734869_PattRandMura_TmaHFq_ActaF_Fig_S_structureOverview_v3cm_4tpack--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Crystal Structure of an Ancient Bacterial Sm (Hfq)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This high-resolution crystal structure of an ancient Hfq hexamer (ribbon) reveals that uridine-rich RNA (shown as van der Walls spheres) binds in the 'proximal' pore.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cameron Mura</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cameron&nbsp;Mura\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Crystal Structure of an Ancient Bacterial Sm (Hfq)</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1350957/1350957_10285917_1703884898203_stanek_Fig_7_U6_site_edensity_v7cm_4tpack--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1350957/1350957_10285917_1703884898203_stanek_Fig_7_U6_site_edensity_v7cm_4tpack--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Crystal Structure of Aae Hfq with RNA Bound\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1350957/1350957_10285917_1703884898203_stanek_Fig_7_U6_site_edensity_v7cm_4tpack--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Crystal Structure of Aae Hfq with RNA Bound\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration of the Aae Hfq hexamer at high resolution, showing a U-rich RNA bound at the lateral site (blue electron density mesh).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cameron Mura</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cameron&nbsp;Mura\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Crystal Structure of Aae Hfq with RNA Bound</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
