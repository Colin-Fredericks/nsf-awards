 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inaugural ACM HotWireless 2014 workshop aims to become a premier venue for publishing early-stage work on disruptive wireless technologies and systems that can enable orders of magnitude improvements in wireless performance and novel wireless applications.  The workshop features a high-quality technical program, with a combination of invited and peer-reviewed papers. It has a single-track session, which offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that foster technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants. Being held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom, which is the premier international conference in the area of mobile computing research, also helps boost the networking opportunities for the participants of this workshop. \r\n\r\nThis award will help increase the representation and participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 5 travel grants. By creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, to attend a high-quality workshop, this award will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, provide them new mentoring opportunities, and offer them the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral positions which will help them advance in their research careers.",
