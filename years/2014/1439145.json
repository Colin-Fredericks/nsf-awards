 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future exascale computing systems will be available to study important,\r\ncompute-intensive applications such as multi-physics multi-scale natural\r\nphenomena and engineering systems typically modeled accurately by partial\r\ndifferential equations (PDEs).\u00a0 A prime example is turbulence at high Reynolds\r\nnumbers, typically found in natural and engineering systems, which comprise an\r\nextremely wide range of spatial and temporal scales and has thus became a Grand\r\nChallenge in scientific computing.\r\n\r\nMany challenges exists that must be overcome before exascale systems\r\ncan be utilized effectively. These include communication between\r\nprocessing elements as well as global synchronizations both of which will\r\nlikely be a main bottleneck when millions of billions of processing elements\r\nare utilized in a simulation.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the PIs develop novel exascale numerical schemes for PDEs,\r\nespecially those describing turbulent flows, that exploit asynchrony from the mathematical to\r\nthe software level. These are based on widely used finite differences, compact differentiation and spectral schemes.\r\nAsynchrony offers better performance but also introduces errors in the solution. The new schemes will\r\nbe able to trade-off accuracy and performance in a quantitative and predictable manner.\r\nThe approach includes (i) rigorous mathematical studies of stability and\r\naccuracy based on numerical analysis and dynamical systems, which will also\r\nprovide a framework for the development of new schemes and quantify its\r\nuncertainty, (ii) development of specific elements in a scalable library for parallel\r\ncomputing to enable portable implementations on current and future machines,\r\nand (iii) physics based modeling of numerical perturbations in\r\nrealistic flows.\r\n\r\nThe tools, techniques and simulation data in this project\r\nwill be integrated in the PIs' educational efforts through graduate mentoring, undergraduate\r\nresearch and as material for courses in high-performance computing, fluid dynamics and dynamical systems\r\ntaught by the PIs.",
