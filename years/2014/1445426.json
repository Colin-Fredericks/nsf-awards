Participants also will receive an introduction to communication, team-building and leadership skills, and elements of interdisciplinary research.\r\nThey expect to develop a core cadre of approximately 30 young scientists.\r\nThe proposed symposium would build upon, and also act as a follow on to, a similar symposium organized by the PI?s during the International Polar Year, the \"IPY: Next Generation Polar Research (IPY NGPR) Symposium\". \r\n",
