 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal addresses a fundamental aim of the ocean drilling program, namely to help characterize one of the largest and least studied ecosystems on Earth, the deep biosphere of the igneous crust buried below the ocean floor. The principal scientific objective of IODP expedition 336 is, in particular, to investigate the microbial population in basaltic crust from the North Pond area near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The study samples are weathered and porous basalts taken from beneath ~100 m of sediment in the North Pond area. The study proposes to determine both the diversity of the microbe population (using DNA) and its metabolic activity (using RNA). The PI?s will investigate the relationship between microbes in the basement and those in the water column and determine which metabolic pathways are used by the deep basement microbes. The study will also provide baseline data for the long-term biological observatories installed in the sub-seafloor basement during expedition 336. \r\nUnderstanding deep biosphere life is a major thrust of the new IODP science plan and has implications for understanding the limits of life. The NSF-funded C-DEBI (Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations) program and Deep Earth Academy promote K-12 education and communicate the results of deep biosphere studies to broad technical and popular audience. An undergraduate student will be involved in the research.",

Limited access to subsurface basalt samples has inhibited biological characterization of microbial communities within this unique, isolated, potentially habitable environment. Basalt contains redox active iron and additional metals available as energy sources for microbial populations (Canfield et al., 2006). Basalt has been shown to geochemically oxidize over millions of years, thus remaining biologically redox active (Bach and Edwards, 2004). Basalt is also porous allowing fluid exchange and providing single-celled life with dissolved metabolites and nutrients required for cell maintenance and growth. Initial cultivation-based and in situ analysis of subsurface basalt has produced some structural identification of populations that have the potential to alter the crust.

Drilling during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 336 in the &lsquo;North Pond&rsquo; sediment pond feature on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012.

Each sample passed drilling contamination quality control standards for microbial analysis. Descriptions of each sample were recorded shipboard and then visually confirmed prior to RNA extraction. The samples from drill site 1382 were aphyric with glassy margins (7R-2B) and a sedimentary breccia with basalt clasts and a rust color (8R-4D).

The targeted 16S rRNA V1-V3 region was sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing and analyzed following a standardized Mills Lab work flow. Sequencing efforts produced 2539 sequences; with each sample library containing 124 to 1323 sequences phylogenetically related to 4 to 10 phyla.

Analysis of these lineages suggested both anaerobic and aerobic metabolisms with populations capable of utilizing the available carbonate present within the basalt samples. Additional characteristics suggested metabolisms capable of taking advantage of substrates within the basalt. As seen in the overlying sediments, many lineages were capable of using nitrogen species in redox reactions, supporting the importance of this pathway in energy-limited environments.
