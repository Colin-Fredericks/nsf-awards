 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the response of forests to air pollution is critical as it affects clean water, timber production and carbon storage.  Comparing forests in different parts of the earth will help us understand if the response is uniform or regionally specific.  This project compares forest responses in the temperate deciduous forest in the eastern United States and in eastern China. These two countries have opposite histories and trajectories of air pollution. When the Industrial Revolution began, air pollution in the form of acid deposition increased rapidly in the U.S. and was at high levels until the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 when the pollution dropped dramatically. Over the same time period, China has had low levels of air pollution until relatively recently as pollution levels have increased to historic highs. In a preliminary study using tree rings and carbon isotopes, an important isotopic signal was found in Eastern red cedars in the West Virginia that indicated these trees are now recovering from air pollution. This observation, however, is limited to a single species from a single stand of trees.  This project will determine how wide-spread and universal this response is by using additional tree species along a transect stretching across the southern, central, and northern Appalachian region. Similar transects in China will be used to compare the isotopic signatures and growth of trees from similar genera that are currently undergoing opposite patterns of change in acid deposition.  \r\n\r\nIf widespread, results from this study will have important implications for carbon storage and cycling in many northern hemisphere forests, especially those downwind from pollution sources. Understanding such complexities will provide much needed information on the overall vulnerability and resilience of forests to dynamic changes in acidic pollution and atmospheric CO2. To broaden the societal impact of the proposed research, data will be made available to inform policy makers, federal land managers, modelers, and other scientists who may benefit from the results. Activities will be incorporated into effective learning activities for high school students and adults to provide a deeper understanding of the link between effective government policies (such as the Clean Air Act) and the health of forest ecosystems. Further, this project will provide training for graduate students and undergraduates, particularly those from facets of society that are underrepresented in science education and research.",

In order to continually refine this important role of forests in earth system models, there is a colossal effort by scientists to more completely understand how forests function, how trees grow, and the environmental factors that either positively or negatively affect tree growth. Tree growth is complex and potentially affected by many environmental factors, such as precipitation, temperature, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>concentration, and acidic deposition.

Our research project used increment cores from trees growing naturally in forests for decades and the isotopic signatures of the tree ring wood to provide an annually refined record of tree growth and leaf physiology in order to disentangle the environmental complexity of historical changes in forest productivity. We cored conifer and deciduous hardwood trees in the Appalachian region in 16 forested locations, ranging from the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee and Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina to the Central Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We used standard dendrochronological techniques (bootstrapped Pearson&rsquo;s correlations), as well as more complex statistical methods (Kendall&rsquo;s rank correlation and linear mixed effects models), to examine the influence and interactions of environmental parameters on historic tree growth and physiology, as well as the sensitivity by the trees to individual environmental factors. For red spruce, a major conifer species in the Appalachian Mountains, the two most important environmental factors affecting tree growth since 1989 were increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>and reductions in acidic sulfur air pollution.
