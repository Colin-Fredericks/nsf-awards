 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project lies within the field of harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations.  Roughly speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and \"operators\" (i.e., mappings that transform one function into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The name itself arose by analogy with the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components (\"harmonics\"). Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between geometric properties of sets, and their \"measures\" (the latter are generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume). Partial differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, steady-state temperature distributions, and elastic deformations. A particular focus of the present project is to explore further the relationship between geometry and the behavior of solutions to these differential equations that arise in the physical world.\r\n\r\nThe project has two main areas of focus. First, the principal investigator plans to characterize quantitative rectifiability properties of a closed set E, of codimension one in d-dimensional Euclidean space, in terms of the  behavior of harmonic functions (and of solutions of linear and quasi-linear elliptic equations more generally) in the complement of E. In particular, a primary goal of the proposal is to prove theorems  of F. and M. Riesz type, and converses, without imposing any connectivity assumptions on either the set E or its complement. In the classical F. and M. Riesz Theorem, and its modern descendants, one obtains existence of, and in some cases quantitative estimates for, the Poisson kernel (i.e., the Radon-Nykodym derivative of harmonic measure for a domain D, with respect to arclength or surface measure on the boundary of D), as a consequence of rectifiability properties of the boundary. In the presence of suitable connectivity hypotheses, say when the set E is the boundary of a domain D enjoying an appropriate quantitative version of path connectedness, the geometry of E can be characterized in terms of the behavior of the Poisson kernel associated to D. On the other hand, a counterexample of Bishop and Jones precludes such results in the absence of connectivity. Thus, to prove theorems of F. and M. Riesz type without connectivity hypotheses will entail finding estimates for solutions of elliptic equations, estimates that serve as appropriate substitutes for Poisson kernel regularity. In the second area of focus of this project, the principal investigator plans to continue to investigate solvability of elliptic boundary value problems, in particular, the Neumann problem, for divergence form, second-order elliptic equations with \"radially\"-independent coefficients in the half-space, without assuming self-adjointness of the coefficient matrix. Previous work of the principal investigaor and his coauthors has treated the Dirichlet and regularity problems in this setting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to better understand the following pair of questions: how does geometry influence the behavior of solutions to partial differential equations of so-called \"elliptic\" type, and conversely, how can one glean geometric information from knowledge of the behavior of such solutions?Let me begin by translating all that into language suitable for the non-specialist.\n\n\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical description of a wide variety of phenomena in the realworld, including fluid flows, elastic deformations, electricity and magnetism,and the propagation of heat and of waves.   Elliptic PDEs in particular describe steady-state phenomena.  A salient example is that of steady-state heat conduction,  pertaining to an object in an equilibrium state in which its temperature distribution (that is, the temperature at each point in the interior of the object) does not change with time.   When the object is composed of some homogeneous medium, the relevant PDE is the``Laplace equation\", solutions to which are known as harmonic functions.The latter name derives from the fact that in the case of certain simple objects, like a rectangular slab, these solutions may be represented by Fourier series, that is, as a sum of different sine waves, analogous to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components.    For inhomogeneous objects, the relevant PDE is no longer the Laplace equation, but in the steady-state setting it is still of elliptic type.\n\n\nIt is not hard to see, from an intuitive point of view, that there is necessarily a relationship between geometry and the behavior of solutions of these PDEs.  Let us consider the case of a homogeneous fluid medium, in which heat is conducted by the transfer of kinetic energy that occurs when one molecule collides with another.  These collisions induce the random movement known as Brownian motion, that is, the movement along a random path of a particle suspended in the fluid.  In this setting, the relevant solutions are harmonic functions, which we view as steady state temperature distributions.  Their behavior is governed by properties of the harmonic measure, which measures any specified region R on the boundary (i.e., the outer surface) of the object according to the following rule: for each point P within the object, the harmonic measure at P of the region R is simply the probability that a Brownian traveler emanating from P will reach the boundary for the first time somewhere within R.   Intuitively, it is clear that if some part of the boundary of the object is rather inaccessible from a given point P, then the harmonic measure of that part of the boundary will be small at P, so that there is an evident interplay between geometry and the behavior of solutions.The difficulty lies in making these statements precise and quantitative.  In the present project, we have made significant progress in this area.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven C Hofmann"
