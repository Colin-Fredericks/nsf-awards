 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fewer than 200 indigenous languages are still spoken today in the United States; 80% are not expected to survive through the 21st century. This extensive loss will have an impact not only on the indigenous American societies in which these languages were once predominant, but also on the scientific study of North American languages and the evidence they provide regarding linguistic variation and linguistic universals.  Although current research is incomplete, evidence suggests a possible positive link between language and cultural revitalization and community health and social improvement. In addition to these benefits, efforts to document threatened indigenous languages and cultures play an important role in developing a deeper understanding of human cultural diversity and human language.  To advance these goals, the Myaamia Center at Miami University and the Smithsonian Institution's Recovering Voices Program have partnered to organize and run the Breath of Life Archival Institute to be held at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., during the summer of 2015.   \r\n\r\nThe Breath of Life Archival Institute supported by this award is a two-week workshop designed to bring together native language educators and learners from communities across the United States to provide workshop participants, with the help of linguistic mentors, direct access to archival documents of their native languages.  In most cases, the communities represented by these participants have lost all or nearly all of their native speakers and must rely on documentation to regenerate the knowledge of their languages.  Through a series of instructional presentations, participants will be trained on a variety of topics including basic linguistics, how to read phonetic symbols, and how to work with archival materials. With this preparation, participants will visit the archives at the National Anthropological Archives and the Library of Congress to locate important linguistic materials on their respective languages.  At the end of the workshop, participants will share projects they have created during the course of the institute.",

The Institute plays a critical role in not only training these citizen scientists in the fields of linguistics and language revitalization, but helping them discover little used archival materials necessary for their revitalization efforts.  Participants leverage archival collections located in the DC area in order to support language revitalization efforts in their communities.  The 2015 BoL Institute hosted twenty nine (29) community researchers representing fourteen (14) different language communities.  Together with their fifteen (15) linguistic partners they spent two (2) weeks learning how to access archives and locate resources on their individual languages.\n\n \nCommunity researchers received instruction in a variety of topics in linguistics including phonetics, phonology and syntax, and were exposed to a wide range of revitalization issues including pedagogy, home strategies and the use of relevant technology.  They worked closely with their linguistic partners learning how to extract and analyse important linguistic and cultural information from archival sources.  The Institute culminated in participant presentations to the group, sharing their discoveries in the archival materials, and their new knowledge of how to use and interpret them. Many expressed the certainty that the materials and their new skills will inform their language revitalization efforts for years to come.\n\n \n At the start of BoL, participants are provided with digital copies of representative samples of the archival collections at the National Anthropological Archives (NAA) that are relevant to their languages.

This  encourages future research and documentation ultimately filling the knowledge gap.  BoL participants, as a result of their participation in the institute, become particularly well positioned for receiving the support from BoL organizational partner Recovering Voices at the Smithsonian\u00c6s National Museum of Natural History to return to the Smithsonian collections for further research under the Community Research Program. Further, sustained relationships are generated between BoL citizen scientists and the Smithsonian\u00c6s research and curatorial staff to further foster revitalization through collections research.\n\n \nAnother important outcome of the BoL Institute is the intertribal networking that takes place, and collaboration between language communities and their linguistic partners, which in many cases are new.
