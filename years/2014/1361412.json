 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Daniel M. Neumark of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student colleagues are investigating the dynamics of excess electrons with isolated anion clusters and in liquid jets. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Neumark and his group is to develop a better understanding of the ways in which electrons interact with molecules in condensed phases.  The results of this research will help develop a better understanding of the ways in which free electrons can attach to and react with DNA nucleobases, a first step in a biologically important radiochemical process. \r\n\r\nTime-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) methods will be used to study the dynamics of excess electrons interacting with isolated molecules and in condensed phases.  TRPES will be used to: (1) study the relaxation dynamics of electronically excited electrons in liquid jets of water and methanol; these experiments will help to link previous TRPES studies of cluster anions to previous transient absorption measurement of bulk solvated electrons; (2) study the dynamics of low-energy electron attachment to isolated uracil and thymine molecules as well as clusters of these molecules with water; and (3) investigate the interaction of electrons with nucleic acid constituents in a liquid jet.  The ultimate aim of these experiments is to develop a better understanding of the ways in which low-energy electrons interact with solvent and react with nucleic acids.  This work will help to illuminate some important biological radiochemistry.  Students working with Prof. Neumark receive training in modern physical chemistry methods.  Recent students have gone on to careers in high-tech industries, academia, and the U. S. Government.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe interaction of nucleic acid (NA) constituents with low energy electrons is a central issue in fields ranging from pre-biotic chemistry to radiation biology.   It is a frontier area in chemical physics in which state-of-the-art electron scattering and ultrafast laser development have been brought to bear, with the goal of understanding how these interactions take place both in the gas phase and in aqueous environments.  The cleavage of DNA by low energy electrons is a primary means of radiation damage, and the exact mechanism by which this happens is an area of significant current interest.\n\nOur research program during the past grant period has focused on electron-induced dynamics in two very different environments:  gas phase anion clusters and liquid microjets.  In both cases, time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy is the primary experimental technique.  The overarching goal is to gain a fundamental understanding of how low energy electrons interact with nucleobases and more complex nucleic acid constituents.  While electron-nucleobase interactions have been extensively studied in electron scattering experiments, our work has provided the first time-resolved measurements of these interactions.  By performing a suite of complementary experiments in the two environments, we can elucidate the fundamentals of electron attachment to gas phase nucleic acid constituents and then determine how these dynamics are modified in the liquid phase. \n\nIn the gas phase experiments that have been carried out thus far, we form binary anion clusters I?NB in which an iodide anion is complexed with a nucleobase (NB).  By photoexciting the complex with an ultraviolet femtosecond pump pulse near or well above the vertical detachment energy of the complex, we transfer the excess electron from the iodide to the adjacent nucleobase, formting a transient negative ion [I&middot;NB]-.  The resulting dynamics are monitored by photodetachment with a femtosecond probe pulse and measurement of the photoelectron spectrum as a function of pump-probe delay.  We find that the transient [I&middot;NB]? anion decays either by loss of an electron (autodetachment) by back-electron transfer to the I atom and dissociation to I- + NB.\n\nThe liquid jet experiments have thus far focused on electron solvation dynamics along with preliminary results on electron-nucleobase interactions in solution.  In these experiments, electrons are generated by charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) excitation of I? anions in water or methanol.  Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy using two or three femtosecond laser pulses is used to follow the resulting electron dynamics in both the pure solvent and in aqueous solutions of the nucleobase.   These experiments probe (a) the relaxation dynamics of electrons created by CTTS, (b) the dynamics that ensue when these electrons are photoexcited from their s to p states, and (c) the energetic changes that occur when an equilibrated hydrated electron binds to a nucleic acid constituent.  Most significantly, these experiments show that lifetime of the p state of the hydrated electron is less than 100 fs, in strong support of one of the models proposed for relaxation of this species in aqueous solution. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel M Neumark"
