ICASS brings together scholars and other researchers interested in issues of the North. The focus of this Congress will be on \"Northern Sustainabilities\" and the requested funding will be used to support the participation of early career scholars, indigenous scholars, as well as northern indigenous community members.   The organizers, Andrey Petrov (member of the organizing committee of the International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences), and Gail Fondahl (President of the International Arctic Social Science Association) will help build interdisciplinary capacity and scholarship by supplementing support increased participation in the Congress.  This in turn will provide new insights in to key areas of concern both from scientists and the public on the long term sustainability of northern development and community well-being.",
