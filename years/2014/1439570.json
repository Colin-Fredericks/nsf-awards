 "awd_abstract_narration": "Video data is ubiquitous in STEM education research and development. Yet the potential for these data to be used outside the initial project in which they are developed has been limited by the labor intensive methodology to index and categorize video segments in ways that support use by external researchers. This project will build the community to determine the taxonomy by which videos might be characterized. The researchers and a strong advisory board will work with the programmers of inVideo, a tool and software for indexing language and non-language objects in video data sets. Working with video of students and teachers in mathematics classrooms from the Robert B. Davis Institute for Learning, the project will determine which categories of videos from the collection are amenable for indexing by introducing successively more complex video samples. The project will push the boundaries of computer science algorithms for video search, benefiting both the computer science community and the mathematics education research and development communities.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no automated method for accessing the content data locked within a video format that is cost effective and available for education purposes. The researchers in this project will determine whether application of automated indexing to generate high precision and high recall retrievals is possible; what human-augmented annotation generates towards more effective searching; and, advisable practices for obtaining IRB approval to share video resources among a wider community of researchers to facilitate a fine-grained analysis on other data sets. The project will train the audio-to-text translation function of inVideo to recognize speech patterns of people recorded in the videos using translations that currently exist. The second stage of the project will address the process of testing new samples of videos for which human-generated transcripts do not exist.  The project will also develop a web interface for inVideo to facilitate transcript editing, time-stamped commenting and tagging by remote users. The results of this study will enhance the utility of educational video to a wide community of researchers.",

Relevant conceptual perspectives include those generated by mathematics education researchers, mathematicians, discourse analysts, child developmental psychologists, learning scientists, among others. Too often, however, the benefits of mathematics education research are limited to the community of mathematics education researchers, and their local students. The reasons for this limitation are many, including difficulty of establishing funding support for interdisciplinary studies, and the transient nature of children&rsquo;s learning behaviors in mathematics. In order to make records of children&rsquo;s learning behaviors more accessible and permanent, education researchers have, for decades, used videotaping of learning within classroom contexts. Careful study of video recordings allows not only the study of how ideas are built by learners, but also how to learn about the subtleties of student thought processes, to trace student cognitive growth in various social settings, and to gain insight into how social processes influence personal cognitive development. Videos have served as a powerful tool for tracing a student&rsquo;s development of mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning over time. One major database of children&rsquo;s learning mathematics (over 4500 hours) has been developed over decades by Rutgers University with financial support from the NSF. The VideoMosaic Collaborative [VMC] (www.videomosaic.org) is a Repository currently housing more than 400 hours of these video data and metadata, available worldwide as open source.
