 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface mining is an intense and ecologically destructive process that involves the removal of native vegetation (e.g., diverse and productive forests) and soil to prepare for resource extraction. Surface mining for coal is commonly conducted in Appalachia in the United States, and also in parts of New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. Because of the impacts of the mining process on native ecosystems, restoration is critical on mined sites. In Australia, similar to in Appalachia, many mined sites are reclaimed to grassland systems, which provide less ecological benefit than native forests. Therefore, developing reclamation techniques that can successfully restore native forests to mined sites should be a priority. The Forest Reclamation Approach (FRA) is a set of guidelines developed in Appalachia for establishing native forest systems on mined sites. However, it has not yet been tested for transferability outside the U.S. This project will assess the potential for FRA techniques to successfully restore native forests in Australia. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Paul Bertsch, a noted soil scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia. \r\n\r\nThis project will take place on the Wambo Surface Mine in New South Wales, Australia. Experimental reclamation plots have been constructed with spoil type and compaction mitigation technique as treatments. Studies in Appalachia have shown that weathered minesoils provide a better growth medium than unweathered minesoils. Studies in Appalachia have found that native trees grow poorly in heavily compacted minesoils; therefore, already compacted soils must be ripped to improve tree growth potential. Alternatively, minesoils can be placed using minimal compaction techniques (e.g., loose-dumping) at the beginning. Five species of native trees were planted directly into the experimental plots in Fall 2013. This project will assess first-year survival and growth of these trees, as well as natural vegetative colonization and soil microbial development. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",
