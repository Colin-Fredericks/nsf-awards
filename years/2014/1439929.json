The workshop addresses an important area of exploration problems of great impact to society: cyber-physical systems in the automotive and aerospace domains, including connected vehicles and their security, safety, and verification, stand to save time, fuel costs, and lives lost to accidents. The project supports community building and ensures multiple and diverse perspectives are included.",

The objective of the workshop was to stimulate new thinking and ideas, and come up with bold new research challenges for transportation cyber-physical systems, where computing, communication, sensing and actuation technologies will revolutionize the transportation sector.   Vehicular networking and automated vehicles are two examples of how information technologies can transform the transportation sector and lead to significant reductions in traffic accidents, injuries and fatalities.\n\nThe workshop was very successful with a number of representatives from academia, industry and the government.    Invited talks were supplemented by a host of wide-ranging breakout sessions and report breakouts.      A report captures the wide-ranging set of discussions at the workshop.   The report comprises multiple parts.  The first part captures the state of today's transportation cyber-physical systems in terms of (a) its limitations and constraints, (b) future needs and requirements, (c) impact on safety, efficiency, mobility, productivity, environmental impact, (d) education and (e) grand research challenges posed by the domain.   The second part captures specific research and educational challenges for different aspects of transportation including (a) Connectivity and automation, (b) Aviation, (c) Infrastructure and cloud support, (d) Model-based design, verification, and validation, (e) Security and privacy, and (f) Environmentally-friendly approaches and personalization.\n\nThe workshop also provided plentiful opportunities for training and professional development.  Specifically, researchers from academia were exposed to a host of concerns and problems faced by practitioners, as well as directions that government officials were interested in pursuing for the longer term in transportation CPS.
