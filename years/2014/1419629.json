In addition to the main conference, the  PerCom 2014 meeting will also feature 12 workshops on cutting-edge themes, a PhD Forum, work-in-progress sessions, poster and demo sessions, a panel, and 2-3 keynote talks.  The conference's technical program also helps promote new directions of research in pervasive computing and communications.  Areas of interest including emerging areas like smartphone sensing, participatory sensing and social networks with applications to healthcare, security, energy and sustainability are all budding career learning experiences for students. Student participation in IEEE Percom 2014, offers opportunities in international collaboration, greater understanding of the field, and an exciting view across the landscape of pervasive computing.",
