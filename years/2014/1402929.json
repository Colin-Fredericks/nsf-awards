Gardner\r\n\r\nInsert abstract here for an award recommendation.\r\n\r\nCAT scanners are machines that save lives daily. They take X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of part of the body. The mathematics behind this process is called computerized tomography. It is very successful, but not perfect; the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays, causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects. In geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects are allowed - the density of the object is the same everywhere inside it. An example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney.  One can use this extra information to find better reconstruction procedures.  The scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider. Any measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered. Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside. For example, a new technique called local stereology depends on measurements of planar sections of biological tissue; each section passes through a fixed point, usually the nucleus of a cell, and the measurements can be made optically rather than physically. This project continues the development of several aspects of the mathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nGeometric tomography uses data concerning sections by planes and projections on planes of geometric objects to obtain information about these objects. The latter include general compact sets, but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets. One advantage of this setting is that it becomes more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution.  Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information than would otherwise be possible. This can lead to algorithms that are more effective when few measurements are available, and less sensitive to measurement errors or noise. Geometric tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry, Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will continue the development of geometric tomography. New directions include the investigation of a new operation between sets called M-addition, which includes Minkowski addition and L_p addition as special cases, focusing on applications to valuation theory and polytope theory, as well as the study of M-subtraction, decomposition, and M-zonoids; the development of a new dual Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski theory and the study of Orlicz intersection bodies; fundamental new classification theorems for binary operations between compact convex sets or star bodies; new classification theorems for Steiner symmetrization and related symmetrization operations; fundamental new classification theorems for binary operations, especially those significant in convex analysis, between functions; and, if time allows, new algorithms for reconstruction of convex bodies from noisy data, in particular, from phase retrieval data, section functions, and lightness functions.  Also included is a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.",

This is the area of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science that lies behind the CAT scanner machines, vital pieces of equipment in most modern hospitals.  These machines take X-rays of a human patient from a number of different directions, and synthesize the measurements to produce an image that can be used by medical staff for diagnosis or surgery.  The realization that there are many similarities between the mathematics behind Computerized Tomography and certain parts of geometry led to the creation of a separate field, Geometric Tomography, that blends the two.\n\nGeometric Tomography uses data concerning sections by planes and projections on planes of geometric objects to obtain information about these objects.  The latter include compact sets, but more usually they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies, or finite sets.

On the theoretical side, the development of Geometric Tomography has overlapped considerably with that of convex geometry, drawing in particular from the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies.\n\nConvex shapes, roughly speaking, are those without holes or dents.  The Brunn-Minkowski theory is a profound and powerful apparatus, with applications both inside and outside mathematics, for solving problems of a metrical character, such as those concerning the volume, surface area, or mean width of convex sets.\n\nSeveral advances in Geometric Tomography and convex geometry arose from the project in collaborative work.  The results may be gathered into two groups:  (1) Three papers (one published, one submitted, and one in progress) developing the Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski theory, a far-reaching extension initiated in 2010 of the original Brunn-Minkowski theory, the core of Convex Geometry, and (2) four papers (one published, one awaiting publication, and two in progress) on the structural theory of operations between functions and of symmetrizations and polarizations.\n\nSymmetrization - the idea of replacing a set by one more symmetric in some sense - is a potent technique in geometry that also has applications to several areas of mathematics, particularly analysis and partial differential equations.\n\nHighlights of group (1) include a new definition of the radial Orlicz sum of starshaped (with respect to the origin) sets and the discovery of new inequalities of the Brunn-Minkowski- and Minkowski-type; the introduction of the general volume of a star body, a notion including many previous types of dual mixed volume, and a new general Orlicz curvature measure; and the formulation of a corresponding Minkowski problem (to characterize these measures), and a solution that also solves some cases of a Minkowski problem posed by Lutwak, Yang, and Zhang.
