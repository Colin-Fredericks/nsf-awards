 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish an REU Site at Northwestern University (NU)'s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA). The Site will take advantage of CIERA's interdisciplinary nature, providing students access to mentors and experience across departments, and insight into the cross-departmental connections between astronomy and astrophysics and other STEM disciplines. The Faculty Mentors (all of whom are members of CIERA) come from four departments: the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Applied Math, Earth and Planetary Science, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Available research projects cover a wide range of astronomical topics and research methods, from theory to computation and from instrumentation to experimentation. Furthermore, the projects will use a wide range of cutting-edge facilities, including instrument labs and the Quest high performance computing facility at NU, instruments at Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.\r\n\r\nThrough this exposure, the REU students will learn how astronomical studies prepare them with a wide range of skills and can lead them to diverse professional paths. NU CIERA's REU site will give students the experience of doing interdisciplinary astronomical research, expose them to a wide array of exciting research areas in astrophysics, and build community among the students themselves and with NU researchers. The Site also aims to recruit a significant fraction of its participants from members of underrepresented groups in STEM by partnering with Chicago-area minority serving institutions. Through high-quality research experiences and professional development activities, the NU CIERA REU Site will contribute to the development of a diverse, sophisticated, and highly competitive STEM workforce.",

CIERA is a university-level center for astronomy and astrophysics which provides support for faculty and students from across disciplines to participate in astrophysics research. During this grant cycle at our NU CIERA REU site, we hosted 26 total REU students (between 7 and 10 students annually), to pursue interdisciplinary astrophysics research for 9 weeks each summer.

Our REUs are majoring (or majored) in a wide range of disciplines: Astronomy, Astrophysics, Physics, Math, Applied Math, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Biochemistry and Education. This broad range of interests reflects the interdisciplinary nature of CIERA and enriches the students? summer experience.  The summer research projects cover the breadth of research methods in astrophysics, from theory to computation and instrumentation to experimentation.\n\nThrough this grant, we provided funding for all students to attend the American Astronomical Society winter meetings.  Nearly all of our students (24) have attended these meetings, and presented posters to their peers and professional astronomers.  Additionally, two of our students presented their summer research posters at the 2015 and 2016 Research Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium, hosted by the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) in Washington DC (funded by CIERA). Another student presented a poster at the 2017 CUR Posters on the Hill conference.  Other students have presented their summer research posters at the 2016 Emory STEM Symposium, PhysCon (the 2016 Quadrennial Physics Congress), APS CUWiP, and the Illinois LSAMP Symposium.\n\nAbstracts for most of these students? posters are available online.  Furthermore, each of our REU students created a research website, maintained by NU and CIERA, to share their research with the public (we provide the URL to our website at the end of this report).   At the end of each summer, students also shared their results with museum visitors at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, through a poster presentation in the main exhibit gallery.  Many articles are also in preparation for refereed scientific journals.  \n\nWe made a concerted effort to maintain a diverse REU cohort: 46% were female, 27% were Hispanic, 19% were African American.  Also, five of our students were first generation college-goers, and one was a community college student.  We also recruited approximately half of our REU cohort (each year) from local Chicago-area schools.  All of these local students were either female or from underrepresented groups in STEM. \n\nAbout half of our REU students from this grant have moved on to Ph.D. programs across the country, mostly in Physics and Astronomy.  (Other students have yet to graduate undergrad.)  Six of our past REU students are attending (or will be attending) Northwestern for graduate school.    \n\nIn addition to the formal research experience, we focus on students? professional development and exposure to a wide range of careers.  Special effort was made to provide these REU students with research skills and the level of preparation needed to get into and thrive in graduate programs in astronomy/astrophysics and other technical fields.
