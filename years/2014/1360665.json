Undergraduates at six institutions from their junior year to their first year post-graduation will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative research.  The community of practice element will convene stakeholders at each partner institution who are invested in translating the results from this project into educational practice. A Professional Pathways Model that explains how students beliefs about their career options and their own abilities affect their career decisions will be proposed.",

To increase retention during the college-career transition, we must learn more about the factors contributing to early career engineering attrition, and particularly, \"problematic attrition\" (where an individual is \"pushed away\" from engineering by negative factors).  This national study draws on data from six U.S. institutions, and has a specific objective of bridging research findings to practice. Our mixed-methods study, based on career professional staff interviews and student surveys and interviews, addresses the following research questions:\n\nHow do engineering students develop beliefs about their      career options and abilities?\nHow do these beliefs influence their career plans and      preparation over time?\nHow might research findings on      students? beliefs and plans be used in improving career development      services?\n\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED- STUDENTS\n\nWe surveyed juniors and seniors at our partner schools in Fall 2016, and again, one year later. Results indicate that student?s confidence in two areas, career exploration and job acquisition, are highly related and influenced by a common set of experiences, including having had an internship/co-op, having been a student leader, and taking courses that emphasizing engineering careers or skills. Some of the most impactful campus resources on students? career confidence, such as company visits and mock interviews, were found to be the least utilized among students. With respect to people, students most sought out career help from academic advisors, faculty, other students, and family members. Career counselors were sought out least and, usually, not until senior year.\n\nWe also interviewed 62 survey respondents majoring in mechanical or chemical engineering. Similar to the survey results, analyses revealed four main socializer groups: family, peers, university individuals, and work individuals. How socializers influence students appears to be domain-specific, with family members influencing students? thinking about specific jobs and peers influencing their job exploration more broadly.

When career-related      options and skills are included, they contribute to student confidence      in engineering, as well as confidence in career discovery and job      acquisition skills.\nEngagement      in EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (including internships) has positive      career discovery and engineering skills payoffs. \nThe      group that supports students? sense of preparedness / confidence in career      discovery and job acquisition skills is not homogeneous, with FACULTY,       INDUSTRY CONTACTS and FRIENDS playing particularly strong roles. \nBecause the group that supports      students in developing career- and job-related skills is not homogeneous      and a variety of activities (both inside and outside the classroom)      contribute to students? preparedness it is challenging to know who are      the \"customers\" are for Career-related research findings?  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Holly M Matusovich"
