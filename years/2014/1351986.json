 "awd_abstract_narration": "Superconductivity in Lithium-rich compounds \r\n\r\nNon technical abstract: Superconductors, which have zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism, hold great promise for applications in energy storage, transmission, medical applications and transportation. Unfortunately, the operating temperature of all currently known superconductors is too low for large scale applications. Light materials have been considered to be promising for exhibiting superconducting properties at high temperature. This research focuses on finding new superconducting systems made of ultra light materials with a focus on understanding the non-classical lattice dynamics which are considerable in light elements. We will specifically focus on materials rich in lithium (the lightest metal and superconducting element) and search for new lithium-rich high temperature superconducting systems utilizing extreme conditions of pressure.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: Lithium is the lightest metal and superconducting element. The emergence of exotic quantum states in a compressed light metallic system has been entertained theoretically for metallic phases of hydrogen.  Metallic hydrogen is predicted to have a liquid ground state, and may exhibit a two component superfluid and superconducting phase.  The difficulty of compressing hydrogen to densities sufficient for metallization, however, has prevented experimental proof of these effects.  As an alternative route to studying the evolution of lattice quantum effects in a dense light metallic system, this study will investigate the structural and electronic properties of lithium which is isovalent to hydrogen under pressure. Due to its light mass, Li's lattice is highly dynamic, providing a large phonon spectrum for electron-phonon coupling. By chemical modification, it may be possible to synthesize a Li rich compound in which a high superconducting transition temperature is achieved through electronic enhancement. The motivation of this research is to systematically study superconductivity in ultra-light lithium-based compounds by using high pressure techniques. Studying the superconducting phase diagram of Li-rich compounds will provide insight into finding ways which enhance the superconductivity by chemical modification.",
