 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this S-STEM project the PI team at the University of Alaska Fairbanks is increasing the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn baccalaureate degrees in environmental and natural sciences.  The student cohort is comprised of 28 upper level undergraduates who are already at the university and transfer students from the five feeder community colleges as well as from Ilisagvik Tribal College.  The goal of the project is to retain the scholarship students by integrating them into the Alaskan community of sustainability research and education.  Project elements include (a) a comprehensive recruitment strategy, (b) a strong mentoring program, (c) career and communication workshops, and (d) supplementary courses and early research involvement.   Acknowledging the regional need to prepare students who have backgrounds in environmental science and that participation in research related to solving civic problems has a strong appeal for Native American and Native Alaskan students, the project team has designed a rigorous, 30- credit hour curriculum for an interdisciplinary Certificate in Resilience and Adaptation (sustainability) which participants are encouraged to complete.  In order to broaden participation, Native American and Native Alaskan students are recruited actively.\r\n\r\nThere are two important ways in which this project will have broad impact.  First, data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields can be achieved through a comprehensive academic program linked to community-based research and civic engagement.  Formative evaluation is carried out to examine whether or not a diverse group of students is recruited and equipped to (a) maintain the target GPA (3.0 or higher), (b) perform skills at the appropriate level, (c) graduate with a STEM degree.  Summative evaluation is to ascertain whether or not the project goal to increase the number of well-prepared students in the selected fields is accomplished based on the Student Assessment of Learning Gains, student essays, and post-graduation data.  Secondly, dissemination of the project results is expected to provide a model for implementation of community-based practices in recruitment and retention of STEM students.  The project team plans to present their work at the national meetings on STEM teaching and learning as well as through the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement. Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the course materials developed for the Certificate in Resilience and Adaptation.",
