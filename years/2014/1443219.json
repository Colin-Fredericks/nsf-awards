In addition to the round table, the award also enables the participants to attend the highly successful Reaction Mechanisms Conference.  The primary objective of this round table is to provide trainings to students in preparing competitive professional proposals.  The round table also provides faculty members with information with which they can guide their students in drafting competitive proposals.   Being able to write competitive proposals is crucial to the success of young chemists in their future careers, especially academic ones.  Success in securing a research fellowship could steer their career choices to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.   Early exposure to high quality research and interactions with world-renowned chemists could all change the life of the aspiring chemists.",
