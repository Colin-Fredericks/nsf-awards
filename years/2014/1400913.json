 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known about the genetic basis of evolution to novel environments in natural populations. Addressing this problem is of broad importance because populations of organisms increasingly need to either adapt to a changing environment or go extinct. Few studies have identified genes important for adaptation in natural populations. This research into the rapid evolution of the vertebrate head offers a unique opportunity to conduct a statistically high-powered study on individuals that have undergone adaptive evolution in less than 50 years. The results of this study could provide insight into the genetic and developmental mechanisms of rapid evolution.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrate head is an impressive structure that houses some of the most important organs. Across vertebrates head shapes are diverse, and much of this variation appears adaptive. In contrast the early programs of head shape development are highly conserved across vertebrates. This begs the question; where in the conserved genetic programs of head development does variation lie to direct such a diversity of head shapes? This question will be answered by identifying genes that underlie head shape variation in the threespine stickleback fish.  New methods of visualizing and measuring head morphology will be used in conjunction with genomic data from a pedigreed threespine stickleback population to map genomic regions regions associated with head shape variation.",

This project helped answer this question by identifying genomic variation that is associated with head and jaw bone shape variation in natural populations of the threespine stickleback fish. The study used a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach to identify the genes that underlay parallel opercle bone shape evolution in two sets of rapidly evolving populations of threespine stickleback. One set of data came from stickleback on islands in Alaska uplifted during a massive earthquake in 1964, and the second set came from a highly variable population of stickleback in the McKenzie River in Oregon. Head and jaw bones and defensive armor morphology were analyzed in over 1000 stickleback for which whole genome data had previously been produced for another project. By analyzing these bone shapes researchers identified major axes of multivariate trait variation. By subjecting the first principle component of shape variation to GWAS with respect to the genotype data in the Oregon Population, at least 4 genomic regions have been associated with bone shape variation. These genomic regions appear to lie in chromosomal inversions suggesting the importance of large genomic rearrangements in rapid evolution. In addition, none of these genes have been previously identified as being associated with craniofacial variation. In addition, through analysis of the very recently evolved populations in Alaska, a novel computational approach was developed for controlling for selection-induced population structure when performing GWAS studies.
