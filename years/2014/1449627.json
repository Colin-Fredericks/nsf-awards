 "awd_abstract_narration": "The March 2011 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (GEJE), resulting tsunami, and Fukushima Dai-ichi\r\npower plant safety systems failures were catastrophic for Japan, and have influenced risk\r\nperceptions and policies globally. The nature of that influence remains an active area of\r\nsocial scientific inquiry. Early findings suggest that risk communication and management inadequacies\r\ncontributed to the social amplification of events. The symposium will provide\r\na timely opportunity to synthesize emerging social and behavioral risk research findings regarding\r\nthese extreme events, develop a risk communication and management research agenda to address\r\nthe challenges identified, and inform ongoing international risk communication and disaster\r\nrisk reduction efforts.\r\n\r\nResearch to date on the nature and consequences of Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and Fukushima-related risk communications identifies a wide range of contributory factors, ranging from lack of scientific consensus\r\nand public misconceptions about the risks, to social amplification of risk by the media, lack\r\nof transparency by management, and insufficient public engagement. Nevertheless, an overarching\r\nsynthesis and assessment of theoretical implications and resulting risk communication research\r\nquestions stemming from these events is lacking, and would advance the related risk and decision\r\nsciences. Extreme events of the last decade have increased in impact, heightening the global focus on\r\nthe necessity of disaster risk reduction. International efforts to improve the evidence base\r\nfor risk management include the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) supported by the\r\nUnited Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), the International Council\r\nfor Science (ICSU), and the International Social Science Council (ISSC) and UNISDR activities,\r\nincluding its lead role in developing a post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action. Risk Interpretation\r\nand Action (RIA) is a key activity of the IRDR, with the aim of understanding how people, both\r\ndecision-makers and ordinary citizens, make decisions, individually and collectively, in the\r\nface of risk, and thereby contributing to an integrated research approach to disaster risk\r\nreduction, to ultimately decrease disaster risks worldwide. The proposed symposium advances\r\nthis agenda, as well as integration of this research with research on the communication and\r\nmanagement of extreme technological risks, and enhances collaboration between Japan and the\r\nU.S. in the social, decision and risk sciences.",
