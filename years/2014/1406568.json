This project combines theoretical research and accompanying educational and outreach activities that address key issues relating to charge, spin, and energy transport in single- and multi-layered electronic systems. Particular systems which will be investigated include materials such a single-atom-thick form of carbon, known as graphene, and other graphene-like two-dimensional materials composed of transition metal atoms and sulfur.

The ability of these systems to transport spin, charge and energy in an efficient and controllable manner makes them promising candidates for the development of new technologies, both in the field of information processing and that of energy conversion. This project combines theoretical research and accompanying educational and outreach activities addressing key issues relating to charge, spin, and energy transport in single- and multi-layered electronic systems. At the core of the projected activity lies a set of basic physics problems which will be addressed in parallel or sequentially during a period of three years. These are:\r\n\r\n1. Evaluating the microscopic spin-charge response functions for two-dimensional electron liquids in graphene and graphene-like materials, including electron-electron interactions, disorder, spin-orbit couplings, and magnetic fields in suitable approximations;\r\n\r\n2. Developing the theory of spin diffusion, thermal conductivity, and viscosity in graphene and graphene-like materials, to the point where the calculations exhibit the crossover between the collisionless (high-frequency) and collision-dominated (hydrodynamic) regimes;\r\n\r\n3. Identifying and quantifying novel thermoelectric phenomena for interacting electrons in multi-layer structures;\r\n\r\n4. Developing the theory of spin Hall effect and spin-galvanic effects at metallic and oxide interfaces with strong spin-orbit interactions.\r\n\r\nThis project is strategically positioned at the interface between fundamental condensed matter theory, applied physics, and computational materials science, and has potential technological implications in electronics and thermal energy transport.
