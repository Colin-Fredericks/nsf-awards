 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Cincinnati's existing network architecture design requires researchers to share a 1Gb network connection with the general university community, resulting in a bottleneck for high speed data transfers.  This project builds a new high performance dedicated research network called UCScienceNet (UCSN) to link five science and engineering research facilities across campus to the 100Gb Internet2 network.  The new network and upgraded bandwidth capacity enables investigators to accelerate and extend existing research programs which require fast transfer of very large data sets for real time visualization or analysis.  It also facilitates the formation of a research ecosystem to address complex Grand Challenge problems in high-energy physics research, multi-scale computational fluid dynamics, public health, renewable energy, advanced aerospace research and global climate change monitoring. \r\n\r\nUCSN is a high bandwidth, friction free Science DMZ modeled after ESnet, incorporating perfSONAR for monitoring and tuning network performance, enabling software defined networking (SDN), and OpenFlow capabilities. This 100Gb Layer-3 distributed internal network connects UC researchers to the 100Gb Ohio Academic Research Network (OARnet), and from there to other high bandwidth networks. Peering of these \"Big Data\" networks opens new opportunities for research partnerships between university and industry, and promotes commercialization and job growth. UCScienceNet provides scalable 40Gb access from five research intensive locations to a 100Gb OARnet Internet2 portal. Eliminating campus and building-level network infrastructure constraints enables multiple, disparate high-speed big data transfers across a comprehensive, integrated cyberinfrastructure with robust access to state, national, and international networks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to construct a high speed research centered Science DMZ network to connect University of Cincinnati  researchers from areas in Physics, Geography, Mathematics, Fluid Dynamics, and Mechanical Engineering to Ohio's 100Gb research network and from  there to Internet 2 and other research networks.  Specifically, we  installed a separate network that is engineered and dedicated to data intensive science and for  efficiently transporting scientific research data sets at high speed,  both internally and externally.\n\nSignificant results reported by researchers as it pertains to network  data transfer on UCScienceNet show a sustained data rate increase of  greater than 100 fold.  Prior sustained data transfer rates of 16Mb/sec,  which resulted in hours long data transfer times and sometime timeouts  of large data sets, are now sustained at 2Gb-4Gb/sec resulting in 1-2  minute typical file transfer.\n\nOne of the key outcomes reported by a researcher in Physics, is the ability to use x2go from machines  at the Large Hadron Collider in CERN and run jobs with significant exchange of graphics images, a  capability not available prior to implementation of UCScienceNet.\n\nAnother researcher in Mathematics is now able to efficiently  share with  collaborators the model outputs of daily CO2 vertical  profiles obtained by observations from NASA?s OCO2 mission.  Using this data, this researcher has developed a new data analytic model to evaluate the data sets collected.\n\nResearchers are now able to leverage the computing resources  at the Ohio Supercomuter Center (OSC), to carry out extensive simulation  studies and real data analyses.\n\nA broader impact of this research network is to allow students, both undergraduate and graduate, to have a more seamless research experience through fast data transfer.\n \n\nThis project is likely to continue making an impact to STEM research by  providing new opportunities for research partnership between the  university and industry.  High speed data transfer pathways will allow  research advancements in engineering, clean water and sustainability,  analytics, high-energy physics, environmental health, pharmacology,  medical imaging and toxicology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce Burton"
