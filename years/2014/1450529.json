 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to support a workshop on the environmental implications of additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, also known as three-dimensional printing, is a suite of computer-automated technologies to fabricate three-dimensional structural and functional parts from metallic, plastic, ceramic, biological, and composite materials. The workshop will help identify the environmental implications and research needs related to additive manufacturing and further inform a research agenda. It will build productive, on-going collaborations among users of additive manufacturing and a wide range of researchers involved in the impact assessment of emerging technologies. The ideas coming from the workshop attendees will be helpful to policymakers setting environmental priorities as well as organizations developing research strategies and educational activities. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for disseminating information and sharing ideas about the emerging technology of additive manufacturing and its impact on the environment and occupational health. The workshop will review the existing research on environmental impacts of additive manufacturing; identify knowledge gaps and uncertainties that could help inform an agenda for future research into environmental impacts of additive manufacturing; and expand the research community focused on these environmental and energy-use issues by including researchers with backgrounds in industrial ecology, energy and materials mass balance assessments, lifecycle analysis, and environmental risk assessment.  The major intellectual outcomes of this workshop include a research agenda for environmental and occupational health issues that proactively addresses future uses of additive manufacturing and a research consensus between the additive manufacturing community and the environment and lifecycle assessment community. This workshop is distinct from previous additive manufacturing-related workshops in its focus on environmental implications.",

The report summarizes the key research issues raised at the workshop as well as integrates the results of an online survey of participants and additional information supplied by the discussion leaders. Some key issues have been identified:\n\nLifecycle Assessment Issues: Research is needed into the supply chain footprint of AM, and methodologies are needed to understand entire pathways, from material extraction to finished products.\n\nOccupational Health Issues: There is a need for better risk assessment and management research related to AM, including the toxicology of emissions, exposure control approaches, and exposure assessments.\n\nEnergy Use Issues: Research is needed into new material development, quantitative energy impact assessment of AM products, and standardized methodology establishment for comparison of AM energy use with that of conventional manufacturing processes.\n\nWaste Issues: There is a need for research into the management at the end of life of products made by AM, in addition to work on industrial production waste and whether novel products made possible by AM pose unique challenges for waste management.\n\nCross-Cutting and Policy Issues: A variety of policy research needs are identified, particularly further research into regulatory implications of advanced AM applications such as bioprinting, risks unique to AM in the desktop setting, and liability for different types of users in various settings (schools, job shops, etc.).\n\nIn addition, the workshop and its website have provided a new platform to disseminate and share related information of interest to manufacturing and environmental researchers.
