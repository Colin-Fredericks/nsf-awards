 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and The Joint Research Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI). The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. This group developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\n\r\nWorking together the Belmont Forum and JPI-FACCE have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to food security and land use change.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to improve soil and water resource management to help increase agricultural productivity in rural areas.  The project will investigate different agriculture techniques and technologies that can help make agricultural production systems that are resilient to environmental changes and provide rural farmers with tools for self-reliance.  This project seeks to investigate novel ways to increase farmer access to agricultural technologies and information; to link farmers to markets and promote the efficient flow of goods and services through strengthened value chains; and to create a framework for other areas to adopt resilient solutions for food security and land use management.",

This precarious food situation is especially dangerous in the central Indian tribal belt (also known as the poverty belt) which is a typical rainfed area dominated by tribal communities. More than 90% of the tribal people are dependent on agriculture and produce much of what they eat. Under such conditions, one approach to achieving sustainable crop production and minimal soil and other resource degradation is the adoption of crop-nutrient-water-land system management practices, such as conservation agriculture (CA). Conservation agriculture is a set of crop management principles that include minimum soil disturbance, permanent organic soil cover by retaining crop residues or cover crops and diversified cropping systems. Given the variability of agro-ecological environments due to climate change, cropping systems, and farmer capacities and preferences for cultivation, there is not a single set of CA practices applicable worldwide. The successful introduction of CA depends upon adapting and tailoring the basic principles to the local context. Conservation Agriculture Production System (CAPS) is intended to develop locally relevant and preferred CA systems to ensure effective production and conservation as well as being acceptable to producers and consumers in local markets. We adopted a transdisciplinary approach framework for this project because the introduction of CAPS technology to tribal farmers in India involves complex human and natural systems. According to Future Earth, this approach is a successful means to building strong partnerships among researchers, farmers, communities and global audiences that lead to the eventual adoption of an appropriate technology and transforms it to sustainable outcomes. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This collaborative transdisciplinary international project had the goals of (1) building and demonstrating a dynamic model of community engagement for sustained adoption of CAPS; (2) determining and documenting community appropriate climate-smart CAPS; (3) analyzing market demand and consumer preferences to increase food security; and (4) enhancing marketing information of agricultural products to farmers contributing to a stable consistent supply for regional markets and urban areas and reduced imports. The SMARTS2 project encompassed co-design, co-production, co-implementation and demonstration of cooperator CAPS trials in 2 villages in Keonjhar, Odisha, India. Conventional tillage with the local maize cultivar was compared to reduced tillage with improved maize cultivar and maize intercropped with cowpea.The project team conducted bus tours, workshops on CAPS, surveyed farms in villages and collected farm-related data.

CAPS work well for areas that are rainfed, slopey and affected by climate variations. Both extension agents and farmers require training in conservation agriculture and need incentives to adopt this climate-smart practice. Since productivity increases marketable surplus, exposing farmers to growing different crops will not depress market prices thus sustaining farm income. A focus on assisting farmers on more efficient input use, in addition to the introduction of new technology, is essential for community resilience. Intercropping is a win-win for farmers as the extra income is an incentive to adopt and the intercropping helps retain soil moisture. Community engagement is essential for adopting new technologies. Baseline surveys of villages can highlight knowledge gaps and opportunities for training. Cognitive mapping of village CAPS&rsquo; perception can highlight potential pitfalls for the scientific team regarding the likelihood the adoption of a practice. Training in the village on the use of cover crops and general agricultural practices (e.g., line planting and the use of hybrid seed) can improve overall farm productivity among low productivity farmers. A bus tour for farmers to on-station and on-farm fields had positive impacts on a farmer&rsquo;s desire to adopt CA on their farm. Training of NGO staff in household baseline surveys was important to convey correct information to villagers and as a conduit to the scientific team.
