 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively Managed Landscapes (IML-CZO)\r\n\r\nIntensively managed landscapes, regions of significant land use change, serve as a cradle for economic prosperity. However, the intensity of change is responsible for unintended deterioration of our land and water environments. By understanding present day dynamics in the context of long-term co-evolution of the landscape, soil and biota, IML-CZO aims to support the assessment of short- and long-term resilience of the crucial ecological, hydrological and climatic services. These include freshwater quality and quantity, provision for food, fiber and (bio)fuel, nutrient transformations, and terrestrial carbon storage. The goals of this project are to quantify the fluxes and transformations, as well as interactions, thresholds, and dynamic feedbacks of water, nutrients, and sediment in IMLs, and to characterize how rapid land use changes have altered the vulnerability and resilience of these systems. An observational network of two sites in Illinois (3,690-km2 Upper Sangamon River Basin) and Iowa (270-km2 Clear Creek Watershed), and a partner site in Minnesota (44,000-km2 Minnesota River Basin), which together capture a range of geological diversity of the low relief glaciated and tile-drained landscape in the Midwest, will drive the scientific and technological advances. The guiding hypothesis for the scientific effort is that through human modification, the critical zone of IMLs has passed a tipping point (or threshold) and has changed from being a transformer of material flux, with high nutrient, water, and sediment storage, to being a transporter. This change threatens the resilience of the landscape to accommodate future impacts associated with ongoing human activity, including climate change and bioenergy crop production. Further, it increases the vulnerability of IMLs by compromising the sustainability of key critical-zone services on which ecological systems and human populations depend. Understanding and quantifying shifts in the response of the critical zone to human development remains a challenge, and current assessments are at best qualitative. IML-CZO research will identify threats to resilience of the critical zone, and will also inform management strategies aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the system to human activities that threaten sustainability. We will develop methods and knowledgebase that are broadly applicable across the Midwest and similar low-gradient landscapes worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide leadership in developing the next generation of work force and informing sustainable management strategies. The IML-CZO will be a launch pad for several new educational and outreach initiatives, and it will be an integral resource to connect and partner with existing organizations. It will draw on and add to several resources and programs available throughout the region. The CZO will provide a testbed for student-led sensing and data collection initiatives, and is expected to stimulate new research ideas and further advance the sensors and measurements curriculum. The CZO will also work to bring together collaborations with National Great Rivers Research and Education Center, IOWATER, Minnesota and Illinois RiverWatch Volunteer programs to enlist \"citizen scientist\" (age 10 - 70) in the work of the CZO.  IML-CZO will also serve as a training ground for several undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral research associates by engaging them in interdisciplinary research.",

These insights have been reached through extensive data collection across watersheds in the US Midwest and development of advanced modeling and data analytics capabilities. We have established that the dynamics of the critical zone in intensively managed landscapes do not operate uniformly over time and space, and critical interfaces have a relatively large regulatory role in the storage, transport, and transformations of material and energy, often through threshold responses and intermittent connectivity between these interfaces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have concluded that the dynamics at critical interfaces is highly variable in space and dynamic in time, and often structured by threshold driven responses. This variability is manifest at the short time scale through responses to variability of weather events including intensity, duration, frequency, persistence, and timing. This convolves with the intensive management practices which has created an organized heterogeneity consisting of mosaic of row crop agriculture that changes seasonally as a result of planting and harvesting of crops and annually due to crop rotation. Over the longer period of several years and decades these landscapes continue to be redesigned through dredging of channels to maintain flow capacity so that water levels don&rsquo;t get high enough to backflow into tile drains, and tile drains are replaced or added to increase productivity. These anthropogenically structured and changing controls on flow result in ever changing heterogeneity of state variables such as soil-moisture and temperature, modify micro-topographic and micro-roughness variability, and lead to changes in preferential pathways, hydraulic conductivity, and pore structure in the soil, and resultant sub-surface flow and runoff. These changes in turn cumulatively impact the surface and sub-surface fluxes of water, energy, carbon, and solutes across the landscape.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The continual restructuring of heterogeneity described above also alters soil micro-aggregate structure and its strength. These affect surface processes pertaining to erosion rate and mobilization of SOC (soil organic carbon) and its transport and re-distribution across the landscape. The rapid SOC redistribution increases the lateral and vertical spatial heterogeneity of SOC content, and the heterotrophic carbon loss via microbial decomposition. Further, it impacts moisture persistence and associated impact on geochemical properties.&nbsp; All of these give rise to emergent threshold behavior in that the dynamics exhibit rapid changes under certain conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Topographic depressions, tile drain network, and macropore in the soil also structure the spatial variability and dynamics of both the concentration and age of the subsurface nitrogen cycle, creating a differentiated expression across the landscape. The spatial distribution of nitrogen reflects the anthropogenically structured controls that govern the chemical phase changes, as well as transport. In tile drained fields, both the concentration and age of nitrate are lower in topographic depressions than elsewhere.&nbsp; High concentration and low age are observed near the tile drains indicating the important role tile drains play in structuring the spatial distribution of inorganic nitrogen. Root exudation from agricultural crops, overlain above- and below-ground litter decomposition, substantially alter the rates of nitrification, respiration, and release of solutes through soil weathering, thereby further augmenting the heterogeneity and transport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Channelization has increased the density of flow paths and their spatial extent, resulting in increased connectivity across the landscape creating fast response times and strong coupling between water, sediment, carbon and nutrient fluxes. This has given rise to increased upland erosion of sediment and SOC and their deposition in floodplains. Their remobilization, structured over a range of stream flow rates, constitute a significant contributor of sediment supply in rivers and reflect the impact of management overlain on glacial legacy. The concept of connectivity extends to the transport of aquatic microbial communities that then adapt to soil and sedimentary environments. New approaches based on information theory reveal threshold behavior in the connectivity of fast response variables in the land-atmosphere exchange fluxes and solute dynamics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Broader Impact</em>: IMLCZO has contributed extensively towards broad outreach of research through over 110 peer reviewed publications involving 300 unique authors. We have also contributed to the strong development of work force. This includes 56 undergraduate students (25 women, 4 URM) who participated in CZ research experience, 21 MS students (12 women, 2 URM), 34 PhD students (17 women, 5 URM) and 13 postdoctoral associates (7 women, 1 URM). Four courses were developed/modified to incorporate CZ concepts, and one field and one modeling course were taught with participation from across the CZO network. Students assisted in direct instruction at various School Districts impacting over 500 middle and high school students. We provided training to six professional technicians and 50 K-12 teachers in CZ research techniques. In addition, the CZO faculty offered two Soil and Water Management seminars to over 120 Certified Crop Advisors through UIUC Extension.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:

This convolves with the intensive management practices which has created an organized heterogeneity consisting of mosaic of row crop agriculture that changes seasonally as a result of planting and harvesting of crops and annually due to crop rotation. Over the longer period of several years and decades these landscapes continue to be redesigned through dredging of channels to maintain flow capacity so that water levels don\u2019t get high enough to backflow into tile drains, and tile drains are replaced or added to increase productivity. These anthropogenically structured and changing controls on flow result in ever changing heterogeneity of state variables such as soil-moisture and temperature, modify micro-topographic and micro-roughness variability, and lead to changes in preferential pathways, hydraulic conductivity, and pore structure in the soil, and resultant sub-surface flow and runoff. These changes in turn cumulatively impact the surface and sub-surface fluxes of water, energy, carbon, and solutes across the landscape. \n\n \n\nThe continual restructuring of heterogeneity described above also alters soil micro-aggregate structure and its strength. These affect surface processes pertaining to erosion rate and mobilization of SOC (soil organic carbon) and its transport and re-distribution across the landscape. The rapid SOC redistribution increases the lateral and vertical spatial heterogeneity of SOC content, and the heterotrophic carbon loss via microbial decomposition. Further, it impacts moisture persistence and associated impact on geochemical properties.  All of these give rise to emergent threshold behavior in that the dynamics exhibit rapid changes under certain conditions. \n\n \n\nTopographic depressions, tile drain network, and macropore in the soil also structure the spatial variability and dynamics of both the concentration and age of the subsurface nitrogen cycle, creating a differentiated expression across the landscape. The spatial distribution of nitrogen reflects the anthropogenically structured controls that govern the chemical phase changes, as well as transport. In tile drained fields, both the concentration and age of nitrate are lower in topographic depressions than elsewhere.  High concentration and low age are observed near the tile drains indicating the important role tile drains play in structuring the spatial distribution of inorganic nitrogen. Root exudation from agricultural crops, overlain above- and below-ground litter decomposition, substantially alter the rates of nitrification, respiration, and release of solutes through soil weathering, thereby further augmenting the heterogeneity and transport.\n\n \n\nChannelization has increased the density of flow paths and their spatial extent, resulting in increased connectivity across the landscape creating fast response times and strong coupling between water, sediment, carbon and nutrient fluxes. This has given rise to increased upland erosion of sediment and SOC and their deposition in floodplains. Their remobilization, structured over a range of stream flow rates, constitute a significant contributor of sediment supply in rivers and reflect the impact of management overlain on glacial legacy. The concept of connectivity extends to the transport of aquatic microbial communities that then adapt to soil and sedimentary environments. New approaches based on information theory reveal threshold behavior in the connectivity of fast response variables in the land-atmosphere exchange fluxes and solute dynamics. \n\n \n\nBroader Impact: IMLCZO has contributed extensively towards broad outreach of research through over 110 peer reviewed publications involving 300 unique authors. We have also contributed to the strong development of work force. This includes 56 undergraduate students (25 women, 4 URM) who participated in CZ research experience, 21 MS students (12 women, 2 URM), 34 PhD students (17 women, 5 URM) and 13 postdoctoral associates (7 women, 1 URM). Four courses were developed/modified to incorporate CZ concepts, and one field and one modeling course were taught with participation from across the CZO network. Students assisted in direct instruction at various School Districts impacting over 500 middle and high school students. We provided training to six professional technicians and 50 K-12 teachers in CZ research techniques. In addition, the CZO faculty offered two Soil and Water Management seminars to over 120 Certified Crop Advisors through UIUC Extension.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Praveen Kumar"
