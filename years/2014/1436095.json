 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis DMREF project aims to make breakthroughs in understanding and designing novel superconductors, magnetic semiconductors, and other magnetic materials.  The research can lead to development of materials with higher transition temperatures suitable for applications to electronic devices with novel functionalities.  To achieve this goal, collaborative research will be performed by five Principal Investigators (PIs) specializing in a variety of techniques and methods, including neutron scattering (Dai) and muon spin relaxation (Uemura) as advanced magnetic probes, synthesis and charge transport of nano-scale systems (Ni and Kim), and theory and computational material design (Kotliar).  The team members will unite their forces and expertise to characterize high-quality specimens with multiple experimental probes, to explore electric field-effect doping of charge carriers using nano-scale devices, to interpret the results using advanced computational models, and to design and synthesize new materials.  As demonstrated in recent discoveries of ferromagnetic semiconductors that have crystal structures identical to those of Fe-based high-Tc superconductors, encounters and coherent collaboration between experts from different research communities will lead to unanticipated breakthroughs.  Since 2011, the PIs from Columbia and Rice have organized live/video lecture courses for entry-level graduate students \"Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics\" seeking broader impact, and have accumulated about 100 video lectures of leading scientists describing modern studies of solid state physics.  The present project will allow adding a new series to this course involving faculty members from Columbia, Rice, Harvard, Rutgers, and UCLA and connecting their classrooms with a web-based technology for simultaneous broadcast. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nCondensation and pairing mechanisms of high-Tc cuprate and iron-based superconductors have not yet been established.  However, there are growing signatures pointing toward the important role played by magnetic interactions.  With multi-probe experimental researchers using neutrons, muons, transport, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), supplemented by quantitative comparison to advanced computation, the present DMREF project will shed new light on the quest for understanding unconventional superconductors.  In conjunction with the predictive powers of advanced computational methods, a better understanding of the physical mechanisms at work will contribute to the ability to design materials with higher transition temperatures.  Carrier doping using electric field effects will provide a new route to search for novel superconductors, less sensitive to disorder effects associated with conventional doping with chemical substitutions.  Transport results on Fermi-level tuning via electrolyte gate voltage will be directly compared to advanced theoretical computations on electronic structures.  Additionally, the formation of interfaces of unconventional superconductors and their magnetic derivatives, and engineering of phase changes via charge-doping with field-effect gating, will result in devices with novel functionality, leading to an as yet unexplored interdisciplinary research front.  This project will provide a unique collaborative experience involving leading researchers, graduate students, and postdocs with multiple research fields and techniques that will make important contributions to the development of the future leaders of modern physics research.",

In studies of iron-based novel superconductors, the \"112\" system predicted by Kotliar was synthesized by Ni and charcterized by Ni and Uemura, while Dai, Uemura and Kotliar elucidated dynamic and static magnetic properties and the relationship with the superconducting order in the \"122\" and \"111\" systems.  In non-superconducting systems which exhibit Mott transitions from antiferromagnetic insulators (AFI)  to paramagnetic metals (PMM), Uemura, Kim and Kotliar demonstrated evolution from AFI to PMM phases associated with phase separation, characteristic of the transition of first-order.  In addition, novel ferromagnetic semiconductors have been synthesized and characterized in the present project.  The semiconducting systems isostructural to iron-based superconductors have been discovered and studied by Uemura and his collaborators from China and Japan.  In particular the present project helped discovery of long-awaited n-type ferromagnetic semiconductor among this family, which would allow formation of new transistor devices with p-n junctions sensitive to spin magnetic properties.  This type of new technologies are often called spintronics.  The group of Kim also made significant effort towards studying these superconducting and magnetic materials by forming devices using nano-technologies.  As the lead PI, Uemura has proposed and coordinated cooperation among co-PI's, and led and organized outreach efforts described below.\n\nBased on the support from the present DMREF grant. the group of PI Uemura have published 3 papers in Nature Communications, 1 in Physical Review Letters, 1 in Physical Review X, 8 in Physical Review B, 1 in Scientific Reports, 1 in npj Quantum Materials, and 1 in Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter.\n\nIn activities of outreach and human-resource development which have broader impact, the present project focused on a graduate lecture course  called \"Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics\" (FCMP), which uses internet technologies to deliver lectures of leading scientists to classrooms in multiple institutions.   Graduate students who finished studying FCMP lectures for one or two semesters are invited to participate in FCMP Workshops to get together with FCMP lecturers and fellow graduate students from different institutions who participated in the same course.  The FCMP Worskhops also offered hands-on-training of participating students on novel accelerator-based experimental methods of condensed matter physics and tours to advanced accelerator facilities.  The FCMP lectures and workshops were initiated by the PI Uemura in 2011 at Columbia, and the present DMREF grant has helped further development, upgrade and globalization.  During the DMREF project period of 2014-17, FCMP courses and workshops involved graduate students from Columbia, Rice, Rutgers, Harvard, UCLA, UC Berkeley, U Oregon Eugene, McMaster U., as well as several institutions in Europe, Japan and China.  In May of 2015 and January of 2017, the present project supported organization of two FCMP Workshops and tours, held at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada and JPARC in Tokai and Tokyo University in Japan, to which total about 100 graduate students and additional 100 senior researchers participated from over the world.  In the Fall 2017 semester, as an Alliance Visiting Professor of Ecole Polytechnique, the PI Uemura organized an FCMP course in Paris and Palaiseau, France, and simultaneously broadcasted the lectures to Columbia, Rutgers, Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), and Max Planck Institute in Hamburg and Dresden (Germany).  This effort has established new internet-based education method connecting between Europe and the US, and benefitted many motivated graduate students and post-doc researchers.\n\nIn human resource developments, the DMREF project supported completion of the PhD thesis projects of Ben Frandsen, Lian Liu and Sky Cheung, and ongoing PhD studies of James Zizhou Gong, at Columbia University. In addition, the muon spin relaxation beamtimes at TRIUMF in Vancouver allocated to the PI's group were joined by 12 graduate students from Rice,  McMaster, IOP Beijing, Zhejiag U., UCLA, Jons Hopkins, and U Tokyo during the funding period of the present DMREF project.  These graduate students obtained important experimental data and unique experience of international collaboration on forefront research activities performed at advanced accelerator facilities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yasutomo J Uemura"
