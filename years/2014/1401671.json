 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many natural questions in mathematics, there arise integrals that diverge when thought of in a classical sense, but which can be made sense of due to an underlying cancellation property (informally, they can be made sense of because they involve adding a \"positive infinity\" and a \"negative infinity\" that cancel each other out). These important objects are known as singular integrals. This project proposes to study several related kinds of singular integrals. A unifying aspect of the proposed questions is that they are all intimately connected to a geometry, and this project will study how this underlying geometry can be used to develop the correct notions of singular integrals. The questions proposed have many applications.  They include direct applications to medical imaging, electrical impedance tomography, geophysical prospection, the rate at which fluids mix in certain situations, new directions in several complex variables, and new directions for multilinear operators that have underlying singular integrals.  Furthermore, given the wide range of applications that singular integrals have found in the past, it is possible that the ideas developed for this project may have many other applications in physics and mathematics beyond those mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThere are five main, interrelated questions in this project. The first is to study open questions from several complex variables using ideas recently developed by the principal investigator on multiparameter singular integrals. In many special cases, operators from several complex variables are Calderon-Zygmund singular integral operators and are well understood. However, in many more general cases, the operators are some sort of singular integral that is not of Calderon-Zygmund type. These operators often have an underlying multiparameter Carnot-Caratheodory geometry, which was recently developed in a quantitative way by the principal investigator. The next topic concerns new directions in oscillatory integrals, which also have two underlying Carnot-Caratheodory geometries and are amenable to the prinicipal investigator's methods concerning these geometries.  The third direction concerns a generalization of multilinear singular integrals due to Christ and Journe, which was motivated by Bressan's Mixing Conjecture. Here a main technique will be to use the geometry of projective space to determine the right class of operators. The fourth direction involves new kinds of multilinear singular integrals where the key tool will be to use actions of semisimple Lie groups to study their boundedness properties. The fifth direction lies in a slightly different line, and introduces a new kind of differential equation that is motivated by questions from pseudodifferential operators and inverse problems. The prinicipal investigator offers a conjecture as to the uniqueness properties of this differential equation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most fundamental aspects of harmonic analysis are singular integrals.  These are integrals which do not converge in the classical sense, but can be made sense of because of a positive infinity cancelling with a negative infinity.  Due to this subtle cancellation, these singular integrals are much harder to deal with than their classical counter parts, but arise in many questions from partial differential equations and related fields.\n\n \n\n\nThis project concerned theories of singular integrals which are closely tied to different notions of distance.  The main notion of distance used is a sub-Riemannain distance.  The most basic non-trivial example of a sub-Riemannian distance is familiar to any driver.  When parallel parking, the goal is to move a car horizontally into a parking spot.  However, moving the car horizontally takes much longer than moving it forwards and backwards, because it involves a series of turns and moving forwards and backwards.  Because of this, we think of distances traveled horizontally as being further than those traveled forwards and backwards.\n\nThis idea from parallel parking can be generalized to a new type of distance which arises in many problems in partial differential equations and several complex variables.  This project deals with singular integrals whose singularities are controlled in terms of this distances.  One of the main aspects of this project to to develop appropriate quantitative theories of these distances which can be used to study the singular integrals.  Another main aspect of this project concerns several theories of singular integrals and related operators.  Related to mixing in a fluid, we investigate some multi-linear singular integrals.\n\nIn a separate, unrelated vein, we describe a new kind of differential equation related to medical imaging.  When preforming medical imaging, one sends signals into a body, and the goal is to reconstruct an image of the interior based on the signals which emanate out.  It turns out this can be related to a generalized kind of differential equation.  The question of whether one can perfectly reconstruct the image from the signal is equivalent to uniqueness for this differential equation.  In this project we introduce a simplified form of this differential equation and prove the desired uniqueness.\n\n\nDuring this project, several students were trained.  The PI ran an REU where three undergraduates furthered results on the above differential equations.  The PI has also trained two PhD students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Street"
