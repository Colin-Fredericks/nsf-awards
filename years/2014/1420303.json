 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standard mathematics education that is embedded in symbol systems often fails to engage students, especially girls, by divorcing mathematics from real world contexts. This lack of engagement extends into truncated course taking and a potentially life-long avoidance of mathematics. This project will build on theories of learning that postulate that design experiences (i.e., embodied learning) can play a crucial role in the learning process alongside of more formalized construct learning. Specifically, the researchers will explore traditional women's crafting (knitting, crocheting, sewing, and quilting) to create models for mathematics learning using craft design and especially the process of fixing mistakes in physical contexts to teach basic mathematical concepts such as proportional reasoning, fractions, and geometry. The broader impact of this work lies in its potential to broaden participation in STEM activities and, later, careers for girls and women, highlighting both the everyday mathematics at play in traditional women's crafting communities as well as introducing middle school youth to new mathematical ideas. The goal is to design and identify tools, materials, and activities that can be leveraged in the long term to transform approaches to mathematics spanning both in- and out-of-school learning spaces.\r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to (1) conduct a series of cognitive and connective ethnographies of female crafting circles to theorize the connections between mathematics and traditional women's crafts; (2) develop key tools, materials (i.e., a set of new tangible manipulatives) and supporting activities with potentially high utility in teaching mathematics through design and embodied approaches to learning; and (3) field test these early prototypes with a range of youth (grades 5-9) to deepen understanding and provide the necessary foundations for the next stages of curriculum development and broader adoption. The core focus will be on highlighting new ways to engage students and educators in mathematical thinking through hands-on crafts, an approach that leverages a range of mathematical ideas to provide students with new tangible manipulatives as \"objects-to-think-with\" in mathematics education.",

The project included: 1) embedded ethnographies that focused on the ways that women participate in advanced mathematics throughout their lifetimes and 2) school and out-of-school interventions with fiber crafts to understand how young people learn mathematics and computer science concepts with the crafts. Over the course of the project, we conducted <strong>embedded ethnographies</strong> that focused on six crafting traditions (i.e., weaving, knitting, sewing, fashion design, quilting, and crocheting) by joining and observing women's crafting groups as well as conducting interviews with experienced crafters. Our research questions targeted both the mathematical practices of particular crafting traditions, as well as the individual mathematical reasoning of expert crafters as they engaged in sustained practice. For the <strong>school and out-of-school interventions</strong>, we built on those instances of success to consider how to incorporate these practices into the institutional contexts from which women often turn away. We specifically focused on multiplicative proportional reasoning, 3D mental rotation, as well as computational concepts including variables, functions, and conditionals. These concepts were identified in the initial ethnographies as being&nbsp; (a) consistently touched upon in crafting traditions, (b) challenging for learners in traditional middle school and high school mathematics, and (c) key conceptual ideas which act as gatekeepers to advanced mathematics, without which often lead to women dropping out of the pipeline in mathematics and computer science.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL MERIT.</strong> The intellectual merit of this work lies in illuminating the inherent connections that women see between their crafting activities and advanced mathematical concepts as well as advancing curricular approaches that build on these identified STEM concepts within fiber crafts.

The project also served as a research training opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students as well as teachers in the field (via the Research Experiences for Teachers program), resulting in a book manuscript, two dissertations, undergraduate honors theses, and opportunities to present in several conferences.
