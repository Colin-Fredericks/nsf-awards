 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stroke occurs in 2.9% of the US adult population and there are nearly 800,000 new or recurring\r\ncases annually. Neuromuscular impairment is a common consequence, though one from which recovery\r\nis possible with appropriate therapy. Though most healthcare plans cover post-stroke therapy,\r\ninsurance reimbursement caps typically limit it to a few weeks, despite a growing body of\r\nevidence that therapeutic gains are possible months and even years after a stroke. Adding\r\nthe fact that patients generally prefer out-of-clinic care, there is a compelling case for\r\ndelivery of physical therapy in the home setting. The new product that will result from this\r\nproject will increase dosing of meaningful exercises that promote recovery and minimize co-morbidities\r\nsuch as pain, swelling, spasticity and (shoulder) subluxation.\r\nThis project?s outputs respond to other trends in the US healthcare system, including the\r\ndwindling supply of qualified care providers, the movement toward evidence based medicine\r\nand the economic requirement for increased self-care. The ultimate goal of our Virtual Coach\r\ntechnology is to leverage scarce human-based care with computer based solutions at substantially\r\nlower cost. The self-adjusting goal-setting capability developed in the proposed research\r\nwill enable professional therapists to extend their reach to patients.\r\n\r\nOne significant challenge in computer-based coaching is devising algorithms that affect human\r\nbehavior in an intended way. It is difficult to predict how people will react to commands,\r\ninstructions, prompts and rewards. Some respond well to a nurturing \"atta boy!\" while others\r\nrespond better to a drill sergeant?s \"that?s not good enough!\" Moreover, not only is there\r\nvariability among people, but also within a particular individual from day-to-day. To be a\r\nviable, pervasive solution, Virtual Coaches will need to be responsive to the psychology\r\nof the people they serve. Pursuit of our objectives, especially the exploratory research objective,\r\naddresses this challenge in the context of motivating people to adhere to an exercise regimen.\r\nA second challenge is designing exercise software factoring in the heterogeneous presentation\r\nof individuals with neuromuscular impairments. Such patients have varying levels of motor\r\ncontrol, cognitive ability and co-morbidities associated with their impairments. Off the\r\nshelf exercise packages do not account for their limitations. Our translational research objective\r\nis to overcome this challenge by leveraging research conducted on impaired patients and an\r\nalready developed software architecture for coaching them through movements that promote long\r\nterm recovery.\r\n\r\n",
