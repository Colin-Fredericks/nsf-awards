 "awd_abstract_narration": "A planar graph is a network drawn on the plane so that no edges cross. Planar and near-planar graphs have been fertile ground for algorithms research since the mid-1950s, both because they naturally model many classes of networks that arise in practice, and because they admit simpler and faster algorithms than more general graphs.\u00a0\u00a0Algorithms for such graphs find numerous applications in geographic information systems, computer graphics, solid modeling, computer vision, VLSI design, information visualization, finite-element mesh generation, computational geometry, and other areas.\u00a0\u00a0New techniques introduced in the last ten years have led to an explosion of new optimization algorithms for planar graphs and their generalizations, as well as the emergence of a small but growing research community that draws on and contributes to this pool of techniques; however, we are coming up against limitations of these techniques.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop efficient algorithms for several fundamental optimization problems in planar graphs and related graph families.\u00a0\u00a0Working on problems just outside the range of existing tools will lead the PIs toward developing the next batch of techniques that will maintain momentum in the field.\u00a0\u00a0Specific targets include faster and simpler exact algorithms for variants of shortest paths, maximum flows, minimum cuts, and minimum-cost flows, as well as new polynomial-time approximation schemes for several network design, clustering, and facility location problems for which no such schemes are currently known.\u00a0\u00a0The PIs will also implement and experimentally evaluate some algorithms that appear particularly promising, and make the resulting software publicly available, to support the efforts of students, researchers, and professionals in many different areas of computing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of the research was to discover algorithms and techniques to address optimization problems, including and especially those arising in road networks.  Consider, for example, vehicle routing.  This is an optimization problem that captures aspects of a real-world challenge: assigning tasks and routes to drivers of vehicles jointly servicing a large number of locations in a geographical area.  Companies offering delivery services face this challenge every day; in this context the problem is called last-mile delivery optimization.  Service crews also face this challenge: they need to dispatch crew members to various locations to, e.g., install broadband or repair utility equipment.\n\n\nVehicle routing is a computationally difficult optimization problem; no method is known to quickly and reliably compute the best solution to a vehicle-routing scenario.  One strategy for coping with this limitation is to seek algorithms that are guaranteed to find approximately optimal solutions, solutions that are nearly as good as the best.  However, as the problem is  traditionally formulated---as a problem in a network---it seems too hard even to compute good approximations reliably. In the research, we taken a novel approach: we work on algorithms that take into account some characteristics of road maps; by doing so, we obtain algorithms that can in principle achieve much better approximations.\n\n\nOne such characteristic is planarity: a network is planar if it can be drawn on the surface of a plane without crossings.  Road networks tend to be nearly planar.  There is therefore reason to believe that algorithms that assume the input is planar will be applicable to road networks, albeit with some adapting.\n\n\nAnother example optimization problem is facility location.  In this problem, one seeks to select locations in which facilities should be placed in order to be near specified clients.  Facility-location problems arise, e.g., when planning for medical clinics, fire stations, polling stations, or delivery fulfillment centers.  They can arise when an organization is planning to select new retail locations such as caf?s.  Related questions can arise in selecting locations to pre-position assets such as emergency supplies or vehicles.\n\n\nLike vehicle routing, facility-location problems are computationally hard, even to approximate; it is unlikely that any algorithm can be designed that is guaranteed to output a solution whose quality is nearly as good as the best solution.  in our research, we have given algorithms that require the input to be planar but under that restriction are guaranteed to output nearly-optimal solutions.  Again, because road networks tend to be nearly planar, our algorithms could be  applicable (with some adapting) to such networks.\n\n\nImage analysis is another application area in which planar networks arise.  Some problems in image analysis involve decomposing the image into clusters (or regions).   In some applications, the image is represented by a network (a.k.a. a graph) in which there is a point representing each pixel and there are direct connections between the points corresponding to adjacent pixels.  Such a network is planar, so is amenable to analysis by algorithms requiring planar networks. The research project has led to the discovery of some such algorithms, one for a problem called correlation clustering, the other for a minimum-cut problem.\n\n\nThe research project led to the discovery of other algorithms as well, and, through seeking these new algorithms, to the discovery and elaboration of algorithmic frameworks for addressing optimization problems in planar networks and similarly restricted families of networks.\n\n\nThe research resulting from the project has intellectual merit of two forms.  First, the results shed light on the intrinsic computational difficulty of the optimization problems addressed.  The results demonstrate that optimization problems that are difficult to approximate when arbitrary networks are considered become much easier to approximate when the input networks are required to be, e.g., planar. This is an example of a more general lesson that is learned in computer science again and again---generality comes at a price--- and speaks to a task central to computer science, finding a suitable compromise between generality and tractability.\n\n\nThe second form of intellectual merit derives from the specific technical contributions of the research: the results obtained illustrate powerful algorithmic techniques for obtaining new algorithms for optimization problems.\nThe research's broader impacts come from the potential of these techniques to make it possible to quickly compute high-quality solutions to optimization problems that arise in the world but are considered computationally difficult.  Problems in search of solution grow in scale as society undergoes changes such as the growth in demand for delivery services and the emergence of new kinds of businesses such as mobility service providers.  Theoretically grounded algorithmic research can contribute to practical solutions to these large-scale optimization problems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip N Klein"
