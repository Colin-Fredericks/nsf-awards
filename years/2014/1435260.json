 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research founded on the basic discovery of an electric response to mechanical pressure, from rapid strength gain in cement. The data obtained from this project will not only enable  the use of construction materials as energy harvesting components but will also create a solid foundation for future electrically responsive cement design. The ability to produce a renewable energy from mechanical loading of a structural material is not only fascinating, but it is the type of thinking/research that is in the forefront of international concern. This research project will leverage a multidisciplinary relationship between academic departments, centers and international collaborators that create an exceptional educational environment where students work on scientifically challenging problems with substantial potential for innovation. A Civil Engineering Graduate student and a post-doctoral scholar will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.  Outreach Programs to three underrepresented, yet motivated, elementary schools through a 4th-grade science program, will increase minority participation.  The designed hands-on learning experience and exposure to advanced laboratory applications will increase the interest of domestic students in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of this project is to functionalize calcium sulfoaluminate cements for energy harvesting and as a smart-sensing construction material. By quantitatively and unambiguously verifying ettringite as a piezoelectric mineral. The aims of the research are (i) to develop the science base needed for utilization of ettringite as a piezoelectric mineral, (ii) identify, isolate and evaluate potential piezoelectric influences within the calcium sulphoaluminate (CSA) mortar matrix, and (iii) the development of engineering approaches that allow efficient assessment for ettringite-based energy harvesting piezoelectric components for civil structures.  Key elements of the strategy include (i) determine the piezoelectric constants of the mineral ettringite, (ii) expand the view on other potential sources of piezoelectric voltage within the hydrated CSA cement matrix; such as crystal morphology or alignment, and (iii) fabrication and piezoelectric testing of large-scale concrete elements optimized for energy harvesting.  If successful, the discovery and characterization of ettringite as a piezoelectric crystal phase in cement will create new knowledge on energy harvesting from calcium sulfoaluminate cement materials.  The data on material properties and piezoelectric potential of ettringite-rich cementitious structural elements will not only enable the functionalization of construction materials as energy harvesting components but also will lay a solid foundation for future piezoelectric cementitious design.",
