 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non- Technical Abstract\r\nThis research project explores the synthesis of new semiconductors and magnetic materials by carrying out reactions using molten metals as solvents. Synthesis in metal flux allows reactions to take place in a solution; this liquid state method enables crystal growth and the formation of unusual new compounds. The new materials discovered in this work may possess useful magnetic and electronic properties, and their study contributes to increasing understanding of the nature of magnetic alloys, solar cell materials, and hydrogen storage alloys. This interdisciplinary research project educates undergraduate and graduate student researchers in materials chemistry.  The work involves collaboration with scientists in a variety of areas (such as chemistry, physics, and engineering), as well as the use of advanced facilities at national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. This allows the student participants to understand the increasingly complex and collaborative nature of modern science.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nSupport from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research allows the research team to explore two areas:  the synthesis of magnetic alloys in lanthanide/transition metal (Ln/T) eutectic fluxes, and the synthesis of lightweight complex salt-like compounds in alkaline earth-rich (AE) flux mixtures. Products of these reactions are characterized by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility measurements, transport measurements, band structure calculations, and other techniques. Trends in reactivity, common structural building blocks, and structure-property relationships are investigated.  The Ln/T flux syntheses yield new compounds with magnetic properties stemming from both the lanthanide and the transition metal element. Product structures often contain clusters or layers of transition metals; the magnetic behavior of these building blocks will shed light on how magnetic moments develop as transition metal clusters increase in size. Magnetic behavior that may arise includes magnetic ordering, spin glass behavior, superconductivity, magnetoresistance, mixed valence and heavy fermion behavior. Alkaline earth-rich flux mixtures using calcium, strontium, or barium will strongly reduce most main group elements to form new Zintl phases and complex salts. These include new metal hydride and subhydride phases which may be of interest for hydrogen storage. Using magnesium-rich fluxes yields more borderline products which do not exhibit complete charge transfer and are often semimetallic; they may be of potential use as thermoelectric materials, or may show metal-to-insulator transitions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n                Metal flux syntheses use an excess of molten metal as a solvent for reactions.  The molten metal dissolves elemental reactants, bringing them into solution at temperatures well below their usual melting point.  This synthesis method produces complex intermetallic phases (compounds containing two or more metal or metalloid elements) in the form of large crystals, which facilitates characterization of their structure and properties.  In addition to discovering new materials, we also seek to understand reaction trends and mechanisms by observing common structural building blocks, competing byproducts, and the effects of changing reaction ratio and temperatures.  Understanding flux chemistry will enable future design and targeting of compounds with desirable properties.\n\nA mixture of magnesium and aluminum which melts at 450&deg;C was used to dissolve silicon and other elements to make compounds such as Ba1.9Ca2.4Mg9.7Si7, Ba5Yb2.3Mg16.7Si12 and Ba20Yb4.7Mg61.3Si43.  These new materials have a series of related structures, and electronic properties lying between those of metals and semiconductors.  They show promise for use as thermoelectrics, which are compounds that can convert thermal gradients to electricity.  Another flux mixture, a 50/50 ratio of calcium and lithium, is an excellent solvent for the growth of metal nitrides.  Most of these products are semiconductors, including Ca6Te3N2, which exhibits dichroism (varying from red to green color depending on the viewing angle).   Magnetic alloys are being sought from reactions in low-melting mixtures of lanthanide and transition metals.  Products such as Nd6Co5GeAl3 have multiple magnetic ordering transitions stemming from both the transition metal (cobalt) and the lanthanide ions (neodymium). \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n            This project contributed to the greater understanding of metal flux synthesis, materials design, and magnetic and thermoelectric properties.  In addition to discovering new materials that may be potentially useful as magnetic materials or in power generation (as solar cell materials or thermoelectrics), this project provided training for several undergraduate and graduate students in solid state chemistry theory and experimental techniques.  Students gained expertise in crystal growth and characterization of structure and bonding using X-ray diffraction techniques.  They carried out elemental analysis and magnetic studies using state of the art equipment.  They also learned electronic structure calculation methods, which are crucial for understanding optical properties and conduction behavior of materials.   In publishing their work and presenting at conferences, the students honed their writing skills and critical thinking abilities.  This training will prepare them to be part of the scientific workforce that will solve today's problems and advance tomorrow's technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan E Latturner"
