 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project will reconstruct fire histories across a network of sites in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota in order to assess the potential impact of Native American land-use activities on fire regimes and vegetation patterns of the region.  The project will advance basic knowledge about the extent and magnitude of human influence on landscapes often considered pristine and address the inclusion of humans as agents of change within ecological baselines of North American forests.  The findings of this project should contribute to innovative thinking about the concept of wilderness as defined under the 1964 Wilderness Act.  During the conduct of this project, research, education, and mentoring activities will be fully integrated to enhance undergraduate learning and prepare graduate students for future scientific careers.  The investigators and collaborations built through the research will provide critical information to resource managers that will aid their long-term planning and management of wilderness landscapes.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of fires over the 20th century is one of the most visible and dramatic human impact on forest fires, leading directly to increasing tree densities and subsequent fuel-driven fire events that may be unprecedented over the last several centuries.  The potential role of Native American burning on landscape structure and composition prior to the advent of effective fire suppression has received much less attention, however, but burning by the Ojibwe who lived in the study area and other Native Americans may have a substantial impact on present forest structure and composition. The use of fire by Native American groups to manipulate their surroundings may have augmented fire frequencies in many areas that are today considered relatively natural.  If Native Americans historically augmented fire frequencies beyond the frequencies that would have occurred from lightning ignitions, vegetation patterns in areas that today are managed as natural areas might be a legacy of past human activity than previously had been realized.  Understanding the relative impact of Native American fire use therefore is critically important as management agencies shift to active management strategies designed to mitigate external pressures, such as invasive species and climate change, through the application of disturbance processes like fire.  To conduct this project, the investigators have worked with USDA Forest Service archaeologists to identify sites with known Ojibwe use alongside sites with little or no evidence of Ojibwe use.  The researchers will use tree-rings to reconstruct past fire and forest demographic patterns at each site. They will compare the characteristics between each set of sites in terms of fire regime characteristics (fire frequency, fire synchrony, and fire-climate relationships) and vegetation patterns (forest age structure, composition, and canopy structure).  Systematic differences in the fire history and vegetation patterns between the groups will provide quantitative evidence of the legacies of Ojibwe land use in contemporary forests, with direct implications for defining the concept and management of wilderness. Past fire history patterns also will be compared with modern records of fire and lightning to assess whether past fire history is similar to ignition or lightning strike density observed within the modern landscape.",

Our research identified important differences in fire activity across the BWCAW, with fire history sites associated with historical Ojibwe settlements and travel corridors exhibiting substantially more frequent fires than sites away from these more intensive areas of use. Elevated fire frequency related to human activities led to the establishment of relatively open, red pine (<em>Pinus resinosa</em>)-dominated forest stands at more sites than would otherwise have supported this community type. This is significant, in that open red pine communities are central to modern wilderness visitors&rsquo; idea of wilderness and are of high conservation value as they support a disproportionate number of rare and endangered species in this region. Fire activity declined precipitously in our study area synchronously with the removal of traditional Ojibwe landuse and lifeways from the BWCAW through the 1889 Nelson Act. Regular fire was a crucial tool used by the Ojibwe to augment and rejuvenate traditional berrying areas at somewhat regular intervals. The cessation of fires, which preceded effective fire suppression in the area by several decades, was quickly followed by a surge in tree establishment that resulted in denser forests that are more susceptible to drought impacts and severe wildfires. Collectively, these results indicate a measurable influence of people on fire and forest development at certain locations and during certaintime periods. Without human augmentation of fire frequency by way of direct human ignition of prescribed fires, the future landscape of the BWCAW will likely become more homogenous and lack important components of the wilderness character often sought by visitors to the BWCAW, and served as the original impetus for wilderness status.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this research extended to undergraduate students, graduate students, and early career scientists, boosted the research activity of a Title III comprehensive university, established numerous relationships among scientists, land managers, and American Indian communities, and was disseminated through 24 public presentations, three publications (including a peice intended to inform the general public), and numerous informal conversations among the public, scientific, non-governmental organizations, and management communities. Over 34 undergraduate students have been engaged in the high-impact educational experience of undergraduate research through this project, while ideas from this work informed the classroom experiences reaching hundreds of students each semester. The findings of this research inspired conversations among wilderness, fire, and cultural resource managers on the Superior National Forest and resulted in a new collaboration with the managers of Quetico Provincial Park (QPP) and members of the Lac La Croix First Nation that is helping revise the QPP fire management plan to explicitly incorporate human influences and shared decision making with LLCFN elders and community members. Finally, the story emerging from this research powerfully speaks to the long-term relationship between people and the land. Funded by a new grant from the Coalition for Archaeological Synthesis, this story inspired the creation of a team of scientists, managers, First Nation community members, and story tellers to initiate a new collaborative effort that will integrate tree-ring, archaeological, and ethnographic data in the context of traditional stories and ecological knowledge.
