 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 2011, the Center for Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame has been organizing and hosting annual summer programs on various mathematical themes.  The goal of the Center is two-fold:  first, to provide students at the undergraduate and graduate level with the necessary mathematical background so they can understand and appreciate recent developments in mathematical research.   This is accomplished through a series of mini-courses taught by leading researchers, who aim their lectures at the appropriate level.  The second goal is to broadly disseminate current advances in these areas by hosting a conference in the final week of the program.   The Center also seeks to increase the diversity of the mathematical work force by actively recruiting underrepresented groups to attend the activities.  This grant supports the programs planned at the Center for the next three summers.\r\n\r\nThe program in 2014 will be dedicated to Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics. Many physical principles are an expression of an underlying variational principle; at the same time, physical laws often have a purely geometric description. The goal of the Program in Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics is to bring together researchers who are working on PDEs with connections to differential geometry and mathematical physics.  The program in 2015 will be dedicated to Boundaries and Dynamics.  In recent years a number of problems and techniques have used statistical properties of a group action on an object at infinity which can be considered as a boundary. The goal of the Program on Boundaries and Dynamics is to explore themes involving a notion of boundaries in geometry and ergodic theory.  The program in 2016 will be dedicated to Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics.  The last few years have also seen a remarkable convergence of ideas in model theory, combinatorics, Lie groups, number theory, and dynamics. The main goal of the Program on Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics is to facilitate interactions between mathematicians working in these related areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nProject Outcomes:\n\nThis award suported three-week thematic programs organized by the Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame (CMND) during the summers of 2014 - 2016.   Each program ran for three weeks, and included three parts:\n\n* An undergraduate week, which brought in students from across the country to learn about some basic ideas/problems in the area represented by the program; \n\n* A summer school aimed at beginning researchers and grad students,  and consisting of several mini-courses taught by world-class researchers; \n\n* A conference with research talks covering recent developments in the field.\n\nThe themes of the prorgams were:\n\nSummer 2014:  Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics\n\nSummer 2015:  Boundaries and Ergodic Theory\n\nSummer 2016:  Generalized Stability, Pseudofinite Combinatorics and related topics\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  \n\nNonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics:   Many physical principles are an expression of an underlying variational principle.  When the maximum or minimum is attained -- for example, when potential energy is minimized -- the physical law is also described by a partial differential equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation. \n\nAt the same time, physical laws often have a purely geometric description.  Einstein's field equations of General Relativity prescribe the\nRicci curvature tensor of space-time, and the underlying metric tensor is a critical point of the Einstein-Hilbert action.  Soap bubbles minimize area and therefore, in physical terms, are the least energy configuration.\n \nThe examples of the Einstein field equations and minimal surfaces are particularly instructive, because their study drove many of the developments in the existence and regularity theory for nonlinear PDEs in the last century.  The program in Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics brought together researchers working on PDEs with connections to differential geometry and mathematical physics, and through the minicourses and undergraduate program disseminate the recent advances in this important area of mathematics. \n\nBoundaries and Ergodic Theory:  Many problems and techniques in the recent years use statistical properties of a group action on an object at infinity which can be considered as a boundary. In this presentation, we recall some of the classical examples and current questions.\n\nFamously Mostow's proof of his rigidity theorem uses the action of a lattice in a semi-simple group on the boundary of the associated symmetric space. Margulis's super-rigidity and arithmeticity theorems used and established more information on this action. This has been generalized to other groups  (in particular to automorphisms of products of trees or to product of Kac-Moody  groups).  In general, many of the recent works on the ergodic theory of Lie group actions go back and forth between the interior of the group and the boundary.\n\nThere are other themes using boundaries, geometry and ergodic theory, such as, for instance,  the study of Diophantine approximations at the boundary.  The thematic program touched on all of these subjects, and afforded the opportunity  to meet and interact with specialists who use ergodic theory in different problems and already have a common language.\n\nGeneralized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics:  The last few years have seen a remarkable convergence of ideas in model theory, combinatorics, Lie groups,  number theory, and dynamics.\nFrom the model theoretic side this is part of what is sometimes called generalized stability, the evolution of the technical apparatus of stability theory and stable groups,\noutside the stable environment. The development of o-minimality almost 30 years ago was part of this process, as well as the work on simple theories beginning in the middle 1990's.\nThe main goal of this thematic Program of the Center of Mathematics\nwas to facilitate interactions between mathematicians working in the related areas,  and also to present mini-courses that provided young\nresearches and  students with introductions to recent major\ndevelopments in Model Theory.  \n\nBroader Impacts:  Over the period of the support of the grant the undergraduate programs had over 60 participants, about 30% of which were women and/or from underrepresented groups.  The week-long summer schools had over 120 registered participants, the majority supported by the grant.  All programs had significant international presence.  Moreover, the lectures of the undergraduate program in Boundaries and Ergodic Theory were published in a book by the European Math. Society: \"Dynamics done with your bare hands\" editors F. Dal'Bo, F. Ledrappier and A. Wilkinson; authors D. Davis, P. Lessa, R. Roeder and B. Waever.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Gursky"
