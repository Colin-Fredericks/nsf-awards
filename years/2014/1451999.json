The goal of this project was to understand how the mentoring structures undergraduates experience contribute to the outcomes they realize from participating in research.

Undergraduates in closed triads report more positive outcomes than undergraduates in other triadic mentoring structures, and similar to undergraduates who are mentored directly by faculty (dyad mentoring structure).

Asian students were also more likely to report being in open triads and experiencing less positive research outcomes, but their mentoring structure was unrelated to this.
