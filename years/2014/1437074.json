 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate how changes in environmental and human activities have influenced fires over time, using a combination of datasets that describe past and present variations in fire.  The project also will develop a global fire model to help test hypotheses about the roles that environmental factors and humans have played in controlling the location, size, and frequency of fires at regional-to-global scales.  The project will provide new information and insights about relationships among fire, climate and other environmental factors, and human activities.  The project will contribute to broader scientific advances in knowledge regarding Earth system processes, and the project will enhance the quality of Earth system models that now are incorporating fire in simulations of the global environment.  Knowledge of the ways that human activity, climate, and other environmental factors have affected fires in the past at both regional and global scales is critical to understanding how fires will behave in the future.  Given the threats that fires pose for humans and the critical role that fires play in the functioning of many ecosystems, increased awareness of the dynamics of fire behavior has considerable practical utility.  Project findings will facilitate enable improved representations of the processes that control fire in models across a variety of climate and land-use conditions, thereby informing decisions about natural resource and fire management efforts.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for graduate students, and it will assist in the development of curricular materials dealing with the interactions among fire, natural systems, and human activities for use in elementary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThis project will use satellite-based reconstructions of fire activity to validate modern-day simulations, and it will advance collection of data to study the factors that have influenced the dynamics and impact of fire in the past.  The investigators will combine information from a still-expanding global database of fire over the last millennium with the outputs from global fire modeling.  Past fire activity will be estimated from charcoal particles in lake sediments at a given depth as well as the time when the charcoal was deposited as determined through the use of radiocarbon dating.   The charcoal records will be used to reconstruct past levels of fire activity under a range of climate and land-use conditions, and the reconstructions will be compared with various simulations of past global fire activity.  Combining past and present datasets with model simulations of past climate will provide a more rigorous basis for understanding the specific processes that produce reconstructed and observed changes in fire activity than modern-day (satellite) datasets alone.",

Fire regimes are now rapidly changing in many parts of the world, with fire extent and frequency increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. Understanding the net effects, as well as the trajectories and causes of these changes requires long-term data because fire both affects and is affected by many components of the Earth system that operate over diverse temporal and temporal scales. In the project&rsquo;s first year, we convened an interdisciplinary, exploratory workshop to identify hypotheses about the evolution of fire during the past millennium. As a result of this workshop, the need to better understand what charcoal data represent emerged as a top priority. Project efforts subsequently focused on 1) reconstructing patterns of global biomass burning during the past 21,000, 1000, and 250 years from an expanded charcoal (paleofire) dataset; 2) comparing charcoal with other fire-history datasets; and 3) developing a deeper understanding of the relationships between charcoal data and fire-regime dimensions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Selected key findings from the research include 1) new spatially-explicit (gridded) reconstructions of global biomass burning for the past 21,000 and 1000 years that show unprecedented contemporary fire activity in several disparate regions of the world; 2) a global emissions inventory that includes long-term fire-history information from charcoal records for broad use by the global climate and Earth system modeling communities; and 3) insights into the unique fire signatures produced by different land-use and land-cover types in both charcoal data and models. This latter finding revealed unique Holocene biomass burning trajectories in forest versus grasslands, highlighting the importance of disaggregating these types of records in future fire emissions inventories. The project team also produced a new version of the Global Charcoal Database (v3) and developed global comparisons of independent fire-history datasets &ndash; from satellites, airport visibility records, fire-scarred trees, and historical sources &ndash; that have increased our confidence in and understanding of reconstructions of sediment-based charcoal data. This new knowledge lays a foundation for more precise and robust fire-history reconstructions in the future, whether applied to issues in fire ecology and management, conservation, or Earth system modeling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the NSF grant, the team engaged two Masters and one PhD student, and convened a workshop involving 34 researchers from 11 countries, including 14 in their early-career stage. The team published 16 peer-reviewed publications, delivered 13 presentations at workshops and conferences in four countries, and produced a website with instructions and code for analyzing fire history data. The project also enabled the contribution of time and expertise to the development of a robust repository for hundreds of lake, bog, marine, and other sediment records with charcoal data collected and analyzed by the paleofire community through collaboration with the PAGES Global Paleofire Working Group (www.gpwg.paleofire.org). &nbsp;The repository has an online interface to contribute, obtain, and analyze charcoal data, and to make individual fire histories for specific sites available to anyone interested in learning more about a particular watershed or region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Project efforts have been synergistic with a number of related NSF-funded initiatives, including the Paleoecological Observatory Network (PalEON) project that connects paleo- and neo-ecologists with modelers and statisticians to assess and improve terrestrial ecosystem models (Marlon), the international PalaeoCarbon Modelling Intercomparison Project/Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (PCMIP/PMIP3), and the Partnership for International Research and Education project (WildFIRE PIRE). Three outcomes that remain in progress at the end of this grant include an analysis of long-term fire history data from eastern North America, a data-model comparison of fire history during the past millennium, and a detailed regional assessment of alternative reconstructions of fire, land-use, and climate history in North America and Europe during the past 250 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Marlon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722614395_gcdv3-map--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722614395_gcdv3-map--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of the Global Charcoal Database\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722614395_gcdv3-map--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of the Global Charcoal Database\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Site map showing the locations of paleofire records in the Global Charcoal Database version 3 (GCDv3).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marlon et al., 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Marlon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map of the Global Charcoal Database</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722753669_fire-past-21000yrs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722753669_fire-past-21000yrs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biomass burning trends over the past 22,000 years\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722753669_fire-past-21000yrs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biomass burning trends over the past 22,000 years\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Trends and spatial patterns in biomass burning from 22,000 years ago to present from the GCDv3.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marlon et al., 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Marlon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biomass burning trends over the past 22,000 years</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722821141_fire-past-1000yrs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722821141_fire-past-1000yrs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biomass burning trends over the past 1,000 years\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722821141_fire-past-1000yrs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biomass burning trends over the past 1,000 years\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Biomass burning trends and spatial patterns over the past 1000 years based on charcoal data from the GCDv3.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marlon et al., 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Marlon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biomass burning trends over the past 1,000 years</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722884656_Data-model-comparison-example--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722884656_Data-model-comparison-example--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data-model comparison maps\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1437074/1437074_10326938_1527722884656_Data-model-comparison-example--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data-model comparison maps\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data-model comparison maps.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marlon et al., 2016</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Marlon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data-model comparison maps</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
