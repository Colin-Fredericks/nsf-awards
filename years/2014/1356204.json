 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting cohorts of upper division undergraduates at Eastern Washington University (EWU) who demonstrate academic potential, motivation for STEM, and financial need. Guiding objectives are: 1) to improve educational opportunities in the STEM disciplines by annually awarding scholarships to nine students; 2) to increase degree achievement by providing increased faculty mentoring and access to specialized student support services; 3) to build capacity in institutional practices that increase the retention of STEM students and of first generation and/or underrepresented minority students; and 4) to create and maintain community partnerships that increase EWU's visibility and generate training and employment opportunities for the students.  \r\n\r\nNotable project implementation components include mentoring, financial support, and enrichment activities designed to increase academic integration, motivation, identification with STEM, and retention to graduation. Students are recruited from three majors: Biology, Biochemistry, and Environmental Science which allows for: (1) an exploration of the interdisciplinary nature of STEM on the part of the cohort of scholarship recipients and (2) better matching of regional workforce needs with agency/industry partners.  Encouragement of diversity in the STEM workforce is promoted through a combined incentive and support program to help recruit students, many of whom are first-generation college attendees and/or members of underrepresented groups in STEM. Finally, the project offers multiple mentoring experiences through cohort-building enrichment activities that include professional development, career planning, information literacy and civic engagement.",
