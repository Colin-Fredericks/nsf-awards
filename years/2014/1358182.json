 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transformative research activities in the last decade focused on sustainable, robust, and reliable power systems have presented several paradigms such as smart grids, self-healing grids, and distributed generation. This workshop seeks to address the Control, Computing, and Signal Processing Challenges in Future Power Systems within the context of developing the tools for a system-level understanding of the impact of these emerging paradigms.  It will promote cross fertilization of ideas with the aim of developing the underlying foundational science to realize next-generation electric generation, transmission, and distribution systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together prominent researchers in relevant disciplines to address key questions relevant to future power systems, including: 1) What emerging control paradigms will improve management of renewables and charging of electric vehicles, with build-in resilience against failures and malicious attacks on critical infrastructure? 2) What is the role of optimization, big data analytics, and grid informatics in revitalizing power delivery subsystems and improving consumer satisfaction? 3) How can advances in statistical signal processing and machine learning be leveraged to improve situational awareness and system reliability? 4) How can we educate next-generation engineers about system-level challenges in future power systems?\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThis workshop will engage several engineering disciplines to map out the foundational science for research in future power systems. The workshop will also emphasize the related educational aspects, primarily by leveraging the long tradition of excellence in power and energy systems education that the University of Minnesota has established through the NSF-supported Consortium of Universities for Sustainable Power.",
