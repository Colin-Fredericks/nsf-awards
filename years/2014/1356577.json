 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science and MAth Research Training (SMART) program at Georgia Tech University is contributing well-prepared individuals to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by providing an educational experience that emphasizes experiential learning. The overall goal of the program is to prepare a cohort of highly talented students, working in science and mathematics to be the technology leaders of tomorrow.  It utilizes a Living Learning Community (LLC) with participation of students and faculty from the Schools of Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Biology, Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics. The program is introducing students to their majors, interdisciplinary and collaborative learning, and research through a series of activities. Specific objectives of the program are to: (i) provide financial assistance to scholars to relieve them of the burden of loans or non-career related jobs; (ii) improve retention of students in the College of Sciences; (iii) decrease the time-to-degree; (iv) increase participation in experiential learning (e.g., undergraduate research, cooperative education, internships, service learning and international study); (v) increase the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates from underrepresented groups; and (vi) increase the rate at which graduates embark on advanced training or careers in STEM fields. These goals are being achieved by providing scholarship funds to students with financial need, and by developing components to build strong student interactions with research-active faculty members. \r\n\r\nThe project addresses the challenge of increasing retention of students in STEM disciplines by providing enhanced mentoring and a coherent suite of student support services based around a LLC. This is enhancing the ability of the institution to increase the number of STEM graduates from underrepresented groups to better reflect the composition of the U.S. population. An extensive evaluation programs is designed to quantify the effect of participation in the program, and its individual components, on the academic success of the scholars. Examination of the value of a STEM-based LLC is important as institutions face the challenge of creating programs to recruit and retain STEM majors and enhance interdisciplinary education and training.\r\n\r\nUndergraduates are being provided the training and advising necessary to prepare them for an array of research projects and internship experiences. This includes skill-building and professional development seminar classes and monthly lunches. Each year a cohort of 24 students, 8 with S-STEM scholarships and 16 others, enter this program that provides a strong foundation for academic success. A tangible outcome of these interactions is enhanced involvement of scholars in experiential learning programs that provide them with skills, experiences, and motivations so that they are best prepared to succeed at the university and to enter productive, sustainable and rewarding careers.  Research opportunities across the university and in collaboration with other on-campus and off-campus units are available, and many faculty members have a culture of publishing with undergraduates as co-authors.  The program builds on many successful components of a previous S-STEM program and benefits from synergies with existing student support services and programs.",
