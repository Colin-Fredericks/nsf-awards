 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned I/UCRC for Rational Catalyst Synthesis intends to establish a research portfolio that can transform the art of catalyst preparation into a science through bringing powerful, complementary expertise to bear on fundamental problems of nanoscience and nanoengineering of heterogeneous catalysts.  In nanoengineering applications, nanoparticles can be synthesized with specific size, content (single or multi-metals) and morphology and so be optimized for particular catalytic reactions or to minimize the content of expensive precious metals.\r\n\r\nCatalytic processes represent a major underpinning of the U.S. economy and are responsible for commodity chemicals such as gasoline, textiles, and fertilizer and specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals. About 20% of the world?s economy depends directly or indirectly on catalysis. Broader educational impact will be achieved in the practical mindset of all projects and the students trained through their execution. This industrial bent will stem from two sources; first, internally, from the industry research experience of the leadership, and second, from direct involvement of industry in individual research projects. Educational outreach will include the recruitment and eventual industrial placement of underrepresented groups.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur NSF award for the I/UCRC Planning Workshop for the Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS) allowed the University of South Carolina (USC) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) to recruit companies to and plan and conduct our June 16-17, 2014 Planning Grant Workshop at the Horizon Research Center at USC.  A total of 13 attendees from 9 companies and 1 national lab participated in the workshop; a list of attendees ane their companies, along with the participating USC and VCU faculty, and the NSF participants, are shown in Figure 1.  The meeting format suggested by NSF (Figure 2) was followed virtually exactly, and Drs. Larry Hornak, NSF\u00c6s program director, and Don Davis, NSF\u00c6s evaluator, both opined that this had been one of the most enthusiastic workshops they had attended.\n\n \n\nWith company feedback from the prospective member companies, the research projects in CeRCaS\u00c6 three thrusts were revised; these are shown in Figure 3.  More detailed write-ups of the first two projects from each thrusts were included in the full I/UCRC proposal submitted in September, 2014.  In February, 2015, we were elated to hear that our full proposal had been funded.  The Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis will occupy the unique niche (and so fill the knowledge gap) in obtaining a scientific understanding of the chemical fundamentals of metal deposition and nanoparticle genesis.  The focus of CeRCaS at the \"preparation &ndash; structure\" nexus is shown relative to the focus of three current or former DOE Energy Frontier Research Centers (at the structure-function nexus) in Figure 4.  The kick-off meeting of CeRCaS will occur in late May, 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Regalbuto"
