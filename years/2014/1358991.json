This component of the program acts as an important follow-through mechanism to further encourage REU participants to pursue graduate studies and contributes to the success of the site by motivating both the student and mentors to obtain quality research results. Other important objectives include providing a structure wherein research and technical communication skills are cultivated.  The intellectual merit of the program resides in the current need for basic and applied research in fluid mechanics across a range of engineering disciplines as well as the training of undergraduate students in state-of-the-art laboratory environments. At least eight faculty will act as research mentors and students will contribute to projects that include, as a sampling, particle image velocimetry (PIV) investigations of bio-inspired boundary layer control mechanisms, combustion studies using a color schlieren system, and the examination of magnetic fluids for cancer treatment. This program provides a structured plan for each student to present their work at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS DFD) Meeting held each fall. Over the past six summers during the previous site, 98% of participants presented an abstract at APS DFD. Assessment of the program has resulted in continuous improvement to the site and, especially, to the seminars and communication skills workshops -- the latest involves having the students compile a three-minute video about their research project for web posting.  The broader impacts of the program include enhancing and diversifying the pool of students considering a research career in engineering/sciences. The program incorporates an aggressive recruitment plan for attracting talented female and other underrepresented groups. Past efforts resulted in demographics that included 22 women, 4 Hispanics and 2 African Americans out of 51 students (43% women, and 28/51 or 55% from underrepresented groups). In addition, one Army veteran also participated in 2013. The original target, which was surpassed in the previous sites, was and still is to have at least half of the students participating each year to be from underrepresented groups. To-date, over 50% of past participants have entered graduate school. The proposed REU program will not only advance knowledge in new research areas within fluid mechanics, but will also train a group of diverse and highly-educated engineering researchers into the US workforce. A new goal of the renewal site is to recruit at least half from colleges where research in STEM areas is limited.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award funds a Research Experience for Undergraduates site that will run for 10 weeks each summer from 2014-2016.  The program is under the direction of Dr. Amy Lang at the University of Alabama and will engage approximately nine students each summer in research related to engineering fluid mechanics.  Students will be mentored by one of eight faculty from Aerospace, Mechanical and Chemical & Biological Engineering departments within the College of Engineering.  These projects range from the study of how butterfly scales improve flight efficiency for potential bio-inspired designs to combustion studies for overall improvement in fuel efficiency for gas turbine engines and automobiles.  The site also cultivates the oral and written communication skills of the students through a series of weekly workshops.  Communication of research results is a key skill for a high quality researcher in engineering.  Also, this site is unique in that it culminates in each student submitting an abstract and presenting at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting held each November.  This is an international conference of over 2000 professionals and students presenting their work in the field of fluid dynamics.  As a group the students attend the conference in November after their summer experience with Dr. Amy Lang and accompanying graduate students.  Overall, this experience provides an opportunity for promising undergraduates to perform research as they would experience in graduate school, and, thus, motivates students to pursue advanced degrees in engineering. Over 50% of past participants have enrolled in graduate school (such as MIT, Georgia Tech and Stanford).  Recruitment of students from underrepresented groups is also a goal, with the primary focus being that of women in engineering (over 40% were women in past sites, about 55% were from underrepresented groups when including Hispanics and African Americans).  This new site also has the goal of recruiting from colleges where research opportunities are limited, such as Smith College in Massachusetts.",
