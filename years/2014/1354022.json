 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore how one result of landscape change, the timing and availability of flowers, affects populations of bumble bees, a prominent group of native bees that pollinate many crops and wildflowers in North America.  Bumble bees are important because more than one-third of the food we eat comes from crops that depend to some degree on the type of pollination they provide.  Although non-native honey bees remain a cornerstone of agricultural pollination, native bees are increasingly the focus of agricultural attention in light of ongoing challenges facing honey bees. Healthy populations of native bees rely on continuous supplies of pollen and nectar.  However, the availability of these floral resources has been dramatically altered by unpredictable weather associated with changing climate, and by human activities, including intensive agriculture.  The investigators will study how changes in the timing and availability of flowers affect the number of bumble bees.  This research is a significant advance over past studies, which used patterns of bee visits to flowers to make broad conclusions about the overall health of bee populations and communities.  In contrast, the current study will focus on reproductive success of bee hives. The results will be key to developing strategies to promote robust populations of bees and ensure food security, as well as to conserve biological diversity. \r\n \r\nSpecifically, the project combines manipulative field experiments and original demographic population models to assess effects of within-year resource variation (resource pulses) on population dynamics of bumble bees.  The experiments will be conducted with Bombus vosnesenskii, a dominant bumble bee species in Northern California.  Investigators will conduct experiments in which flower availability and timing are systematically altered. They will then measure how vital rates of individual colonies (e.g., worker production, worker survival, and queen production) depend on the availability of floral resources at different times in the colony life cycle.  To ensure a consistent baseline of hive quality, all measurements will be made on lab-reared colonies started from wild-collected queens.  Experimental results will be combined with demographic models to predict long-term population viability of bees under different landscape conditions.  This research will answer questions about how ongoing landscape change will affect Bombus vosnesenskii and other bee species. It also will provide a previously-missing framework for population viability analysis of bees and other social insects.",

Unfortunately, multiple species of bumble bees are in decline worldwide. The causes of these declines vary, but the loss of habitat with consistent floral resources is one factor. &nbsp;Bumble bees have social colonies like honey bees, but, unlike honey bees, these colonies last for only one growing season. Over spring and summer colonies grow by producing worker bees. At the end of the summer they switch from producing workers to producing new queens and male bees. By fall, only the new queens are still alive. These new queens hibernate for the winter, emerge in spring, search for new nesting sites, and establish new colonies by early summer (See Fig. 1). We are learning that persistence of their populations year to year is determined by how strongly colonies grow, by how many new queens they produce and by how well these queens survive the winter to initiate new nests.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With this grant, we tested how the availability of flowering resources affected the growth and number of queens produced for a dominant western bumble bee (<em>Bombus vosnesneskii</em>) within a single growing season. This research was done in the Central Valley of California where agriculture has changed the amount and timing of flower resources available to bees. In the Central Valley, native plants flower mostly early in spring, before the dry summer. Irrigated agricultural crops have peak flowering later in summer. Therefore, although natural and agricultural landscapes have the same amount of flowers overall, they produce flowers at different times during bumble bee colony growth. Our and other groups prior field surveys suggest this timing might be crucial for colonies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used experiments in which we augmented free-flying bumble bee colonies with a multi-day pulse of resources either earlier or later in the summer to test how the timing of resources affected colony growth and reproduction. We found that early season resources and growth were disproportionately important leading to larger colonies with higher numbers of new queens produced. (This result is similar to the way that early childhood nutrition affects human health later in life.) A main cause was that bumble bee workers produced during the resource pulse were larger, and larger bees are better at foraging for more resources. The impact thus carried over to increased ability to get new resources even after the pulse ended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We extended our project to examine queen overwintering. Co-PI Elizabeth Crone and her students led efforts in the eastern US and our team worked in coastal California.

The results also have direct implications for bee conservation. State and federal agencies, growers and land managers are heavily engaged in work to conserve and augment habitat for bees. We show that paying careful attention to when flower resources are available to bees matters and that reliable resources early in the season is critical.&nbsp; Our field monitoring of nesting and foraging is also exciting because lack of knowledge about the full life cycle of bumble bees has limited effective conservation.
