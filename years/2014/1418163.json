 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Increasingly, all STEM fields rely on being able to understand data and use statistics. This project builds on prior efforts to create teaching resources for high-school Advanced Placement Statistics teachers to use an open source statistics programming language called \"R\" in their classrooms. The project brings together datasets from a variety of STEM domains, and will develop exercises and assessments to teach students how to program in R and learn the underlying statistics concepts. Thus, this project attempts to help students learn coding, statistics, and STEM simultaneously in the context of AP Stats. In addition, researchers will examine the extent to which students learn statistical concepts, computational fluency, and critical reasoning skills better with the online tools. \r\n\r\nThe resources developed by the project aim to enhance statistics learning through an integrated application of strategies previously documented to be effective: a focus on data visualization and representation, engaging students in meaningful investigations with complex real-world data sets, utilizing computational tools and techniques to analyze data, and better preparing educators for the needs of a more complex and technologically-rich mathematical landscape. This project will unite these lines of work into one streamlined pedagogical environment called CodeR4STATS with three kinds of resources: computing resources, datasets, and assessment resources. Computing resources will include freely available access to an instance of the cloud-based R-studio with custom help pages. Data resources will include over 800 scientific datasets from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Boston University, and Tufts University with several highlighted in case studies for students; these will be searchable within the online environment. Assessment and tutoring resources will be provided using the tutoring platform ASSISTments which uses example tracing to provide assessment, feedback, and tailored instruction. Teacher training and a teacher online discussion board will also be provided. Bringing these resources together will be programming lab activities, five real-world case studies, and sixteen statistics assignments linked to common core math standards. Researchers will use classroom observational case studies from three classrooms over two years, including cross-case comparison of lessons in the computational environment versus offline lessons; student and teacher interviews; and an analysis of learner data from the online system, especially the ASSISTments-based assessment data. This research will examine learning outcomes and help refine design principles for statistics learning environments.",

To do so, we introduced new features to the already popular STATS4STEM website for teaching, learning, and assessment using RStudio, a popular data analysis package. By making statistics education more computer-based, we hypothesized it would become more useful and engaging for students. Because R allows students to analyze larger datasets than they could otherwise, they can explore contemporary topics and data about the environment and social issues in which they may be personally invested. R is also a full-fledged programming language, providing students an opportunity to develop computational thinking skills and practices even if they are not enrolled in a computer science course. Combined with tutoring that the STAT4STEM platform provides, CodeR4STATS curriculum also allowed students to choose their own statistical topics and approaches, while still receiving guidance to be successful. Over the course of the project students explored environmental, social, and health data using a variety of methods including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and nonparametric methods.</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">The research component of this project used classroom-based and video methods to study how students approached and learned with CodeR4STATS tools and materials. We explored whether and how CodeR4STATS activities supported the development of (1) computational thinking and (2) statistics knowledge, and the degree to which students (3) demonstrated interest and agency in their data explorations. One major finding was that it was challenging for students to learn what they experienced as two subjects?computing and statistics?at the same time. One reason for this was that these subjects each come with different goals and problem-solving strategies. Sometimes, when students got stuck or encountered a problem in one discipline, they tried to apply solutions from on discipline. For instance, a student using the wrong statistical method for their data may try to address this issue by using debugging methods to diagnose why the method will not run, rather than reconsidering whether the statistical method itself is well suited for their goals. Another was that students may percieve themselves and each other as relatively more expert in one domain versus the other, which complicates group dynamics. These challenges led to interesting collaborative dynamics whereby students had to balance a number of at times conflicting goals, disciplinary values, and expertises. We found that successful groups navigated these challenges through explicitly discussing and agreeing on task goals. Building on social theories of cognition, we also identified a strategy that we termed \"secondary listening\" whereby students actively work to understand their peers' goals, especially when those goals are conflicting or not explicitly stated. Together these findings suggest that when using interdisciplinary activities in classrooms, instructors should encourage students explicitly discuss their goals and problem solving strategies frequently, as they relate to both domains.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">In addition to the theoretical and research-based contributions described above, the project has also yielded a number of practical contributions to teaching and learning.
