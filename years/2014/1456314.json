 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is important for the United States (U.S.) to maintain a leadership role in marine science, in accord with the Presidential Executive Order on ocean stewardship, the U.S. government?s Ocean Research Priorities Plan, and the goals of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)is strongly engaged in research related to climate change, biodiversity, and assessment of ocean resources and is building its portfolio in the human dimensions of marine research and management. The new strategic plan of ICES emphasizes science for sustainability, and its five Steering Groups focus on science to support ecosystem-based management, providing many opportunities for U.S. scientists to engage in collaborative international research. New initiatives directed to research in regional seas (e.g., the northwest Atlantic off the U.S and Canadian coasts), in the Arctic, and for sustainable aquaculture are examples of the new opportunities. NSF funding will insure that U.S. academic science can exercise both leadership potential in ICES and the ability to recruit young scientists into ICES activities. Funds also will help to insure that the academic community is well represented, balancing the strong input of U.S. governmental science, primarily through NOAA. \r\n\r\nSupport is provided for U.S. academic scientists to participate ICES activities. ICES is the leading intergovernmental organization conducting and coordinating marine science in the North Atlantic region. The recently evolved structure of ICES, with its emphasis on science to support sustainable, ecosystem-based management, and its continued reliance on the historical twin pillars of scientific inquiry and scientific advice, will assure that ICES remains at the forefront of marine science. Scientists from the United States of America (one of 20 signatory nations) have traditionally taken leadership roles in ICES science initiatives, which have in turn invigorated scientific inquiry in the USA. This proposal supports travel by U.S. academic scientists to promote participation in the ICES Annual Science Conference, its Working Groups and Workshops, Symposia, Theme Sessions, and Training Programs. Funds will be provided to worthy applicants, especially young and early-career scientists. The recent restructuring of ICES and its increased emphasis on science in the western Atlantic Ocean, climate science, Arctic research, and science to support ecosystem-based management have further increased the value of ICES to U.S. marine science interests.",
