 "awd_abstract_narration": "Directional dry etching constitutes a fundamental fabrication technique in the research and manufacturing of micro- and nanoscale devices. The proposal seeks funding to allow Columbia University to acquire an advanced etching system that allows for a diverse set of uses and will expand the range of a variety of current projects at Columbia, including projects related to nano-electronics, nanobiology and nano-neuro-biology, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and medical research. The equipment will also enable a range of future projects that are currently not possible, including lasers at the nanoscale level and a class of semiconductors known as III/V semiconductors. As a major upgrade to the shared Columbia Cleanroom -- currently the only shared cleanroom facility in the New York City metropolitan area --the etching system to be acquired will directly impact the educational and research activities of over 250 researchers (faculty, staff, and students) at Columbia and neighboring institutions. The group of co-Principal Investigators includes all the researchers who serve on the Cleanroom Board of Directors, representing an accumulation of experience in the successful installation and support of such equipment for a varied and evolving set of users. The facility also hosts graduate and undergraduate lecture and laboratory courses taught by the co-PIs, REUs and RETs, and independent study projects advised by faculty from many departments. Since nanopatterning is a central component of these courses, the requested etcher will directly impact the educational program of several departments, providing students with important skills for future careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe ICP RIE (inductively-coupled plasma, reactive ion etching) system described in this proposal will employ chlorine-based etch chemistries for vertical etching of compound semiconductors, metals, and organic materials. The new patterning capability and system will enable a range of future projects including nanoscale lasers and sensors based on III/V semiconductors. During operation of the etcher, recipes will be systematically developed to provide optimal results to all researchers. The Columbia University clean room is currently the only shared-access micro- and nano-fabrication facility in the metropolitan New York City area and serves a diverse population of academic users and small businesses. The facility has permanent technical and administrative support, and the proposed ICP RIE system will constitute a crucial facility of the available infrastructure for research training in nanoscale science and engineering. The tool will be used directly by students and post-doctoral researchers as part of their research activities, providing training in advanced nanopatterning techniques.",
