Undergraduates at six institutions from their junior year to their first year post-graduation will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative research.  The community of practice element will convene stakeholders at each partner institution who are invested in translating the results from this project into educational practice. A Professional Pathways Model that explains how students beliefs about their career options and their own abilities affect their career decisions will be proposed.",
