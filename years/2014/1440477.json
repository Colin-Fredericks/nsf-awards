 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Enabling Big Computing for Data Intensive Computing (EBCDIC) project upgrades the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) research Internet connectivity to 100 Gb and allow the redesign of the campus network to better support data-intensive computing.  As a first step,  UMBC is upgrading its Internet2 connection to  MidAtlantic Crossroads (MAX) Gigapop so that it can connect to the Internet2 Innovation Platform at the fastest speeds possible. Through the implementation of the science-DMZ, UMBC improves capacity and productivity in its collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the sharing of data for climate change investigation and weather prediction. In addition, the EBCDIC project greatly benefits the ECOSYNTH project, which is designed to support the use of 3D and spectral imagery data from a variety of low-altitude sensors.\r\n\r\nOnce UMBC completes its 100 Gb connection to the Internet2 Innovation Platform, the investigators can focus on the deployment of software-defined-networks (SDN) on campus. Through the use of SDN, UMBC seeks substantially improved connections of big-data projects that require extremely low latency times, including a neuroscience project that involves real-time processing and the monitoring of EEG data between users at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and UMBC. As the UMBC Cybersecurity Center prepares for increased participation in the Global Environment of Network Innovation (GENI) campus deployment of SDN also enables UMBC's recently-acquired ExoGeni infrastructure to advance cybersecurity efforts.",

Please refer to the UMBC scienceDMZ design to see our design.

The figure labelled DTN Transfer Speeds From UMBC to Pacific Platform show the results of regular tests.

Using the scienceDMZ we are getting approximately 7.5Gb of throughput and from inside the firewall we get under 4Gb. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We also worked with the Center for Hybrid and Multi-Core Productivity Research (CHMPR), an NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC). UMBC is the lead institution for CHMPR, which is led by UMBC professors Yelena Yesha and Milt Halem. To better enable CHMPR&rsquo;s work, Co-PI Don Engel and CI engineer Mike Petry worked closely with CHMPR to utilize the scienceDMZ so they can pursue their data-intensive projects. In fact, our work with CHMPR was so successful that UMBC has worked with its CHMPR partners to submit a letter of intent to the NSF&rsquo;s solicitation &ldquo;Towards a Leadership-Class Computing Facility.&rdquo; This LCC effort would not be possible without the advances we have made under this grant.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One of the academic sites of CHMPR is the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
