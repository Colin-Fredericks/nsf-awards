 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon his earlier work in developing parallel and adaptive immersed boundary (IB) methods for simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI), in this project, the investigator aims to construct a new hybrid FSI methodology which incorporates features of both the IB method and the immersed interface (II) method.  The IB method is a broadly-useful approach to FSI which has been applied to diverse problems in biological fluid dynamics.  Although the IB method has been demonstrated to be a useful approach to such problems, it is generally only first-order accurate, and fine spatial grids are therefore required to obtain resolved numerical simulations.  The II method is an IB-like approach to FSI which yields second-order accuracy for certain problems, but which is currently limited to thin elastic interfaces which are closed (i.e., which do not have free edges).  The hybrid FSI methodology of this project will incorporate features of both the IB and II methods to obtain high-order accuracy for both \"thick\" and \"thin\" elastic bodies, including thin elastic interfaces with free edges.  We believe that the basic version of the methodology will be the first IB-like method to achieve full second-order accuracy for thick elastic bodies such as the muscular walls of the heart, and that the extended version of the methodology will be the first II-like method to treat interfaces with free edges, such as the thin leaflets of the cardiac valves.  These new methods will be used to simulate cardiovascular flows, especially the fluid dynamics of the aortic heart valve.\r\n\r\nProblems in which a fluid flow interacts with an elastic structure, such as the writhing and coiling of DNA or, as addressed within this project, blood flow in the heart and vessels, are ubiquitous in engineering, biology, and medicine.  The immersed boundary (IB) method is a broadly-useful approach to such problems which was introduced to enable the computer simulation of the fluid dynamics of the heart and its valves.  Indeed, cardiovascular applications have motivated much work to develop mathematical and computational methods for FSI, and the large and growing number of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases (80 million people in the United States, approximately 30% of the population), such as coronary heart disease (16.8 million people) or heart failure (5.7 million people), make such applications increasingly important.  This project aims to develop an improved version of the IB method which will improve the accuracy of the methodology, possibly leading to significantly more realistic simulations of cardiovascular dynamics.  Because the IB approach is widely useful, and because the software implementing the methods of this project will be freely distributed, the potential impact of this work is quite broad, possibly affecting studies which aim to address basic scientific questions (e.g., the fluid-structure interactions which result in the beating of cilia within the oviduct or respiratory tract) to studies which aim to improve the design of medical therapies and devices (e.g., prosthetic cardiac valves or treatments for heart failure).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe immersed boundary (IB) method is a broadly-useful approach to modeling and simulating problems of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in which a structure or system of structures is immersed in a viscous, incompressible fluid.  These structures may be elastic, viscoelastic, or rigid, or they may move with prescribed deformational kinematics.  The IB method was introduced to describe cardiac fluid dynamics, but this method has subsequently been used to model and to simulate a variety of problems in biological fluid dynamics and, more generally, numerous problems in which an incompressible flow interacts with an immersed structure or a system of immersed structures.\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of the project is that it developed new versions of the IB method that leverage the additional geometrical information provided by finite element (FE) approximation schemes for the solid mechanics and dynamics to enable higher-order accurate IB methods.  Two schemes have been introduced; one incorporates features of the immersed interface (II) method to sharply impose pressure jump conditions, another employs a decomposition method to split discontinuous fields into continuous fields.  Although further work is still needed to sharply resolve all stress discontinuities at fluid-solid interfaces, both methods yield very substantial improvements in accuracy compared to the conventional IB method at a comparable cost because they avoid regularizing (or smoothing) pressure discontinuities, as is characteristic of most conventional IB methods.\n\n\nA major outcome of the project is that we have shown that the accuracy of the IB method for rigid-body FSI problems is highly sensitive to the distribution of the Lagrangian control points that determine the shape of the immersed body.  We have found that using tightly spaced control points, as is commonly done in almost all variants of the IB method, can induce spurious forces that have the effect of increasing the effective physical size of the immersed body (and thereby affecting quantities such as the lift and drag coefficients and vortex shedding frequency).  A startling finding, resulting from the work of this project, is that by using relatively coarse spacings of Lagrangian control points, the effective physical size of the immersed body becomes substantially closer to the actual size of the body, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulation withoutrequiring increased spatial resolution.\n\n\nVarious modeling applications have also been advanced in this project, especially in cardiac and cardiovascular mechanics.  We have demonstrated, for the first time, that the IB method is capable of computing accurate solid stresses in realistic models of cardiac muscle, and we have demonstrated that an IB/FE model of the aortic root is capable of yielding physiological and nearly grid-resolved pressures and flows in a large-scale three-dimensional model of aortic valve FSI.  The methods developed in this project are also being leveraged in ongoing work to develop models of heart valve prostheses as are used in novel therapies such as transcatheter valve replacement.\n\n\nAn important broader impact of the project is that the methods developed in this research are incorporated into open-source software, IBAMR, that is freely available.
