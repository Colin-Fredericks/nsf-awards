This travel grant will support an estimated twenty-five travelers to the 2014 C3E workshop.  The results of this workshop will be widely disseminated in the open literature. Additionally, this workshop and its challenge problems will create excellent opportunity for students to engage with leaders in the field in the context of unsolved problems.",

This funded effort focuses on providing travel support for a diverse community of participants in the C3E workshop. The most recent meeting, held in October 2015 at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, focused on attribution and on active response to threats. Speakers included ADM Michael Rogers, Director NSA and Commander, U.S. Cyber Command, Prof. David Brumley, Carnegie Mellon CyLab, and Finn Ramsland from Fire Eye / Mandiant, among others. Colleagues attending the invitational C3E workshops number about 50 and are drawn from multiple disciplines and backgrounds, ranging from systems assurance and applied cryptography to intelligence analysis and social psychology. The C3E workshop facilitates interactions among disciplines and backgrounds, which is important because cybersecurity is unavoidably multi-disciplinary.
