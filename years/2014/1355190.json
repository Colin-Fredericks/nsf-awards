 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea slugs of the genus Sacoglossa exhibit an array of unusual traits that may confer an evolutionary advantage.  For example, some sea slugs species are 'solar-powered,' like plants, as they can harvest and sequester functional photosynthetic chloroplasts after feeding on algae. This kleptoplastic ability, along with other traits, may account for their high diversification rate and species richness.  In this project, the researchers will combine genetic, anatomic, ecological and developmental studies to describe over 100 new species of sea slugs. Modeling will then identify factors that determine how species are distributed, and what makes some sacoglossans more ecologically and evolutionary diverse than others. \r\n\r\nMarine biodiversity is increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change, yet actual biodiversity richness is not reflected by the scientific names in many groups, hampering conservation efforts. Anti-cancer compounds have been isolated from some saccoglossans, and others have served as biological control agents for invasive algae, but taxonomic uncertainty has limited the potential for their use in these roles.  To fully leverage an improved understanding of this biodiversity resource, this project will train the next generation of taxonomists at two Hispanic and predominantly undergraduate serving institutions and during an international workshop, develop web-based resources, and provide new insight into factors that govern diversity in marine ecosystems.",
