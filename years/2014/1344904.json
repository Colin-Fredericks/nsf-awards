 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop printing technologies for fully printed single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin-film transistor (TFT) backplanes by aerosol jet printing ultra-pure semiconducting SWCNT ink and gold nanoparticle ink as channel materials and electrodes on flexible substrates, respectively.  The new trend in display products is driving the needs of printed TFT backplanes.  This project will leverage currently developed aerosol jet printing technologies to implement fully printed SWCNT TFT backplane, utilizing the innovative direct-write and aerodynamic focusing technology to produce high resolution features down to 10microns on non-planar substrates. The printing technology also reduces the manufacturing cost and environmental impact, and increases fabrication size with high throughput. The advance of ultra-pure semiconducting SWCNTs has remarkably improved the performances of SWCNT TFTs to now be superior to other mature and available transistors made of polysilicon, amorphous silicon, metal oxide and organic materials.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is fully printed SWCNT TFT backplanes of low operation voltage, fast refreshing speed and high contrasting currents that will open opportunities to applications and products in flat-panel displays, and will impact a plethora of low cost consumer electronics products like mobiles, GPS, PDA and TVs.  Especially, fully printed SWCNT TFT backplanes on flexible substrates can expedite shifting display markets to printed flexible devices. Using ultra-pure semiconducting SWCNTs as active materials, the company's TFTs exhibit transparency, flexibility, environmental stability and mechanical strength.  The fully printed SWNCT TFT backplanes will overcome many limitations current display backplanes.",

The devices were characterized on Keithley 4200 SCS showing high conductance of 0.1 mA and decent ON/OFF ratio &gt;10<sup>5</sup> under sub-2 voltages (<strong>Image 3</strong>). We are able to sequentially print gold conductive bottom lines, then print polyimide patches, and then print gold conductive top lines to form gold grids insulated by polyimides patches (<strong>Image 4</strong>).

To integrate the developed printing technologies into industrial manufacturing lines, we successfully achieved printed SWCNT TFT on photolithography patterned electrodes (<strong>Image 6</strong>). These accomplishments demonstrated that super pure single chirality (6,5) SWCNTs can replace low temperature polycrystalline silicon, and metal oxide materials in display industry. The current gold standard in the TFT backplane market is the low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS).

Japan Display, Sharp, AUO, LG Display, Samsung, CBS outdoor, BOE, and other Chinese FPD makers majorly focus on LTPS TFT backplanes.
