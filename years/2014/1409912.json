 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The project addresses the science that underpins the reversible switch from insulating to metallic behavior in extremely thin vanadium dioxide.  The goal of this research is to determine what happens at the nanometer scale during the thermally driven transition, and how to control it.  Understanding and controlling transitions between the various possible phases of vanadium dioxide will enable advances to be made in the development of energy-efficient computers, and smart windows that regulate the heating and cooling of buildings.  Extended international visits to Bremen University in Germany to perform experiments complement the development of joint on-line courses between universities in Binghamton and Bremen.  Undergraduate researchers from underrepresented minorities are involved with the research activities, including dedicated field trips to national research facilities, such as Brookhaven National Laboratory.  A K-12 educational outreach to attract younger students to science and engineering employs on-line video demonstrations and infographics.\r\n \r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The abrupt metal insulator transition of vanadium dioxide is an archetypal example of the complex interplay between the electrons and the lattice. A structural phase transition accompanies the electronic transition, which can be triggered by small thermal perturbations near room temperature. Additional phases are expected to exist during the transition or may be stabilized by strained thin films. However, the exact nature and presence of these phases is a hot topic of debate. The advent of high quality ultrathin films, newly developed nanoscale spectromicroscopy techniques, and recent sophisticated computational studies present an ideal opportunity to explore these phases. Nanoscale resolution spectromicroscopy techniques can determine exactly and simultaneously the electronic and geometric configurations in phase-separated regions that coexist through the phase transitions of vanadium dioxide. The research objective is to determine whether the structural and electronic phase transitions in nanoscale vanadium dioxide are intrinsically decoupled, as suggested by the presence of intermediate states, or whether the material can be tailored to be so by strain and doping.  Measured parameters, such as lattice constants, density of states, and vanadium coordination are used as inputs and constraints for band structure calculations of vanadium dioxide.  Students, at both the graduate and undergraduate level, are being trained in cutting-edge low-energy/photoelectron electron microscopy and small-spot X-ray spectroscopy at national research facilities in the US and abroad.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground: Current silicon based devices for computing are nearing their limit.  Metal oxides display more functionality than silicon and are expected to replace it in the next-generation of electronics.   By growing thin metal oxide films on top of similar materials to stretch and compress their dimensions, it is possible to engineer new properties in these thin films.  Understanding how and why these properties evolve with strain (or \"strain-engineering\") is a major research activity in the field of materials science to better understand this important class of materials.  \n\n Motivation: In this project, we employed a model material system to investigate the effects of strain-engineering.  In its bulk form, vanadium dioxide (VO2) displays an abrupt transition near room temperature switching between insulating and metal phases.  The mechanism describing this transition has been hotly debated since its discovery in the 1950s.  By strain-engineering VO2 thin films, it is possible to change temperature of the transition.  The main objective of this project was to determine why.\n\nIntellectual merit: A combination of high quality strain-engineered thin films of VO2 and highly bright x-rays at dedicated National Facilities (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) were employed in this project.  The interface between the VO2 thin film and scaffold material underneath required to maintain the strain was found to play an important role in dictating the behavior of the films.  In films with abrupt atomically-sharp interfaces, it was possible to observe reversible switching behavior in VO2 as thin as 1 nanometer! By strain-engineering the VO2 films it was possible to stabilize an additional insulator phase expected to exist.  However, further inspection revealed that this third phase was significantly less stable than predicted from thermodynamics alone.  Strain-engineering in a specific manner was found to increase electron-electron correlations within the material.  As a result, this is an exquisite example of engineering electron correlation strength without changing the chemistry of the material i.e. bona-fide strain-engineering quantum materials!  Our model to describe this effect provided insight into the underlying mechanism driving the transition of bulk VO2.  Moreover, these studies have provided material scientists new directions towards realizing the full potential of metal oxide electronics (refer to attached Figure).\n\nBroader impact: Our work relied upon international collaborations within the UK (Diamond Light Source) and Germany (Bremen University), with extended student visits and exchanges for experiments and training that they would not have had otherwise.  To explain our result in a broader educational format, we worked with graphic design students to develop infographics and online educational videos (refer to attached Figures).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Louis Piper"
