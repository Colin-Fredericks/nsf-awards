 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops and field-tests a mathematics-specific coaching protocol centered on the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) instrument, a Common Core-aligned observational tool. The coaching model will consist of three elements: a summer training workshop, personalized web-based coaching, and access to a library of resources to support coaching and instructional change. The project team works with 3rd through 8th grade mathematics teachers to implement and evaluate the coaching model, randomly assigning teachers to treatment and control conditions, stratifying on grade level. The project team evaluates the effect of the coaching model in both the concurrent and post-intervention year, as past studies have found effects only after teachers have completed the full cycle of coaching (Allen et al. 2011; Campbell & Malkus, 2011). The primary outcome measures include teachers' classroom performance as captured by the MQI, students' perceptions of their teachers' effectiveness, and student test scores.\r\nThis study supports the development of a subject-specific and Common Core-aligned coaching protocol. Moreover, it provides further experimental evidence on the effect of web-based coaching, and the first evidence on a subject-specific coaching tool. This information advances the field?s understanding of the potential value in shifting resources from more traditional professional development programs to web-based coaching. \r\nThe increasing demands being placed on teachers by new evaluation systems and the adoption of the Common Core has created a growing need for content-specific coaching models. If this web-based coaching model proves successful, it could be widely adopted by districts to supplement the generic evaluation feedback teachers receive in most large-scale evaluation systems. It would also allow individualized feedback for teachers who concentrate in mathematics, including elementary mathematics specialists and middle school math teachers.",

Under NSF support, this project developed and evaluated a coaching program that uses the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) observation instrument to structure teachers&rsquo; and coaches&rsquo; reflections on and conversations about mathematics instruction. These conversations centered on three MQI dimensions: &nbsp;[1] <em>Richness of the mathematics</em>, which captures the presence of disciplinary practices such as mathematical generalizations and multiple solution methods as well as mathematical sense-making activities;<em> </em>[2] <em>Common Core-Aligned Student Practices</em>, which captures students&rsquo; mathematical reasoning, explanations, communication, and the cognitive demand of classroom tasks; and [3] <em>Working With Students and Mathematics</em>, which captures teachers&rsquo; use of student ideas and teachers&rsquo; remediation of student misconceptions. Based on this focus, we expected treatment teachers&rsquo; instruction to become more disciplinarily rich and involve more student thinking, reasoning, and communication. We similarly expected student outcomes to improve as a result of the program.</p>\n<p>We conducted a randomized field trial to evaluate whether this was the case, examining a range of teacher and student outcomes during both the coaching implementation year as well as a follow-up year, when teachers no longer received MQI coaching. A total of 142 math teachers participated in the study, recruited from the third through eighth grades across two districts &ndash; urban and suburban &ndash; in a Midwestern state. During the implementation year, teachers videotaped themselves and shared those videos with remote coaches, as outlined in Steps 1 through 3 of Figure 1. A key part of our model was the virtual conversations in Step 4. There, coaches and teachers reviewed and scored &ldquo;stock&rdquo; clips from the MQI video library, a process designed to help teachers recognize and begin to understand key mathematical and pedagogical practices. Then coaches and teachers moved to a discussion of how the stock video teacher could have &ldquo;elevated&rdquo; her MQI score. The coach then asked the teacher to reflect on her own clips, and the process of analysis and elevation repeated itself. Coaches encouraged teachers to take the lead, directing their own learning and solving their own problems of practice</p>\n<p>We find a pattern of results common to the professional development literature&mdash;sizable positive effects on teachers&rsquo; instructional practices, more modest effects on students&rsquo; perception of instructional quality, but no detectable effects on student achievement. Consistent with the theory of action behind MQI Coaching, the program approximately doubled the incidence of teachers recognizing MQI-related instructional elements in stock clips. This large effect is sustained even a year after teachers had stopped working with their coach. In the implementation year, coaching also improved students&rsquo; perceptions about the quality of their teachers&rsquo; instruction by over one fifth of a standard deviation. Effects on students&rsquo; perceptions of instructional quality are attenuated and no longer statistically significant in the follow-up year. However, we do find large effects teachers&rsquo; videotaped instruction that follow-up year. Conditional on teacher characteristics, we estimate that MQI Coaching increased the probability a teacher would score a mid or high on a given segment for <em>Richness</em> by 9.6% (<em>p</em>=.001), a 37% increase over the control-group mean of 26%.&nbsp; We saw a 7% increase on <em>Working With Students</em> (<em>p</em>=.049), which translates to a 15% increase over the control-group mean of 46%. Finally, we saw a 9.2% percentage point increase (<em>p</em>=.001) for <em>Common Core-Aligned Student Practices</em>, or a 35% increase over the control-group mean of 26%.</p>\n<p>To assess program impact on student achievement, we collected student performance data on both state standardized tests and district-administered diagnostic tests in math, including the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test developed by the Northwest Evaluation Association.
