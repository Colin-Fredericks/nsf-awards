An interdisciplinary discussion of critical developments in the geoscience applications of fine-particle magnetism, and their fundamental physical foundations, will help to advance our understanding of Earth's surface environment and its deep interior. This award will provide partial support to hold a Conference on Rock Magnetism and its Applications, June 26-29, 2014 in Santa Fe NM, continuing a biennial series of such conferences. St. John's\r\nCollege will serve as the venue.  Support will help cover the facility-use costs and to provide partial coverage of participant travel expenses (full coverage for invited plenary speakers and on-campus accommodations for other participants).",
