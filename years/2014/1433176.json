 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water conservation technologies and policies are increasingly adopted for agriculture in semi-arid environments as demand increases while supplies dwindle.  The roll-out of these devices is tied to a broader trend in water policy that advocates a \"water soft path\" (WSP), or the use of flexible technologies and demand-management policies for environmental and social sustainability.  This project investigates the roll-out of this WSP, the adoption of WSP, and socio-economic outcomes for rural communities. Although WSP has been advocated and implemented widely, there is little existing research on the processes and outcomes of WSP projects as it relates to user access to water resources, particularly for agricultural production in rural areas. This project contributes to research and education integration because the researchers will share data and results with water managers.  It promotes training and learning, as data from the project will roll into learning modules for undergraduate courses and geography courses at an international baccalaureate certified secondary school.  Furthermore, the project trains a doctoral student in data collection, analysis, and scientific outreach.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates how the water soft path creates new pathways of accessing and using water resources that contribute to larger processes of social and political change in the countryside.  The working hypothesis for this research is that irrigation-efficiency devices and the institutional framework supporting them provide new pathways for some farmers to access to water resources for agricultural production. This project addresses the major research question through an empirical case study of water-soft path in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, a major agricultural exporter to the United States. The research design uses a reproducible mixed-method approach, including interviews, participant observation, questionnaires, and surveys. This project will: (1) Describe how WSP emerged in response to scientific and regional discourses of water scarcity; (2) Examine the mechanisms required to gain access to and benefit from irrigation efficiency devices in the countryside; and (3) Explain how irrigation efficiency devices offer farmers opportunities to respond to water scarcity and continue cultivating land under conditions of climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the twentieth century, central governments managed water through large-scale infrastructure projects (i.e. dams, irrigation canals, and central plumbing networks) in order to increase the supply and geographical availability of freshwater resources.  Water experts advocate for an alternative paradigm for the twenty-first century, referred to as the water soft path, to encourage demand management through conservation technologies.  This project investigates how rural producers transition to the water soft path, and the consequences of this transition for producers? access to water and land resources.  Specifically, we analyze the social, political, and biophysical mechanisms that enable rural producers to gain access to and benefit from conservation technologies. \n\nWe draw on theoretical and methodological tools in political ecology to historically and geographically contextualize the transition to the water soft path.  This project uses a mixed methods case study approach to examine the implementation of the WSP for groundwater irrigation in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato.  This site was chosen because, starting in the 1980s, the central government of Mexico rolled out policy tools to monitor and curb rates of freshwater extraction.  Guanajuato has been a focus of these efforts given the importance of agriculture for the culture and economy of the state, as well as the declining availability of groundwater resources within the state. \n\nResults show that the water soft path emerged in response to water scarcity, but also as part of a broader package of political economic reform that entailed the rescripting of state-led environmental governance. In other words, the emergence of the water soft path has been shaped by the continuing existence of twentieth century political and infrastructural tools of water management.  Consequently, the state has enforced principles of demand management without devolving control over natural resources to water users. The contradiction of state power exacerbates biophysical, economic, and political uncertainties that threaten groundwater irrigators? ability to produce and in turn maintain control over land and water resources.  Farmers who can access irrigation efficiency devices, such as drip irrigation, are better able mitigate these uncertainties.  Access to these devices, however, is not equally available to all irrigators, which threatens to consolidate land and water access to a few producers.\n\nOur project builds on current work in political ecology, a subfield of geography and spatial sciencies, by integrating access theory from the field of agrarian studies with materially grounded studies in urban political ecology.  Therefore, we utilize technology as the central point of analysis empirically and theoretically.  We look at material changes in the sociotechnical landscape as a lens for assessing processes of resource access and sociopolitical transformation.  Consequently, while many studies examine land and water as a mechanism of technology access, we examine technological change as a mechanism of land and water access. \n\nThis project benefits society because it describes the mechanisms through which WSP is applied in rural areas, and particularly among agricultural producers. This is crucial because WSP is currently being recommended as the future of water policy for the U.S. and other countries in Latin America, and agricultural production represents the highest water demand by sector in many of these countries. Despite divergent histories and political economic contexts, this project helps identify specific mechanisms that lead to technology choice and water scarcity responses and thus provides insight into these processes outside of Mexico. \n\nFunding for this project assisted with data collection and the communication of results.  Data collection involved long-term fieldwork, such as interviews and surveys with farmers, as well as participation observation.  Lee (co-PI) communicated findings at several conferences within the United States.  Funding also enabled the completion of a doctoral degree for Lee (co-PI).  Further details of findings are available in Lee?s doctoral dissertation, and will be made more widely available through publication in peer-reviewed journals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Heather Lee"
