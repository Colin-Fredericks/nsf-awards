 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frontier Probability Days 2014 is a three day conference to be held at The University of Arizona, in Tucson, May 18 - 20, 2014.  The purpose of the meeting is to bring together leading regional and national researchers in probability theory and its applications, graduate students and others, to foster interactions and stimulate research activity in this area.  The format consists of 7 plenary talks and several shorter presentations. The plenary speakers represent a spectrum of leading work in probability and its applications.  Topics of interest for the conference include disordered and interacting systems, random matrices, stochastic analysis and probabilistic applications to biology and dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThis conference meets approximately once every two years in the Intermountain West of the United States.  This is the fourth meeting of the conference.  The previous three meetings ran successfully in 2007 (Boulder), 2009 (Salt Lake City) and 2011 (Salt Lake City).  Roughly, 40 outside participants are expected to come to Tucson for the conference.  Much of the NSF support will be allocated to students and junior researchers.  A special feature of the conference is its attention to \"applications of probability.\"  Part of the intent of the meeting is to help broaden participation with other fields, a source of inspiration for both more applied and theoretical aspects of probability research. \r\n\r\nConference website:  math.arizona.edu/~fpd/",
