 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a diverse range of application areas--including astronomical\r\nimaging, microscopy, wireless communications, radar, sonar, and\r\nmany others--one must confront the problem of estimating or\r\nextracting information from a signal that is governed by a small\r\nnumber of unknown (continuous-valued) parameters. Customized to\r\neach of these applications, unique methods for handling these\r\nunknown parameters have been proposed in the past. This research\r\ninvolves the development of a unified framework for addressing\r\nproblems in all of these areas systematically, efficiently, with\r\nawareness of the fundamental limits, and with provable accuracy.\r\n\r\nThere are two main components of this framework. The first\r\ncomponent involves the development of models where the signals of\r\ninterest lie within or close to a subspace or a union of subspaces.\r\nIn the case where the underlying parameters for the signal are\r\ncontinuous-valued, this is a challenging task. Rather than attempt\r\nto simply discredit these problems (a program potentially fraught\r\nwith difficulty), this research involves the development of finite\r\napproximations for a locally infinite range of subspaces using\r\nefficient local subspace fits whose dimensions match the effective\r\nnumber of local degrees of freedom. The second component of this\r\nframework consists of techniques for identifying the range of\r\nsubspaces responsible for generating a signal from a set of\r\ndiscrete observations, confronting difficulties posed by the\r\ncoherence, by the continuous nature of the parameter space, and by\r\nthe fact that some signals may be synthesized from a narrow (but\r\ncontinuously-indexed and therefore infinite) range of subspaces.\r\nThese components combine to enable the efficient acquisition,\r\nprocessing, and estimation of signals arising from the\r\nparameterized subspaces model.",
