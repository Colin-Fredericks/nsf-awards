 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help in envisioning the next generation of learning technologies and advancing what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that showed the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and project teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and to answer questions about how people learn with technology. An important issue in education is encouraging learners to engage in sustained inquiry around important content and helping them to continually refine their understandings. Technology already exists to help communities of learners (e.g., those in a class) keep track of the ideas they are generating and refining. The innovation in this project will help groups of learners make two kinds of connections: (i) between the different discussions they are having across topical areas and (ii) between the ideas they are discussing and those that groups in other classes are discussing. The project team's earlier Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) project showed that such connections gives rise to curiosity and new learning goals as well as deeper understanding. It is expected that technology that makes these connections easier to identify will also make it easier for students to refer back to what they learned in previous years' classes and to refine their earlier understandings. \r\n\r\nKnowledge building is the collaborative refinement of ideas by a community. The goal in knowledge building is to engage learners in sustained inquiry and progressive discourse through which ideas are continually developed and refined, giving rise to higher-level learning goals. The aim in this project is to design and build support for knowledge building across communities and across time, connecting communities into a shared field in which shared bases of knowledge co-advance with each other and across communities (e.g., across classes addressing similar issues; across years of school). Students kick off their inquiry by importing productive idea threads from other classrooms as inquiry starters, then co-review with others, access others' ideas as they move forward, and engage in live interactions with partnering communities. The knowledge building platform being developed for use across communities is called CITY (Connecting Idea Threads or Youth).  Automated analysis developed during the previous Cyberlearning EXP project helps groups within a single class visualize their idea threads and thread idea threads with each other.  The automated process is being extended with language processing algorithms that can identify conversations in other communities that have potential to be useful in extending a group's understanding.   The project team, which includes experts in collaborative learning, computational linguistics, and self-regulation, is aiming to learn how to make the technology work across communities, to understand how to use such technology to sustain engagement with and refinement of ideas, and the qualities the surrounding socio-technical system needs to have for such sustained and distributed knowledge building to happen.",

As the technology innovation,&nbsp; this project created a cross-classroom, collaborative online platform: Idea Thread Mapper (ITM, see <a href=\"https://idea-thread.net/\">https://idea-thread.net/</a>). ITM interoperates with Knowledge Forum and potentially other collaborative learning systems. New features in ITM provide (a) <em>metacognitive support </em>for making collective progress visible in online discourse to enhance students? reflective and connected efforts for continual idea advancement (see Figures 1-4), and (b) <em>boundary-crossing support </em>for connecting student-generated knowledge between different classrooms (see Figures 5-6). A set of learning analytics and visualizations is embedded in the online collaboration space to feedback on shared inquiry directions, progress, and idea connections. ITM-enabled educational designs support students? collaborative dialogues in their own classroom with broader idea exchanges across classrooms. While members of each classroom continually investigate various problems and deepen their understandings, they selectively synthesize and share major knowledge progress and challenges in a cross-community (cross-database) meta-space, &nbsp;which is shared among a distributed network of classrooms that work on challenging problems in the same or related curriculum areas.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>Fostering collaborative dialogues for creative inquiry among students represents a significant educational challenge.

The ITM software system showcases a set of new designs of collaborative online environments, incorporating online supports for group metacognition and cross-boundary collaboration. Such supports are essential to sustaining student-driven collaborative knowledge building over longer terms and at higher social levels. Long-term design-based research in a set of Grades 3-6 classrooms generated rich findings, suggesting that:</p>\n<p>(a) ITM-enabled educational support can enhance student reflective efforts for co-organizing collaborative inquiry over time, leading to more productive and connected dialogues and deeper scientific understandings;</p>\n<p>(b) Students as young as 5th-graders are able to use ITM to synthesize their knowledge advances for cross-classroom sharing, enabling mutual learning and idea connection across the boundaries of different classrooms and cohort groups; And</p>\n<p>(c) Conferencing with the diverse ideas and expertise from the different classrooms with ITM support can help students broaden and enrich their knowledge, reflect on the different perspectives, and further connect the distributed expertise to investigate challenging issues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>This project has created new collaboration tools and classroom designs that are needed to sustain student-driven collaborative learning in each classroom and to further scale it to broader networks of classrooms.
