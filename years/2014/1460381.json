 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site of Utqia&#289;vik is the source from which the modern community of Barrow developed. It has been subject to archaeological investigations at several periods (Ford 1959:67-73, Hall 1990:8-30), culminating in the multi-year Utkiavik Project (Dekin 1990, Hall and Fullerton 1990. Despite this extensive excavation history, there are only nine C14 dates from the entire site. A number of archaeological samples that had been retained at Binghamton University, Dekin's home institution, when the main collection was returned to the North Slope Borough have recently been rediscovered. Binghamton wishes to return these samples to NSB or dispose of them. Currently, the Inupiat Heritage Center (IHC) Artifact Storage Facility in Barrow, where the original artifacts are stored and the natural repository of this previously unknown sample collection, does not have enough storage space to accept and properly store the discovered samples. This RAPID project will provide the funds to purchase a freezer for segregated storage of the samples that need to remain frozen until processed. The samples include organic items, bulk samples of indeterminate nature that may contain artifacts, and items retained as C14 samples, included logs and grass.  In addition, the project will include the processing and analysis of organic samples and the preparation and proper curation of any artifacts that may be found in the bulk samples.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of Binghamton excavations at the Utqia?vik village site (now part of modern Barrow) in the early 1980s were the largest ever carried out in North Alaska using modern excavation techniques. The project excavated six mounds containing multiple houses, a qargi (ceremonial center) and several tent platforms, as well as some areas outside of structures.   To understand how the settlement developed over time, it was crucial to have dates for the different\n\nThe plan was to use a technique called thermoluminescence (TL) dating of pottery fragments, and dates of historic artifacts to determine how old different levels were.  Sadly, TL dating did not work at all, apparently since the pottery was not heated enough when it was made to \"set the TL clock.\"  This left only artifact types to help researchers figure out in what order the various houses and other structures were built, and what was in use at the same time.  Unfortunately, not many of the types of precontact artifacts they used were dated by other methods, and recent work has shown that they are not as reliable as once thought. The lack of good dates at Utqia?vik makes comparisons with the results of major new projects now being carried out in the Kotzebue Sound area nearly useless.\n\nSo it is important to try to date the site by other techniques.  Radiocarbon dating has made great strides in overcoming some issues that were identified in the early 1980s, so that was the logical approach.  There is a large existing collection of artifacts, including a number of diagnostic items. However, almost all artifacts in the collection had been treated with chemicals for  conservation, which made them unsuitable for dating.   \n\nThen some samples were found in a freezer in Binghamton, which had never been treated.  This collection of samples was the only realistic chance of getting additional dates from Utqia?vik from controlled excavation.  Sometimes items erode from the bluff but the lack of context for such finds makes them much less informative. An existing residential neighborhood covers the unexcavated part of the site, so further archaeology there is unlikely.  Binghamton offered to send the samples back to Barrow, but the Inupiat Heritage Center had no way to store frozen samples.\n\nThis grant covered a freezer to store the samples, time for processing the samples and the cost of radiocarbon dating.  The sample processing turned out to be more time consuming than the expected.  Many of the samples turned out to be large lumps of frozen congealed marine mammal oil (with the consistency of caramel when thawed) containing a large variety of delicate organic materials.  Aggressive heating or use of chemicals would destroy the organics or make them useless for dating.  We did a series of experiments on split test samples to learn the most efficient way of proceeding.  In the end, thawing under a fume hood (due to odor issues), then saving a small sample of the oily material for possible future studies, followed by 20-40 warm water baths with Dawn dishwashing liquid to dissolve the rest of the oily material, flushing the remaining material with purified water, and then going through the sample under magnification, separating out each of the different types of material, proved to be the best method.  It was far more labor intensive than estimated.  Fortunately, we had several people volunteer to help with sample processing and sorting during down time from their projects, so we were able to process most samples.\n\nSome of the samples turned out to have problems (like possible diesel contamination, noted on the sample bag but not in the catalog) which made them poor choices for radiocarbon dating.  The radiocarbon dates we have gotten, all from the qargi, fall between 1415-1455 AD, and 1660-1880 AD (most likely before 1815 AD).  This confirms that the structure was in use for centuries.\n\nWe found several different kinds of organic remains, including plants and hair, which can ..."
