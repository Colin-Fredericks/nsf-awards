 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Shannon Tushingham, David Gang, and Jelmer Eerkens will advance residue extraction and chemical fingerprinting techniques to identify psychoactive plant use in the past. The research will provide archaeologists with a new set of analytical tools that may be applied in similar studies investigating the spread and use of ritual and medicinal psychoactive plants in the ancient Americas and beyond. Development of least invasive methods will increase the potential data set of archaeological specimens. Application of metabolomics research is a new avenue in archaeology that has the potential to develop a panel of molecular (metabolite) markers for the analysis of archaeological specimens. \r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary team of archaeologists and analytical chemists will employ mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and metabolomics research tools to chemically profile smoke plants and medicinal teas, develop methods where plant biomarkers are identified from archaeological artifacts, and test assumptions concerning use of psychoactive plants in ancient societies. Chemical analysis of alkaloid residue extracted from archaeological artifacts provides a means to track past plant use and has great potential. However, methodological development in controlled laboratory settings is in its infancy. The purpose of conducting laboratory experiments is to better understand how to extract residues from ancient artifacts. A specific concern is to address basic gaps in methods and understanding how the biochemical signature of a particular plant changes through the cooking and/or smoking process as well as archaeological preservation. The intent is to establish the least invasive chemical profiling/analysis methods possible that can be used on artifacts, while at the same time producing a sufficient amount of biochemical data where residues can confidently be identified and contribute to archaeological study.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearchers include three advanced scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate assistants who will participate in the experimental, evaluative, and publication phases and participate in interdisciplinary seminars. They will disseminate results at the international, national, and local level through professional and public publications, presentations, a museum exhibit, a mobile display, and an educational website including podcasts and videos.",

Our team tested a wide range of plants&mdash;grown from seed in WSU greenhouses or collected in the field or research arboretums&mdash;on their own and in experimental artifacts. Because cooking and smoking processes alter the plant residue chemistry, it is critical to understand how these dynamics work in controlled laboratory settings. Our experiments involved testing different solvent systems, mass spec platforms, and extraction protocols. The research established a universal solvent system and extraction methods that may be applied to identify a range of smoke and drink planks used by ancient peoples.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">We successfully identified plant residues in a wide range of archaeological materials. For example, we identified nicotine in pipes from in Nez Perce ancestral territory and reported in a paper entitled &ldquo;Biomolecular archaeology reveals ancient origins of indigenous tobacco smoking in North American Plateau&rdquo; (Tushingham et al 2018). Another recent study includes organic residue analysis of pipe from Ohio (Marley et al 2018), and other studies cited below.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">Another major innovation involves the identification nicotine residues in ancient dental calculus from ancient burial populations in a study conducted in collaboration with central California indigenous communities (Eerkens et al. 2018). This represents a major breakthrough in residue studies as it allows researchers to investigate ancient use of psychoactive plants <em>on the individual level</em>, which promises to significantly expand our understanding of use dynamics of people of varied ages, sexes and status. Another exciting development is the ability to identify tobacco to the <em>species level </em>through advanced metabolomics techniques (Brownstein et al. in prep).</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">Students were involved in all phases of research, from laboratory experiments, to course work, to research and writing. Tushingham established and taught a new WSU graduate course (Experimental Archaeology and Residue Analysis), taught in 2015, 2016, 2018. All students have projects that investigate a wide range of topics&mdash;from ancient coffee consumption in Ethiopia to Cacao fermentation practices in Central America&mdash;and present results at conferences. Student research also includes Korey Brownstein&rsquo;s PhD dissertation (Molecular Plant Sciences), William Damitio&rsquo;s MA thesis (Anthropology), and Charles Snyder&rsquo;s PhD thesis (Anthropology).</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">The research team presented numerous papers at national and international conferences and at public events, established GIS database of pipes and biocultural data (see Damito 2018) and established a curation freezer and database for research samples. Other pipe and dental calculus research from locations in the Americas are ongoing, and this work includes a significant expansion of dental calculus studies from individuals in pre-contact central California sites and Chile, South America. Our work on the GIS database of archaeological pipes and collaborative research with Native American and First Nations Tribal communities is ongoing.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">Broader impacts include advancing cutting edge technologies to investigate the history of psychoactive plant use, including establishing a new field in ancient metabolomics studies. Perhaps because of the subject matter and the techniques used, we have found tremendous public interest in the study. Importantly, the study promotes understanding of the cultural context and ancient nature of psychoactive plant use. For example, we collaborated with the Nez Perce tribe to better document traditional tobacco use, and this information can be incorporated into culturally relevant tobacco cessation programs for American Indian groups. There is a growing awareness among public health professionals that such culturally informed programs are often the best means of combatting health disparities, recreational tobacco use, and tobacco related disease among many communities. Information about the history and context of traditional indigenous tobacco use that highlights its sacred and ritual nature, and contrasts it with recreational commercial tobacco, is being integrated by Tribal and public health programs like the &ldquo;Keep Tobacco Sacred&rdquo; program.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">In sum, through NSF research we developed a new set of analytical tools that may be applied in similar studies investigating the spread and use of ritual and medicinal psychoactive plants in the ancient Americas and beyond.
