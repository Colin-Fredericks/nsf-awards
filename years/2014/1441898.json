This annual international conference is being held in the US for the first time in a decade and will span a wide range of topics including chemical separation techniques, materials science, and thermal and solar energy conversion that are of interest to CMP researchers. Many of the topics covered in this conference will address the key research challenges facing the community at large, such as inhomogeneity of carbon synthesis, toxicity, and utilization of carbon nanotubes in large integrated circuits. The conference will attract a broad audience, which includes world leaders in nanotube and carbon physics and condensed-matter physics (including several Nobel Laureates), emerging academic stars, and young researchers at graduate and early post-graduate levels.",
