 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together a dynamic and creative group of faculty from the University of Wisconsin-Stout to create an 8-week interdisciplinary REU site targeting first generation and underrepresented minority students. Students and faculty engage in a holistic apprentice-style training model with the overall theme of studying phosphorus pollution in a highly impacted Wisconsin watershed. The team studies inclusive decision-making, social networks among farmers, responsive policy implementation, economic impacts, land-use effects on phosphorus run-off, remediation strategies, and sediment geochronology. Data are integrated into a comprehensive strategy for economically sustainable phosphorus use. Students and faculty participate in professional development programming, interdisciplinary data sharing, and original research activities designed to empower and prepare students for science\r\ncareers. Ultimately, this investment in human capital will help produce a workforce trained in interdisciplinary and collaborative thinking necessary to solve 21st century problems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\n\r\nThis work offers significant intellectual contributions by improving student learning and development in response to research experiences, creating innovative approaches to manage the training and professional development of students and faculty in interdisciplinary research, and understanding the complex processes contributing to phosphorus pollution while developing\r\nsustainable solutions. These efforts dovetail nicely with an ongoing NSF-funded project at UW-Stout to study classroom-based research. The research results are broadly disseminated via student presentations, peer-reviewed literature, local media outlets, and policy stakeholders.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is ecpected to result in lasting impacts for students, faculty, and community alike. The PI-team's efforts at synthesizing different research projects centered on the same substantive problems have improved their effectiveness in collaborative problem solving and in teaching undergraduates an interdisciplinary approach to research. The team expects an increase the retention and success of underrepresented groups and their pursuit of advanced science degrees. By sharing results with civic leaders\r\nand government regulators, their new knowledge will impact public policy, the local economy, and regional water quality. This should have a significant impact on developing a more competitive workforce in the social and natural sciences in the US, increasing participation of underrepresented minority groups and women in the sciences, improving undergraduate education in the social\r\nand natural sciences. Most importantly, this project whould have a positive impact on public scientific literacy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhosphorus is a necessary element in the regular functions of an ecosystem; unfortunately, in excessive quantities it becomes a costly environmental pollutant resulting in surface water eutrophication, blue-green algal blooms, and loss of aquatic biodiversity throughout the Midwest and around the world.  The amount of phosphorus entering waterways has increased significantly in recent decades with the rise of industrial agriculture.  The Red Cedar Watershed, and especially Lakes Tainter and Menomin, was the research site for the LAKES (Linking Applied Knowledge in Environmental Sustainability) REU (the original awarded project was called the CROPS REU).  These impoundments are perfect examples of the effects of a system overrun with phosphorus.  Phosphorus pollution will not get better without the focused, cooperative work of stakeholders to make changes that will protect and improve water quality.  The LAKES REU site not only gave undergraduate students an opportunity to contribute to real, meaningful research, but it also allowed them to engage the community in their research and work together to find ways to mitigate the phosphorus pollution and invest in a better tomorrow.  Included in the scope of the LAKES REU were objectives associated with the social networks and connections existing in the watershed, the economic and biological impacts of impaired waters, and the strengths and weaknesses of the community in handling water quality issues.  The LAKES REU site has involved students from the disciplines of biology, geology, anthropology, sociology, geography, economics, and mathematics.\n\nThe economic study asked questions about what kind of value people place on clean water, how the local economy interacts with impaired water, what kind of water quality policies the community would support, and how water quality affects the housing market.  We found that improvements in water quality would boost the economy around the lake.  For example, the city of Menomonie could conservatively see an increase in economic output of around $36.1 million per year and Chetek businesses were projected to see a 185% increase in sales revenue if water quality significantly improved and a 168% decrease in sales if water quality were to significantly worsen.\n\nThe anthropology projects focused on the history of the community and the lakes, the structure and limitations of government agencies, the process of policymaking, and the efficacy of farmer-led councils.  Personal memories and experiences with the lake influence people?s current attitudes about the health of the lake and what kind of solutions are feasible.  Fatalistic attitudes and misconceptions about the condition of the lake hinder and even derail efforts to improve water quality.  Policies can improve water quality, but the best policies recognize the community?s values and use those values to create and implement water policies.\n\nThe Red Cedar Watershed is comprised of forest and agricultural land, but the expansion of conventional agriculture land use has produced most of the problems with phosphorus pollution from run-off.  Interviews and surveys of farmers and Non-Operating Landowners (NOLs) to learn about what drives their farming practices were important to the goals of the LAKES REU sociology projects.  Building stronger social networks and connections among farmers, NOLs, and county/state agencies would have a positive impact on the quantity and quality of Best Management Practices (BMPs) used throughout the watershed.\n\nStudying the physical aspects of the watershed and movement of phosphorus through the system were also important.  Although a significant amount of research has been completed on phosphorus pollution, a complete understanding of how phosphorus interacts with the system in the Red Cedar Watershed was needed to identify the best phosphorus mitigation strategies. Seasonal variation in phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations were measured in relation to hydrodynamics and nutrient availability.  Mathematical modeling was used to estimate the blue-green algae in the lakes and how long it takes chlorophyll levels to reach saturation after a flushing event.  It was also important to have a grasp of how much natural occurring phosphorus there is in the system, and our geological research discovered that parts in the eastern watershed, where brachiopods were captured under the surface, produced higher levels of phosphorus, introducing the importance of implementing more mitigation efforts in that part of the watershed given its already high natural phosphorus base.\n\nEach of these individual projects provide a greater understanding of how this social, cultural, economic, and ecological system works.

These included regular posters presentations of our findings at local coffee shops to facilitate community discussions, presentations for various stakeholders throughout the watershed and state of Wisconsin, and integration in the EPA approved TMDL implementation group for the watershed.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David C Ferguson"
