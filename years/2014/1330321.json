 "awd_abstract_narration": "While precursors proteins were thought to be transported into plant chloroplasts in an unfolded conformation, recent discoveries indicate that this question is far from settled. The mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts will be probed and the conformation of precursor proteins will be monitored as they are being imported. Fluorescent probes that are sensitive to their local environment will be used to monitor the conformation of substrate proteins as they are captured in the chloroplast import machinery and to determine the size limits of the channels through which import occurs. The upper size limit of the chloroplast import mechanism will be probed using gold particles of fixed sizes.\r\nBroader impacts: A program entitled \"Fellowships in Molecular Biology at UC-Davis\" will bring two college-bound students from the River City High School in West Sacramento to participate in this project for four weeks during each of the two summers of the funding period. Students will be nominated by their AP biology teachers and will work on projects that can be completed in four weeks. Local high school students will be hosted for their Biotechnology class internship during the spring quarter, and a Young Scholars Program student will have the opportunity to work on this project during the summers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChloroplasts are the organelles in green plants that are responsible for photosynthesis and many other metabolic pathways.  More than 95% of the protein complement of chloroplasts are imported into the organelle after their synthesis in the cytoplasm.  The physical nature of the import machinery that moves proteins across the two envelope membranes to the stroma is the subject of this project.\n\n \n\nThe so-called TOC translocon is comprised of different subunit components in the outer and inner plastid envelope membranes.  However, translocation across these two membranes generally occurs as a single step, involving both the translocons at the outer and inner chloroplast envelope membranes in a coordinated fashion.  The translocating pore of the outer membrane is Toc75, while that of the inner membrane is Tic20.  We have investigated the size of these translocation pores by presenting them with substrates of differing sizes to see which ones might exceed the diameter of the pores. \n\n \n\nProtein translocation machineries are known in organelles in addition to chloroplasts, and the functional sizes of their pores are the subject of numerous studies.  It is generally thought that proteins must be unfolded prior to transport to fit into these pores, with some notable exceptions.  This is true of mitochondria, the bacterial plasma membrane, and the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and was assumed to be the case in chloroplasts as well.  Our experiments challenged this view and showed that a folded protein that was excluded for its size from the mitochondria and bacterial plasma membrane translocons was able to traverse the chloroplast envelope membranes, albeit at reduced rates.  By extrapolating the observed decrease in transport efficiency as a function of substrate size we can determine that chloroplasts can import proteins with diameters as large as 30 to 35 angstroms.  This is considerably larger than the structures that can be accommodated by the mitochondrial import or bacterial secretion machineries which impose limits of approximately 20 to 25 angstroms.  Our results lead to hypotheses in which proteins are imported into chloroplast in either folded or unfolded conformations depending on the energetic cost of protein unfolding prior to transport is greater or less than of transporting folded proteins.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven M Theg"
