 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gene duplication is important for evolutionary innovation. When genes duplicate, the copies are identical at first but can evolve in different directions resulting in the evolution of new genes, new metabolic pathways and even new developmental pathways. We know genes duplicate often but we don?t fully understand the processes and mechanisms that drive independent evolution of duplicate genes. Co-PI Duncan and PI Wilson will test among different hypotheses of how duplicated genes evolve by examining the evolutionary trajectory of several gene copies following duplication. Their research will focus on the citrus mealybug, a sap-feeding insect that underwent extensive duplication in genes that transport amino acids, nutrients that are essential for normal cellular function in all organisms. The PIs will compare expression and amino acids transported between three types of amino acid transporters: (1) duplicated mealybug transporters, (2) related single-copy transporters in other insects, and (3) the extinct mealybug transporter that Duncan and Wilson will synthetically resurrect. Further, Duncan and Wilson will use computer programs to test the role of natural selection during the evolution of duplicated amino acid transporters in the mealybug.\r\n\r\nThis project will establish which evolutionary and molecular mechanisms are most important in the evolution of duplicated amino acid transporters in the citrus mealybug. The results will contribute to our general understanding of the importance of different mechanisms in the evolution of gene copies following gene duplication, and thus the role these mechanisms play in driving evolutionary innovation across the tree of life. Further, amino acid transporters are essential for survival, so this research could identify potential targets for controlling populations of the citrus mealybug, a pest of citrus and other commercially important plants. By providing opportunities for University of Miami undergraduates to conduct research in a lab setting under the mentorship of co-PI Duncan, this project will advance discovery and learning. Undergraduates at the University of Miami are culturally and ethnically diverse, providing research opportunities for undergraduates underrepresented in the biological sciences. Finally, Duncan and Wilson will share their findings with the general public in a Department of Biology open house that co-PI Duncan will organize during the University of Miami Alumni Week.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow does evolution generate the amazing diversity of life on Earth?  The biology and ecology of organisms are supported by the genes encoded in their genomes; understanding how diverse organisms evolve can be facilitated by unraveling the evolutionary history and function of their genes.  In this project, we used insects to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the evolution of new genes as well as new gene functions.  We focused our work on aphids, tiny sap-sucking insects that form partnerships with bacteria, exchanging essential nutrients called amino acids, to survive.  These insects exchange amino acids with their bacteria using proteins called amino acid transporters, encoded by many different genes.  We examined new genes that arose in aphids through gene duplication, the process by which part of the genome is copied, giving rise to two versions of the same gene that can then evolve independently from each other.  We asked whether new amino acid transporters are maintained for a role in facilitating the aphid/bacteria partnership.  We found evidence that some amino acid transporters new to aphids likely play a role in their relationship with their bacteria &ndash; these transporters arose when aphids first established their bacterial partnership, and they are expressed in the aphid cells where the bacteria live.  Other amino acid transporters new to aphids, however, were not expressed in the cells housing bacteria and their evolution does not correspond to the evolution of the aphid/bacteria partnership, indicating that they likely function in a different context.  Additionally in this project, we examined the functional history of one amino acid transporter, ApGLNT1; a transporter that aphids use to control nutrient production by their bacteria.  ApGLNT1 sits at the membrane of the aphid cells housing bacteria and functions as a gate-keeper, allowing the passage of a precursor of bacterial amino acid production when aphids need more bacteria-produced amino acids, but blocking passage of the precursor when aphids have sufficient bacteria-supplied nutrients. We asked whether the role of ApGLNT1 in the aphid/bacterial partnership arose through evolution of a new function, or through co-option of an old function not originally used in insect/bacteria partnerships.  To address our question, we assayed the transport function of ApGLNT1 in aphids and four other insects; two insects were sap-feeding and have partnerships with bacteria that supply amino acids, one insect did not feed on sap and has a partnership with bacteria that don\u00c6t supply amino acids, and one insect did not feed on sap and does not have a partnership with intracellular bacteria.  All five insect versions of the transporter had the same transport function, implying that the transport function was present in the common ancestor of the five insects &ndash; before the aphid/bacterial partnership evolved.  Thus, the role of ApGLNT1 in the aphid/bacterial partnership results from aphids using an old gene in a new context.  Our findings have implications on academic and societal levels. First, our findings advance scientific knowledge of how evolution uses genes to generate biodiversity and relationships between different organisms.  Second, they advance our understanding of how insects their bacteria interact with one another.  By studying interactions between animals and bacteria in simple systems like insects, we can gain insight into mechanisms by which humans interact with the bacteria in and around our bodies, which carries important health-related implications.  Lastly, aphids are agricultural pests, and understanding how they interact with their bacterial partners can help identify novel targets for controlling their populations on crops.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca Duncan"
