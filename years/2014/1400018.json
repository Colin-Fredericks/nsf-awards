 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to integrate optical instrument designs, biomechanical, biochemical, and microstructure analyses to elucidate and characterize relationships between collagen fiber re-alignment and failure under dynamic loading conditions. This investigation will provide systematic engineering analyses and predictive models to enable the assessment of tissue injury and degeneration for better optimization of the recovery processes. The broader vision for the research is that it will culminate in synergistic activities between experimental and clinical efforts aimed at a breakthrough in clinical treatments of damaged tendon-to-bone insertions. This research will make important contributions to fields within health care, science, engineering, and society as a whole. To transfer the outcomes of this project outside of the academic community, the PIs will work with the NC Biotechnology Center. Through presentations to local companies and interaction with startup incubators, this experience will permit us not only to advertise these outcomes to companies in the field of tissue engineering, but also collect feedback from them on the experimental data essential to their technology development. The proposed research will form the basis of our graduate courses, including the basics of the structure of materials and biological aspects of tendon-to-bone insertion.\r\n\r\nTendon-to-bone insertions are functionally-graded connective tissues whose anisotropic biomechanical functions depend intimately on the regional biochemical composition and structure, thus functioning to alleviate stress concentration at the junction of these tissues.  Studies conducted under this award will expose and quantify properties of tendon-to-bone insertions subjected to different magnitudes of loading, associated loading time-scales (e.g., strain rate), mutual interactions, as well as the order in which these events occur. In parallel, constitutive and finite element models will be developed to predict the response of tendon-to-bone insertions under different loading conditions.",

The objective of the study herein is to develop structural-based finite element models for predicting structure-mechanics changes. Tendon-to-bone insertions are functionally-graded connective tissues whose anisotropic biomechanical functions depend intimately on the regional biochemical composition and structure. The insertion site provides a gradual transition from soft tissue to hard tissue, functioning to alleviate stress concentration at the junction of these tissues. In chronic disease or frank rupture, the bone mass becomes lower, and with structural deterioration, as seen in osteoporosis and tendinosis, the finely-tuned structure-property relations governing tendon-to-bone insertion homeostasis are disturbed. Yet associated tissue regeneration, repair, and remodeling mechanisms are poorly understood since a gradation in microstructure and properties does not exist at healing tendon-to-bone insertions. This lack of understanding is one of the key obstacles faced by the orthopedic community, hindering optimization of surgical techniques. Via integrated experimental and computational studies to elucidate relationships between local tissue stress-strain state and collagen reorganization, the current study has the potential for shedding light on mechanisms involved in tendon-to-bone insertion repair and remodeling in homeostasis and disease states, as well as for developing effective design rules for advanced tendon replacements and for overcoming tissue-engineering challenges. A brief project outcome is listed as follows:</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>The experiments demonstrated that the high-speed QPLM instrument is capable of monitoring complex tissue structure reorganization during dynamic loading. While microtome slicing of the specimens was required to achieve sufficient transparency, overall fiber realignment rends during loading were consistent between the different specimen thicknesses. Therefore the slicing of the specimens did not noticeably change the measured dynamic behaviors observed in the tendon-to-bone insertion specimens.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The generated alignment and retardation images indicated the tendon-to-bone insertion birefringence became stronger as the load increased, the fiber crimp structure straightened and the collagen fiber alignment became more uniform and well aligned in the tissue. During loading, the fiber realignment began at the insertion site and then propagated toward the tendon side along the fiber direction. The tendon-to-bone insertion globally realigned with the joined tendon before specimen failure. Quantitative values of the local collagen fiber alignment angle were obtained throughout the dynamic event. The retardation maps were less useful, as the specimen thickness varied significantly, introducing variations of the same magnitude as those due to the collagen fiber realignment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The limitation of the high-speed QPLM system was the temporal bias introduced to the alignment and retardation maps due to the need to collect 60 images per map. The alternate PLM camera removed the temporal bias, however introduced new issues due to the large amount of noise in the images. This noise is created by the highly scattering tissues and short camera exposure time. Current work is focused on introducing signal processing algorithms to decrease this noise issue and better evaluate this second technique for high-speed QPLM imaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The structural-based computational model of insertion tissues is capable of describing nonlinear mechanical responses to large deformations. This model will be useful for understanding how tendon-to-bone insertion develops during tissue remodeling and may also be useful for controlling tissue healing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The optimized insertion shape will be useful for understanding how tendon-to-bone insertion functions and may be also useful to planning surgical interventions and developing orthopedic implants.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The strain-state dependent viscoelastic model could be useful for testing and describing viscoelastic materials and for developing interfaces for dissimilar materials, considering rate effect and multiaxial loadings.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Via computational studies to elucidate relationships between local tissue stress-strain state and collagen reorganization, the current study has the potential for shedding light on mechanisms involved in tendon-to-bone insertion repair and remodeling in homeostasis and disease states, as well as for developing effective design rules for advanced tendon replacements and for overcoming tissue-engineering challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, through systematic strain-rate testing of the tissue and fusing with the dynamic polarized light microscopy, the project provides a centralized resource to dynamic structure-property evolution and related data.

Thus, this research will make important contributions to fields within health care, science, engineering, and society as a whole.
