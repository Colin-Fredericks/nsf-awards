 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award sponsored by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brenner-Moyer of the Department of Chemistry at the City University of New York at Brooklyn College will investigate the development of new cascade reactions catalyzed by organocatalysts, which are environmentally benign alternatives to traditional Lewis acid- and transition metal catalysts.  The proposed cascade reactions represent new approaches to two persistent problems in organic synthesis:  1) how to rapidly build molecular complexity, and 2) how to achieve efficient, asymmetric conjugate additions of simple alcohols.  The proposed cascade reactions will also provide direct access to useful synthetic intermediates that are currently accessed using multiple step syntheses, expensive chiral starting materials, and/or hazardous metals.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of efficient organocatalytic methods to produce useful synthetic intermediates will have positive implications for the synthesis of natural products and medicinal compounds by increasing the availability of catalysts in greener laboratories and reducing waste streams and also lowering costs. These activities will benefit society, from research chemists to communities that house academic institutions and industrial plants. In addition, the research activities will help train undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral student researchers and will aim at increasing retention of females in the sciences through participation in the program Women In Science and Engineering (WISE). The principal investigator will 1) coordinate peer mentoring for students struggling in the sciences, and explore careers in green chemistry and other green sciences, via a WISE-sponsored seminar series and research fair, as an alternative to careers in medicine for students who are excelling in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:  Since the turn of this century, derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids have emerged as competent reaction catalysts that are complementary to conventional metal catalysis.  While many aspects of these so-called organocatalysts are fairly well understood by now, some unknowns remain.  Data resulting from research supported by this grant have significantly advanced the understanding of the mechanisms as well as facial- and site-selectivity in reactions of reactive intermediates generated by these amino acid-derived catalysts.  This has culminated in the development of synthetic methods that offer direct routes to types of structures that have previously only been synthesized via multiple steps or with simpler substitution patterns.  The types of structures generated by these newly developed methods are broadly useful in the synthesis of medicinal compounds and complex natural products.  This research has produced a total of eight peer-reviewed publications, ten invited seminar presentations, two Ph.D. theses, two national conference proceedings, and one book chapter. \n\n \n\nBroader impacts:  This award supported the research training of two Ph.D. students; one (Ph.D., ?18 expected) is a female minority researcher and the other (Ph.D., ?16) will begin his independent academic career in fall 2018 as an assistant professor of chemistry, and will thus train future generations of scientists.  Additionally, this grant enabled the PI to implement a peer mentoring program for female undergraduate science majors.  This program paired third- and fourth-year female science majors with incoming first-year female LSAMP (Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation) and EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund) students intending to become science majors.  The overall goal of this program is to facilitate these students? success in the sciences by providing them with a support network they might otherwise lack, being students at a commuter campus that is for the most part void of embedded peer (i.e., dorm) communities.  Towards this end, these students received individual and group mentoring, the latter during roundtable discussions moderated by the PI.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stacey Brenner-Moyer"
