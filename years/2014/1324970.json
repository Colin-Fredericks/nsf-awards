 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential environmental, social, and economic consequences from the post-industrial increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) due to fossil fuel burning is one of the most important areas of scientific research today. Whether this increase will affect weather patterns (ie. more frequent or more severe storms, changes in precipitation resulting in floods or droughts), sea level rise (ie. coastal flooding due to melting of Greenland and Antarctic glaciers), needs to be better understood so that policies can be put in place to avoid or adapt to these consequences. A useful approach to understanding how the Earth responds to such changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration is to look back in time to periods when the conditions were similar to those we are experiencing today. Investigators propose using a relatively new tool to address this, the boron isotope composition of marine carbonates which have been shown to reflect the acidity of seawater. It is known that increasing atmospheric CO2 causes surface seawater to become more acidic. Thus, boron isotopes have great potential for examining changing atmospheric CO2 in the geologic past. They propose a study of the Carboniferous-Permian interval (360-260 million years ago), a time similar to today's Earth in that it represents a time of extensive glaciation, with glacial-interglacial variability analogous to the Late Cenozoic, that is then followed by significant climate warming. They will produce a high-resolution record from a suite of brachiopod shells that extend from the cold conditions of the early Mississippian to the culmination of the glaciations and warming in the early Permian.\r\n\r\nThe potential for perturbing the Earth's climate system is of immediate global societal relevance. This proposal will not only address climate change questions in deep time, which will help to inform the present, it will also continue the development of boron isotopes as a pH proxy in deep time, providing additional tools for multi-proxy studies of global climate change that will be valuable to a wide range of climate scientists. The investigators are professors at Queens College and Stony Brook University, institutions with considerable cultural diversity and programs in place to encourage students from underrepresented groups to become engaged in scientific research. Both investigators have mentored undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups, and will actively recruit them for this project. They have developed a summer program for high school students employing a nested system that provides valuable mentoring experience for graduate students, post-docs, and Earth Science teachers as they guide the student research. Weekly seminars on the topic of seawater chemistry will provide the students with the background to understand the relevance of their work. This approach leads to great synergy and naturally results in better communication of the science, as the teachers take this experience back to their classrooms.",

This interval, the Carboniferous-Permian, saw a change from coal formation suggesting very wet climate, to evaporite formation suggesting extreme aridity. This transition occurs at the time that the continents came together to form the super continent Pangea. We found that the boron isotope composition decreases rapidly by 7 per mil across the climate transition and remains stable after the drop for at least 30 million years. The direction is opposite what would be expected if the only thing that was changed with the amount of continental weathering. We can model the change as a combination of reduction in continental weathering, which would cause a rise in atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub>, and a diminished borate ion availability, which would result from this increase in CO<sub>2</sub>. This is consistent with the known speciation behavior of boron, which predicts less borate with lower pH. Borate removal from seawater has to decrease by 60% to account for the change using the current understanding of the fluxes out of the ocean. This dramatic reduction is incompatible with the fact that more than half of the present-day flux from the system is through Mid Ocean ridge (MOR) hydrothermal reactions. We suspect that the published estimate of 4 per mil for the MOR flux is too low. A value of 12 per mil for the MOR would better account for the measured changes. Because there is a pH control on boron speciation, boron isotopes have been shown to change with pH and have been used to show changes across Pleistocene glacial to interglacial timescales. One barrier to using boron isotopes in deep time geologic records is the fact that the boron isotope composition of the seawater reservoir must be known and cannot be expected to be constant. This study offers a path forward to a better understanding of past boron isotope composition of seawater.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/22/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: N.
