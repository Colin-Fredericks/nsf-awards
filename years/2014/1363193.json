 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns studies of fundamental symmetries in mathematics, and how they interact with each other, creating larger symmetries. The aim is to give a quantitative analysis of the number of times some symmetries appear as a result of such interactions. The analysis will help elucidate the nature of symmetries in general and will apply to other spaces and families of discrete objects exhibiting such symmetries.  The work has important applications in probability and statistics.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is concerned with the study of Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group, which are some of the most classical objects in Algebraic Combinatorics. It aims at applications of enumerative and computational complexity nature, for estimating the coefficients and deciding their positivity. On a combinatorics side, the proposal aims to establish new unimodality results for various classes of partitions. The employed tools are largely intrinsic in these fields, involve group representation theory, Schur functions, and combinatorics of Young tableaux, with some bijective and analytic methods in partition theory added to the mix.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt least six papers were written on the subject of the proposal, some in collaboration with other mathematicians, elucidating the nature of combinatorics and complexity of Kronecker coefficients.  In totality, these papers have found their audience and are currently used in other projects (including some funded by NSF and other agencies) by other researchers in an effort to resolve the fundational computability problems. \n\nLet us emphasize several notable research contributions which have been pioneered by our work.  First, we studied the unimodality properties of the Gaussian coefficients (joint with Greta Panova), strict unimodality and asymptotics of these coefficients by reducing these to positivity of Kronecker coefficients.  All of these numbers play an important role in understanding fundamental symmetries of nature.  As a result of our work further inequalities have been obtained by other researchers.  \n\nNext, these inequalities have been used by Panova, Ikenmeyer and others to lay ground for the lower bound in Geometric Complexity Theory, the current leading effort to resolve the P. vs. NP (milleanium) problem.  This problems is at its core asks if the computations can be performed efficiently and remains completely unresolved.  The effort of other scientists spurred by our earlier work seem to suggest that a brute force application of Kronecker coefficients in the Geometric Complexity Theory needs to be calibrated and refined.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Igor Pak"
