 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Synthetic quantum dot mesocrystals, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) periodic arrays of quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a matrix material, represent one strategy pertinent to designing new materials for nanoelectronics, thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, and magnetics, all areas that are critical to our technology-based economy.  The project aims at establishing a deeper scientific basis for a specific approach to directed self-assembly relevant to various 3D periodic QDs systems that are often at the heart of electronic materials research and development.  This type of synthesis has a great potential to reach unprecedented length scales. The effects of the highly-regimented nanostructure control on the resulting materials properties are explored. The outreach activities including curriculum development and the NanoDays are integrated with the research program. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: This research project focuses on the growth of synthetic quantum dot mesocrystals.  These artificial materials are expected to have novel and improved properties. This research effort builds on the principal investigator's recent accomplishments in creating two-dimensional arrays of epitaxial Ge quantum dots on Si substrates. These highly uniform arrays formed by directed self-assembly on nanoscale surface templates.  The templates are either periodic surface topography, or nanoscale \"stressors,\" created by direct-write techniques. The two-dimensional quantum dot arrays serve as \"seed crystals\" for the formation of the three-dimensional mesocrystal by additional growth of Ge dot layers separated by Si interlayer spacers. No additional templating is required.  The ultimate goal is to control self-assembly processes close to the intrinsic, limiting length scales associated with strain-driven quantum dot self-assembly. The resulting materials are structurally characterized, and their potential for novel electronic and thermal transport is explored.",

Quantum dots offer size-tunable properties to control different forms of energy transport, including electricity, light, and heat. These are important to computing and sensing technologies, as well as for energy generation. However, in order to be truly useful, control over the size, shape, chemical composition, and spacing of quantum dots in extended arrays must be established. This project investigated semiconducting quantum dots made of Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge), and grown as thin films under extremely clean vacuum conditions. This approach offers the advantage of forming fully dense arrays of embedded Si-Ge alloys dots on Si wafers, enabling integration of quantum dot arrays with integrated circuits that are the staple of the computer industry.</p>\n<p><span>The aspiration of this project was to develop better understanding of the fundamental growth mechanisms that dictate the resulting quantum dot array in all three dimensions. The key approach was to create highly patterns of pits, where the size, shape and spacing of the patterns was readily varied across a range that was determined by a key science question: what happens when the pattern spacing either matches, or deliberately differs, from the length scales for quantum dot formation that are imposed by their fundamental nature? The research developed an alternative approach to growing the QDs, which are usually formed by growing Si-Ge films at high temperatures to allow the dots to form. Here, the very small lengthscales being investigated are unstable at high temperatures, so the Si-Ge films were instead grown at low temperature on the patterned wafers, then more gently heated in the vacuum chamber to promote quantum dot formation. Quantum dot arrays for three heating times are shown in Figure 1, where it is seen that the heating time controls the dot size.&nbsp;&nbsp;While it was thought that this approach would suppress changes in quantum dot composition that are typical of the usual high-temperature-growth technique, after performing a careful analysis of the composition of the quantum dots formed by annealing it was found that the dots still intermixed to a similar degree. A second key result was that forming quantum dots in pits is rather robust, but when the pits began overlapping, forming a surface pattern more like an egg-carton, that control over positioning was lost. However, just prior to loss of site control, the quantum dots found a new way to arrange themselves between the pits rather than inside them, shown in Figure 2. This result, not predicted by existing theories, offers a means to readily double the number of quantum dots per area while halving their size.</span></p>\n<p><span>The second phase of the research investigated growth of ordered arrays of quantum dots in three dimensions instead of just two, a structure referred to as a quantum dot mesocrystal. Forming this demanding structure requires an initial pattern to form a ?seed crystal? layer of Si-Ge dots, then a layer of pure Si, a layer of Si-Ge, etc. If each successive layer of dots successfully aligns above the prior layer, then a mesocrystal can be obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp;The annealing approach described above was used for mesocrystal formation, wherein each successive layer of Si-Ge was grown at low temperatures and then annealed. Examples of the resultant structures are shown in Figure 3, which shows the shape of the top layer of quantum dots after forming ten successive layers. The alignment appears to be perfect registry in the final layer, for a range of quantum dot sizes and spacings. However, examining the full mesocrystal from the side, shown in Figure 4, shows that the structure is more complex than the idealized object as depicted in the schematic illustration. It should be possible to greatly improve on this with further research.</span></p>\n<p><span>NSF funding has enabled deeper insights into controlling the formation of quantum dots, at the nanoscale and in all three dimensions.
