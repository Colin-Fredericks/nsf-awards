 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Judy Westrick from Wayne State University and colleagues Stephanie Brock, Ratna Naik, Eranda Nikolla and Charles Winter will acquire an X-ray diffractometer for the study of powdered samples. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. A powder diffractometer also allows compositional analysis. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of chemistry, physics and engineering and materials science students.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding structure-function-size relationships in nanoscale transition metal phosphides and arsenides with magnetic and catalytic functionality; (b) preparing solid-state devices with applications in energy and the environment; (c) studying the effect of size on the phase-transformation temperature of MnAs; (d) developing and growing of thin films; (e) developing heterogeneous catalysts for biomass conversion and electrocatalysts; (f) studying heterogeneous catalyst for biomass conversion; (g) developing multifunctional electrodes for Li-air batteries; (h) establishing applications of in-situ XRD for battery materials characterization; and (i) investigating lattice deformations at multiferroic transitions.",
