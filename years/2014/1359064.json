 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nOver $100 billion is spent on infrastructure maintenance in America each year. Despite this spending, groups such as the American Society of Civil Engineers rate US infrastructure to be on the D+ level, and the Department of Homeland Security considers \"ageing infrastructure\" to pose as much of a threat to the nation as terrorism or pandemic. New materials and new technologies, with improved durability and longer service lives, are needed to address this growing infrastructure crisis. The REU site hosted at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and supported by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers will focus on developing such materials and technologies. The performance of a variety of conventional and experimental infrastructure materials exposed to deterioration mechanisms will be investigated. Materials of interest include alternative cements, novel asphalt systems, and bio-inspired materials for structural applications; deterioration mechanisms include electrochemical corrosion, frost damage, and fatigue due to mechanical loading. The objective of this research is to identify the fundamental material properties that lead to improved durability in infrastructure materials, ensuring that current and future infrastructure needs can be sustainably supported. An interdisciplinary approach, blending materials science and civil engineering methodologies, will ensure that the fundamental scientific and technical issues are investigated in a holistic, multiscalar manner. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe nation's infrastructure, including buildings, transportation systems, energy facilities, and other public services, is in a critical state of disrepair. Infrastructure materials with improved durability and longer service lives would lead directly to less frequent maintenance carried out at lower cost; improved safety for the average user and for maintenance personnel; and a reduction in the environmental impact of the built environment through reduced consumption of energy and material resources. The goal of this research is to identify the fundamental scientific principles on which such materials can be developed, ensuring that current and future infrastructure needs can be sustainably met. The results of this research will be applicable in the US as well as globally. A recruitment plan designed specifically for this REU site, based on interpersonal relationships with local institutions, will ensure the participation of a high percentage of students from under-represented groups that would otherwise have limited opportunities for undergraduate research. Programmatic assessment by an experienced third-party evaluator will lead to the continuous improvement of the research program, as well as wide-spread dissemination of the results. Finally, two educators participating in the site will be supported in the development of lesson plans, so that the research conducted can be used to inspire and encourage high school students for years to come.",

Each year, the U.S. invests more than $100 billion in core infrastructure systems &ndash; over 70% of which goes to routine maintenance. These funds, however, are unable to keep pace with the rapid decline of the built environment. In 2017, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) awarded U.S. infrastructure a &lsquo;grade&rsquo; of D+, and the Department of Homeland Security determined that ageing infrastructure was a potential threat to national well-being on par with terrorism and infectious disease pandemics. The average motorist loses roughly 14 hours per American per year (a total of 4.2 billion hours) due to maintenance-related congestion and inefficient detours during which time 3 billion gallons of fuel are wasted and 30 million tons of greenhouse gases are emitted. Significant natural resources, in the form of aggregate, cement, fresh water, and petroleum products are sacrificed every year to maintain and repair deteriorated infrastructure assets. The ASCE estimates that $3.6 trillion must be spent by 2020 in order to bring U.S. infrastructure to a satisfactory level; however, such spending is only a temporary solution that does not address the fundamental causes of the infrastructure maintenance crisis. New, more durable materials and better methods for fighting infrastructure deterioration are needed to truly ensure a sustainable built environment for future generations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goal of this REU site was to advance the scientific understanding of such materials, as well as help to develop a workforce with the interdisciplinary technical skills necessary to develop solutions to future infrastructure maintenance issues. As a commuter site, roughly 12 students were hosted each year, maximizing student research while reducing logistical oversight. Undergraduates worked on projects ranging from the recovery of valuable rare earth elements from waste materials to self-healing coatings for steel-reinforced concrete systems; from evaluating the durability of alternative cements to optimizing bio-inspired polymer/cement composites; and from elucidating the structure of hydrothermal char, a promising material with many potential applications, to optimizing the placement of counterweights that would negate post-collisions vibrations in bridge structures. &nbsp;Participants were involved in a variety of professional development activities, building skills such as technical writing, giving formal presentations, and interpreting data. In addition to the undergraduate participants, each year two local high school teachers carried out research that they brought back to their classrooms in the form of lesson plans. As the research that was performed reaches maturity, and as the participants bring the skills learned during their time at the REU site into industry, infrastructure will be improved at the local, national, and global scales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/19/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492614233084_CviSHv9WgAAfqUa--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492614233084_CviSHv9WgAAfqUa--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU Student presenting at CUR REU Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492614233084_CviSHv9WgAAfqUa--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU Student presenting at CUR REU Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rachael Messier, a 2016 REU participant, presents her research at the Council on Undergraduate Research's REU Symposium at the NSF Headquarters in Arlington, VA.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aaron Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU Student presenting at CUR REU Symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492613809269_Untitled--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492613809269_Untitled--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Presentation 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492613809269_Untitled--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster Presentation 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A student discusses his REU research with other students during the 2016 REU Poster Presentation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aaron Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster Presentation 2016</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492613761716_106_3767--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492613761716_106_3767--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Presentation 2015\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492613761716_106_3767--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster Presentation 2015\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nadine Geagea, an undergraduate researcher, presents the results of her REU research during the 2015 poster session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aaron Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster Presentation 2015</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492614408068_pavementlab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492614408068_pavementlab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU Participant Constructing Testing Device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359064/1359064_10294406_1492614408068_pavementlab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU Participant Constructing Testing Device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An REU participant works with his graduate student mentor to construct a modified solar simulator, capable of monitoring the thermal performance of pavement materials.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Aaron Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU Participant Constructing Testing Device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
