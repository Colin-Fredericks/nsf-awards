 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) will build on its existing Water Data Center (WDC) facility to provide a range of services to the multidisciplinary water science community. Specifically,  CUAHSI will offer training in instrumentation and host specialty conferences in field instrumentation and hydroinformatics.  CUAHSI will continue its successful activities from the past, including Pathfinder graduate student travel grants, Research Cyberseminars, Let's Talk about Water outreach events, and the Biennial Water Science Symposia. A new initiative is the development of a community governance process and community modeling resources designed to enable the water science community to more readily contribute its knowledge of continental water processes to Earth Systems models. This will be a collaborative effort with NCAR to develop a water-oriented branch of the Community Land Model (CLM), that would be supported by the Water Data Center, and empower the community toward improving the model realism in large-scale water storages and fluxes in climate and Earth system simulations. Strategic planning activities are incorporated into the core governance of CUAHSI. \r\n\r\nBecause water connects the biotic and abiotic components of the Earth system and is a critical economic and ecological resource, CUAHSI services impact multiple disciplines and serve society at large. The WDC will enable new synthetic research, and better sharing and dissemination of research data and results that can be utilized in applied and policy research. The advancement of standards for water data ensures free and better exchange of information between academics, federal agencies and the private sector. CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System is being used by multiple governments around the world (the Dominican Republic and the Republic of Italy). The WDC will also target outreach activities to the Native American community through tribal colleges and tribal government. Water management is a major issue at many reservations and water science provides an attractive career path for Native Americans with jobs available at all degree levels. Training and outreach activities will provide important training and research opportunities for graduate students to explore meaningful and important interdisciplinary questions. Advancement of water science depends on such investments in part because of the many traditional disciplines that are required for an understanding of water in the Earth system. CUAHSI seeks to overcome fragmentation in water science research by supporting interdisciplinary science. The services included in this project have been selected to provide maximum benefit to the community as well as to serve as a foundation for the advancement of the science.",
