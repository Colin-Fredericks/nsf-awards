The workshop will bring together experts in fluid dynamics of multiphase systems to examine pattern formation in diverse problems, including multiscale turbulence, interfacial instabilities, granular flows, and flowing suspensions.  The workshop will focus on the mathematical structures and underlying physics that are common to this diverse set of multiphase systems. The workshop will feature invited and contributed research presentations as well as several poster sessions that will address important problems in pattern formation. \r\n\r\nThe formation of patterns in flowing systems is an important feature of many multiphase and interfacial processes. The development of such patterns in complex materials sometimes indicates the onset of an instability that can influence the processing of such materials. In geophysical flows, structures that develop can influence potentially catastrophic events such as avalanches in landslides. By seeking commonalities in the behavior of distinct physical systems, this workshop may aid researchers who study a broad range of materials. The workshop will also provide educational opportunities for students at a variety of academic levels. The meeting will give students a chance to interact with leaders in their research fields, which will enhance their early career development.",
