 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at Virginia Western Community College will increase the number of American mechatronics engineers. Mechatronics engineering concerns systems that integrate electrical, mechanical, and computer technologies.  Many modern technologies such as manufacturing, robotics, and automated equipment involve mechatronics design and maintenance.  Developing and maintaining a sufficient workforce of highly skilled mechatronics engineers and technicians is a vital factor in a sustaining a strong United States economy. Virginia Western Community College (VWCC) is conducting a project called the Partnership for Advanced Career Education in Mechatronics Engineering (PACE ME). This effort will improve the degree of collaboration between community college faculty, technical educators, and industry to help achieve effective mechatronics education. Mechatronics engineering is an area with a growing need for appropriately-skilled engineers and technicians. The project addresses gaps in diversity in this field and develops a structure to build awareness of Mechatronics Engineering Technology to help increase the number of people pursing this career path. The project involves a diverse population of students and is designed to produce innovative engineering technicians with critical thinking and adaptive learning skills. \r\n\r\nThe project will utilize innovative student-focused strategies to achieve the project goals for student retention and success in producing mechatronics engineers and technicians.  Mechatronics demands the application of multidisciplinary skills.  To create a program to develop these skills educators will collaborate with industry partners to create opportunities for experiential learning. Industry is also engaged through integrated internships and stackable credentials. Industry involvement will also help student training to keep pace with rapidly changing intelligent systems. This project embraces the importance of enhancing the capability of faculty to support student understanding of mechatronics technologies by providing professional development of course instructors. PACE ME will establish a modern fabrication laboratory to support both secondary and postsecondary technician training and to strengthen industry alliances. Through the fabrication laboratory PACE ME implements industry-relevant projects and problem-based learning. The project monitors key outcomes including the number of underrepresented students exposed to mechatronics engineering, the rate of change in enrollment of mechatronics related courses, and the number of industries serving as contributing partners.  PACE ME includes an organized effort to disseminate the effective practices and outcomes resulting from the project.",

Furthermore, fifteen secondary and post-secondary faculty participated in structured Summer Institutes to learn application-based engineering technician training strategies that they were able to employ in their classrooms. This training included industrial tours to help them provide relevance and real world Mechatronics scenarios with their students (figure 3). To help teach SMSCP content, personal Computer Numeric Control (CNC) Milling Machines were provided to teachers and students to learn and apply Computer Aided Design (CAD), and Computer Aided Machining (CAM) technologies in support of Mechatronics education. The PACE ME project provided additional opportunities for stimulating&nbsp;professional development through participation in the HITEC. This allowed the high school CTE and college teachers to keep skills up-to-date on current Mechatronics educational trends happening on a national level. The HITEC Conference was instrumental in building <span>camaraderie</span> and collaboration among educators and industry professionals. Additionally, the HITEC conference created networking opportunities that helped build the FABLAB at Virginia Western and the Mechatronics Community Exchange &nbsp;(MCE is a national group of stakeholders discussing Mechatronics issues and a resource for new Mechatronics instructors.)</p>\n<p>Goal two was achieved by engaging industry through integrated internships, the annual STEM-H Summits, Manufacturing Summits, Summer Institutes, project development, evaluations, and stackable credentials. &nbsp;The STEM-H Summit is an event whereby high school students visit campus to participate in career exploration activities and college students attend job fairs (figure 4). Over the course of the project, we had over 150 industry representatives from multiple management levels engage students to help them understand what is required academically to enter the growing field of Mechatronics. In addition to their participation in the STEM-H Summits, over 75 of these industry representatives have actively participated in Manufacturing Summits that helped provide leadership and direction for classroom instruction.</p>\n<p>One of the most significant components of goal two and the project itself was creating the Summer Institute, which connected industry to educators through meaningful training and facility tours. These tours provided to the high school CTE teachers offered insight and practical application of the Mechatronics multidisciplinary skill sets essential to many of the unfilled positions available today.</p>\n<p>Mechatronics Mentorship was established and implemented to increase retention. PI Horine selected students in academic jeopardy to participate in the Mentorship program, successfully changing their academic trajectory, attitude, and ultimately their success in the program. During the PACE ME project, the mentorship program helped seven students, exceeding the goal of five.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Goal three was attained through the implementation of strategies to increase student diversity and retention including a Career and Technical Students Organization (CTSO) Liaison, enhanced Summer Camp opportunities, a STEM Academy and more engaging promotional outreach. The employment of an Industry Liaison was a critical aspect of the project&rsquo;s efforts to foster a stronger relationship between industry and education. The Industry Liaison increased career opportunities for graduates by building and strengthening partnerships with over 40 companies. Another outreach activity to promote interest in Mechatronics further down the secondary pipeline included offering middle school summer camps. Over the course of three summers, the project provided hands-on activities to ignite the spark for Mechatronics for nearly 60 students.</p>\n<p>In addition, PACE ME cast a wide net in recruitment strategies by offering the high school faculty an online learning resource, Tooling University, owned and operated by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Throughout the course of the project, the college hosted four STEM-H Summits that connected over 300 high school students annually to exciting careers in Mechatronics.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Mechatronics program experienced over a 400% increase in enrollment and a 350% increase in a diverse population (figure 2).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the PACE ME Project was a major factor in setting the foundation for economic growth in the Roanoke Valley. Specifically, four new industrial partners cited the Mechatronics program at Virginia Western as the key factor in expanding or relocating their manufacturing operations to Roanoke, Virginia. Through industry engagement, preparing and aligning to global industry credentials, maximizing outreach efforts nationally, and training and developing Mechatronics faculty, the PACE ME Project has increased the number of engineering technicians necessary to fill the skills required by industry today and in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/19/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Horine</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951340055_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951340055_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951340055_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mechatronics AAS degree enrollment growth</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dan Horine</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Horine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951405953_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951405953_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951405953_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Female and Minority growth in Mechatronics</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dan Horine</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Horine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951500015_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951500015_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400571/1400571_10331352_1539951500015_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer Institute -
