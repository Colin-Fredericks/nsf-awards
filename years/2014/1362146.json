The objectives of the Center are: (1) Design of novel and evaluation of existing HV/T energy transmission/transfer multifunctional materials for next generation composite conductors, insulators, underground cables, towers, and other electric power transmission structures; (2) Design and development of novel advanced high energy transfer materials for aerospace, oil/gas, automotive, and other industrial applications; (3) Failure prediction and prevention of HV/T materials and structures under in-service conditions through state-of-the-art multi-scale modeling and material performance evaluations; (4) Development of new failure monitoring techniques and material repair methods in HV/T materials under laboratory conditions and their subsequent transfer to in-service inspection and repair.\r\n\r\nThe proposed I/UCRC will seek to create a diverse and interdisciplinary educational, research and business environment for (1) undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, funded by the research projects of the Center; (2) faculty members from a variety of disciplines, including junior faculty starting their academic careers; (3) utility, aerospace and national lab engineers and designers developing various types of HV/T materials and structures; and (4) utility managers supervising HV transmission lines across the country. The Center intends to enhance the reputation of the U.S. HV/T manufacturing around the world and, in particular, improve the level of confidence among the potential users of novel HV/T structures. The center targets long-term benefit to infrastructure, manufacturing, energy transport and efficiency of the electric grid, and the durability of other HV/T and high energy transfer structures.\r\n",

We designed and studied materials and structures for power transmission and aerospace. We investigated novel polymers, called aromatic thermosetting copolymers (ATSP), and their composites for next-generation cables. The analysis spanned the characterization of the structure and thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties. We found that these polymeric materials have robust mechanical properties, can withstand high temperatures, have low moisture intake, are resistant to environmental damage, including radiation, and have a strong bond with carbon fibers or nanofillers, making them desirable candidates for a broad range of industries.</p>\n<p>One studied application was electrically conductive carbon-filled nanocomposites providing shielding effectiveness for the aerospace industry. We utilized percolation theory to study how to tailor filler shapes (e.g., carbon nanotubes or graphene nanoplatelets), arrangements, and fractions to achieve conductive materials (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>Secondly, we designed impact-resistant structures to protect transformers from severe weather and ballistic impacts and aerospace structures from bird strikes. We incorporated various computational tools (finite element analysis, topology optimization, and machine learning) and bioinspiration in the designs. Nature has designed multiple systems for protection against impacts. Examples include shells, turtles, nuts, horns, horse hooves, and many others. We identified and cataloged common characteristics of such impact-resistant natural structures. The materials have sandwich, tubular, layered, sutured, gradient structures and hierarchical, composite, and porous architectures (Fig. 2). Some of our efforts have focused on lattices, particularly those with triply periodic surfaces, with smooth surfaces that minimize stress concentrations. Such lattices were 3D printed using powder bed fusion with metals and polymers as base materials.</p>\n<p>We also studied the mechanics of helices and helically wound cables under thermal and mechanical loadings (Fig. 3). This study provided insight into the mechanical responses of cables and other systems due to heterogeneous material structures (e.g., nanocomposite). We generalized a Timoshenko rod model for helical strands and helically reinforced cylinders where the thermomechanical constitutive law has five effective elastic moduli and two thermal coefficients. The model predicts nonclassical bending and thermoelastic behavior of helical strands. The dispersion relation of thermoelastic harmonic waves is governed by two thermoelastic coupling constants, one chirality parameter, and the Fourier number. The quasi-longitudinal and the quasi-torsional waves are dispersive, damped, and dependent on temperature. The Fourier number determines the adiabatic-isothermal transition of the wave propagation. Thermoelastic waves in helical strands were also investigated in the case of Maxwell-Cattaneo heat conduction. The corresponding dispersion relation is a sixth-order algebraic equation governed by two thermoelastic coupling constants, one chirality parameter, the ratio between extensional and torsional moduli, the Fourier number, and the dimensionless thermal relaxation. Properties of solutions were determined for the cases of small and large wavenumbers,&nbsp;(Fig. 4).</p>\n<p>Work on dynamics of helically wound cables led to the development of a new stochastic model of wind turbulence, validated with atmospheric field turbulence data. Two novel spectrum models were developed for the streamwise velocity component with robust correlation structures, which account for and decouple the fractal dimension and Hurst effect. The formulations were adapted from the modern probability theory using the so-called generalized Cauchy and Dagum models. An inspection of these two models with field data from a met-tower-mounted sonic anemometer located within the atmospheric surface layer revealed good agreement and better performance than all other conventionally used isotropic-based models of streamwise velocity spectra. Both models' fractal dimension, D, was found to be consistent with the Kolmogorov &minus;5/3 power law in the inertial sub-range. For completeness, the study included a derivation of the explicit forms of the energy spectral densities of the Cauchy and Dagum covariances.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>The HVT Center offered a diverse and interdisciplinary educational and research environment for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, funded by the Center's research projects.
