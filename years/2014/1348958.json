 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keystone Symposia Conference on \"Plant Signaling: Dynamic Properties\" will focus on the relationship between signaling events at the molecular level and their higher order behavior, e.g. the integrated response of the cell or organism. The properties of signaling systems will be compared in diverse organisms, including non-plant examples, emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches that include mathematics, computation and synthetic biology. This conference has the goals of 1) fostering a community of researchers interested in elucidating the emergent properties of plant signaling behaviors 2) helping develop the vocabulary and concepts necessary to understand emergent signaling behaviors 3) providing a forum for discussion of the future directions of this field, particularly with respect to its predictive power and translational potential and 4) generating an interactive forum that engages new investigators and provides opportunities to highlight their research. Broader Impacts. This conference will acquaint new trainees and investigators with recent developments in the field, and provide opportunities to present their research and interact with leading investigators. The conference will broaden participation (including by members of underrepresented groups) in this emerging field of research. This award is supported jointly by the Divisions of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster) and Integrative Organismal Systems (Symbiosis, Defense and Self-Recognition Program)",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     The Keystone Symposia meeting on \"Plant Signaling: Dynamic Properties\" was conceived and organized around the central goal of capturing and promoting the exciting new synthesis of the cell and molecular biology of signal transduction with mathematical modeling and synthetic biology.  This 4-day meeting was designed around the following specific aims: 1) To build a community of researchers elucidating the generic properties of signaling behaviors that transcend the identity of the component parts from which signaling pathways are built; 2) To develop the vocabulary and concepts necessary to establish this community; 3) To provide a forum to discuss the direction of travel for this field, particularly with respect to its predictive power and translational potential; and 4) To convene an interactive forum to involve new investigators and highlight their research through short talks and poster sessions.  Plenary and short talks, a workshop, poster sessions and unstructured informal discussions were all used to address key issues in plant signaling research.\n\n     More specifically, plenary sessions explored different pathways in plants and the properties of signaling sensitivity and environmental modulation, on-off signaling states and reversibility, robust responses in unstable environments, signaling specificity and signal transduction events, as well as how mathematical modeling and computational predictions have progressed our understanding of these signaling systems.  Additionally, a panel discussion was held at the end of the meeting to discuss the future of plant signaling fields.  Thus, the meeting provided a unique forum for scientists working in plant signaling biology, and sought to foster enduring interactions and collaborations between plant signaling biologists and computational modelers and synthetic biologists.  Findings reported at the meeting support that computational models are proving to be useful research tools and may guide the direction of future work in plant signaling.\n\n     There were 109 total attendees at the meeting.  Attendees at this meeting were diverse with regard to gender, ethnicity, stage of career, and institutional affiliation.  More specifically, 41% of the meeting participants were female researchers, and ~3% of all attendees (or ~7% of attendees who were US citizens or permanent residents) self-identified as scientists from under-represented minority groups.  The meeting was highly international, drawing 57% non-US attendees.  Approximately 42% of attendees were students and postdoctoral fellows.  The meeting provided ample opportunity for training and professional development.  Trainees and newer investigators were exposed to dozens of high-quality oral presentations by more senior investigators, who served as models for high-quality research and communication skills.   Plenary sessions also included short talks drawn from submitted abstracts, about half of these presentations were given by students (Rachel Hillmer and Edith Pierre-Jerome), postdoctoral trainees and newer investigators (Drs. Yan Liang, Satoru Okamoto, Michael Wrzaczek, and Cyril Zipfel).  In addition, a workshop featured presentations by junior investigators (Drs. Toyota and Waadt).  Two poster sessions also provided a venue for trainees and newer investigators to share their research and to discuss this research with more experienced investigators.  Finally, the unstructured portions of the meetings and the retreat-like venue provided significant and generous opportunities for productive informal interactions between trainees, newer investigators and more senior investigators. \n\n     We assessed outcomes with regard to attendee perceptions of the quality and impact of this meeting through post-conference surveys sent via email.  We received responses from 58 (53%) attendees.  The survey results demonstrated that attendees felt that the meeting was of high quality and value.  For example, 95% rated the scientific co..."
