Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Alison B. Miller is \"Arithmetic Invariant Theory and Knot Invariants.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Benedict Gross.",
