 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work aims to expand upon previous studies at Axial volcano, particularly a 2002 research cruise there, and seeks to: 1) process the remaining Axial multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles from that cruise; 2) process two \"repeat\" profiles from the 2002 cruise to identify any differences in overall structure after the 2011 eruption and better image the internal and basal magma chamber reflections using an additional 2 km of offset in the new data; 3) reprocess select along- and cross-axis profiles from the Endeavor and Cleft segments of the Juan de Fuca ridge to examine differences in crustal accretion using new methods; and 4) extend these methods to aging crust in poorly and heavily sedimented environments.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed work will provide more detailed images of sub-seafloor structure along the Juan de Fuca Ridge, particularly across Axial volcano. The results will lead to better understanding of the crustal processes at the mid-ocean ridge locations.The results of the project will be used to create a \"ridge to subduction\" virtual tour of plate tectonics through Cascadia for the National Seismological Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno which is visited annually by many K-8 students. A postdoctoral researcher will be supported.",
