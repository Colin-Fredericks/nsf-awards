Participants also will receive an introduction to communication, team-building and leadership skills, and elements of interdisciplinary research.\r\nThe organizers expect to develop a core cadre of approximately 30 young scientists.\r\nThe proposed symposium would build upon, and also act as a follow-on to, a similar symposium organized by the PI?s during the International Polar Year, the \"IPY: Next Generation Polar Research (IPY NGPR) Symposium\". \r\n",

The first NGPR symposium was held in early 2008 and was open to graduate students and new PhDs who conducted polar research during the 2007/08 IPY.

Applications were welcome from graduates conducting polar research in any field of science or engineering. While the focus was on U.S. research, citizens of all countries were eligible. Applicants were required to submit their Ph.D. dissertation abstract; 2-page resume; statement of their goals for polar research and community engagement; and two letters of recommendation.&nbsp; A total of 92 applications were received and selection was based on research excellence and community leadership potential.
