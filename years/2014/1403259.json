Scott \r\nProposal Number: 1403259 \r\nInstitution: University of California-Santa Barbara \r\nTitle: Molecular and Hybrid Simulations of Nanobubble Stability \r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses one of the foremost challenges in interfacial science, the critical issue of long-lived nanobubble stability on hydrophobic surfaces. A successful attack on this problem will have a significant impact on a range of emerging technologies that rely on the ability of stable nanobubbles to dramatically modify the properties of solid surfaces, including anti-fouling and surface cleaning techniques, transport in microfluidic devices, delivery of medical therapeutics, chemical processes involving biological or gas-liquid reactions, surface-induced crystallization, and catalysis.  The PIs will also build on their record of involving students at multiple levels, including those from underrepresented groups (e.g., The Shell group has hosted two minority students from HBCU schools as summer research interns through UCSB's GRIP and SABRE programs), through different programs at UCSB (summer research opportunities for undergraduates and high school students, giving talks in events from minority associations and professional associations at UCSB). In particular, the PIs and graduate students will be involved with the SIMS summer program that involves top high school graduates. \r\n\r\nThe main thrust of this proposal is to critically address several hypotheses for nanobubble stability, using state-of-the-art molecular and hybrid molecular continuum simulation methods that provide a complement to current experiments. The goal is to develop a thermodynamic picture of nanobubble stability because there is some evidence that the nanobubble may actually be thermodynamically stable. To that end, the PI will use molecular simulations to compute free energies of nanobubble formation as a function of bubble size, shape, composition, and solution conditions. The results will quantify the stabilities of the bubbles, and clarify whether and when they are associated with global or local (metastable) free energy minima. These free energies will also be compared with the macroscopic expectation (e.g., based on bulk surface tensions and solubilities) to assess the possible breakdown such arguments at the nanoscale. To achieve these goals, the proposal provides clearly formulated hypotheses, including both thermodynamic and dynamic transport mechanisms, that will be addressed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project seeks to understand the unusual behavior of very small bubbles in liquid water.  These \"nanobubbles\" are much smaller than the diameter of a human hair and cannot be seen with the naked eye.  They form on hydrophobic&mdash;such as oily&mdash;surfaces that are covered in water saturated with air.   Nanobubbles are exciting because of their potential to radically modify the properties of solid surfaces, if they can be understood well enough to be controlled.  For example, they can be used to clean surfaces fouled by microorganisms and proteins, to carry therapeutics and other medical treatments to specific target cells, to enable efficient pumping in \"lab on a chip\" microfluidic devices, and to control and catalyze many kinds of chemical reactions needed for precise synthesis of technologically-relevant compounds.\n\nA major challenge is to understand why nanobubbles even exist.  In general, as bubbles become smaller they increasingly are likely to redissolve back into the liquid surrounding them.  Nanobubbles are so small that they would be expected to dissolve away in a mere millionth of a second.  Yet experiments now unequivocally show that they persist for at least days&mdash;a huge discrepancy in our basic understanding of them. \n\nIntellectual merit.  This project uses computer simulations to develop a detailed molecular picture of the behavior of nanobubbles, in order to develop a theory that successfully explains their unusual properties and mysterious stability.   Work has address two hypothesized mechanisms that may underlie stability.  (1) The first is a dynamic equilibrium model that suggests that gas lost from the bubble apex is balanced by an influx of gas near the bubble contact line due to the hydrophobicity of the substrate.  Molecular-scale computational modeling of this process and hence testing of this mechanism is currently well outside of the range of even supercomputing resources.  One of our major accomplishments was the development of a hybrid modeling strategy that allows for molecular resolution where it is needed, at the interface, but that solves larger-scale transport models away from it, seamlessly marrying the two approaches.  This new multiscale methodology is useful for modeling not only nanobubbles, but a wide range of scientific and technological problems influenced by molecularly-detailed behaviors at an interface.  (2) The second mechanism that we have addressed posits that nanobubbles sit on a molecularly-thin blanket of adsorbed gas, and there may be additional energetic contributions or solvent structuring that are not considered in traditional macroscopic analyses of surfaces.  We have modeled this gas adsorption layer in molecular simulations and characterized the magnitude and directions of deviations from macroscopic theory.  Moreover, we have probed how the layer might form and under what circumstances a bubble-like domain might appear as a result of it. \n\nBroader Impacts.  We developed a powerful new hybrid multiscale simulation methodology that will allow detailed simulations of nanobubble transport as well as a wide range of other problems where interfacial thermodynamics cannot be modeled using conventional macroscopic approximations. Observations from molecular simulations are providing potent clues in the nanobubble stability problem, offering possible explanations for survival times that shortly may allow precise control of these bubbles and hence their deployment in a wide range of exciting new technologies.  On the educational front, this project contributed to the training of three graduate students and one postdoctoral scholar.  The Shell group has also mentored several undergraduates in molecular simulations, of which many have gone on to top graduate programs.  PhD students on this project helped found a campus-wide seminar series for graduate students in the areas of modern simulation advances.  PI Shell has also been active in outreach and other educational activities at UCSB, and in department and campus administrative efforts, particularly those seeking to improve diversity and inclusion. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M.
