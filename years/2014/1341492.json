 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers seek to make high-resolution temporal and size distribution measurements of aerosol composition and size in the Ross Island region, coastal Antarctica. An Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) will be used to provide quantitative size and chemical mass loading information, in near real-time of non-refractory sub-micron aerosol particles such as sulfate, nitrate, chloride, ammonium, and organic carbon species. Additional measurements will include aerosol sizing with overlapping size ranges from 20 nm to 100 um, and particle into liquid sampling for bulk ionic compositional analysis of larger aerosol particles. \r\n\r\nAdvantages in continuous AMS monitoring of aerosol include being able to observe the episodic nature and short duration of new particle nucleation events, thus capturing the extreme variability of meteorological conditions expected in maritime Antarctica. \r\n\r\nThese aerosol measurements are likely to be of interest to other disciplines. Training of a post-doctoral associate, and research experience for a Polar-TREC participant are allied broader impacts.",

These small aerosols are almost always present without the variability seen in the larger sea-salt particles. \n\n \n\nThese high time resolution measurements also revealed several new discoveries that have not been seen before by previous measurements.    On the snow-covered sea ice where these measurements were taken, high wind speeds had a much bigger impact on the number of aerosol particles and the chemical composition of that aerosol than where the air that was sampled had come from. Under higher wind speeds (above 15 mph), we observed a significant increase in the number of aerosol particles and linked that to blowing snow conditions, which was independent of where the air was coming from.  These increase in aerosol particles was not due to the snow itself, which the instruments do not measure, but to aerosol particles mixed with the snow.
