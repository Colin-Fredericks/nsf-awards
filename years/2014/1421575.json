 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasingly widespread use of multicore processors, whose computing power\r\ncan only be unleashed by concurrent software, makes software defects, or bugs,\r\nbecome more common and labor-intensive to detect and repair.  Runtime verification\r\nis a novel analysis approach that extracts information from a running system and\r\nuses it to detect and possibly react to observed behaviors satisfying or violating\r\ncertain properties.  Runtime verification scales well and avoids the complexity of\r\ntraditional formal verification techniques. The techniques developed in this project \r\nwill lead to robust production quality software by providing a scalable alternative \r\nto formal verification that provides many of the same guarantees for safety and security.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a scalable predictive runtime verification framework\r\nfor concurrent software.  A major technical advancement over prior art is that it\r\nnot only detects errors when they occur at runtime, but is able to predict general\r\nsecurity and safety property violations before they actually surface, preventing\r\nbad behaviors from happening by taking proper actions defined by the users.  This\r\nproject builds upon a sound and maximal causal model, hereby providing the provably\r\nmaximum possible prediction power on the observed trace with no false alarms.  The\r\ncore research insight of this work is to explore the maximal causality of concurrency\r\nwith automated constraint solving, which has been studied for decades and is becoming\r\nincreasingly powerful.",
