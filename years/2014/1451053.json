 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing body of research suggests that many types of institutions and experiences contribute to science and technology learning by the public. These include the formal education system, libraries, science centers, citizen science, after school programs, television programs, film and video, newspapers, radio, books and magazines, the internet, community and health organizations, environmental organizations, and conversations with friends and family. It is also important that research about who learns and how they learn from these institutions and experiences is informed by and discussed within the communities themselves. This project focuses specifically on STEM learning in interactive science centers. It invites science center professionals from around the country to contribute to and share findings from an on-going research study designed to better understand the influence that interactive science centers have on youth and adult's long-term understanding, interest and engagement with science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe pair of workshops supported by this grant will engage science center administrators, educators, exhibition and program designers, evaluators and researchers in two sets of tasks. The first workshop, held prior to the start of the larger research project, will examine and focus the research's overall goals and help frame a set of specific research questions. Although no research study can answer all important issues, the goal of the workshop is to ensure that the planned investigation attempts to address the issues and outcomes considered most critical to the broader science center community. The second workshop will occur after completion of all data collection and initial data analysis. It will engage a broad cross-section of the science center community in discussing findings, brainstormind implications and usage, and developing dissemination strategies to insure that the findings of the research reach the broader science center and policy communities. The goal of these workshops is to use the collective wisdom of dozens of active professionals from across the country to develop a suite of strategies for grounding research in practice, incorporating research results into practice as well as bringing important research findings to a broader national audience.",

The research effort itself, the Multi-Institutional Science Center Effect Study (MISCES) project, was funded by the Noyce Foundation and involved a multi-year, multi-city, multi-partner investigation whose research goal was to: Measure and understand how, why and for whom experiences at science centers, schools, broadcast media, print media and the internet effect current and past youth and adult interest and engagement with science.  The goal of this project was to support this research effort by involving a broad cross-section of the informal science community directly in the research planning process.  The main vehicle for accomplishing the project?s goal was the convening of two intensive workshops at critical stages in the research process &ndash; the first prior to the implementation of quantitative data collection and the second subsequent to initial analysis of quantitative findings and prior to implementation of qualitative data collection.\n\nThe direct involvement of the informal science education community in the conceptualization and design of the MISCES research, in particular the wider frame and multiple perspectives from many science centers embedded within the design, were immensely helpful to the MISCES researchers and helped to ensure that field-wide concerns and questions were included in the research design.
