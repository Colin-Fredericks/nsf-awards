 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proliferation of chronic infectious diseases in the developed and developing world demonstrates the vital need to make presently slow and labor intensive laboratory diagnostics cheaper and more portable with the requisite sensitivity and specificity to be deployed as field diagnostic assays. The integrated barcode diagnostic tool developed at UC Berkeley significantly reduces assay cost and time while providing health practitioners with critical new information on disease state for accurate on-the spot screening and treatment of infectious diseases including HIV/HCV (hepatitis C) co-infection.  The proposed work will enable prototyping, needs assessment and collection of customer and industry feedback towards development of the first multiplexed electrophoretic platform for immunoassay of biomarkers from whole blood.   The team's core technology is a three-dimensional hydrogel matrix which enables specific antibody (IgG) capture and detection. \r\n\r\nThere exists an opportunity to introduce an integrated diagnostic platform technology preserving the low cost, small footprint, ease-of-use and portability of current screening diagnostics while adding the high-specificity (accuracy) provided by slow, manual-labor intensive confirmatory diagnostics that are presently run in large centralized laboratories.  The key advances in biologically-functionalized polyacrylamide photo-patterning technology provide a multiplexed barcode blotting immunoassay with simple and fast operation.  Transforming sophisticated and high performance assays into a single low-cost portable tool can significantly advance diagnosis of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Commercializing the barcode blotting technology for rapid (30 min) and multiplexed HIV/HCV screening diagnostics would make a major contribution to improving world healthcare while also providing entry into a commercial market primed for significant growth over the next several years.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF I-Corps Team 282: Project Outcomes Report\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n The National Science Foundation I-Corps program provided us with a grant period in which our team was encouraged to test hypothesis-driven business models while receiving training in entrepreneurship and customer development.  Most importantly, we interviewed over 120 potential customers and partners including physicians, nurses, and public health workers in settings such as hospitals or clinics - both small and large, public and private, ranging from urban to rural locations. We also spoke to hospital administrators, clinical lab managers, diagnostics companies, distributors, NGO representatives, insurers, salespeople, and business development experts. \n\nDue to our technology\u00c6s ability to provide accurate and rapid blood test results, we believed that the allergy field would serve as a good pathway market to entry based upon the frustrations experienced by many patients undergoing traditional skin prick tests.  We learned that although patients did not prefer the skin test, these methods had become gold-standards in the field and that the preference of the physician was more important than that of the patient when it came to technology adoption.  For the majority of allergists we interviewed, a rapid blood test to indicate allergen specific IgE levels was only a \"nice to have\" technology rather than a necessity.  Only 10% of allergy doctors told us that a rapid IgE test would be something that they \"must have\" in their clinic.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nWhat we learned from these interviews was invaluable &ndash; providing customer insights which now guide the development of a commercial product.  As a result of our customer interview process, we refocused our attention towards family practice physicians, which opened up a significantly larger market &ndash; as there are over 400,000 primary care providers in the United States.  We spoke to pediatricians and family practice doctors to determine their largest needs and pain points in clinical diagnostics - and we are now using their feedback to guide our technical development.  Strong candidates for rapid diagnostics performed at the point of medical care include differential diagnosis of fevers of unknown origin, jaundice tests, and diabetes monitoring.  Healthcare providers desire affordable and accurate point of care tests for these conditions to empower their patients with valuable information, minimize wait times, and circumvent the need for a centralized laboratory. \n\nTests performed at the physician office lab represent a $2.5B market with annual growth rates approaching 9%. Sales of in-vitro diagnostics are estimated at $50B, with point of care tests comprising approximately $17B of that market.
