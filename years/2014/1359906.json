 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Seth Cohen of the University of California, San Diego seeks to develop high value catalysts using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are a type of porous solid. By incorporating metals into the MOFs very robust selective catalysts can be developed. (Catalysts are species that facilitate chemical processes, thus saving energy and time.) Catalysis is needed for activities ranging from pharmaceutical synthesis to advanced energy.  The development of new catalysts that can perform important transformations and be readily separated from products, recovered, and recycled is of value for process efficiency and greener chemistry.  The MOF-based catalysis developed in this project will help realize these goals.  This proposal also includes teaching activities involving a Science Policy Internship Program (SPIP).  The SPIP supports undergraduate STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) students at the University of California Center in Washington D.C. This program educates STEM students on the importance of science in pubic policy.  This program has recruited both underrepresented and women students, across the University of California system, to help to create a generation of scientists that better appreciate their role in society and government. \r\n\r\nThe MOF materials targeted in this study are being developed to catalyze reactions where the advantages of a heterogeneous (i.e. solid state) catalyst can be exploited.   In this study chiral substituents, organocatalytic groups, organometallics, and oxidizing metal centers are introduced into several known MOFs to produce single-site, catalytically active species. The project has three specific goals: 1. Modify the MOFs to generate organometallic active sites for transition metal catalyzed transformations; 2. Prepare MOFs that contain redox-active monocatecholato-metal sites that can perform oxidation reactions; and 3. Prepare MOFs with strong hydrogen-bonding groups, including squaramides, that can demonstrate significant organocatalytic behavior. These MOFs are attractive as catalysts because they can easily be isolated and separated from homogenous reaction mixtures by filtration, they contain well-ordered pores for potential size and shape selective reactions, and that they can be used to generate isolated active sites, reducing the chance of unfavorable interactions between catalytic sites.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n \n\n(i)  Overview\n\nThis research program explored the development of a versatile class of materials, known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as solid-state catalysts.  Solid-state catalysts are important materials for accelerating chemical reactions that are used to make fine chemicals, process petroleum products, and obtain pharmaceuticals.  MOFs have the advantage of allowing for tailor-made catalysts that can accelerate a wide range of chemical reactions, while allowing for easy separation and resuse of the MOF from the chemical reaction mixture.  Our outcomes in this project resulted in the development of several new MOF catalysts with very appealing properties for future applications.\n\n \n\n(ii)  Intellectual Merit\n\nOver the course of this project, we developed MOFs possessing unique properties that made them active and effective catalysts.  Some of these MOFs used reactive metal centers or light-activated metal centers to accelerate the desired reactions.  In other cases, metal ions were not used, and only organic molecules were used in the MOFs to achieve catalysis.  The chemical reactions that were accelerated with our MOF catalysts included a reaction known as ?C-H activation?, which represents one of the most challenging and exciting areas for the synthesis of organic molecules (e.g. fine chemicals).  In another example, MOF catalysts performed a ?trifluorethylation? reaction, which is very important in the preparation of next-generation pharmaceuticals.  Overall, our findings substantially advanced the field of MOF catalysts and demonstrated the diversity of chemical groups and chemical reactions that could be performed.\n\n \n\n(iii)  Broader Impacts\n\nIn addition to the chemical research aspects of this project, our project also included support of the Science Policy Internship Program (SPIP).  The SPIP supports STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) students at the University of California Center in Washington D.C. (UCDC).  This program enlightens STEM students on the importance of science in pubic policy.
