 "awd_abstract_narration": "Muscle contraction is a fundamental biological process.  The same molecular machinery that powers voluntary movement, heart contraction and gastric motility is responsible for diverse cellular processes, from cell motility to cell division.  A detailed understanding of this process could revolutionize, among other things, prosthetic design and treatments for heart disease and cancer.  However, understanding muscle contraction is difficult because it spans vastly different size scales.  Contraction starts with molecular interactions that cause the relative sliding of two sets of protein filaments.  This sliding causes subcellular, cellular and macroscopic structures to contract.  Over the past hundred years, measurements have been made at each scale, from classical studies of whole muscle to recent single molecule experiments.  Despite this wealth of data, there is no widely accepted theory of muscle contraction suitable for, say, prediction of locomotor strategies or understanding how molecular defects lead to heart disease.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop a quantitative description of whole muscle, single cells and single molecules.  \r\n \r\nAccomplishing this goal requires the development of 1) models that accurately describe molecular measurements; 2) methods to efficiently simulate these models; and 3) techniques to bridge size scales. This project focuses largely on the first two requirements.  These will be achieved through three specific aims, each to be completed in collaboration with an experimental lab.  The investigators use Monte-Carlo simulations, numerical solution of partial and ordinary differential equations (PDEs and ODEs, respectively) and analytic solution approximations to develop and validate 1) an integro-PDE model of molecular interactions; 2) an ODE model of activation; and 3) an integro-PDE model of myosin binding protein c.  Each step in model development will be tested and refined by quantitative comparisons to experiments. The final result of the project will be a rigorous, experimentally validated molecular model of muscle, which will not only be a critical step toward a bottom-up model of muscle contraction, but will also represent an important contribution to muscle biophysics.  Further, the mathematical techniques and equations used to develop this theory have applications beyond muscle contraction, applying more generally to geometrically constrained chemical reactions that occur in a variety of systems (e.g. adhesion of cells to surfaces, bundling of cytoskeletal filaments and frictional sliding).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMuscle contraction is a fundamental biological process. The same molecular machinery that powers voluntary movement, heart contraction and gastric motility is responsible for diverse cellular processes, from cell motility to cell division. A detailed understanding of this process could revolutionize, among other things, prosthetic design and treatments for heart disease and cancer. However, understanding muscle contraction is difficult because it spans vastly different size scales. Contraction starts with molecular interactions that cause the relative sliding of two sets of protein filaments. This sliding causes subcellular, cellular and macroscopic structures to contract. Over the past hundred years, measurements have been made at each scale, from classical studies of whole muscle to recent single molecule experiments. Despite this wealth of data, there is no widely accepted theory of muscle contraction suitable for, say, prediction of locomotor strategies or understanding how molecular defects lead to heart disease. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a quantitative description of single molecules, single cells, and whole muscle. \n\nPrior to funding, we had developed a predictive mathematical model of muscle contraction at the molecular scale, capable of reproducing a range of experiments performed with variable numbers of molecules, ranging from two to hundreds working together.  This model did not include the molecular machinery that regulates muscle contraction (i.e., turns a muscle \"on\" or \"off\"), or some of the proteins in muscle whose function is still unclear.  Muscle regulation presents a major challenge because it violates a central assumption of our (and others\u2019) mathematical models &mdash; molecules are not \"independent,\" in the sense that a molecule\u2019s behavior is influenced by what nearby molecules are doing.  With this funding, we developed new techniques to efficiently model muscle regulation at the molecular scale.  In collaboration with experimental labs, we then tested and validated this model.  We then used the model to develop, test and validate a model for the function of a muscle protein (myosin binding protein-C) whose function is unclear.  We used the model to explain how muscle contraction changes under conditions that replicate fatigued muscle (elevated phosphate, acidosis).  Finally, we used these models and mathematical techniques to relate a specific region of a muscle molecule to the function of a muscle cell. \n\nThis work &mdash; in addition to providing biological insights into the nature of muscle regulation, the function of a muscle protein, and the molecular basis of muscle fatigue &mdash; has developed a mathematical framework that allows the connection of properties from the molecular to cellular scale.  Such connections are a major challenge in all fields of biology, and are particularly relevant for the rational understanding and treatment of disease, where molecular-level effects can be observed but the connection to the larger size scales at which symptoms occur is unclear.  As an illustrative example, our models were used by another group of scientists to provide insight into the function of a drug used to treat heart disease.  As an additional benefit, the mathematical tools we developed have provided insights beyond muscle contraction; we have used them to contribute to studies on cellular locomotion and intracellular transport.\n\nIn the course of this project, two graduate students and one undergraduate student obtained training and research experience in both applied mathematics and biology.  With the increasing complexity of biological data, scientists need this type of training to use the power of mathematics to provide important and relevant biological insights.  Part of this process, and an important part of this project, is close collaboration between quantitative/theoretical and experimental scientists.  Such collaborations leverage strengths of both groups and open up lines of communication between fields that often do not share a common language.  Therefore, as part of their training, all student trainees presented to biological and mathematical audiences.  The ability to communicate complex mathematics to an audience of non-experts is a critical skill for the next generation; conversely, the future of mathematical science depends on other disciplines (and the general population) recognizing its utility.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sam Walcott"
