 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Professor Lanny S. Liebeskind and his coworkers of Emory University are developing a new, atom-efficient, environmentally-sensitive catalytic system for the production of amides (and peptides), esters, and ketones directly from carboxylic acids.  This new reaction system possesses a number of the key attributes that are desired for environmentally sustainable 21st century \"green\" chemical synthesis: the minimization of chemical waste, the avoidance of hazardous reagents, the use of benign solvents and reagents, the use of environmentally sustainable feedstocks, and the use of ambient temperatures to maximize energy efficiencies.\r\n\r\nThis new reaction system currently under development relies, in part, on the use of non-toxic redox organocatalysts that are easily recycled using oxygen in air.  In combination with an inexpensive phosphite, the redox organocatalyst drives the dehydrative formation of carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-oxygen bonds from carboxylic acids.  The broader societal impact of this work derives from its introduction of a new \"redox organocatalytic\" paradigm for chemical synthesis that establishes an environmentally sustainable means by which hydroxylic reactants, like carboxylic acids, can be transformed into value added materials like amides/peptides, esters, and ketones using \"green\" chemistry principles.  It can positively impact chemical synthesis across various domains (commodities, fine chemicals, biologicals) and its development represents an excellent tool for training students and postdoctoral associates in the rigors of critical scientific thinking and analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "An essential societal obligation of those practicing the science of modern chemical synthesis is the discovery and development of new methods of synthesis that minimize waste and mitigate environmental impact in order to replace industrially necessary chemical processes that generate waste and are poorly sustainable.  One such chemical reaction that is the foundation of many existing industrial processes is the joining of a carboxylic acid reactant with a selected amine reaction partner through the elimination of the elements of H2O.  This \"dehydrative\" formation of amides and peptides from carboxylic acids and amines is of seminal importance in the creation of molecularly-based therapeutics, diagnostics, and advanced materials.  It is used industrially on massive scale throughout the world.  The related joining of a carboxylic acid with an alcohol to form an ester (also eliminating a molecule of H2O) is of equivalent industrial importance.   \nThe major outcome of this proposal was the discovery and development of new environmentally compatible catalytic chemical processes for the dehydrative joining of carboxylic acids with amines (to generate amides and peptides) and with alcohols (to generate esters).  Rather than directly removing the elements of water, H2O, our new catalytic dehydration reactions transfer \"2H\" to oxygen in air and \"O\" to an inexpensive acceptor.  The intellectual merit of this \"redox dehydration\" rests with the discovery of simple organic molecules containing active sulfur and selenium components that function as catalysts for transfer of the \"2H\" of water to oxygen in the air.  The broader societal impacts are found in the development of a general, economical, and benign catalytic process with practical potential to replace currently used, wasteful industrial processes.\n\nOver the lifetime of the award, we have:\n\nDeveloped a general method for the construction of amides and peptides using organocatalytic \"benzoisothiazolones\" and traces of copper to influence the redox dehydration.\nInvestigated the chemical mechanisms by which the benzoisothiazolones function as catalysts.\nDiscovered much more efficient catalytic process for the \"redox dehydration\" formation of amides and peptides using specially designed \"diselenides\" that function as low-loading, organocatalytic oxidants linked to oxygen in air.\nUsed the new \"diselenide\" catalysts for an effective new esterification process.\nInvestigated, in preliminary experiments, the use of the new sulfur- and selenium-based molecules to extend the catalytic \"redox dehydration\" reaction from carboxylic acids and their reaction partners to alcohols and their reaction partners. \n\n\nOverall, the collective experiments carried out under this proposal constitute an important step towards the development of a broadly general, economical, and benign catalytic protocol for the formation of amides, peptides, and esters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lanny S Liebeskind"
