 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research on porosity formation and localization of electrochemical deposition in order to develop an innovative additive process for manufacturing of metal parts without thermal damage. Specifically, the research team will perform molecular dynamics simulation of porosity formation during electrochemical deposition to understand the mechanism of porosity formation in electrochemical deposition, develop a physics-based predictive model for prediction of porosity in electrochemical deposition and conduct experiments to verify the model, test the hypothesis that current density is the determining factor for porosity in electrochemical deposition, evaluate the feasibility of using localized electrochemical deposition to produce functional metal parts from computer aided design models, and establish the process parametric relationships in electrochemical deposition.\r\n\r\nThis research is expected to have a transformative effect on 3-D printing of a wide variety of conductive materials, result in extensive benefits to biomedical, healthcare, electronic, automotive, and metal working industries, and extend frontiers of additive manufacturing. Research results will provide knowledge and understanding to perform layer-by-layer manufacturing of metal parts by electrochemical deposition and enable producing metal parts by additive manufacturing without thermal damage. This research project features multi-disciplinary approach involving manufacturing technology, molecular dynamics simulation, electrochemistry, control theory, and materials science. This multi-disciplinary approach will positively impact engineering education at University of Cincinnati, and broaden participation of the underrepresented groups in research.",
