The project will investigate the surprising observation that adding a small number of needle-like particles in a granular material composed of spherical particles significantly increases the ability of the material to flow.  For very small particles, the investigators hypothesize that the needles and spheres stick together in a way that results in an effective particle shape and size that enables the material to flow more easily. For larger particles less likely to adhere, other lubrication mechanisms are suspected. A series of experiments will be conducted to show how the particle size and the mixture ratio affects flow characteristics.  The experiments will be complemented by numerical simulations that can predict the arrangements of particles and correlate particle arrangements with flow behavior in well-defined model flows.  The project will provide an environment for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the research.\r\n\r\nThis project studies the flow and shear of mixtures of particles consisting of spherical and irregularly-shaped particles.  Experiments will be conducted with canonical geometries, such as hoppers, cylindrical column collapse, and annular-Couette shear, to study the flow behavior as functions of particles size and mixture ratio.  The experiments will tie together several quantities currently used to quantify flow, including the static and dynamic angles of repose, dynamic deflection modulus and flowability index.  Computer simulations will study shear in dense systems of rods and mixtures of rods and spheres to reveal the fundamental mechanisms for enhanced flow whether it is changes in the effective morphology or segregation-induced lubrication.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: Granular materials are systems composed of many large particles for which thermal fluctuations are negligible, and in which particles interact only when they come into direct contact.  As a granular material is compressed, and the packing fraction of the particles increases, the system undergoes a jamming transition from a flowing liquid to a rigid but disordered solid.  The flow of such granular materials is of considerable technological importance.  The flow of granular particles through hoppers, channels or conduits, whether dry or in a slurry, necessarily involves the formation of stress gradients orthogonal to the flow direction due to interactions with boundary surfaces. The transport of such materials thus intrinsically becomes a situation of shear driven flow.  The study of such granular shear driven flow, as the packing fraction increases and one approaches the jamming transition, has been the topic of much recent research.\n\nMost recent work has focused on models consisting of simple spherical granular particles under compression and under shear driven flow. In contrast, this project has focused on the behavior of granular materials composed of non-spherical particles of complex shape, as studied by extensive numerical simulations. Particular attention has been given to layers of rod-shaped and cross-shaped particles, where the non-spherical shape of these particles both break rotational symmetry, and cause the particles to tumble when placed in a shear driven flow.  We have studied the interplay of orientational alignment of particles with rotational tumbling, as a function of particle packing density, particle aspect ratio, and with compressional and shear strain-rates. \n\nFor rods, a surprising non-monotonic behavior was found in the degree of particle alignment as the particle packing increases.  This has been identified as due to a competition between increasing torques arising from particle collisions, and the increasing fluctuations in those collisional torques, as the particle packing increasing.  A surprising behavior was also found as we shrink the aspect ratio of the rods so that they approach a spherical limit; rather than smoothly approaching the behavior of spheres, the particles retain memory of their non-spherical shape, preserving some degree of orientational order, and having a strong likelihood for inter-particle contacts to take place on the flat sides of the rod, even those these are shrinking to zero in length.  These behaviors appear to be related to the hypostatic nature of jamming in such systems, in which soft, or \"floppy\" (low cost in energy), models of small particle displacements exist at the jamming transition.\n\nCrosses have been studied so as to investigate the effect of concave, as opposed to convex, particle shape on shear driven flow.  It is found that the rotational tumbling of such particles in shear flow is very sensitive to this distinction.  As the ratio of the lengths of the two arms of the cross vary, one finds a dramatic change: for a small ratio, the rotational velocity first decreases, then increases, as the particle packing fraction increases, similar to behavior in convex rods.  But when this ratio approaches unity, the rotational velocity first increases, then decreases, as particle packing increases.  This effect illustrates one of the consequences of the concavity of the particle shape becoming important.\n\nBroader impact:  Granular materials, such as powders, seeds, grains, sand, rocks, etc., are ubiquitous in nature and important for a wide variety of industrial processes, from the processing of pharmaceuticals, to transportation of seeds and grains, to materials fabrication. It has been estimated that significant energy loss arises due to inefficiencies in the processing and handling of granular materials, and substantial economic gain would thus accrue from a better understanding of the structural and flow properties of granular materials.

Students have also gained technical experience in using graphic processing units (GPUs) for efficient parallel computing, and had experience communicating scientific results through presentations at symposia and conferences.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen L Teitel"
