 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last thirty years there have been two dramatic breakthroughs in analytic number theory: the use of automorphic forms on higher rank groups, and the introduction of multiple Dirichlet series.  A conference focusing on recent advances around these two breakthroughs will be held at Perrotis College, Thessaloniki, Greece, July 14-18, 2014.  The conference will feature lectures by twenty leaders in the field.  One of the main aims of this conference is to introduce young researchers to this exciting new frontier by suggesting open problems and new research directions.  This award supports the participation of US-based postdocs, graduate students, and researchers without other sources of support.\r\n\r\nThe conference \"Analytic Number Theory and its Applications\" is centered on research by Jeff Hoffstein and his collaborators and students.   Topics to be discussed include the construction of Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series associated to any finite or affine reduced root system, convexity breaking, non vanishing results of L-functions, the description of Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series in terms of crystal graphs, asymptotics of integral moments of L-functions, and surprising relationships between theta functions and multiple Dirichlet series. The meeting provides an international audience with opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas between classical problems in analytic number theory and recent breakthroughs in automorphic forms and multiple Dirichlet series. \r\n\r\nConference website: http://math.umn.edu/~brubaker/jh2014c.html",
