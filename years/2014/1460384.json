 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a RAPID project to fund salvage archaeological excavations on the Walakpa (Ualiqpaa) archaeological site, an important site located on the North Slope of Alaska about 12 miles south of Barrow. This project will support a partial excavation of the structure that has been recently exposed in the current erosion face at Walakpa, and allow for emergency stabilization and limited preliminary analysis of the resulting collections.  The excavation will take place as soon as possible, as part of the structure is endangered by slumping of the bluff due to thawing of permafrost, as well as disturbance by the many curious recreational visitors. It will almost certainly be lost with the first big fall storm of the 2013 season. The construction details and architecture will be documented, as will the distribution of artifacts. Samples will be taken for C14 dating, macrobotanical and wood analysis, as appropriate.  Given the urgency of the situation, the research project focus will be on excavating the undercut and thawing portions of the structure and underlying cultural strata, if present, to avoid further disruptive collapse first, and then proceed with excavation of as much of the remaining structure and associated midden as time and funds allow. Since the immediately available time and funds will most likely not be sufficient to excavate the entire structure, excavations will be carried out so that the site can be stabilized and protected when excavations are forced to terminate for the season, with the intention that additional funds can be obtained for complete excavation and analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWalakpa (Ualiqpaa&mdash;the Western entrance in I&ntilde;upiaq) is an important archaeological site located on the North Slope of Alaska about 12 miles south of Barrow.  Barrow families have long-standing ties to the site.  Dennis Stanford excavated there in 1968 and 1969, which exposed occupations stretching back from Recent Inupiat through Late Western Thule, Early Thule, Birnirk, to an Arctic Small Tool Tradition (ASTt) occupation (Stanford 1976:13, 15).  This was the first site in northern Alaska where multiple distinct cultures were found in layers one above another, making it clear which order those cultures had occurred \n\nIn July 2013, a precontact sod house was discovered eroding out of the Chukchi Sea shoreline bluffs at Walakpa. It was near the part of the site which was known to contain not only Thule and Birnirk materials, but also the most extensive remains of ASTt (Stanford pers. comm. 2013).  It was clear that more damage would occur as it thawed and that a severe storm could destroy the entire structure.  The site and the data it contains was at high risk of disturbance and even outright destruction.  The North Slope Borough, the local municipal government, and the landowner, Ukpea?vik Inupiat Corporation, provided funds to conduct an excavation to record the structure, recover as much data as possible and sandbag the site prior to the arrival of that storm. \n\nIn early September 2104, a severe storm overwhelmed the sandbags, destroyed the house and removed over 11 meters of the site, leaving a dangerous overhanging slump block in front of the deepest part of the site.  A crew was able to document the new conditions and do limited salvage.  In 2015 volunteers helped to get additional samples from the erosion face beside the slump block.   \n\nThis project provided support for radiocarbon dating of 12 of the samples recovered from Walakpa.  The samples dated were from lower levels, although we were not able to get suitable samples from the very deepest levels.  No dates were run on things from upper levels, since they contained artifacts (like metal and even a set of plastic glasses frames) that let us determine they were post-contact to recent, so no radiocarbon dates were necessary. These dates, which run from 675 AD up to 1645 AD, were in order, which confirmed that the levels were in the order they had originally been laid down, and had not been disturbed in the past.  Since there was at least one meter (roughly 39\") of cultural material below the lowest material dated, this also showed that the original use of the site was well before 675 AD.\n\nThe field portion of the project involved local students and local volunteers in the field and in the lab, but the number of individuals who were affected by and learned from the project is much higher than the number who participated directly in the research.   The entire North Slope community is concerned about the loss of their history through erosion.  The North Slope Borough and UIC both provided significant support for the excavation phase of this project.   The radiocarbon dates help put the materials recovered during those excavations in context, and will be very helpful in planning future work to salvage more of the information from this site efficiently before erosion destroys it entirely.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne M Jensen"
