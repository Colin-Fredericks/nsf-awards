 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in relativistic astrophysics and general relativity, with a focus on tests of general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that might be detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and by future space based detectors.  Theoretical studies of sources of gravitational waves funded by this award will be useful to aid detection of signals from black holes and other sources, and also to aid in their interpretation.  Gravitational wave studies can tell us about the nature of gravity, properties of black holes, and properties of the early Universe.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, this principal research topics of this award are: (i) The development of methods to compute the gravitational waveforms from point particles inspiralling into spinning black holes, using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches; (ii) The computation of the effects of radiation reaction on the gravitational wave signals from cosmic strings, which may have been produced in the early Universe; and (iii) The exploration of an explanation of angular momentum ambiguity in general relativity in terms of the gravitational wave memory effect, using approximation methods that have been developed for asymptotically flat spacetimes.",

Gravitational waves have been detected with LIGO over the past few years, opening a new astronomical window on the Universe and providing tests of fundamental physics.

Detection of either of these kind of signal could bring us interesting information, about the properties of black holes or about the early Universe.\n\n A separate focus of the award was the development of our understanding of how the conservation laws of physics become modified in the presence of relativistic gravity.  Energy conservation and momentum conservation are still valid, but the conservation of angular momentum is reformulated and becomes more complicated.  We invented a prescription for how to measure angular momentum, and showed that it becomes observer dependent in the presence of gravity, and showed how this observer dependence is related to an aspect of gravitational waves called gravitational wave memory.  This is an aspect of gravitational waves that may be measured in the next decade.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eanna Flanagan"
