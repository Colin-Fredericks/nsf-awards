 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a proof-of-concept testbed for a larger community-scale infrastructure called WimNet, the first open-access software-defined radio (SDR) platform to advance research and education in 60 GHz wireless networking.  Existing studies of 60 GHz networks mostly rely on simulation or analytical models, which cannot reproduce the sophisticated characteristics of real 60 GHz radio environment. Aiming to fill the experimental gap, WimNet incorporates programmable hardware components, which allow flexible implementation of communications algorithms and network protocols. Users can remotely access the WimNet testbed through a web portal.\r\n\r\nWimNet will facilitate high-impact research and education in the domain of 60 GHz wireless networking across multiple research institutions. Its potential impact includes: (i) accelerating the development of the 5G broadband cellular networks and Gbps wireless LANs, which can alleviate the current spectrum crisis and enable new generations of mobile applications; (ii) integrating with existing NSF-supported wireless testbeds; (iii) engagement of industrial partners to expand the capability of WimNet and extend its impacts; (iv) public dissemination of hardware/software components and test results;  (v) modernizing communications/networking courses with knowledge of multi-Gbps, high-frequency radio systems, and promote hands-on experiences with a reconfigurable radio.",
