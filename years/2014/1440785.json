 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Chicago (UChicago) has built a high-speed Science DMZ network that includes a 100Gbps uplink to Research and Education networks. This network provides researchers with the bandwidth required to collaborate both nationally and internationally at extremely high speeds. The initial experimental build was completed in a non-redundant fashion, which means that a single failure or disruption has the potential to impact every project dependent on the Science DMZ. Further, multiple projects have demonstrated high-bandwidth needs that will quickly congest the singular 100Gbps uplink available.\r\n\r\nTo address these risks and concerns, UChicago is building a redundant Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) System between its main Hyde Park campus and a location in downtown Chicago. This system includes a second 100Gbps capable router that provides UChicago?s Science DMZ network with additional capacity and resiliency. Upon completion, the system will provide researchers with a highly available, extremely high-capacity network foundation that enables them to maximize their scientific productivity. \r\n\r\nAmongst science projects that will benefit are: \r\n- ATLAS collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\r\n- Bionimbus - Open Science Data Cloud Project designed for managing and analyzing genomic data\r\n- The Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) advancing research on the nature of dark matter and dark energy\r\n- The South Pole Telescope (SPT) collaboration ? a survey of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation\r\n- The Urban Center for Computation and Data (UrbanCCD) partnering with the City of Chicago to design and implementation its next generation data analytics platform.",
