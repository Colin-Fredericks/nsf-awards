In particular, wax esters are a highly-valued class of oils used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, fine lubricants, and fuels.  Most commercial wax esters are synthesized from petroleum, and thus there is a growing interest in developing biological systems for the sustainable production of wax esters. The goal of this project is to characterize and modify enzymes involved in the biological synthesis of natural wax esters. The final enzyme in the wax ester production pathway is able to utilize a large array of substrates to produce either wax esters, or smaller esters with properties similar to biodiesel fuel. This project will explore the chemistry involved in these biological processes, and further aims to develop systems that alter the composition and enhance wax ester production using a model microorganism. The results of these studies will provide important insights into the enzymes and biochemical processes involved in these biological oil production pathways, and identify the broad diversity of products that can be produced utilizing sustainable biological production routes.   The need for shift for a petroleum based fuels to sustainable fuels is a topic of interest by K-12 students the broader public, and the proposed activities include innovative activities for outreach to these groups based on the research activities, including Youtube videos.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop fundamental understanding of lipid biosynthesis and accumulation in the model bacterium Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8.  Enzymes obtained from this species have been found to be far more active than enzymes obtained from alternative hosts. The first aspect of the research is related to detailed studies of several key enzymes responsible for key steps in the biosynthesis of wax esters from the fatty acyl-CoA pool. This will include studies to alter enzyme substrate selectivity to tailor the production of specific compounds similar to biodiesel, and general studies probing structural features of these enzymes. The second aspect of the proposal deals with broader metabolism, and includes metabolic studies using RNA-sequence experiments to monitor changes in the cell under conditions of wax production versus wax degradation, both compared to growth under exponential growth where no waxes are being produced. Additionally, key genes will be deleted or altered to determine the effect this has on wax production, especially in light of the redundancy of many of the genes for the enzymes involved in this pathway. Finally, efforts to improve or alter the production and quantities of waxes produced will be pursued in terms of metabolic engineering of a model neutral-lipid accumulating bacterium.  The need for shift for a petroleum based fuels to sustainable fuels is a topic of interest by K-12 students the broader public, and the proposed activities include innovative activities for outreach to these groups based on the research",

Wax esters are used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, or as fine lubricants and have the potential to serve as sustainable biofuels. These waxes can be found in a range of different organisms, including plants, animals and in certain bacteria. Most commercial wax esters are produced from fossil fuels. However, there is a growing interest in developing biological systems that can produce a range of different chemicals through these pathways at industrial scales. To accomplish this goal, we first need to understand how to reprogram these cells and restructure the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these chemicals to tailor the production toward specific target chemicals. As part of our studies, we have been probing the protein environment and manipulating specific regions within the enzymes to understand which aspects of the enzyme environment govern chemical selectivity.</p>\n<p>Our results to date have identified a number of key regions within the protein environment that can profoundly alter enzyme selectivity. This is important, as these regions need to be identified in order to develop new enzymes capable of producing biodiesel through biosynthetic approaches, as an alternative to converting current feedstocks such as seed oils through chemical processes. A recent report by another laboratory has provided the first structure for the final enzyme within this pathway, which has allowed us to revisit our own results and probe the enzyme environment further and in greater detail, which should lead to rapid progress toward these goals. Importantly, this reported structure confirmed that many of our previously targeted changes (selected prior to the publication of the structure), were indeed in the proximity of the active site of the enzyme.</p>\n<p>As another output, our laboratory published the structure of a fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, which plays a potentially competitive role with oil production, and confirmed that our model microbe has several versions of these enzymes. These studies were able to trap the substrate and cofactor on the active site, providing information about how these proteins interact with biological oils to create an environment primed to catalyze the reaction. These enzymes likely play a role in degrading petrochemicals found in the environment in relation to large oil spills, while also converting the chemicals into the less toxic natural wax. These results were also confirmed by our whole cell gene expression studies that illustrate the important role these enzymes likely serve in oil metabolism.</p>\n<p>We also investigated the role that thioesterases play in the biosynthesis of waxes. Thioesterases are enzymes generally associated with degradation pathways, though many current models of wax ester biosynthesis indicate a key role in this pathway as well. We have isolated and characterized the two primary thioesterases from our model microbe, and also deleted each of these genes independently, with no adverse effects on the production of wax esters. Our working hypothesis is that these enzymes are not an important component of the biosynthetic pathways to wax esters, but are essential to other functional roles within the organism. As a final aspect of this aim, we have isolated a number of additional enzymes to reconstruct the full pathway we believe is functional within the cell, and demonstrate that it can function outside the cell as well. These latest results are being prepared for publication.</p>\n<p>As a component of our broader impacts, we have trained approximately ten early-career scientists and engineers as a result of this funding. We have also prepared 3D models of a number of important proteins and biological chemicals, which we have shared with the broader community of 3D printing hobbyists and educators. We view these models as an opportunity to share science with people from across the world, and our models have been viewed and/or downloaded for printing through these shared resources many thousands of times. The PI taught a course on the construction of 3D biological models, and has shared what has been learned with additional educators through a number of online tutorials or direct interactions and communication.
