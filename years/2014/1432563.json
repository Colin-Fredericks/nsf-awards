 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent science education reform efforts (Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action, the AP Biology Frameworks and the Next Generation Science Standards [http://www.nextgenscience.org/]) emphasize the importance of evolution as a major unifying theme in the science curriculum and in understanding life processes.  They further identify inquiry-based laboratory experiences as key to helping students gain a better understanding of evolution and highlight the need for controlled studies to test such interventions.  A major impediment in involving students in the experimental study of evolutionary processes is that the evolutionary process is difficult or impossible to demonstrate in the classroom. Current efforts rely on simulations with limited opportunities to test hypotheses and to learn how science is practiced. This project specifically and directly addresses these challenges through ongoing development and testing of Avida-ED, an educational software tool derived from an experimental digital tool used by scientists to study bio/computational evolution.  It was first developed under an NSF CCLI award (031484).  Activities planned will provide in-depth faculty development through a national series of workshops, and an expansion of an ongoing national study of the effectiveness of this approach for learning about evolution and the nature of science. \r\n\r\nAvida-ED engages students in observation and manipulation of populations of self-replicating, autonomous digital organisms while they are actively evolving.  It is built on top of a proven experimental evolution research platform, so students can perform experiments to test evolutionary hypotheses that they generate on their own in the same modeling system used by scientists. Evidence from on-going national classroom studies indicates the unique value of being able to directly observe evolution in action in this digital environment. Pilot studies show that Avida-ED is effective in (i) overcoming common misconceptions about evolutionary mechanisms and (ii) increasing acceptance of evolutionary science.  This study examines these issues in more detail, including cognitive and non-cognitive elements of active learning when using digital evolution models.  These constitute some of the first  quasi-experimental classroom studies in evolution education.  Other activities planned include a series of national workshops to provide profession development in the use of Avida-ED to over 150 faculty\r\n\r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/",

Built on a digital evolution model system developed for research, Avida-ED does not simulate but instantiates evolutionery processes, allowing students to conduct experiments with populations of digital organisms that evolve by Darwinian mechanisms. Doing evolution experiments firsthand helps overcome misconceptions in a way that traditional lectures and materials cannot. The Active LENS project extended the development and dissemination of Avida-ED to make this possible in classrooms around the world.</p>\n<p>We provided training for faculty in a national series of workshops. Nearly 200 instructors attended our half-day demonstration workshops at professional conferences and another&nbsp;160&nbsp;attended our 3-day intensive train-the-trainer workshops we put on at Michigan State University, North Carolina A&amp;T, University of Texas, University of Washington, and virtually during the pandemic. These, plus an on-line faculty mentoring network, equipped participants to train others, and many went on to do that in their own communities, broadening our impact. We created a 12-part video series in collaboration with our university PBS station, so that others can take an on-line version of our training course. We also created videos of 15 presentations that highlight noteworthy participant implementations and 9 that demonstrate new model exercises. We updated existing exercises through annual additions of our lab book. We made these and other curricular materials, including a new user manual and set of help videos, available through various on-line channels.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">To assess the effectiveness of our training and dissemination efforts, we studied participants' implementations to learn how well they worked in different educational settings. We collected data from classroom use and interviewed instructors about their experiences using Avida-ED to improve student learning of evolutionary concepts and scientific reasoning for the particular learning goals in a wide variety of courses. To get a quantitative measure of the success of our dissemination, we tracked Avida-ED server access and saw usage steadily increase to tens of thousands uses annually. To share these and other results, we gave 150 presentations at professional venues, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), BioQUEST, Gordon Conference on Undergraduate Biology Education Research, Life Discovery Conference, National Association of BiologyTeachers (NABT), Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), and Western Conference for Science Education (WCSE).&nbsp;&nbsp;We also published reports?ten articles overall, with two more wrap up papers still to come?in peer-reviewed journals such as&nbsp;<em>American Biology Teacher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Artificial Life Proceedings</em>,&nbsp;<em>Computer Applications in Engineering Education</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Evolution: Education and Outreach</em>.</p>\n<p>In parallel with these training and research efforts, we developed improved versions of the platform itself. In June 2016, we released a beta version of Avida-ED 3, which involved a complete recoding so that it could run in a browser on all platforms, solving the problem of having to update and maintain separate stand-alone applications for Mac and Windows. June 2017 saw the full release of Avida-ED 3, which now can run on tablets and phones as well as full size computers. We then got to work on Avida-ED 4.0. Among other improvements, it added the ability to set new resource options to provide greater complexity to the digital environments in which Avidians evolve. For example, one can now configure environments with limited resources that deplete as they are used by Avidians. This and other new features allow users to model and investigate aspects of evolutionary ecology for the first time. We released a beta of Avida-ED 4 in 2021 and a final version in 2023. We also developed a software virtualization container that will allow Avida-ED to continue to be usable even when browsers and operating systems change. During the pandemic we also ran summer internships for students to work on programming tasks that supported platform development, to learn about evolutionary computation, and to develop professional skills. Over 75% of the students were members of an underrepresented group in computer science.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Active LENS dissemination was successful not just nationally, but internationally. Avida-ED won the 2017 International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL)&nbsp;<em>Education &amp; Outreach Award</em>. Beyond the domestic workshops we offered, our team and workshop participants put on several invited workshops overseas, including ones in Argentina, India, and Peru. Server logs from the last eight months alone show that Avida-ED has been accessed from 48 of the 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia and from 75 different countries. Avida-ED is free, so even schools in communities with limited funding can have their students learn to conduct evolution experiments with the same cutting-edge model system used by professional researchers. As we have heard from students, using Avida-ED made them feel for the first time like real scientists.</p>\n<p>Links to publications, videos, curricular materials, and to the Avida-ED software itself are available on the Avida-ED web site: https://avida-ed.msu.edu.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;T&nbsp;Pennock</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1432563/1432563_10333618_1688601231219_Avida-EDlogoblkbackground--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1432563/1432563_10333618_1688601231219_Avida-EDlogoblkbackground--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Avida-ED logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1432563/1432563_10333618_1688601231219_Avida-EDlogoblkbackground--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Avida-ED logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Avida-ED logo depicts a stylized Petri dish filled with a grid of Avidian digital organisms.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert T.

Among other improvements, it added the ability to set new resource options to provide greater complexity to the digital environments in which Avidians evolve. For example, one can now configure environments with limited resources that deplete as they are used by Avidians. This and other new features allow users to model and investigate aspects of evolutionary ecology for the first time. We released a beta of Avida-ED 4 in 2021 and a final version in 2023. We also developed a software virtualization container that will allow Avida-ED to continue to be usable even when browsers and operating systems change. During the pandemic we also ran summer internships for students to work on programming tasks that supported platform development, to learn about evolutionary computation, and to develop professional skills. Over 75% of the students were members of an underrepresented group in computer science.\nActive LENS dissemination was successful not just nationally, but internationally. Avida-ED won the 2017 International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL) Education &amp; Outreach Award. Beyond the domestic workshops we offered, our team and workshop participants put on several invited workshops overseas, including ones in Argentina, India, and Peru. Server logs from the last eight months alone show that Avida-ED has been accessed from 48 of the 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia and from 75 different countries. Avida-ED is free, so even schools in communities with limited funding can have their students learn to conduct evolution experiments with the same cutting-edge model system used by professional researchers. As we have heard from students, using Avida-ED made them feel for the first time like real scientists.\n\nLinks to publications, videos, curricular materials, and to the Avida-ED software itself are available on the Avida-ED web site: https://avida-ed.msu.edu.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert T Pennock"
