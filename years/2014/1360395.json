This research will create an integrated trans-disciplinary system of data-driven econometric and numerical simulation models to test scientific hypotheses on how farmers adapt to climate change and how these altered practices are processed through a watershed to affect downstream estuarine ecosystem health (e.g., water quality, hypoxia). An overarching hypothesis is that climate-induced adaptive changes in agricultural practices and ecosystem processes will cause large indirect phenologic effects that propagate through watersheds to estuary. For this work, the ecological concept of phenology is extended beyond its usual meaning of seasonal life-cycle events (e.g., tree flowering) to seasonal events in water system processes. The project approach involves simultaneous collaborative and integrated activities by three research teams: Economics and Policy, Watershed, and Estuary. The Economics and Policy Team includes agricultural and environmental economists, whose empirical models feed and constrain the simulation models that are to be developed and linked by the Watershed and Estuary Teams. The Chesapeake Water System (CWS) is used as the study site because of its rich and long-term record of data. Synthesis of these data with models will enable comparative analyses to reveal broad relationships between human and natural drivers and processes that extrapolate well to water systems worldwide. This research will advance knowledge of: 1) how climate changes influence the timing and type of agricultural practices; 2) how temporal and spatial scales of watershed models influence simulated effects on nutrient delivery; 3) how direct influences of climate change on ecosystems compare to indirect influences that cascade through the watershed; and 4) how alternative management policies - with different rules and incentives - affect farming behavior and thus ecologic health. The effort will also advance understanding of how best to link economic and policy modeling approaches and scales with those of watershed and estuary simulation, as related to maintaining water system sustainability under climate change. Agricultural models of farmer adaptation will empirically demonstrate how spatial and temporal distributions of practices are altered by climate change, allowing transformation of the modeling approach and improving the observational grounding of the models. Further, this work will advance ability to test policies aimed at managing nutrient emissions from agriculture by characterizing conditions at scales relevant for understanding adoption/compliance. \r\n \r\nThe Watershed Team will use process understanding - synthesized from data across multiple watersheds - to assess structural uncertainties in conventional models that are typically ignored in policy applications. The Estuary Team's data synthesis will search for climate-related shifts in timing and amounts of nutrient loading and use numerical simulation models to quantify effects on Bay health. The Economics and Policy Team will apply a novel state-contingent pollution-control approach that incorporates uncertainty. Through the development and linkage of these models, this project will help transform climate-change impact assessment and response, tackle basic knowledge gaps in the understanding of long-term sustainability of estuarine water systems, and develop new tools and understanding that are applicable to other water bodies influenced by agricultural land use. The areas of broader impact for this project include: 1) workforce recruitment and training; 2) transfer of tools and knowledge to environment management agencies; 3) enhanced public understanding and K-16 science education. In the first regard, the project will recruit, train and mentor 8-12 MS and PhD students toward careers in ecology, economics, hydrology, oceanography and engineering with foci on water quality, agricultural sustainability, environmental policy analysis, and climate change. Secondly, the team will continue to work very closely with investigators in USDA, USEPA, USGS, and other federal and state agencies working with the Chesapeake Bay Program to develop better integrated modeling tools for modeling support of environmental management. Interactions with the Bay management community will include regular meetings with collaborators, presentations of findings at CBP meetings and collaborative workshops. Thirdly, K-16 education will be improved through integration of products into a highly successful ongoing NSF COSEE program, including a new workshop for training 15 high school teachers.",

The research revealed that farmer adaptations to climate change will likely change the seasonal timing of nutrient delivery to waterbodies and potentially mitigate impacts to estuaries that would otherwise occur in response to warming. The team used this new knowledge to envision how nutrient management practices on farms might be adapted to further offset impacts of changing weather on nutrient export to tidal waters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Jeremy Testa and graduate student Nicole Basenback found that the volume of low-oxygen (hypoxic) water, a measure of estuarine habitat quality, could be reduced by shifting the seasonal timing of watershed nutrient runoff. Shifting nutrient deliveries 1-2 months earlier resulted in a 5-10% decrease in Chesapeake Bay hypoxic volume relative to conditions with only projected warming. A supporting analysis of observed long-term (~35 year) trends indicated that reduced spring nitrogen loads and spring blooms conspired with warming trends to reduce late summer low-oxygen volumes.&nbsp;Nutrient runoff will tend to shift earlier in the year, if farmers plant and fertilize earlier. Dr. Ariel Ortiz-Bobea used historical USDA survey data to estimate that farmers are likely to plant corn 9.4 days earlier than present day by mid-century and 18.0 days earlier at the end of the century (an average of results from 17 climate models). Therefore, crop farmer adaptations to increase yield under climate change have the potential to offset some of the negative effects of climate change on estuarine water quality. However, this work also shows that crop production has become increasingly sensitive to high temperatures, particularly in non-irrigated areas of the Eastern US.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lisa Wainger's policy analysis team used model results to envision an approach to nutrient management by farms with drainage control, that could serve as a rapid-response to manage nutrients under particularly adverse weather conditions. Weather conditions that tend to lead to the worst water quality outcomes, such as a wet spring, would trigger policy actions, on an as-needed and seasonal basis, to hold water on farms at critical times. Dr. Kate Zipp developed economic models to test which types of farmers would be likely to adopt such practices and found that such an approach could be a cost-effective tool for promoting water quality without taking agricultural land out of production permanently.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The watershed modeling work has significantly advanced our understanding of how landscape features and climate control the movement of water and nutrients from field to stream, and how climate and human decision-making together affect the timing of nutrient runoff. Two SWAT (watershed) models were developed to project how changes in farmer planting dates, temperature, and precipitation would change the magnitude and seasonality of nutrient loads. Dr. Ciaran Harman and graduate student Shuyu Chang modeled nitrogen runoff and Dr. Amy Collick modeled phosphorus runoff in two small eastern Maryland watersheds, each making use of detailed monitoring data. Their results of climate change effects alone showed that the expected increased rainfall intensity would tend to deliver extra dissolved nutrients (both N&amp;P), relative to current conditions. N increased particularly during fall, while dissolved P runoff was elevated during fall and P-laden sediment runoff was elevated during spring. Model results of farmer behavior (earlier corn planting) without adding climate change resulted in seasonal shifts in nutrient runoff. Results from both models were integrated with the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model (through a partnership with government scientists Gary Shenk and Gopal Bhatt), to project future loads and consider policy scenarios. The impacts of seasonal nitrogen and phosphorus load changes on hypoxia in a small estuary, the Chester River, were surprisingly small (&lt; 1 %), but the simulations revealed that the estuary appears more sensitive to direct inputs of low oxygen water from the Chesapeake Bay. Thus, the responses of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia to climate and seasonal changes in runoff will be transferred to the Chester River.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several outcomes of this work are in use or are being evaluated for management application and teaching. Dr. Harman and Dr. Dano Wilusz developed and tested a framework (StorAge Selection functions) that improved the prediction of hydrologic transport of water and nitrate-N in watersheds to better understand lags in achieving water quality goals, and is now widely used. The Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) was engaged in the integrated watershed modeling because it served as a testing ground for ideas that could inform future changes in the CBP management model. A game for students (You?ve Got Kale!) was developed to share research findings about how farm practices influence water quality and the challenges of meeting farm financial and environmental goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/07/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lisa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wainger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609972980050_1.Overview--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609972980050_1.Overview--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Integrated Modeling Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609972980050_1.Overview--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Integrated Modeling Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multiple models were linked to project effects of climate change and future farmer decisions on watershed processes (nutrient runoff) and estuarine aquatic habitat conditions (dissolved oxygen)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Wainger, L.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lisa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wainger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Integrated Modeling Overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609973818870_nitrate_wshed_image--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609973818870_nitrate_wshed_image--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Phenology of nitrate runoff from SWAT model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609973818870_nitrate_wshed_image--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Phenology of nitrate runoff from SWAT model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seasonal timing of peak nitrate load in Chesterville Branch predicted by SWAT under Baseline conditions (black squares) and climate model projections (colored squares) for scenarios of future climate change (Cli) and planting dates (Ag) in response to climate change</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shuyu Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeremy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Testa</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Phenology of nitrate runoff from SWAT model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609975086013_4.Kale_game--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609975086013_4.Kale_game--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teaching portal &amp; farming game\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1360395/1360395_10316348_1609975086013_4.Kale_game--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching portal &amp; farming game\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen capture of educational game created by project available on the teachoceanscience.org website.
