 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cultural anthropologists conduct research on a wide range of important topics, including migration, natural resource management, food security, family structure, resilience after natural and anthropogenic disasters, and the social and cultural influences on health and healthcare. The impact of research in these and other areas depends in part on the methodological rigor of anthropological research. Therefore, enhancing the methodological training of cultural anthropologists strengthens the discipline's contribution to basic understanding of the causes and consequences of human social and cultural diversity and to the development of public policy. To those ends, the Cultural Anthropology Program supports programs that contribute to the training of the next generation of cultural anthropology scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award to the University of Florida supports a community-based methodological training program for graduate students in cultural anthropology. The highlight of the program is a summer field school in Tallahassee, Florida, that will be directed by Dr. Clarence C. Gravlee and Dr. Sarah M. Szurek. The field school provides hands-on experience in all phases of research, from formulating important questions to selecting appropriate methods of data collection and analysis. Students learn and use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods and are closely mentored by faculty instructors. The field school also benefits from a long-term partnership between researchers and community members, so that students also learn about collaborating with local residents and adapting research plans to the needs and expertise of a host community. Over three years, the program will provide intensive training for at least 24 doctoral students in anthropology. The high level of collaboration with community partners also has potential to improve community capacity for research and to enhance public understanding of anthropology.",
