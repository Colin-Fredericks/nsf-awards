 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop scalable solution processed techniques to create unique fast switching electrochromic layers. The novel electrochromic layers will be initially examined for compatibility and performance then subsequently used to construct solid state fast switching windows. Systematic characterization of the solid state electrochromic device will establish which components in the system limit performance.  Upon successful fabrication, the company expects to achieve enhanced  light  transmission  modulation  at  fast  switching  speed s for automotive applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to address automotive applications in improve light/heat control into the automobile and enhance user comfort by replacing existing automotive glass with dynamic automotive glass.  Economic and environmental benefits of using dynamic windows in automotives are clear:   increasing miles per gallon by reducing air conditioning load with enhance light/heat management.  Increasing fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon will decrease oil consumption by one million barrels of oil per day.  It is estimated that replacing standard automotive sunroof glass with dynamic sunroof glass will increase fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon during summer time.   If all the glass in an automobile are replaced with dynamic glass then the impact will be much larger resulting in decrease in oil consumption by several millions of barrels per day.  Still, current dynamic window technologies have not reached their market potential due to their high cost.  The  electrochromic windows are based innovative materials and device designs that achieve fast switching and high contrast while reducing production costs compared to alternate dynamic window technologies available today.  Wide scale adoption of this unique technology will not only enhance market penetration for dynamic windows but establish a new benchmark for performance and cost.",
