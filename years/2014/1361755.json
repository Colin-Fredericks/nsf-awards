 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Phase II operation, the University of Maine Site of the I/UCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) intends to focus its research portfolio so as to advance understanding of plantation growth dynamics and yield and product quality impacts of forest management activities. Many of the problems and opportunities facing the management of forests today bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries.  For technological advances to be made, it is necessary to approach research questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. CAFS has been successful at providing the administrative structure and funding that has allowed scientists from these existing cooperatives to initiate much need cross-disciplinary research in areas of genetics, site manipulation, and growth and yield modeling. \r\n\r\nResearch conducted by the University of Georgia site of CAFS is targeted at increasing the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners. Technology transfer between CAFS scientists and industry and government member personnel fosters rapid implementation of new technologies. Students trained via CAFS research are unique in the forestry sciences because of their applied problem-solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales. Aggressive recruiting for graduate students among under-represented groups will continue to be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline. Opportunities will continue to be sought to involve undergraduate students in CAFS research activities, exposing them to the excitement of forest science and encouraging them to pursue graduate education.",
