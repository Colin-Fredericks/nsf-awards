 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports the Workshop 'Mixing in Rapidly Changing Environments - Probing Nature at the Extremes.' The Workshop is a part of the program 'Turbulent Mixing and Beyond' (TMB). The Workshop is focused on interfacial and turbulent mixing in fluids, plasmas and materials under extreme conditions of high energy density and sharply changing flow fields, and on their applications in nature and technology, from astrophysical to atomistic scales. The workshop will consist of invited lectures by leading experts on hydrodynamic instabilities in fluids and plasmas, contributed talks and posters. The inter-disciplinary and international program of the Workshop will provide an infrastructure for promoting research frontiers, for developing productive collaborations, and for leveraging the community experience in educational programs for graduate and professional education. The results of the workshop will be published.\r\n\r\nThe target problems of the TMB Workshop 'Mixing in Rapidly Changing Environments' (TMBW- 2014) include Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and interfacial and turbulent mixing, active and passive scalar mixing, the evolution of phase boundaries, and non-canonical turbulence and convection in fluids, plasmas and materials, and their applications in fusion, astrophysics, reactive flows, aerodynamics and material science. TMBW-2014 will provide the opportunity to bring together young researchers and seasoned scientists from the areas of fluid dynamics, plasmas, astrophysics, material science, nonlinear physics, and applied mathematics. TMBW-2014 will serve to advance knowledge of fundamental aspects of hydrodynamic instabilities and mixing, and will potentially have an impact on predictive modeling capabilities, physical description and, ultimately, control of these complex processes.",
