Friedrich(2)\r\nInstitutions: (1) Indiana University, (2) Michigan Technological University\r\nProposal Numbers: (1) 1264739 and (2) 1264549\r\nTitle: Collaborative Research: Self-circulating, self-regulating microreactor for on-chip gas generation from liquid reactants\r\n\r\nGeneration and handling of gaseous species with reduced parasitic power consumption and parasitic mass has been a growing challenge in many types of chemical reactors, including micro power sources, on-chip cell culturing systems, gas-liquid synthesis, micro flame ionization detectors, solar water splitting systems, and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC). To address this challenge, a self-circulating, self-regulating mechanism is proposed to generate gaseous species from liquid reactants on demand. The system involves little or zero parasitic power consumption and needs no discrete control system for regulation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis work seeks to understand the process control and dynamics of an integrated microfluidic gas generator with self-circulation and self-regulation functionalities. This work is expected to establish the engineering and scientific foundation for highly-efficient, autonomous, on-demand gas generation systems for many applications. To achieve this objective, the research efforts will first be focused on fundamental understanding of the reactive multiphase flow in a microfluidic network with the proposed self-regulation, self-circulation mechanism. Catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide will be employed as a basic model system to perform the fundamental studies. The dynamics of bubble-driven liquid circulation, self-regulation, mechanism of gas/liquid separation, and reactant utilization will be experimentally investigated. A comprehensive lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) model will be used to study the physics in the gas generator. Bubble dynamics is a focus for the numerical study. The LBM model and the related numerical simulation will be used to provide benchmarks for the experiments and to guide future designs. The micro reactor configuration will then be tested on two applications: high-performance small fuel cells for portable electronics and energy reclamation/treatment of waste water by MECs. The issues related to these two particular applications will be used to establish the foundation for future commercialization.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nEfficient management and utilization of multiphase flow in microreactors have a broad range of applications. The successful implementation of this research could directly facilitate the development of high-energy-density power generation devices based on fuel cells, where hydrogen storage and delivery remain major technical challenges. The proposed approach may help overcome this problem by achieving autonomous pumping and control for on-demand hydrogen generation with little burden on system complexity and packaging. The work could also benefit a series of portable applications, such as portable electronics, implanted biomedical devices, and distributed microsystems with wireless communication capability. In addition, it could also benefit the development of scalable microbial electrolysis cells for hydrogen generation from renewable energy sources, while cleaning up waste water before its discharge. It is expected to further inspire similar approaches in on-chip cell culturing systems, micro flame ionization detector, solar water splitting systems, etc.\r\n\r\nEducational efforts will benefit through the involvement of minority students from the local community. Summer camps will be organized on both campuses to provide local high school students an opportunity to explore the interdisciplinary fields of micro/nanotechnology.",

Efficient management and utilization of multiphase flow in microreactors have a broad range of applications in process and reaction engineering. As an exemplary integrated multifunctional microreactor with automatic circulation and control, the proposed platform will benefit the study of applications that need similar functionalities, such as micro power source, microbial electrolysis cell, solar water splitting cell, micro FID, on-chip cell culture, gas-liquid synthesis, and so on. This fundamental study will have significant impact on micro chemical reactor design and facilitate the development and commercialization of the above mentioned chemical reaction systems. For instance, one of the industrial outreach of this study is to develop a low cost and high energy density portable hydrogen fuel cell which can replace current rechargeable batteries for portable electronics. With the fast growth of portable electronics such as cell phones and laptop computers, the need to increase the energy and power densities of portable power sources is more urgent than ever. The polymer electrolyte fuel cell is an ideal energy conversion device that can use hydrogen as fuel with high energy conversion efficiency and high energy/power densities. Compared to rechargeable batteries, charging fuel cells can be done in seconds by simply replacing the fuel cartridge. Currently, both the laptop computer and cellular-phone industries are investigating fuel cells because consumers demand longer battery life and greater reliability. However, the micro-scale hydrogen storage and generation still remains one of the technique challenges for portable hydrogen fuel cells. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Here, we developed a facile single step process based on organic solvent based electrophoretic deposition to produce polymer-coating free, metal decorated CNT superhydrophobic deposits. We have further developed and characterized a rapid, electric field-assisted growth technique of superhydrophilic and superaerophobic 3D nanodendrite forests of various transition-metal hydroxides with high catalytic activity and electrochemical performance. We expect such a unique and highly-active catalytic surface to be of great value in a microfluidic bubble pumping application. The developed parallel and cross-flow siphoning method shows approximately 27-34% improvement in hydrogen production and 39-60% increase in current density when used in conjunction with a hydrophilic porous membrane in a two chamber MEC.&nbsp; Fabrication of a novel prototype microfluidic MEC from micromachining techniques with 10% platinum/carbon black/CNT electrodes has been shown to work for effective gas generation. A microfluidic cathode has been micromachined and tested for electrolysis based bubble generation. Buoyancy aided bubble pumping has been established and is currently being studied for more efficient control. An improvement of gas generation current has been seen while using the hp-microfluidic cathode in an electrolysis setup. EPD was able to achieve controlled surface modification ? contact angle and internal resistance via solvent control. Start-up performance or Microbial cells was studied and best start up time was observed for anode with a contact angle of 74?. Steady state performance for anode modified microbial cells was observed showing internal resistance affects steady state performance and lowest internal resistances led to higher cell voltages and power. The facile EPD technique that has been developed through this project has been able to prove that EPD is an extremely versatile technique that allows for production of functional deposits of CNTs decorated with active and inexpensive transition metal alloy hydroxide and oxide nanoparticles. Importantly, our research so far has shown that the composition of the co-deposited metal hydroxide nanoparticles is directly influenced by the chronology of introduction of precursor salts during the preliminary preparation process. Given these gains in understanding of the manipulation of composition of co-deposited material, the developed technique can be potentially extended to a range of elements to produce the optimal hydroxide and oxide alloy based nanocomposites for specific tasks. To replace expensive Pt/C, EPD was shown as a viable, scalable route to produce economically feasible catalyst coatings for MEC applications.&nbsp; In addition, the organic solvent based EPD allows for easily scalable and patternable deposits of metal decorated CNT. We have been able to show that wettability of CNT deposits can be easily controlled by the polarity of the dispersion medium used during deposition.</p>\n<p>Hydrophilic CNT depositions with high conductivity were demonstrated by changing the EPD counter electrode. Novel radial EPD method has been used to fabricate stainless steel brushes deposited with CNTs. EPD versatility was shown with depositions on different substrates. EPD was also successfully used to fabricate large scale MFC that operated in 275 mL MFC, thus demonstrating versatility of EPD for different electrode architectures and large scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrophilicity was seen to be an important parameter to improve HER catalytic performance. Galvanic replacement of nickel with low amounts of platinum was shown to reduce voltage for 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> current density by 115 mV.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sunand&nbsp;Santhanagopalan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517094881_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517094881_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Controlled Wettability of MEC Anodes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517094881_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Controlled Wettability of MEC Anodes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CNT deposition and wettability control for MEC anodes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bryan Steinhoff</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunand&nbsp;Santhanagopalan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Controlled Wettability of MEC Anodes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517012083_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517012083_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Superhydrophilic Catalyst deposits\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517012083_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Superhydrophilic Catalyst deposits\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extreme wetting behavior of the metal hydroxide nanodendrite forest deposits</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anirudh Balram</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunand&nbsp;Santhanagopalan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Superhydrophilic Catalyst deposits</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576516842430_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576516842430_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nanomaterial decoration and wettability control\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576516842430_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nanomaterial decoration and wettability control\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stainless steel sheets and meshes coated with CNTs with controlled wettability</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bryan Steinhoff</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunand&nbsp;Santhanagopalan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nanomaterial decoration and wettability control</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517167679_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517167679_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microbial Fuel Cell Operation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1444473/1444473_10236145_1576517167679_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microbial Fuel Cell Operation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Large scale (275 ml) microbial fuel cell operation cycles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bryan Steinhoff</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sunand&nbsp;Santhanagopalan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microbial Fuel Cell Operation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
