The particles are so small that they move in response to various forces exerted on them by their surroundings.  This project will study diffusiophoresis, which is the motion of colloidal particles in response to concentration variations of a dissolved solute such as salt in the liquid.  A microfluidic-based device will be developed that can create and maintain solute concentration gradients in a liquid.  Then, the motion of colloidal particles in the liquid will be observed directly and correlated with the direction and magnitude of the concentration gradient. A variety of particles and different kinds of solute concentration gradients will be examined.  Although there have been theories developed to explain diffusiophoresis, there are few experiments available to test those theories.  The results will help scientists and engineers formulate and process colloidal suspensions that are used in a variety of industries.  The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and will engage elementary school students in demonstrations of engineering principles and applications.\r\n\r\nAlthough colloidal diffusiophoresis plays a central role in industrial and coating processes, and is common around equilibrating or reacting surfaces, it is less well understood than other migration phenomena such as electrophoresis.  Direct measurements of diffusiophoretic mobilities are confounded by the challenges of establishing strong, stable, convection-free gradients in macroscopic systems.  This project will use a microfluidic device that has hydrogel micro-window membranes integrated into its channel walls.  The hydrogel windows are permeable to solute and solvent diffusion.  Diffusion through the windows will allow spatial and temporal solute gradients to be established and maintained across selected channels of the device.  An interferometric technique will be used to measure solute concentration, and colloidal diffusiophoretic mobility will be measured by direct observation of particle motion.  The device will also be equipped to measure electrophoretic mobility of the same colloid.  New phoretic phenomena will be identified and exploited for direct assembly of structure soft materials.",

The success or failure of these products depends crucially on how the particles interact: it is good for milk to curdle when making cheese, but not when a microbial community has taken root. \r\n\n\nA number of equilibrium interactions have long been exploited to stabilize these suspensions and tune the properties of the materials. This project involves diffusiophoresis, which is a non-equilibrium phenomenon in which suspended particles migrate in response to solutes diffusing in inhomogeneous concentration fields.Although diffusiophoresis was first described almost 70 years ago, direct experimental tests have been challenging because gradients strong enough to drive appreciable diffusiophoresis in a lab-scale system simultaneously introduce density gradients, and thus cause fluid flows that overwhelm the effect.While it may seem like this would make the effect unimportant in any real-world application, there is often a small stagnant layer around electrodes and surfaces across which such gradients arise, which can impact the deposition of paints or foulants onto surfaces, for good or for bad.\r\n\n\nThis project advanced scientific understanding of colloidal migration and diffusiophoresis in multiple ways, and developed powerful new experimental tools to do so.Working with microfabricated fluidic devices avoided the buoyancy-driven convection that hampers larger-scale experiments.Moreover, we developed hydrogel microwindow membranes (HMMs) that can be integrated naturally in place of microchannel walls, and that function like microdialysis membranes: HMM pores are small enough that the membrane looks like a rigid wall to a flowing fluid, but large enough that small molecules (salt ions, solvent molecules, sugars) can diffuse through it (figure 1).Flowing different solutions behind each HMM enable chemical concentration fields to be sculpted; for example, a stable concentration gradient can be imposed, and the migration velocity of suspended particles can be visualized directly.\r\n\n\nThis system enabled the direct visualization and systematic characterization of colloidal migration under a host of chemical gradients.
