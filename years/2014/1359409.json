 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas A&M University - Commerce provides opportunities to eight students from community colleges each summer for ten weeks of research on topics in astrophysics, astronomy, computational physics, engineering physics, optics, material sciences and nuclear physics. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have written a research report and presented the results of their work in a talk. \r\n\r\nThis REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. Additionally, the site focuses on providing research opportunities to students from community colleges and assists them with the transition to a four-year college. The site has put strategies in place to ensure that non-traditional students, many of whom have families, are able to participate in a summer research experience.",
