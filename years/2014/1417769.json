 "awd_abstract_narration": "Offering meaningful and motivating engineering contexts, such as robotics, within science and math courses constitutes a compelling strategy to address the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards for Math while enhancing science and math learning for all students. Using design-based research, with teachers as design partners, the project will create and refine project-based, hands-on curricula such that science and math content inherent in robotics and related engineering design practices are learned. To provide teachers with effective models to capitalize on robotics for elucidating science and math concepts, a design-based Professional Development program will be built using principles of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). To ensure that teachers are well prepared, research-based practices and features of effective Professional Development will be adopted. Experts in robotics, engineering, education, curriculum design, and assessment--with experience in K-12 education, training, and outreach--have formed an interdisciplinary team to make robotics central to and sustainable in middle school science and math classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe research questions addressed in this project are qualitative in nature as appropriate for design research questions. The methodologies include teacher needs assessment, teachers' perceptions of robotics, pre and post testing, classroom observations, and surveys. Examples of the research questions are:\r\n\r\nWhat characteristics of robotics  promote effective learning of middle school science and math?\r\n\r\nWhat elements of Professional Development engender teachers' TPACK of robotics and link it with classroom science and math?\r\n\r\nWhat are student prerequisites to effectively use robotics in science and math learning? \r\n\r\nWhat are the gains in students' STEM engagement, interest, persistence, and career awareness? \r\n\r\nThe robotics curriculum will include physical science used in robot performance expectations and motion stability.  Additionally the curriculum will include the engineering design process consisting of problem definition, solution development, and design improvement. Robotics provides opportunities to support science and engineering practices of the Next Generation Science Standards such as developing and using models, planning and conducting  investigations, designing solutions, and analyzing and interpreting data.  The project will be aimed at middle school students and will provide substantial teacher professional development to implement the new curriculum modules. The partner schools have student bodies drawn from a diverse student population in New York City.",

Teachers were supported in developing robotics-enhanced science and math curricula and its classroom implementation to enhance teaching and learning for female, Black, and Hispanic students and those from low-income families. Each year (2015-2017), a three-week summer professional development (PD) workshop, with engineering facilitators as mentors, supported teachers to: (1) learn to build and program LEGO robots; (2) create and implement standards-aligned robotics-based science and math lessons (30+ lessons); and (3) develop, practice, and examine optimal pedagogical approaches for science and math learning using robotics through the mastery of TPACK. After the summer PD, a follow-up program was sustained during the school year through structured opportunities for teachers to collaborate with project personnel that scaffolded the instruction of new teaching practices. Specifically, each participating teacher taught at least five robotics-based science and math lessons to students as part of their regular academic curriculum. These robotics lessons were delivered to over 2,000 students, many of whom had not been exposed to robotics previously. The project's researchers visited the PD participants at their schools weekly to observe the classroom implementation of robotics-based lesson. Moreover, researchers supported the participants to: conduct lessons, help troubleshoot any hardware and software issues faced during lesson implementations, and carry out class discussions about robotics-based lessons. The sustained academic year follow-up imparted to the teachers the technical knowledge and skills of robotics as well as an understanding of when and how to use robotics in science and mathematics teaching.<br /><br />Survey, focus group, content knowledge, observation, and artifact data was collected throughout the project. Based on data collected at the beginning of the PD workshops, teachers' comfort, self-efficacy, and trust level for using robotics in teaching was low. When teachers were well supported and developed TPACK, students were able to improve their understanding of abstract content knowledge in physics, math, and life sciences as compared to conventional pedagogical techniques. Statistically significant improvements were observed in student learning with robotics-based activities versus non-robotics activities, particularly in science classrooms.<br /><br />Beginning in the fall of 2018, the project focused on utilizing recommendations from prior years of study and enhancing the PD by supporting teachers to develop mastery of the three-dimensional (3D) learning framework of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Bybee's 5E Instructional Model (5E) to create 10 lessons, coined NGSS-plus-5E Robotics Lessons, rated by using the NGSS EQuIP and 5E ILP rubrics.<br /><br />Broader Impact: A significant proportion of the DR K-12 project teachers are from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines (the 41 participants included: 25 female, 7 Black, and 4 Hispanic teachers). Each participating teacher from the PD program received five LEGO EV3 kits for use in their classes. These kits stay with the teachers at their schools for use in their classrooms. Project teachers have impacted classroom teaching and learning of over 2,000 students who included approx. 46% female and approx. 76% from racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Six DR K-12 teachers in the summer of 2018 and three DR K-12 teachers in the summer of 2019 participated in a PD program focused on exploring the 3D model of the NGSS and the 5E instructional model. These teachers served as master teachers during multi-day summer PD workshops that disseminated their lessons to additional teachers (11 in 2018 and 20 in 2019). The teacher participants have presented their classroom experiences and challenges at several conferences and workshops, e.g., 2018 ASTE Northeast Meeting, 2019 ASEE Fall MidAtlantic States Conference, and 2020 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition. Project's curriculum development, PD, classroom implementation, and robotics research activities have led to over 70 scholarly educational and technical publications (book chapters: 3, journal articles: 12, and conference proceeding papers: 58). Moreover, the DRK-12 CADRE site has featured two spotlights on this project.&nbsp;<br /><br />The PIs, graduate student researchers, and engineering education research personnel of the project disseminated robotics educational activities through workshops, seminars, and expos. Ten graduate students and engineering education researchers supported under the project (for various durations) engaged in robotics education, lesson development, and pedagogy activities with project teachers. These activities broadened the training and education of the researchers, sensitizing them to the needs of K-12 constituencies and enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of the relevance of their research to the K-12 environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/18/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vikram&nbsp;Kapila</p>\n</div>\n<div
