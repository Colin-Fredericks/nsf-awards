 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to work on several questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry studies solutions of many polynomial equations in many variables.  Understanding this problem is of fundamental importance in many sciences, in engineering, and in other disciplines as well. It is often difficult to determine whether to expect any solution, finitely many solutions, or infinitely many:  in the last case  one wants to know how many degrees of freedom one has in describing the solutions. One can study the solutions  geometrically, or algebraically, by investigating certain functions on the solution space that form what is called a commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a close  connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that is very valuable. The problems proposed for study are long standing and of fundamental, central importance.  The results obtained will be disseminated by journal and book publication, lectures at  conferences and workshops, and via the internet. There is a strong educational component. The principal investigator has had thirty-nine Ph.D. students including fourteen women (and has five  other Ph.D. students currently, including four women, one of whom is African-American), and has served as mentor to fourteen junior faculty members, of whom six were women.  This level of activity will continue.  The PI will integrate undergraduate students into his research.\r\n\r\nThe PI will investigate several long standing questions in the theory Noetherian rings. One is to prove Stillman's conjecture bounding projective dimension, which Tigran Ananyan and Hochster have done in characteristic not 2, 3 for degree at most four.  Another is to continue the development of tight closure theory:   Neil Epstein and Hochster have developed a new version with many of the properties of the original theory that gives a smaller closure, is defined in both characteristic p and equal characteristic  0, and commutes with localization. This theory raises new questions while offering insight into existing ones. Jointly with Bhargav Bhatt, Hochster has given a new proof of the positivity of Serre intersection multiplicities over regular rings in positive characteristic using an idea that  has promise for  solving the more than fifty year old problem of settling the general case in mixed characteristic.  Other directions include the relatively recent theory of quasilength and content of local cohomology, finiteness of support of local cohomology, Lech's conjecture and generalizations, a new approach to the long standing direct summand conjecture, and the geometry of certain algebraic  sets associated with matrices. A number of these problems are intended for collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral faculty.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "If one has a system of equations, one may study the solution set as a geometric object or create an abstract algebraic system called a commutative ring in which the equations are forced to have a solution.  The algebraic properties of this ring and the geometric properties of the solution set are intertwined.  Working in this generality, one can get information about solutions over the complex numbers by studying instead solutions in other rings, which can include finite rings.  \n This idea has been refined into a systematic technique called tight closure theory.  During the interval of the grant, in collaboration with graduate students, postdoctoral faculty, and others, the principal investigator obtained many new results about this theory, including results on elements used to test tight closure in new situations, and work on extending the theory to study problems over the integers and related rings. \nThe study of polynomials in many variables is at the center of research in commutative algebra. A great success of the project was the complete proof, in joint work with Tigran Ananyan, of Stillman's conjecture, a long standing problem bounding certain aspects of the behavior of polynomials.  Much stronger results were obtained, and they can be applied very broadly.  Unexpectedly, if one has a bound on the number of polynomials and their degrees, but no bound on the number of variables involved, one can still find a relatively small number of polynomials with very good behavior (called a regular sequence) such that the original polynomials are all expressible in terms of the regular sequence.  In fact, one can do this so that every subset of the sequence generates a prime ideal (ideals are closed under in addition and multiplication by any element of the ring; prime ideals have the property that when the product of two elements is in the ideal, at least one of them is in the ideal as well).  This permits one to transfer a host of problems from the original large ring to a polynomial ring in a much smaller number of variables, and enables one to bound far more invariants than in the original Stillman problem. A new theory of strength of polynomials was developed, and has itself become a central object of study in this area. Many new avenues for research have opened up.  Progress was made on many other related problems.  One of them is involves counting the elements of a given degree in an ideal generated by quadratic polynomials. There was further progress on the understanding and use of  lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences.  When two sets defined by algebraic equations meet at a point, an intersection multiplicity can be assigned to that point.  Lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences give information about the behavior of these intersection multiplicities, and can also be used to study other long open questions.  There is more about this in the discussion of broader impact just below.\n Broader impact: intellectual merit. A great deal of progress was made on Stillman's conjecture, including the development the new theory of strength of polynomials, in modifying and extending tight closure theory,  in understanding the behavior and uses of lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences, and on several related problems.
