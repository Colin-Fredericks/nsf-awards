Some solid progress has been made in areas of campus infrastructure, but all too often these efforts fall short.

The first issue is  knowledge exchange and best practice. Having staff at each layer of the campus, regional  and national layer equipped with correct skill sets and resources to call upon for  resolution is paramount.

Secondly, having a widely deployed and easily accessible monitoring and  measurement infrastructure is required for success.\r\n\r\nOARnet is convening a forum for regional stakeholders to articulate needs, solutions  and best practices via a workshop series.  Secondly, OARnet is providing technical engagement and knowledge exchange directly with stakeholders and is developing the \"human network\" of support  amongst the stakeholders.
