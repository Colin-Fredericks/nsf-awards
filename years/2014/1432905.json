 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACM MobiHoc conference is the leading international conference on the theory and practice of mobile multi-hop wireless networks. It invites research contributions addressing the challenges in the area of multi-hop wireless networks, ranging from cognitive radio networks to ad hoc networks. The conference features a high-quality technical program, with an acceptance rate of around 10% out of around 250 submissions. It has a single-track session, which offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that foster technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants. MobiHoc is also an international conference that stimulates exchanges between various international research communities. \r\n\r\nThis award will help increase the representation and participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 20 or more travel grants limited to a maximum of $750 each. By creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this award will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, providing mentoring opportunities, as well as the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral positions which will help the students advance in their research career.",
