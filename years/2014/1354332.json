 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many infectious diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that are transmitted from wildlife.  One important example is Lyme disease, in which the bacterial pathogen lives inside small mammals, such as the white-footed mouse, and is transmitted to people by ticks that first bite an infected mouse and then a person. Human risk of Lyme disease increases with the abundance of white-footed mice.  Recent data collected by the investigators suggest that mice infected with the Lyme disease bacterium live, on average, 17% longer than do uninfected mice.  This is an unexpected finding, given that the bacterium causes illness in people and other animals. It is important because longer life spans likely result in larger populations of infected mice. How might the bacterium increase life span in mice and what are the consequences for disease transmission to other mammals (including humans) and for the forest ecosystem?\r\n\r\nThis research will experimentally determine the effects of the Lyme bacterium on: (1) mouse survival and abundance; (2) mouse foraging behavior; (3) how commonly mice are bitten by ticks; (4) the rate at which other (non-mouse) hosts for the tick become infected; and (5) the ability of mice to control populations of an exotic forest pest, the gypsy moth.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide both content material and research experiences for the Community Science program at the University of Pennsylvania.  This program is designed to increase the understanding of biology by high school teachers in inner-city Philadelphia schools and to expose high school students to scientific research and careers in science. \r\n\r\nLyme disease is a common and serious problem for humans in North America and elsewhere.  The investigators will develop and test a vaccine to protect mice species from the pathogen that causes the disease. If this vaccine works as expected, it may reduce transmission of the pathogen to humans.  Through a carefully designed experiment on wild mice, the investigators will be able to evaluate both the intended and potential unintended consequences of wildlife vaccination.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost infectious diseases of humans are transmitted to us from animal hosts like wild or domesticated mammals or birds.  Lyme disease and associated tick-borne diseases are among these so-called zoonotic diseases.  Prior research has demonstrated that white-footed mice are the principal source of infection of the blacklegged tick vector with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.  Yet almost nothing is known about the effect of Lyme disease bacterial infection on the mouse hosts.  We developed a vaccine against Lyme disease, and a sham-vaccine used as a control, and deployed the vaccine and control in six natural populations of white-footed mice.  Our overarching goal was to ask whether infection with the Lyme bacterium affects key behavioral and demographic features of the mice, with potential feedbacks to important ecological and epidemiological outcomes.  We found that the bacteria had little or no effect on the life span or reproduction of mice, had subtle but important effects on mouse foraging on seeds and gypsy moths (an introduced forest pest), and had strong effects on the number of ticks infesting the mice.  Mice that were healthier by virtue of having been vaccinated against Lyme bacteria had fewer ticks, which could result in a positive feedback loop, with lower infection causing lower exposure.  Vaccination of mice could therefore protect human health both directly, by reducing infection prevalence in ticks that could bite us, and indirectly, by reducing exposure rates of the mice themselves.  These results are important particularly in light of ongoing efforts by other researchers to determine whether releasing genetically modified mice that resist infection might comprise an effective means of reducing human exposure to Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard S Ostfeld"
