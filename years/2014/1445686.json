 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a cooperative research effort by Dr. Nikhil Gupta, Polytechnic University of New York with Dr. Atef Daoud, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute, Helwan, Egypt. They will study \"Casting and Characterizations of Zn alloy Based Composite Foams for High Energy Absorption\". The goal of the project is to develop light-weight and low-cost energy absorbing foams that are useful in a variety of industrial applications. These foams will be manufactured using fly ash, thereby recycling an industrial waste material while also reducing cost. \r\n\r\nThe study will focus on developing a low cost synthesis method for Zn-alloy composite foam, characterizing the synthesized composites for a wide variety of loading conditions and applications, and studying the failure mechanisms. The high density of Zn-alloys is a limitation in several significant applications, so the development of lightweight composite foams will help broaden the applications for these materials. The use of fly ash cenospheres as hollow particles will provide a valuable mechanism to use this industrial waste material and also reduce the cost of the composite. The synthesis work will be led by the Egyptian team, working on producing composites containing high volume fraction of fly ash cenospheres (up to 50% in volume). The characterization will be led by the American team and will include compressive, tensile, vibration, impact, and high strain rate compressive testing of materials. Numerical simulations will be conducted on the composite foam microstructure to obtain an estimate of the mechanical properties. Both groups have complementary expertise and facilities to help ensure the effectiveness of this collaboration. \r\n\r\nThe key intellectual merits of the project include development of lightweight Zn-alloy composites, understanding of mechanical properties of Zn-alloy composites and their strain rate sensitivity, and knowledge of failure mechanisms of these composite foams. It is potentially very valuable to develop a low cost material that is also lightweight enough for many industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThis project's broader impacts include the cross cultural exchange and intellectual development produced by bringing the complementary expertise of these two teams from two countries together. The training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as junior scientists on both teams will be very valuable. The U.S. team will also integrate an education component with the research, building upon existing collaborations to develop a k-12 educational video, and both teams will ensure a wide dissemination of the research results. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded through the US-Egypt Joint Science and Technology Fund Program. Support for the U.S. side of these cooperative projects is provided to the National Science Foundation by the U.S. Department of State. The Egyptian Government provides support for the Egyptian side of the collaboration.",

Syntactic foams are hollow particle filled composite. The introduction of hollow particles results in embedding porosity in the matrix, which is zinc in the present case, without having adverse effect on mechanical properties. Apart from studies on Zinc matrix composites, a number of technologies were developed in the project that can have significant impact on the materials science and materials characterization fields. One of the examples is the development of a vibration test method and equipment that has been used to characterize a number of other materials. The method is able to provide material modulus, which is difficult to measure from tensile or compression tests. Zinc-glass hollow particle (microballoon) syntactic foams developed in this work allowed advancing fundamental understanding of structure property correlations for these materials to utilize their weight saving potential. One of the major challenges is to preserve the fragile hollow particles during synthesizing syntactic foams. Two methods were developed to synthesize zinc matrix syntactic foams with high quality. The first process was based on powder metallurgy method, where two and three-phase syntactic foams were synthesized using metal powder and hollow particles mixed together in a die and heated above melting point of zinc. The second method was based on melt infiltration. These methods allow synthesizing syntactic foams with desired volume fraction of syntactic foams to obtain the properties desired by a given application. Heat treatment processes are developed for these zinc matrix composites in order to obtain optimized properties. A number of different heating and cooling cycles were studied for their effect on microstructure and mechanical properties to provide a deep understanding of microstructure evolution and its relationship with mechanical properties. The results show that the zinc matrix syntactic foams may provide over 30% weight saving in several applications due to their high mechanical properties and low density. It is also observed that the reduced consumption of zinc makes these materials more environmentally friendly. The project also included a number of educational programs, where undergraduate and graduate students were involved. The opportunity provided by the project was also extended to summer high school research interns. Training of students included their direct involvement in research and co-authorship of publications. The project also included researchers from Egypt and resulted in recruitment of an Egyptian PhD student, who will continue some of the future directions of this project at NYU funded by other sources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nikhil&nbsp;Gupta</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423235540_plw-ZA-8-2017-6-19_X200_8--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423235540_plw-ZA-8-2017-6-19_X200_8--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zn-syntactic foam 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423235540_plw-ZA-8-2017-6-19_X200_8--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zn-syntactic foam 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hollow glass particles dispersed in Zn alloy ZA8.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nikhil Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nikhil&nbsp;Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zn-syntactic foam 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423321258_plw-ZA-8-2017-6-19_X200_12--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423321258_plw-ZA-8-2017-6-19_X200_12--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zn-syntactic foam 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423321258_plw-ZA-8-2017-6-19_X200_12--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zn-syntactic foam 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hollow glass particle dispersed in Zn alloy matrix to make lightweight syntactic foams.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nikhil Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nikhil&nbsp;Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zn-syntactic foam 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423444256_ZA-8_untestedspecimen-4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423444256_ZA-8_untestedspecimen-4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zn-syntactic foam 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1445686/1445686_10339050_1538423444256_ZA-8_untestedspecimen-4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zn-syntactic foam 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Zinc alloy matrix syntactic foam microstructure showing dispersed hollow particles in a matrix and precipitates in the interparticle region.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nikhil Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nikhil&nbsp;Gupta</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zn-syntactic foam 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
