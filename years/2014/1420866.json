 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer systems are pervasive in all aspects of modern society.  The\r\nsoftware running on these systems, however, is difficult to implement\r\ncorrectly, and many failures occur after software is already released to\r\nthe public.  Unfortunately, these \"post-deployment\" failures are often\r\nthe most difficult to fix.  Failing runs are difficult to reproduce and\r\nanalyze, as information about these failures is much more difficult and\r\ncostly to obtain than failures occurring before software release.  The\r\nPI's research will address this problem by making post-deployment\r\nfailures more informative without sacrificing the end-user experience.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will tackle this problem on two fronts.  First,\r\ndeployed programs will perform low-cost, customizable tracing to enhance\r\ncore memory dumps produced by failures.  The project will investigate methods\r\nusing both static and dynamic analysis to reduce the cost and improve\r\nthe utility of traced information.  Second, the enhanced memory dumps\r\nwill require development of powerful new automated postmortem analyses\r\nto partially automate the process of debugging and program\r\nunderstanding.  These analysis results can then be used to further\r\ninform useful tracing strategies via dynamic feedback from previous\r\nfailures.  Thus, information about a particular post-deployment fault\r\ncould continually improve as more failures are observed.  This automated\r\niterative improvement of postmortem analyses has the potential to\r\nsubstantially reduce effort required to fix post-deployment faults, thus\r\nleading to faster and more accurate patches, resulting in greater\r\nreliability for the software we all rely upon in our daily lives.",
