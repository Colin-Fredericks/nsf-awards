The conference will feature ten plenary speakers with plenty of time between talks to encourage discussion and the interchange of ideas.  The key areas represented in the conference will be Metric Geometry, Geometric Flows, Ricci Solitons, Minimal Submanifolds,  and the Geometry of Partial Differential Equations.  The overlap between these areas makes very real the possibility for cross-collaboration among the participants.\r\n\r\nThe Smoky Cascade Geometry Conference  features important areas of geometry and geometric analysis with leading researchers as speakers. The  funding  helps to involve early-career mathematicians (including graduate students and postdocs). Particular attention is paid to identifying and supporting women and other members of underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThe webpage for the conference can be found at: https://googledrive.com/host/0B_keKNxvwJfwRV9MdTdlTl9fT0U/Smoky%20Cascades%20Geometry%20Conference.htm",
