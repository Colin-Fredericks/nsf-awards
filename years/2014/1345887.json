 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of a family of ?smart? automation elements that can be interlinked to provide robotics for a wide range of purposes at a significantly lower cost than current solutions. The concept uses autonomous telescoping struts and interconnecting hubs that can be readily assembled into smart mechanisms. The struts include a novel compact transmission called a ball rotor that is capable of very high mechanical advantages in a single stage. Each strut has an independent, programmable, control system that communicates with the other struts it is linked to over an embedded network providing a multitasking control system for the robot?s programmed motions. The new device will be more capable than existing alternatives and less expensive because it is simpler.  This project will test the viability of the concept by producing and testing functioning prototypes of the basic components involved in the technology. The proposed research focuses on understanding the performance of the struts.  These will be tested, measured and modeled to ensure that the ranges of useful working speeds and loads are known, stresses are sustainable, and material limitations are understood ? all necessary to ensure a dependable working device.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is tied to versatility, ease of programming, greater capabilities and (projected) significantly lower costs of this novel automation solution.  We expect early adopters to include automation suppliers (ease of assembling customized mechanisms, and lower costs), manufacturing (readily assembled simpler automation for productivity boosts), and the academic market (students re-use autonomous struts in different configurations). The lower cost will also enable applications in many activities that are currently shut out of automation by the expense and need for specialist knowledge.  Our vision is to trigger the development of a vast range of useful, smart mechanisms by making the basic components inexpensive and user-friendly. This will parallel the impact of PCs when they evolved from, expensive, specialized mainframes into the devices that the general public relies on daily. Democratizing access to robotics is crucial to increasing the number of minds that apply robotic solutions in non-traditional areas, opening new markets. It could preserve an economic edge for the US, especially in a global race-to-automate. Lower-cost, and easily implemented robotics will improve US competitiveness vs. low-cost foreign labor. This is key to improving manufacturing potential in the US, and creating new higher value jobs.",
