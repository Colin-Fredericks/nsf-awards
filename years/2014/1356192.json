 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eco-DAS (Ecological Dissertations in the Aquatic Sciences) symposia bring together individuals within 1 year of receiving their PhD in the aquatic sciences. Previous symposia were held&#8232;in 2008, 2010 and 2012. To date, this award has supported 107 participants and 10 mentors.\r\nThis project will continue the Eco-DAS series with three new symposia to be held in 2014,&#8232; 2016 and 2018. Each symposium will support approximately 35 participants and up to 5 mentors, and will result in publication of a formal proceedings volume. The project will pay &#8232;the direct costs of the symposia (travel, accomodations, food, event coordination), for preparation&#8232; of the symposium proceedings, and for evaluation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe proposed symposia will:&#8232; \r\n1. Foster sustained, cross-disciplinary interactions among top new researchers in ecological oceanography and limnology.&#8232; \r\n2. Help to build a trusted network of colleagues with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and&#8232; expertise.&#8232; \r\n3. Challenge participants to explore new ideas with self-organized author teams of their peers.&#8232; \r\n4. Familiarize new researchers with the diversity of research funding, and introduce them&#8232; to representatives of funding agencies with whom they will interact in future.&#8232; \r\n5. Foster mentor relationships with more established scientists. &#8232;\r\n6. Address the requirements for professional success of new researchers through targeted discussions. \r\n7. Provide valuable feedback to the funding agencies by identifying needs and recommending directions for future research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nFormal evaluations indicate that the Eco-DAS symposia significantly increase career confidence of the participants. Eco-DAS dramatically increases participants? access to a network of&#8232;trusted expertise, including their peer group as well as senior and near-peer mentors. This trusted network also enables participants to investigate alternative possibilities for a productive science career. Participants meet NSF program managers and have the opportunity to ask direct questions regarding funding opportunities and the funding process. They engage in discussion of emerging issues in the aquatic sciences, and provide feedback to NSF. Participants receive training in team leadership, and instruction and practical experience with collaboration tools.\r\nFor many, this is their first experience with leading or even working in a collaborative team&#8232;of equals. Interdisciplinary collaborations are actively encouraged through the publication &#8232;of a formal proceedings volume for each symposium. The proceedings chapters are not merely tools to encourage collaboration: they are a substantive contribution to science, and benefit &#8232;the participants by disseminating their creative ideas. The three additional symposia are very likely to have a significant positive impact on more than 100 new aquatic scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn ecological scientist's most important asset can be an extensive professional network that allows the scientist to tackle problems that could not possibly be solved alone.  The Ecological Dissertations in the Aquatic Sciences (Eco-DAS) program brings together recent recipients of doctoral degrees in any area of the ecology of water bodies: oceans, estuaries, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, or groundwater.  The purpose of Eco-DAS is to promote collaborative science by building strong, diverse professional networks early in the careers of aquatic scientists.  \n\nThe highlight of each Eco-DAS cohort is a symposium, but participants begin working together several weeks before the symposium and continue to work together for more than a year afterward.  They begin by proposing to write articles that depend on developing an author team.  During the symposium, author teams self-organize around some of the offered topics.  By the end of the symposium, author teams have developed outlines for 10-12 manuscripts, and the manuscripts are written after the symposium.  Although even the process of developing a manuscript outline will build network connections, more than &frac12; of author teams continue all the way to having their article published.  All published articles generated by Eco-DAS author teams are freely available to the public. \n\nIn addition to formation of author teams, mentor-led discussions, informative panels, and workshops are held during the symposium to prepare participants for the challenges of academic and non-academic careers in the aquatic sciences. \n\nThe Eco-DAS 2.0 award funded three biannual symposia with a total of 110 participants, most of whom were USA residents.  The cohorts were diverse with respect to gender, ethnicity, race, and scientific specialty. Science extends beyond national borders and it\u2019s important for a professional scientist to engage with an international network.  About 15% of participants were from outside the US and were supported primarily by $30,000 in donated funds.\n\nIn addition to interacting with one another, the participants interacted with a total of 51 mentors representing different facets of aquatic science professions.  The average Eco-DAS participant added a total of 54 new professional colleagues to their professional network. \n\nThis award resulted in the preparation, submission, and publication of a total of 17 formal articles.  Eleven of these appeared in peer-reviewed professional publications, and six appeared in a non-reviewed professional publication read by thousands of aquatic scientists.  Collectively, the peer-reviewed articles already have been cited 320 times by other science articles.  This is an extraordinarily high publication rate and citation total from a single NSF award. \n\nAdditionally, an Eco-DAS author team &ndash; WikiProject Limnology and Oceanography &ndash; focused on improving the representation of aquatic science on the public information website Wikipedia.org. To date, WikiProject L&amp;O has improved hundreds of Wikipedia pages, held three workshops to teach early career scientists how to edit Wikipedia pages, and released a 54-slide presentation on Wikipedia editing for general use.  Many of the pages edited by WikiProject L&amp;O are viewed hundreds of times every day.  The WikiProject L&amp;O team continues to work together, as do other author teams formed during Eco-DAS 2.0. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul F Kemp"
