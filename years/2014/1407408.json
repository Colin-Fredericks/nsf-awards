There will also be over 1000 shorter invited talks and 200-300 contributed talks.  There will be a Student Paper Symposium for the winners of a student paper competition, to encourage graduate students to write up their new results.  The topics covered will include all areas of the important and diverse fields of differential equations, dynamical systems, and many applications of these fields.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.aimsciences.org/conferences/2014/",
