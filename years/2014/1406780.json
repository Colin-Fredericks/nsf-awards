The convocation addresses several important and timely questions: (1) how to help teachers engage in important education issues beyond their classrooms, and (2) what kinds of networks or mechanisms might be identified to accomplish that engagement.\r\n\r\nFollowing the meeting, materials will be developed that will be available both in hard copy and as PDF files from the National Academies Press.",
