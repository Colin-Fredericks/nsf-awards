 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive species have highly variable impacts on natural services, such as carbon storage and nutrient retention, that make them very difficult problems for land managers to address. This project examines the impacts of one of the most widespread invasive plant species in the eastern United States, Japanese stiltgrass, on how forests use carbon and nitrogen, and will develop a more general framework with which to explain how and why impacts of invasives differ so much among different forests. The research will be conducted at three locations in Indiana, North Carolina and Georgia so that soil and climate effects can be separated, and a combination of observational measurements, controlled experiments in labs and greenhouses, and experiments in the field will be used.  \r\n\r\nThis research addresses important questions about how individual plants, especially invasive species, affect how forests use and cycle carbon and nitrogen. The investigators will also develop a general framework for predicting the impacts of invasives more broadly that will enable predictions of when and where biological invasions will have the greatest effects. As part of this project, the scientists will work with high schools to conduct training programs for teachers in Indiana and Florida that will include the development of new curricula and activities. The project will also train several undergraduate students each summer of the project, will provide an opportunity for a new PhD and Masters students, and will train a post-doctoral associate as well.  The results of the project will be made available to land managers, other scientists, and to the general public through a web site, public presentations, and publications. Stiltgrass is one of the most common invasive plants in the forests of eastern North America, so that helping land managers to more efficiently target its removal and restoration efforts will have lasting benefits for conservation and forest restoration projects in the future.",

Our research included field observations across invaded and invaded forest sites, experimental manipulation of natural invasions, and experiments with artificial communities of native trees and an invasive grass. This work led to three main findings. First, invasive plants, such as a non-native grass in the understory of mature eastern deciduous forests, can have significant effects on how ecosystems function (e.g., how nutrients cycle), even when the invader comprises a small fraction of the total living biomass in the community. Second, the impacts of invasive plants on soil properties can depend on the pre-existing conditions of the site, with the largest ecological effects occurring in ecosystems where the soil properties reflect native plant communities with characteristics that are most different from the characteristics of the invasive plant. Third, impacts of invasive plants on the performance of native plant species depends on the specific characteristics of the competing plant species. However, in contrast to the circumstances where invasive plants have significant effects on soil properties, invasive plants have larger effects on native species that are more similar to them, and smaller effects on plants that are less similar to them. Collectively, our results demonstrate that efforts to understand how invasive species impact native ecosystems must consider both the properties of the soils and the characteristics of the plant species in the ecosystem being invaded. In turn, this research helps inform natural areas managers that are concerned with mitigating the impacts of invasive species as to where in the landscape the impacts of invasive species are likely to be the greatest, thereby helping to prioritize invasive plant control efforts. More generally, our efforts to disseminate knowledge on the impacts of invasive plant species through workshops, teacher-training programs, and assistance with school curriculum development has raised awareness of invasive species and their threats to native ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/24/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Flory</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537826976345_mesocosmexp--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537826976345_mesocosmexp--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mesocosm experiment at Indiana University\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537826976345_mesocosmexp--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mesocosm experiment at Indiana University\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mesocosms used to examine the effects of experimental invasion on tree growth and nutrient dynamics</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Sheehan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Flory</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mesocosm experiment at Indiana University</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827061617_Mvfield1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827061617_Mvfield1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Herbicide application at Duke Forest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827061617_Mvfield1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Herbicide application at Duke Forest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Application of a grass-specific herbicide to reduce the abundance of the invasive grass Microstegium vimineum</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marissa Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Flory</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Herbicide application at Duke Forest</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827144412_Mvfield2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827144412_Mvfield2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microstegium vimineum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827144412_Mvfield2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microstegium vimineum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extensive invasion of the non-native grass Microstegium vimineum in the Duke Forest in North Carolina</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marissa Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Flory</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microstegium vimineum</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827204726_RobininaseeofMv--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827204726_RobininaseeofMv--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microstegium vimineum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353211/1353211_10298633_1537827204726_RobininaseeofMv--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microstegium vimineum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Invasion of the non-native grass Microstegium vimineum at the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Laura Podzikowski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;L&nbsp;Flory</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microstegium vimineum</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
