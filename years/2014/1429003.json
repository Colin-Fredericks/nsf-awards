Research projects include biology, computer science, mathematics, and atmospheric sciences. \r\nThe proposed UNC HPC cluster is available to all of UNC, including training courses for new users. It is expected that some courses (specifically bioscience and computer science) will utilize the cluster. Outreach activities include the UNC 'Frontiers of Science Institute' which is a summer program for Colorado high school students in STEM disciplines. The PIs plan on implementing a program with the UNC Math and Science Teachers Institute to train K-12 teacher in advanced topics.",
