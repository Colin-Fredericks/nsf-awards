 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics  abounds  with extremal  problems  problems  where  the  goal  is  to  minimize some  functional  applied  to  a  class  of  objects  under  some constraint,  identify  the  extremal  objects,  and  investigate  the stability  of  extrema.  Relevant  examples  range  from  some  in the  continuous  world  (isoperimetric  phenomena  in  convex geometry,  functional  analytic  inequalities),  to  some  in  the\r\ndiscrete  world  (structural  phenomena  in  additive  combinatorics), and  some  in  both  (maximum  entropy  problems  in  statistics, limit  theorems  in  probability).  A  natural  language  for  all  of these  problem  classes  is  probability,  and,  although  not obvious,  information  theory.  The  project  will  develop  new formulations  of  extremal  problems  from  each  of  these  fields in  terms  of  information-theoretic  inequalities,  and  then  use  a variety  of  tools  from  analysis,  probability,  convex  geometry, combinatorics,  and  information  theory,  to  make  progress  on them.  The  unifying  nature  of  the  perspective  adopted  will bridge  discrete  and  continuous  problems  using  a  common  set  of tools,  and  enable  significant  cross-fertilization.  Furthermore, some  of  the  information-theoretic  inequalities  developed, combined  with  statistical  decision  theory,  will  be  applied  to novel  statistical  challenges  involving  multiple  players  that arise  in  engineering,  economics,  and  biology  (specifically, theoretical  foundations  for  the  problems  of  data  pricing  and distributed  inference).    The  project  will  use information-theoretic  thinking  to  make  advances  on  challenging mathematical  problems  from  the  three  seemingly  disparate  fields of  convex  geometry,  arithmetic  combinatorics,  and  probability.\r\n\r\nApart  from  the  intrinsic  significance  of  these  areas  within mathematics,  they  have  much  practical  significance - convex geometry  finds  applications  in  medical  tomography,  arithmetic combinatorics  in  computer  science,  and  probability  is ubiquitous  as  the  foundation  of  statistical  inference.  The interpretability  and  unifying  nature  of  the  proposed  research, and  the  diversity  of  tools  it  uses,  create  wonderful  opportunities   for  student  motivation.  Newly  developed  courses  and  a resource  website  on  information  theoretic  approaches  to extremal  problems  will  exploit  these  opportunities.  The investigator  will  disseminate  key  findings  through  survey articles,  organize  an  interdisciplinary  workshop,  and communicate  the  excitement  of  research  through  non-academic public  lectures  to  attract  promising  students  to  the mathematical  sciences.  The  applied  component  of  the  research would  also  have  broad  impact,  by  contributing  to  how  data collectors  and  vendors  come  up  with  pricing  mechanisms  (e.g., for  pricing  of  advertisements  by  search  engines),  and  by improving  the  way  networks  of  sensors  collect  and  use  data for  various  applications  (e.g.,  for  disaster  recovery coordination  or  smart  kindergartens).",
