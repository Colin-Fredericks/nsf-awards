 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flood prediction and mitigation are important aspects of watershed management, especially in New England where a 30-year upward trend in floods has been attributed to a combination of urbanization and climate change. In addition to urban development, New England is currently experiencing an increase in agricultural land development.  While increases in flood risk from conversion of forests to urban land has been well studied, conversion from forest to agriculture requires further research. This project will investigate the impact that land use change from forest to agriculture has on flood risks in New England, and will separate impacts due to land use change alone, and impacts of combined land use and climate change. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Taikan Oki at the University of Tokyo in Japan. Dr. Oki's lab has developed and validated a flood model that is cutting edge in the field of flood and land-use change research.  \r\n\r\nCompared to forests, agricultural land has less capacity to store water in soil and biomass.  The seasonal cycle of water consumption through plant evapotranspiration also differs in agricultural land, with potentially greater water consumption than forests during peak growth periods, but significantly less water consumption during dormant and fallow seasons. Most watersheds contain multiple land use types. Therefore hydrologic watershed modeling can help understand these processes and make predictions about future changes in flood risk due to different development patterns. This study will couple two existing models; the first is a water balance model that represents the land surface and water management through dams, irrigation, and interbasin water transfers. The second is a flood model that predicts flood events, flood water volume, and inundation levels. Each of these models alone could not address the research goals outlined here; coupling the models is therefore a unique solution to understanding and predicting the connections between land use change and flood risks. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFlood prediction and mitigation are important aspects of watershed management, especially in New England where a 30-year upward trend in floods has been attributed to a combination of urbanization and climate change.  In addition to urban development, New England is currently experiencing an increase in agricultural land development.  While flood risk increases from conversion of forests to urban land has been well studied, conversion from forest to agriculture requires further research. Before such research can be carried out, appropriate methods for studying large-scale land use change must be determined.  Modeling tools are one way to assess the impact of large-scale land use change, as they allow experimentation without actually changing real world landscapes. \n\nThe research carried out in this project aimed to assess the validity of using a new, combined modeling approach for studying land use change induced floods in New England.  The main outcomes were: 1) the development of a new combined modeling system for flooding of watersheds, 2) development of fine-resolution modeling within this new combined modeling system, and 3) assessment of the combined modeling system for New England watersheds.  The first main outcome was the result of combining a large-scale hydrology model with a flood model; this achievement was primarily technical.  Once these two models were combined, they needed to be altered so that they could be used together at a high resolution spatial scale.  These alterations were achieved (outcome 2).  Lastly, this new combined modeling system, with its high resolution scale, was tested against hydrology data in the study region.  We found that for the fine spatial resolution needed to model fooding in New England, this combined modeling system requires either: a) a more detailed set of input on river dimensions, or b) an improved general representation of small rivers.  Without either a) or b), river discharge (and therefore the timing and extent of flooding) could not be accurately modeled.  This result will be extremely helpful in moving forward with developing a useful scale-appropriate model of flooding in New England.  We have identified a useful two-model tool, and identified the key improvements or new data requirements needed to use this tool in further studies. \n\nAs a collaborative project between the University of New Hampshire and the University of Tokyo within the EAPSI program, this research had the additional goal of building international collaborations at the graduate student level.  In the three month period I spent at the University of Tokyo, I worked directly with graduate students and professors, and gained experience working in an international setting.  I will presenting a poster (or potentially an oral presentation) in an AGU conference session lead by the University of Tokyo PIs, and will be continuing contact with graduate students and PIs that I met through EAPSI. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Danielle S Grogan"
