 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plate tectonic arguments, primarily based on motion derived from Earth's magnetic anomalies, require that Greenland has moved about 250 kilometers northeast with respect to North America during the Paleocene (65 to 54 million years ago) on a continental transform that links the opening of the Arctic Ocean with the opening of Baffin Bay.  Some scientists view the proposed transform as a myth, and indeed geophysical data show that the so-called Wegener Fault is not located in Nares Strait itself.  The PI joins a helicopter-supported expedition led by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) to look for evidence of faulting onshore remote SE Ellesmere Island, Canada adjacent to the strait.  The study area is on strike with known left-lateral strike-slip faults of Paleocene age to the north, which could link up to form the Wegener fault. Identifying the Wegener fault settles a long-standing tectonic problem and solidifies our understanding of the critical period of spreading in the Labrador Sea and opening of the Arctic Ocean.  The results also provide an important case study of the complexity of geologic relationships along continental transform boundaries, which can be compared to processes at similar boundaries such as the San Andreas Fault. Research results will be shared with the Geological Survey of Canada, and will be disseminated through the geologic literature. In addition to the geologic goals of the project, the project is providing support for research infrastructure at the University of Iowa, as well as public outreach efforts, including those aimed at First Nations people who live near the field area.",
