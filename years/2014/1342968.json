 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to comprehensively investigate the dynamics of SubAuroral Polarization Streams (SAPS) during geomagnetic disturbances and their effects on the ionosphere and thermosphere (IT). The dynamics of SAPS is an outstanding magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling problem associated with the electrodynamics at the interface between the hot and cold particle populations in the inner magnetosphere. The generation mechanisms of SAPS during geomagnetic active times, in particular substorms, are still not well understood, nor are the wave-like oscillations embedded within SAPS, or the effects of SAPS on the global IT system.\r\n\tGround-based observations (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and all-sky imager arrays) and space-based measurements (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) and the Van Allen probes), as well as the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM), will be used to carry out an integrated study of the dynamics of SAPS and their effects on the coupled IT system. Specific objectives are (1) to statistically construct the distribution of response times of SAPS intensifications relative to substorm onset and the distribution of intensification durations, and investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the SAPS intensification and for variable time delays, (2) to characterize the wave activity within the SAPS and their magnetospheric counterparts and identify the nature of the wave activity, and (3) to quantitatively evaluate the role of ion precipitation in affecting the SAPS evolution and the effect of the SAPS intensification after substorm onset and the wavy-structures of SAPS on the IT system using GITM.\r\n\tThis project will support the professional development of two young researchers, including one female. It will also involve participation of a graduate student and summer REU students. Project results will be disseminated broadly. The project is interdisciplinary and will be valuable to the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling) community, and contribute to an improved understanding of space-weather events.",

The dynamics of SAPS is an outstanding MIT coupling problem associated with the electrodynamics at the interface between the hot and cold particle populations in the inner magnetosphere and it can affect the ionospheric density significantly, which may lead to disruption and degradation of communication and navigation systems. We used a comprehensive set of instruments, including ground-based radars, magnetometers and all-sky imager arrays, as well as space-based satellite missions, such as the Time History of Events and Macro-scale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) and the Van Allen probes, and carried out an integrated study of the dynamics of SAPS and their effects on the coupled geospace system. Two graduate students and two earlier career research scientists have been supported and trained by this project.</p>\n<p>The characteristics of ionospheric density irregularities associated with the SAPS flow channels have been studied using high cadence Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) total electron content (TEC) measurements. During the March 17, 2015 intense geomagnetic storm, the spatial scale size of ionospheric irregularities near SAPS has been determined. Kilometer?scale irregularities are detected near the SAPS equaterward boundary and its center (i.e., mid-latitude trough), but not equatorward of SAPS and the storm-enhanced density plume or within the plume itself. This work has been published in JGR Space Physics special issue on the study of upper atmospheric disturbances and M-I-T coupling during the recent solar storms.</p>\n<p>The frequencies and amplitudes of inner magnetosphere Pi2 waves are affected by the radial plasma density profile and the largest density gradient usually occurs near the SAPS and the plasmapause. Variable geomagnetic activity and external driving conditions can affect both wave properties and density profiles simultaneously. When interpreting observations, this can lead to ambiguity about whether changing wave properties are due to changing external conditions, density profiles, or a combination of factors. We have performed a case study to examine Pi2 wave properties near SAPS during a period of variable geomagnetic activity. Multiple satellite passes demonstrate the density profile and plasmapause location are stable for at least 2 h over a wide range of magnetic local time. This stability allows us to examine how factors besides the radial density profile affect Pi2 wave properties. We find evidence for Pi2 waves with a broadband frequency spectrum as well as a discrete frequency plasmaspheric virtual resonance (PVR) that is observed at low, middle, and high latitudes and both inside and outside the plasmapause. The PVR is excited in repeated bursts before, during, and after (1) the development of a substorm, (2) several auroral intensifications, (3) the development of SAPS, and (4) variable interplanetary magnetic field conditions. Through all these changes the PVR frequency remains remarkably stable, suggesting that these variations have little effect on the frequency. This is consistent with PVR model predictions for a stationary plasmapause. The above findings have been published in JGR Space Physics.</p>\n<p>We have analyzed in detail a SAPS event on May 18, 2013 observed by the Van Allen Probe satellites and conjugate ground-based SuperDARN radars and magnetometers. A large SAPS electric field pointing radially outward, a magnetic field depression and a dispersionless proton injection were observed simultaneously in the inner magnetosphere. The conjugate SuperDARN observation of this SAPS event revealed a short lifetime of this SAPS on the order of &nbsp;~10 min. The above-described complex signatures can be explained by a two-loop current wedge, which is likely generated by diamagnetic effect of the hot injected particles. Conjugate observations from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and SuperMAG suggest that the injection was likely from 20 MLT and not associated with substorm injections. We suggest that the proton injection in the inner magnetosphere and the associated equatorial pressure and magnetic flux tube volume gradients can be the direct source of SAPS. Particle injections due to substorm activity might not be necessary for the SAPS formation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/06/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shasha&nbsp;Zou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1342968/1342968_10299834_1530899939232_jgra53295-fig-0006-m--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1342968/1342968_10299834_1530899939232_jgra53295-fig-0006-m--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"TEC observation over North America\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1342968/1342968_10299834_1530899939232_jgra53295-fig-0006-m--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"TEC observation over North America\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(left) Interpolated Madrigal VTEC map with 5 min IPP tracks for the interval ending at 23:205 UT.
