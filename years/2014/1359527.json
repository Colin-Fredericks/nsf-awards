 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a new Census Research Data Center in Kansas City.  The center will be used by faculty from the University of Kansas City Lawrence and the University of Missouri Kansas City, as well as by researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the Ewing Marion Kauffman   with a satellite center on the campus of the University of Missouri Columbia.  The center will allow these researchers to use government data records for cutting edge research in economics, sociology, management, demography, health, and related disciplines.  The center allows researchers access to the data while fully maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the data records.   The center will join an existing network of 18 Census Research Data Centers located round the country.  Since these other centers are primarily on the East and West coasts, the center will be an important addition to the research capacity of Kansas and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThis RDC will be used for projects on a wide range of topics.  There is a significant community of researchers in this part of the US who focus the scientific study of entrepreneurship.  Several of the researchers who will make immediate use of the new center will use the restricted-access Census microdata to test innovative new hypotheses about the effects of entrepreneurship and small business on the US economy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded the creation of the Kansas City Federal Research Data Center (KCRDC) and the University of Missouri (MURDC) branch.  The project created a consortium led by the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, the Kauffman Foundation, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and the University of Missouri-Kansas City.  The intellectual merit of the project was motivated first by the significant research capacity in the states of Kansas and Missouri. Second, the KC-RDC will be located in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which has a proven track record of maintaining data security.  Third, at the time of the proposal the nearest Census RDC was over 500 miles away. Locating an RDC in Kansas City will benefit two EPSCoR states and enhance social science and health research in the heartland.  \n\n \n\nThe KCRDC, is housed at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  However, it was delayed in being built.  In addition, it has experienced significant turnover in its administrator position.  As a result, it has had a fewer number of projects and researchers than was expected.  Use of the RDC will increase since the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service has relocated to Kansas City and those economists will be using the facility.  The University of Missouri branch has had significantly more projects that include 36 active researchers with special sworn status and 27 total projects.  Access to the RDC has resulted in three social science publications, one dissertation, and one working paper.  There are several projects in development in both the KCRDC and the MURDC branch.  Despite the end of the NSF funding, the KCRDC partners continue to provide financial and administrative support to the RDC.  Over time, it is expected that more researchers will take advantage of the Census and health data sets made available in the RDC to conduct high-impact, social science research.\n\n \n\nThe KC-RDC has the broader impacts of providing access to confidential data for researchers, faculty and graduate students in two states that are geographically isolated from the RDC network.  In addition, the KCRDC has provided training opportunities for graduate students and research assistants to learn the best practices associated with using confidential and restricted-use data.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donna K Ginther"
