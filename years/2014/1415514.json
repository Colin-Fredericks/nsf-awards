 "awd_abstract_narration": "Superconducting qubits (quantum bits) are solid-state artificial atoms, comprised of Josephson tunnel junctions and superconducting interconnects and microwave resonators. When cooled to milli-Kelvin temperatures, these superconducting circuits exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, such as quantized states of flux, charge, or junction phase depending on design parameters. Such superconducting artificial atoms have already proven a useful vehicle for advancing the scientific community's general understanding of coherence in quantum mechanical systems, particularly in regimes not easily accessible with natural atoms and molecules. Moreover, superconducting qubits are promising candidates for quantum information science and technology applications, including quantum computing. The main limiting factor in using superconducting qubits is noise, The sources of noise in these systems will be studied and characterized. Established techniques from the related field of NMR (such as those used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging), for example, the targeted control sequences known as dynamical decoupling and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, will be adapted and extended. The underlying microscopic sources that destroy the quantum nature of these superconducting qubits will be identified and mitigated. While the future applications of quantum information science and technology are still being recognized, a broad social benefit from the technology itself (e.g., quantum sensors, simulation machines) is anticipated, as well as from the the ancillary spin-off technologies that will arise (e.g., materials, fabrication, control schema), and the young researchers who work to make them a reality. An educational feature of this work will be the access and participation by students in academic (MIT, U. Tokyo, Chalmers), corporate (NEC), and government (Lincoln Laboratory, RIKEN) research environments in the US, Japan, and Sweden. Via shared research and student internships, this will provide a culture that fosters young scientists with a global research perspective, capable of developing and leading interdisciplinary teams across institutional and international boundaries. \r\n\r\nThis work addresses the characterization, identification, and mitigation of noise sources in advanced, high-coherence superconducting qubits. One objective is to use control techniques such as dynamical decoupling to assess and mitigate noise in a new generation of these advanced qubits (2D and 3D transmons with high-Q materials, metastable flux qubit). In general, this is achieved using NMR-based techniques that are known to benchmark and elucidate microscopic noise generators in order to identify and mitigate the underlying sources of decoherence. The goal is to understand what is limiting their coherence times. The information can then be used to improve fabrication processes and materials. A second objective is further advance the noise characterization and mitigation toolset. The research will utilize a quadrature amplitude modulator and sequencer with arbitrary amplitude and phase to generate microwave pulse sequences, which will be applied to transmons and metastable flux qubits in a dilution refrigerator. Coherence characterization, including the measurement of standard coherence times, will be performed as a function of the qubit quantization axis. Randomized benchmarking, state tomography, and process tomography will be used to characterize gate fidelity. Decoherence will be mitigated through the application of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences. These techniques will also be used to measure the noise power spectral density. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy techniques will be used to assess the microscopic nature and origin of decoherence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject outcome report, NSF PHY-1415514\n\n A quantum computer is a type of computing device that use the power of quantum mechanics (e.g., quantum superpositions and quantum entanglement) to speed up computation by performing a large number of operations in parallel. So far, quantum computational operations have only been realized in systems with a small number of quantum bits (qubits). The difficulty is that qubits are very susceptible to noise in their environment, which causes them to lose their \"quantum-ness\" (their \"quantum coherence\") before there is enough time to perform any calculations. \n\nOne way to improve the qubits and make them live longer is to develop new designs, using new materials and more refined fabrication techniques which have lower levels of unwanted noise.  However, to be able to improve on the noise levels in the systems, it is important to first measure the existing noise with high precision.  This information then allows us to target the imperfection that causes the largest amount harm to the qubits.   Unfortunately, due to the low signal levels involved and the requirement for operation at very low temperatures (T = 20 mK, which corresponds to -459 K), it is technically challenging to directly measure the noise with standard, commercially available instruments.\n\n During the first year of this program (and building upon the results of our previous NSF grant) we developed new methods for measuring noise by using the qubit as a sensor of its environment.  The technique consists of applying a sequence of control pulses to the qubit, and based on how the qubit reacts to those pulses we can determine what type of noise the qubit experiences.  By changing the type of control pulses and their spacing, we can investigate various properties of the noise, such as its strength and its frequency spectrum.  From this, we can also determine its likely physical origin.\n\n By implementing these techniques on our devices, we found that the performance of the qubits is limited by a combination of charge and flux noise.  Based on this knowledge, we started to investigate if it is possible to design qubits with reduced sensitivity to such noise sources.  The type of qubits we use in our lab consist of capacitors, inductors and special non-linear inductive circuit element called a Josephson junction.  From numerical simulations, we found that it is possible to reduce the qubit?s sensitivity to both flux and charge noise by replacing a larger Josephson junction with many small ones.  We found that both the flux and charge noise sensitivity scale as ~1/N, where N is the number of junctions, showing that it should be possible to improve qubit coherence times by increasing the number of junctions N. During the later years of this program, we designed, fabricated and measured qubits with N = 4, 8 and 16 junctions.  For devices with N = 8 or 16 junctions, we measured qubit lifetimes T1 &gt; 80 us, which is an improvement by a factor of two compared to the best lifetimes measured for the previous generation of devices (N = 2).  \n\n In addition, the new samples behave more like true two-level systems.  Similar to natural atoms, our qubits have higher levels, but we are only interested in the lowest two levels to encode the qubit states |0&gt; and |1&gt;.  The higher levels are not used for computation, but the quantum computation will fail if the qubit accidentally enters the second excited state. For the new devices we designed, the energy difference to the next higher state is three times larger than for our previous qubits.  This allows us to apply fast control pulses without unintentionally driving higher transitions in the system. Thanks to the reduced leakage to higher levels, we anticipate that these new devices will allow us to further improve both one- and two-qubit gate fidelities in superconducting qubit systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Simon Gustavsson"
