 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an adaptive learning system for early childhood care and education to aid parents and childcare providers in fostering the development of young children and assist them in preparing children for academic success beginning in kindergarten. The system will establish an interactive learning environment - delivered via smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer - to provide caregivers with a virtual teaching partner and mentor that is accessible at any time or place. Additionally, the system will enable the formation of social networks among parents and caregivers, build awareness of local childcare resources, and provide access to professional childcare and pediatric services. The project will develop a technology framework for data collection through smart devices and interactive educational programs to advance the use of learning analytics in early childhood education. This capability will enable longitudinal collection of data on early childhood development and learning across large populations and demographics to refine current understanding and methodologies, enhance professional knowledge among childcare providers, and inform a new generation of childcare and family support services.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact is the project's potential to addresses the lack of infrastructure to deliver quality early childhood care and education that is accessible and affordable to all families. Research has indicated only a minority of parents with pre-kindergarten age children gain access to services that could ensure their children enter school fully ready to learn as determined by kindergarten entry assessments. This need is particularly acute in underserved communities that lack resources to support positive parenting skills and quality early childhood experiences. National studies have consistently demonstrated the benefits to society of early childhood education in improved high school and college graduation rates, reduced juvenile crime, greater adult productivity, enhanced wage-earning potential, and increased tax revenues. To address this shortfall in capacity, this project will identify educational content appropriate for delivery via information technologies and develop an adaptive learning system to aid parents and caregivers in establishing effective learning environments for their young children. The widespread availability of mobile digital devices and the trajectory of future development and use, particularly among young parents and caregivers' present an opportunity for innovation in early childhood care and education that will greatly enhance access to knowledge of parenting skills and child development.",
