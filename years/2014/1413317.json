 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to move forward our understanding of the variety of processes that are responsible for observed galaxy properties, and how these vary with galaxy environment, e.g. galaxies that have few neighbors versus galaxies that are crowded closely together.  This is important to help scientists to distinguish the relative importance of properties that contribute to the growth of galaxies, including environment as mentioned above, the amount and type of stars being formed in galaxies, and how the visible matter in galaxies interacts with the dark matter associated with them.  The proposers will do a large survey of galaxies and their environments at distances that correspond to when the Universe was young, but mature enough that clusters of galaxies had formed and some galaxies had formed nearly all their stars.  It is important to look at galaxies at this epoch, as that is when it is expected that environmental effects are strong.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes the development and implementation of several public outreach and curricular activities, to be carried out both by him and the supported postdoc. The PI is at an institution which has a significant population of under-represented minorities.  The proposed integration of the project data into a lab for astronomy students is a great example of bringing research into the classroom, and it provides an opportunity for the postdoc to acquire experience in education and outreach.  The PI also plans monthly public lectures for high school students.\r\n\r\nThe proposal describes the first systematic survey of galaxy environment at z=0.8-1.5. The survey will combine deep optical imaging from 0.3-1 micron with deep near-IR imaging from 3-5 micron over an area more than 15 times that of the COSMOS survey. In this way, the new survey will open the redshift z=0.8-1.5 universe in a way that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has opened the local universe at z=0.1. The team will measure the relation between galaxy stellar masses/halo masses and its dependence on environment and address the following questions. When do galaxy scaling laws appear and how do these depend on environment? What are the physical mechanisms that transform galaxies to red sequence galaxies with low mass-specific star-formation rates? How do these mechanisms depend on galaxy mass, environment, and redshift?",

This program used data from two surveys.  Firstly, it used the  DECam/IRAC Galaxy Environment Survey (DIRGES), which combines deep imaging from the large-area Dark Energy Camera on the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer Spitzer Telescope.  This covers 24 square degrees on the sky, containing one cubic billion light years in volume of the Universe at redshifts z=0.8-1.5 (covering a time  7-10 billion years ago in cosmic history).

This rich dataset covers less area than DIRGES, but more deeply, and allows us to study the environmental effects of galaxy evolution on lower-mass galaxies.\n\nThe findings of this program have improved our understanding how a galaxy's environment  affects its evolution - this is the question of nature versus nurture for galaxies.  The results of this program show that a galaxy's stellar mass is the dominant factor that dictates the course of its evolution, over the past 10 billion years of cosmic history.  However, the environment plays a significant impact, and causes galaxies to quench (cease forming stars) at earlier times  in dense areas compared to galaxies in sparsely populated areas.   The impact of this environmental quenching is more pronounced for galaxies at high stellar masses: a major finding of this project is that galaxies stop accreting new gas when the enter dense regions of the Universe, and galaxies with higher masses burn through their remaining gas faster.   Moreover, this environmental effect is present in galaxies when then are in modestly dense regions, before they enter the richest environments of clusters.   This places a tight requirement on theories of galaxy formation. \n\nBroader Impacts:  The team of researchers working on this project has been committed to expand the scientific literacy of the general public, students, and researchers.  The team provided materials for use in public science talks, educational resources to use in undergraduate and graduate courses in astronomy and astrophysics.   This project in particulate improved the scientific training of underrepresented groups in the sciences.\n\n\nThis program has also provided as a broader impact a lasting legacy dataset for cosmological and astrophysical studies.  This program provides one of the largest-area, deep multiwavelength datasets, including observations of millions of galaxies, covering more than 10 billion years of cosmic evolution.  This is available for data-mining from the astronomical community and to the public at large.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Casey J Papovich"
