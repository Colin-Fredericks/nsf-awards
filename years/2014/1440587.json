 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a novel plug-and-play platform of open-source software elements to advance algorithmic research in molecular biology. The focus is on addressing the algorithmic impasse faced by computational chemists and biophysicists in structure-function related problems involving dynamic biomolecules central to our biology. The software platform resulting from this project provides the critical software infrastructure to support transformative research in molecular biology and computer science that benefits society at large by advancing our modeling capabilities and in turn our understanding of the role of biomolecules in critical mechanisms in a living and diseased cell.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the current impasse on the length and time scales that can be afforded in biomolecular modeling and simulation. It does so by integrating cutting-edge knowledge from two different research communities, computational chemists and biophysicists focused on detailed physics-based simulations, and AI researchers focused on efficient search and optimization algorithms. The software elements integrate sophisticated energetic models and molecular representations with powerful search and optimization algorithms for complex modular systems inspired from robot motion planning. The plug-and-play feature of the software platform supports putting together novel algorithms, such as wrapping Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo as local search operators within larger robotics-inspired exploration frameworks, and adding emerging biomolecular representations, models, and search techniques even beyond the timeline of this project.",
