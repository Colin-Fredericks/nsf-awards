Although coal ash spills have occurred many times in the past with disastrous consequences on humans, water resources and the ecosystem, this will be the first time a complete investigation based on coupled one and two-dimensional modeling of unsteady hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphodynamics and contaminant transport and fate can be undertaken. The models established for the research will also serve for long term monitoring and development of remediation approaches. \r\n\r\nThe research team has already published one- and two-dimensional models in the lower reaches of the Dan River/Roanoke River system, downstream from the proposed research site.  The results of this research can serve to bridge engineering and policy making by providing fundamental information of the hydraulic flow in the river systems. Several graduate students and two undergraduate work study students will be involved in this research contributing to STEM and research-based education.",
