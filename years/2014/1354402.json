 "awd_abstract_narration": "Representation of climate feedbacks in a coupled-model remains the largest source of uncertainty in its projection of future climate change driven by increasing greenhouse gases. The sign and magnitude of a feedback, however, depends critically on the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of a background climate. Due to internal variability of the climate system and fluctuations in external forcing, climate models inevitably excite low frequency variability and generate a wide range of background climates. The drift of feedbacks with these background climates, hence the transient behavior of climate feedbacks, presents a major challenge in our assessment of the risk of climate change acceleration and abrupt climate change. Delineating the evolving nature of feedback processes in a model is of particular importance for understanding the source of both the skill and bias in decadal climate prediction. However, the lack of a local measure of feedback strength has greatly limited our ability to make connections between actual model predictions (e.g., local temperature change) and transient behavior of climate feedbacks.\r\n\r\nThis project will use a newly-developed technique, the coupled atmosphere-surface climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM) to tackle this problem. The study will take advantage of modern reanalysis products and the multi-model ensemble products from the decadal prediction experiments of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to explore CFRAM's full potential in quantifying local and transient behavior of climate feedbacks and understanding the skill and bias of a model's ability to simulate decadal climate prediction. Specific research tasks that will be undertaken are (i) to quantify the relative contributions of various feedbacks to the annual cycle and interannual to decadal variations in surface air temperature (SAT) using reanalyses data; (ii)to evaluate the fidelity of CMIP5 models in representing the SAT annual cycle and decadal prediction of SAT; and (iii) to examine the attribution of models skills and biases in the ability to simulate decadal climate predictions and identify feedback processes that have major contributions to both systematic errors in the SAT annual cycle and forecast errors in decadal prediction of SAT.",

CFRAM is capable of decomposing temperature differences between two climate states at a point either in the atmosphere or at the surface into partial temperature changes associated with 1) radiation-related thermodynamic processes such as cloud and water vapor feedback, 2) local dynamical processes including convective energy transport and turbulent/diffusive energy transfer, 3) non-local dynamical processes such as the horizontal energy transport in the oceans and atmosphere, and 4) changes in surface heat storage.

At Georgia Tech, we first adopted the CFRAM to understand the representation of dominant modes of climate variability (such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation) in the latest generation of climate models. Our results suggest that models can capture temperature variability associated with these modes but the relative importance of individual feedbacks and processes in contributing to the temperature variations differ substantially between models and observations. The differences are more pronounced over extratropical regions where atmospheric dynamical processes dominate radiative processes. When analyzing decadal prediction results from one of the most widely used climate models (NCAR CCSM4), we found that although the model predicts the decadal-scale warming across the globe, it does not do it through the correct processes, i.e., in the model surface warms mostly due to increased water vapor in the atmosphere while in reality changes of ocean state play the most important role. The same dilemma (&ldquo;correct answer with wrong reason&rdquo;) was also seen at specific locations, e.g., North America and East Asia. Applying the CFRAM to the latest high-resolution observations, we also identified the key processes responsible for the observed upper tropospheric warming over the tropical western Pacific during the recent decades. This warming exhibits substantial seasonal variations, and ocean heat content change and latent heating related to the formation of deep convective clouds stand out as two most critical processes driving the warming. Additionally, when using the CFRAM to partition an index quantifying the thermal contrast between land and ocean, we were able to detect the factors modulating interannual to decadal variations in the onset date of the East Asian summer monsoon. Ocean heat content change and turbulent heat transfer from surface to atmosphere largely determine the magnitude of land-sea thermal contrast over East Asia thus the date of the monsoon onset.
