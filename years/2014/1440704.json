 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a Science Research Network utilizing next-generation technologies to dramatically reduce and remove barriers to the free flow of scientific research data at Vassar College.  The enhanced network better supports the transfer of large data sets with dramatically increased network capacity and reduced latency, positioning science researchers to utilize distributed data collection, remote sensor networks and pursue other network-enhanced research.\r\n\r\nThis project upgrades the current network core to a fully meshed 10Gbps backbone to facilitate high-capacity science research data transmission across the Vassar network.  A dedicated science research network, a Science DMZ, is designed and implemented to enable the unfettered flow of science data across and between researchers, data collection, analysis and storage resources.  Researchers are provided direct access from the Science DMZ to Research and Education (R&E) Networks including the New York State Education & Research Network and Internet2, with access to distributed computing resources including the New York State High Performance Computing Consortium (HPC2), as well as the commodity Internet in support of scientific research.  Additionally fiber connections to the local Point of Presence (POP) are reconfigured to enable dramatically greater network throughput.",
