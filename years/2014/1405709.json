 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polynomial equations are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Particularly important are the kinds of polynomial equations that arise in fields like cryptography and computer science, where the inputs and the outputs of the polynomials are fractions or their near-cousins (elements in a \"global field\"). For these equations, it is important not only to know that there are solutions in fractions, but also to know that there are many solutions, and that we can find such solutions efficiently in a finite amount of runtime (i.e., there are efficient bounds on the size of the numerators and denominators of some fraction solution). Investigating these questions is a major goal of algebraic geometry. Remarkably, ideas from geometry, particularly ideas suggested by physics, give a proof of existence of integral solutions for many special polynomial equations over global function fields. The main goal of this project is to exploit this advance and prove the veracity of certain conjectured bounds on rational solutions of these special polynomial equations (\"rationally simply connected\" systems of equations) over global function fields, thus giving an efficient algorithm for finding rational solutions. In addition, there are several educational and training goals: improving the writing of math students through weekly meetings, helping with a summer math camp for high school students, and holding twice-annual one-day training workshops for math students coinciding with one an important weekend workshop series in algebraic geometry. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the main objective is to study the Batyrev-Manin conjecture on asymptotics of rational points of bounded height over global function fields for the special class of \"rationally simply connected\" varieties: a class that includes, for instance, the projective homogeneous varieties so ubiquitous in representation theory. Recent work relates rational points over global function fields to geometric properties of moduli spaces of rational curves on lifts of the varieties over the complex numbers. By exploiting this, there is hope to give efficient height bounds on rational points implied by the Batyrev-Manin Conjecture, and hopefully to settle the conjecture in important special cases. Secondary goals are to understand the Picard groups of these moduli spaces (roughly, the different possible \"height functions\"), and to extend the amazingly successful story of Neron models to a more general class of varieties than Abelian varieties. Broader impacts include continuing and extending a mathematical writing and professional development seminar begun by the PI, to continue the partial support of the PI for the Mathematics Summer Camp at Stony Brook University, and to institute a new series of one-day training workshops for graduate students timed to coincide with the AGNES series of twice-annual weekend workshops in algebraic geometry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main research outcome of this project was finding solutions for those systems of polynomial equations having the maximum possible group of faithful and semisimple symmetries (\"principal homogeneous spaces for semisimple groups\") when there are no \"cohomological obstructions\" to finding solutions and when the \"field\" of coordinates is among several previously unproved cases (e.g., \"function fields of curves over pseudo algebraically closed fields\") yet that were predicted to admit solutions in the long-standing \"Conjecture II\" of Jean-Pierre Serre (winner of both the Fields Medal and the Abel Prize, the two highest honors in mathematics).  This conjecture is analogous to a theorem of geometry that every function between geometric objects having the maximum possible group of faithful symmetries (a \"principal bundle\") and for which the target of the function has dimension 0, 1 or 2, i.e., it is a point, a curve, or a surface, has a continuously-varying cross-section precisely when the most elementary obstructions allow this.  These are obstructions in \"integer-valued cohomology\" of the target, first discovered when studying multivariable calculus integrals on these geometric objects.  Serre's \"Conjecture II\" predicts that existence or non-existence of solutions of these symmetric systems of polynomials is completely determined by the vanishing or non-vanishing of analogous cohomological obstructions, at least for solutions having coordinates in those fields arising most naturally in algebra and number theory. Precisely, these are the fields of \"cohomological dimension\" equal to 0, such as the field of complex numbers, equal to 1, such as finite fields like the binary number system ubiquitous in computer science, or equal to 2, such as the \"purely imaginary number fields\" arising as fractions of the numbers in the regular square and hexagonal grids of the complex plane with edge length 1.  These highly symmetric systems of equations (\"principal homogeneous spaces\") arise amazingly often in both geometry and number theory, and the methods of the PI for finding solutions for these highly symmetric situations also apply to situations with less symmetry but with \"positive curvature\".\n\nOne throughline of mathematics in the 20th and 21st centuries is the remarkable connection between \"positive curvature\" geometry (such as arises in the maximally symmetric, bounded geometric objects such as the 2-sphere surface of a beach ball), respectively \"negative curvature\" geometry (such as arises for a saddle), and the abundance, respectively scarcity, of solutions of associated number-theoretic polynomial equations.  The main goal of this project was developing this connection between \"positive-curvature\" geometry and \"positive\" solutions of polynomial equations, i.e., existence and abundance of solutions (as opposed to \"negative\" solutions saying that there are no solutions or few solutions).  The method of the PI, his coauthors, and his students giving abundance of solutions, in particular, giving new proofs of cases of Serre's\"Conjecture II\" in the number-theoretic settings of \"global function fields\", flows directly from this connection: we study the geometry of *all* 2-spheres on a high-dimensional geometric object, we use the abundance of these 2-spheres to prove \"positive curvature\" or \"ampleness\" of certain intrinsically associated geometric objects, and then we use this positive curvature to prove the vanishing of large parts of the cohomology of the original geometric object.  \n\nThe PI gave many lectures, including a mini-course, on this work in research conferences and summer schools both in the United States and internationally.  In particular, together with two postdocs in this area, the PI organized a workshop at the American Institute of Mathematics that included lectures by world leaders on the newest advances, yet also included intense working groups during the conference that solved new problems \"on-the-spot\".\n\nRegarding broader impacts, the PI organized many activities, including two Graduate Student Mini-Schools preceding the large twice-yearly Algebraic Geometry Northeastern Series workshops that regularly attract 150-200 participants.
