Such particles are used for construction of biosensors, as well as for detection of important immune or cancer cells from physiological samples.  Currently, magnetic particles must be synthesized through chemical processes, and proteins or other targeting components are added to particle surfaces through painstaking step-by-step processes.  Nature has also developed an approach to biomineralize magnetite to create magnetic nanoparticles.  Several species of ?magnetotactic? bacteria evolved to produce chains of magnetic nanoparticles in specialized compartments called magnetosomes that aid in alignment within Earth?s magnetic field.  These bacteria may be ideal factories for the next-generation of low cost magnetic particles that are pre-coated with medically useful proteins.  We will use microfluidic tools to apply selection pressures for directed evolution of magnetotactic bacteria with a range of magnetosome properties.  We will also develop techniques to isolate magnetosomes from the selected cell populations while maintaining the commercially useful protein and lipid envelope surrounding the precipitated magnetite particles.  Besides use in creating customized and potentially economical protein-coated nanoparticles for biosensing, imaging, and cell biology research, the genetic changes within our evolved strain will give unique insights into biomineralization, vesicle formation, and self-assembly processes that can be used in a variety of biological systems.",
