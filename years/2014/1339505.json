The goals of the IRM include: 1) providing the geoscience research community with access to a full suite of sensitive instrumentation for detailed study of magnetic properties of natural materials; 2) providing visiting scholars with the support necessary to use the facilities effectively, including technical, educational, and logistical components of support; 3) adapting methods and techniques from physics and materials science, as well as developing new methods, for using magnetic measurement data to characterize complex natural samples and to address questions of specific interest to geoscientists; and; 4) serving as a catalyst in widening and improving the applications of magnetic analysis in geological and biological studies, by holding workshops and conferences, and by maintaining active (and separately funded) research programs in those areas.  Research facilitated by the analytical and technical capabilities of the IRM includes high resolution studies of variability in the intensity of the Earth?s magnetic field in order to elucidate fundamental questions surrounding the origin of the geodynamo, characterization of the properties of microbial nanophase magnetic minerals, and fundamental studies of the origin of magnetization in minerals and the behavior of magnetic minerals in response to environmental perturbations in temperature and applied magnetic fields.  The IRM supports the training of graduate and postdoctoral students in state-of-the-art rock and paleomagnetic analysis techniques and facilitates international collaborations through the Visiting Fellows program and a biennial conference series.\r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFacility Support:  Institute for Rock Magnetism\n\nNatural materials almost invariably contain at least trace amounts of magnetic iron-bearing minerals or alloys.  Scientific study of these materials provides important information on the processes that have formed and acted upon the materials over their history, in two major ways. \n\nFirst, the persistent stable magnetization of geological, archeological and extraterrestrial materials serves as a ?magnetic memory? in roughly the same way as in modern magnetic recording media.  It stores information on the magnetic fields present when the materials formed, or when they have been affected by significant later processes including metamorphic heating, tectonic deformation, and chemical alteration at ambient conditions.  Paleomagnetic research investigates the evolution of the Earth?s magnetic field (and those of other planets, moons and asteroids) over the time interval since the formation of the oldest rocks, including variations in strength, polarity and orientation of the field over the surface of the planet.  It also uses the paleomagnetic records in rocks and sediments as indicators of their latitude and orientation at the time of their formation and initial magnetization, to track the motions of the tectonic plates.  Magnetic ?overprints? result when later thermal or chemical events cause some or all of the original magnetic recording to be replaced, and these secondary magnetizations provide direct evidence of significant geological events.  The history of geomagnetic polarity reversals and variations in intensity and orientation, derived from studies of independently dated rocks and sedimentary sequences, also provides an important chronological tool for dating other geological or archeological materials whose ages are difficult to determine by other methods.\n\nSecond, the physical and chemical properties of fine magnetic particle populations serve as indicators of past processes or conditions that have affected the rocks or sediments in which they occur.  Magnetic anisotropy (variation of magnetic properties according to the direction in which they are measured) is a sensitive indicator of petrofabric, the preferred orientations of mineral grains produced by sediment deposition, igneous rock emplacement, or tectonic deformation.  Stratigraphic variations in magnetic mineral characteristics (composition, concentration and particle sizes) result from changing sources of sedimentary input, or from variable degrees of chemical alteration due to changing environmental conditions.  These can be quantified by sensitive magnetic measurements in the laboratory, to provide important data for understanding the evolution of sedimentary systems and depositional environments.\n\nThe Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) serves as a national research facility for studies of the magnetic properties of natural materials and synthetic analogs, and for research into the physical and chemical mechanisms that control the acquisition and retention of persistent magnetic memory.  A suite of advanced instruments enables sensitive measurements of magnetization under controlled conditions of temperature, magnetic fields, time and orientation, allowing detailed characterization of magnetic mineralogy, particle sizes and preferred orientations in natural and anthropogenic materials.  Experimental research focuses on the physics of magnetization changes as functions of time, temperature and applied magnetic fields, with controlled magnetic mineralogy and particle sizes, to improve our understanding of how the complex natural recording systems work, and to maximize the information that we can recover from magnetic analysis of natural materials.\n\nThe IRM provides access to its research facilities to researchers in the geosciences and related fields, primarily through a competitive Visiting Fellowship program.  An external Review and Advisory Committee, comprising experts in paleomagnetism and rock magnetism from around the world, evaluates proposals for Visiting Fellowships, and approximately 15-20 Fellowships are awarded annually.  Each Fellowship provides ten days of access to the full set of instruments and staff support.  An additional 30-40 visiting researchers use the facility annually for shorter term work using one or two instruments for preliminary studies or critical experiments.  IRM runs a biennial Summer School teaching the fundamentals of fine-particle magnetism and its applications in the natural sciences to beginning geophysics graduate students from around the globe, and organizes biennial conferences for in-depth presentations and discussions of magnetic geophysical research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Jackson"
