 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using an innovative multimodal imaging agent for cell tracking.  While traditional contrast agents are suitable for many clinical imaging approaches, new fields of medicine, such as stem cell transplantation, and improvements in imaging technology are creating small?but growing?niches for more sophisticated contrast agents than what is traditionally used.  For instance, there is a great deal of interest in functionalized contrast agents which tag specific cells based on surface markers, or are internalized by stem cells prior to transplantation so that the cell bolus may be tracked non-invasively to its site of engraftment.  To address these markets, this project intends to develop a range of imaging tools based on mesoporous silica.  The 50-200 nanometer particles have 3-4 nm pores into which a drug or other bioactive molecule can be loaded, and with further surface functionalization to give the particle contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and fluorescent microscopy.  The result is a multi-modal, multifunctional particle that addresses all the needs of state-of-the-art bioimaging.\r\n\r\nbegins with the relative ease and very low cost of production of our mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which can be priced competitively with other products that have a fraction of the functionality: quantum dots, traditional contrast agents, and even other novel contrast agents, which may be used for stem cell tracking, but only one imaging modality.  This includes new products offered by other niche manufacturers.  Using these nanoparticles, an investigator can label a stem cell transplant, use ultrasound for an image-guided deployment of the cells into a host animal, and perform follow-up studies with MRI or CT.  After the experiment, histology can be performed to detect labeled cells in-situ.  With one reagent used through the whole experiment, the investigator can more rapidly assess his/her approach, which leads to a more rapid translation to clinical implementation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStem cell therapies are becoming more commonplace in both clinical and research settings.  Despite technological advances, the fate of transplanted cells is often unclear.  There is an unmet need in developing novel functional contrast agents, which enhance contrast in specific tissues of interest.  Our group has developed a multi-platform imaging contrast agent, based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), which can be used as a standalone product, or incorporated into stem cells for tracking studies.  Relative to other functional contrast agents, MSN are low cost and manufactured repeatably, thus our product can be priced competitively with other products that have a fraction of the functionality: quantum dots, traditional contrast agents, and even other novel contrast agents, which may be used for stem cell tracking, but only one imaging modality.  We plan to offer our products to scientific investigators as a tool for pre-clinical imaging and biochemical analysis, with the long-term goal of obtaining approval for use in clinical settings. Using our MSN, a researcher can label a stem cell transplant with our particles, use ultrasound for an image-guided deployment of the cells into a host animal, and perform follow-up studies with MRI or CT.  In other words, one product is used through the whole experiment, allowing the investigator to more rapidly assess his/her approach, leading to a more rapid translation to clinical implementation.\n\nIn this phase I/IB project, we began with characterization and validation of the MSN with respect to scale-up and commercialization strategies.  We analyzed systematically the chemical and physical characteristics of various version of the products offered.  Within this project, we made significant improvements to the manufacturing and characterisation of the MSN, resulting in improved final products.  In addition, we prepared the molecule for other medical applications.\n\nNext, we evaluated the biocompatibility and potential toxicity of the MSN, both in cell culture and in whole animals (mice).  In cultures, using many varied cell types, the MSN were engulfed by cells with no adverse effects on their normal function.  In mice, we studied the fate of various formulations of our MSN injected intravenously.  These studies had two major goals: 1) to evaluate the site of particle accumulation as well as the relative MRI intensity of the signal, and 2) to verify the biocompatibility of the particles.  We were able to observe the MSN injected using ultrasound for short-term imaging (for several minutes) in conjunction with MRI for longer-term studies (over 1 month).  MRI studies were also used to demonstrate biocompatibility in the mice, as free MSN were observed to accumulate in and be cleared by the kidneys. \n\nThe final objective of the project was the proof-of-concept for stem cell tracking and contrast enhancement using a mouse model for bone marrow transplant.  Successful engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in the host bone marrow is key to the ultimate success of the transplant.  Using conventional tools, detection of engraftment in mice takes 4-6 weeks.  Our studies were able to show through MRI signal changes the accumulation of HPCs in bone marrow in 10 days.  This represents a significant savings of time and money for scientific investigators, and potentially a new avenue of cell tracking in humans receiving bone marrow transplants.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jose Assouline"
