Through a carefully constructed protocol, grounded in organizational change theories, a national framework will be developed and utilized as a tactical blueprint for: 1) assessing family friendly policies and practices according to levels of demonstrated institutionalization and inclusivity, and 2) promoting and implementing a flexible workplace environment at the level of precision required for dramatic change and sustained impact.  \r\n\r\nBroader significance and importance:  This project will set in motion the deep and pervasive adjustments to institutional policies, procedures and processes that will ensure that all STEM faculty, particularly women and women of color, will be represented in numbers equal to or higher than parity with pools from which they are selected.",
