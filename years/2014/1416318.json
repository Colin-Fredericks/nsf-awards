 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award addresses the fundamental physics and technology of modern accelerators through a program aimed at investigating and understanding the phenomena driving the behavior of compact, high power beams.  This includes studies of bright sources and RF superconductivity. In addition, the extensive instrumentation and flexibility of the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) will provide a framework to carry a program of accelerator science studies.  A better understanding of the physics and behavior of particle beams and related technology paves the way for new accelerators that are ever more powerful probes of materials, biological systems, molecules, atoms, nuclei and the most fundamental particles in nature. Research accelerators may be used to develop new drugs, to design lighter and stronger jet engine components, or better battery technology. Accelerators are tools of discovery that may inspire young scientists to explore our universe. Future accelerators may also enable the manufacture of smaller computer chips, more effective border security, and a safer food supply.  This program will also train future accelerator scientists. The participating graduate and postdoctoral students will have the opportunity to operate state of the art particle accelerators, and to advance the understanding of accelerated beams and beam technology. The operational experience will prepare them for leadership roles in accelerator science and future accelerators. The public will also gain deeper understanding of accelerator-based research through guided tours of the Cornell facilities.\r\n\r\nSuperconducting RF (SRF) is by far the most energy efficient means of accelerating a beam of charged particles. The Cornell SRF research will focus on the physics of microwave superconductivity. The physics that limits the performance and efficiency of SRF cavities will be studied in order to improve the technology and advance the capabilities of future accelerators. The combination of state of the art SRF expertise and technology with Cornell's world's brightest electron source provides an experimental program focused on very high power beams.  The high energy storage ring CESR is the vehicle for systematic study of the phenomena that emerge and ultimately limit particle density in very compact beams, thereby contributing to studies of fourth generation synchrotron light x-ray sources and electron positron colliders, building on past work that has led to the design of damping rings for linear and circular colliders. The particle source ultimately determines the quality of the accelerated beam and the power it can deliver. As part of this award, new electron source materials will be developed with a thorough understanding of material properties that is supported by theoretical considerations as well as direct measurements.",
