 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to fabricate and commercialize Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) that are free from any wavelength limitations imposed by the choice of semiconductor substrate. These revolutionary VCSELs will operate in a single mode with high output power, narrow linewidth and a stable linear polarization for use in spectroscopy and communications. Using 2D photonic crystal structures and substrate-independent reflectors, it is possible to build efficient single mode VCSELs at any wavelength covering the near-infrared and approaching mid infrared (800nm to 2,500nm). High efficiency and high output power are achieved by very low electrical resistance and efficient heat sinking. The first prototype will have the ambitious goal of offering a preferred alternative to DFB lasers in long-haul fiber optic communications and near infrared spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes many societal, educational, scientific and commercial benefits.  As a social benefit, the commercialization of this technology will enable faster and simpler air and water contamination measurements, and faster and lower-cost telecommunications. As an educational and scientific benefit, the next generation VCSEL development provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating 2D photonic crystals that are usable for optical signal processing and novel laser designs. Also, the resulting high-efficiency compact lasers with high mode quality can be used for pumping high power solid state lasers; and finally, the high speed versions of these advanced lasers can simplify data communication in fast computer systems used in scientific simulations. As a commercial impact, the additional functionalities of the next generation VCSELs will enable them to break out of their current niche datacom market into broader applications in communications and instrumentation. Their substrate independence will eventually make it possible to process them on silicon and other materials suitable for the final application. This will lead to a significant increase in demand for VCSELs due to the new markets that they will serve.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are the smallest lasers available on the market today. Unlike other semiconductor lasers that emit light from the edge of the chip, VCSELs emit from the surface. They have better optical beam shape, and can be fabricated at a lower cost than edge emitters. VCSELs have been mostly used in short-distance data communications and in computer mice. Recently, there is growing interest in VCSELs for 3D imaging and gesture recognition. Their compact size makes them easy to integrate into mobile platforms.</p>\n<p>One weakness of VCSELs as laser sources is their limited wavelength range. They are only commercially available in deep red and near-infrared wavelengths up to about 980nm. This limitation is imposed by the feasibility of fabricating mirrors on their host semiconductor substrate. The other weakness of VCSELs is their low output power level when they operate in a single mode.</p>\n<p>In this project we developed solutions for removing both limitations and also for fabricating novel nano-VCSEL arrays with high output power, that are not larger than a single standard VCSEL chip. These developments are listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A major achievement in this project was the design and fabrication for the first time of what we call a Monolithic High-Contrast Grating or MHCG. High Contrast Gratings are broadband mirrors consisting of fine lines defined by e-beam lithography. They are typically suspended in air and have been used in tunable VCSEL research. We found the suspended HCG not to be suitable for building reliable and cost effective VCSELs. Instead we developed the new monolithic version with our collaborators and showed its viability in VCSEL fabrication. VCSELs built with MHCGs will have much higher single-mode optical power than previously achievable (Figure 1).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In order to achieve confinement of the drive current and the optical field, VCSELs typically have one or more apertures formed by lateral oxidation of an epitaxial layer. The presence of this oxide aperture adds stress to the structure that has long term reliability repercussions. It also creates some nonuniformity of emission over the wafer. A second achievement of this project was the full development of 850nm and 940nm tunnel-junction VCSELs. Tunnel junctions replace the oxide aperture with a stress-free double layer of highly doped semiconductor material that is lithographically defined with precise dimensions. Tunnel junction VCSELs were previously demonstrated for long wavelength VCSELs fabricated on InP substrate. We were the first company to remove the obstacles of tunnel junction fabrication for VCSELs on GaAs that have the more popular wavelengths of 850nm, 940nm and 980nm. The precise and reproducible aperture size allow for effective beam shaping of VCSEL arrays. We filed for a patent on this technology.&nbsp; </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recently there is growing demand for compact and efficient VCSEL arrays that can fit in mobile devices for 3D imaging and gesture recognition. In this project we developed novel nano-VCSEL arrays that are highly compact and have no oxide apertures. Figure 2 shows our 25-element 940nm VCSEL array with dimensions of 430 by 480 mm. In comparison, Figure 3 shows our 52-element nano-VCSEL array with chip dimensions of 220 by 175 mm which is smaller than a standard single emitter VCSEL chip but provides over 20 times the output power. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits </strong>of the technology developed in this program include: (i) A robust and reliable method for fabricating subwavelength gratings that are usable for optical signal processing and novel laser designs.
