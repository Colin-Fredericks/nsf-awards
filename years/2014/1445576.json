 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key issue in modern biology is to understand how the complex development of an organism is regulated at the molecular level.  The model fruit fly system (Drosophila melanogaster) studied in Dr. Drewell's laboratory is particularly well suited to this type of research.  In the last decade a number of Drosophila genomes have been completely sequenced, allowing us to begin analyzing the function and evolution of genetic regulatory regions.  The experiments in this project will use a combination of molecular, genetic and computational approaches to examine the interacting network of DNA regulatory sequences at critical developmental genes, the Hox genes.  As the correct pattern of expression of the Hox genes is essential for the control of cell identities in the developing embryo in all animals, the results will have very broad significance.\r\n\r\nDr. Drewell is an investigator at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).  This project will build on the strong tradition of excellence in undergraduate research and education at HMC.  Active engagement of undergraduates in research will be an integral part of the success of this project.  Special attention will continue to be given to recruiting female, minority and first-generation college student researchers, who are currently highly represented in Dr. Drewell's laboratory.  An additional major goal is to develop courses and tools for biology education by synthesizing a strong interdisciplinary curriculum in molecular and developmental biology, genetics and evolution in the Biology department at HMC.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe issue of gene regulation is at the heart of our understanding of embryonic development.  Carefully timed and spatially controlled expression of key developmental genes, many of which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream genes, serves as the critical basis for normal animal development.  The early patterns of Hox gene expression in the embryo initiate a cascade of regulatory events at the molecular level that has profound consequences for the body plan of the adult.  Our study has enabled a clearer understanding of the DNA sequences that regulate this set of evolutionarily conserved master control genes.\n\nOur studies, supported by this award, have led us to investigate the function of DNA cis-regulatory modules and how protein transcription factors act at the sequence level to control the expression of Hox genes in the bithorax complex of Drosophila.  We characterized a novel regulatory sequence, the Promoter Tethering Element (PTE) and demonstrated that this sequence is required to establish the correct patterns of Hox gene expression in the early embryo by controlling enhancer-promoter interactions.  In addition, we extensively investigated the molecular nature of these interactions by dissecting the function of early embryonic enhancers in the bithorax complex.  Employing an interdisciplinary set of genetic, computational and mathematical modeling experimental approaches, we showed that the enhancers are themselves controlled by a conserved regulatory logic reflected in the physical organization of their transcription factor binding sites.\n\nThis award has been instrumental in providing research exposure to 89 undergraduate students (many of whom have subsequently become graduate students), two high school students, and three research assistants.  In addition, the projects have helped lab members develop their interdisciplinary, quantitative and computational skills.  Critically, the majority of undergraduate students supported were from traditionally under-represented groups in STEM (female, minority and first-generation college student researchers) and 34 were co-authors, representing 21 individual students, on the 14 peer-reviewed papers published in the context of this award.  The activity supported by this grant has also enabled the PI to develop courses and tools for molecular genetics, evolution, bioinformatics and mathematical biology education.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Drewell"
