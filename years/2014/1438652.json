 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Title: Understanding the role of calcium phosphate in improving oil properties during thermochemical conversion of wastewater-fed algae to biocrude \r\n\r\nAlgae have long been investigated as a potential feedstock for renewable, affordable, and reduced carbon-footprint fuels.  Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a process to convert wet algae to a carbon-rich biocrude.  HTL processing of algae grown in municipal wastewater has been shown to produce a biocrude with properties similar to conventional petroleum crude.  Furthermore, the HTL of wastewater-fed algae results in the production of a solid biochar product, which has hitherto been considered a waste product. However, evidence shows that wastewater-derived biochar contains a form of calcium phosphate, which may act as a catalyst to improve biocrude composition and stability. An award is made to Professors Susan Stagg-Williams and Belinda Sturm of the University of Kansas to understand the fundamental relationships between growth conditions, the formation of biochar during the HTL reaction, the formation of calcium phosphate crystals, and the ultimate impact on biocrude yield and properties. This knowledge is necessary for the ultimate commercialization of algal technology for renewable fuels and chemicals.  Various educational programs are planned by the investigators which will increase public awareness and engagement with sustainable energy production.  \r\n\r\nHydrothermal liquefaction has emerged as a promising whole cell conversion technology utilizing subcritical water to convert algal biomass to a carbon-rich biocrude.  Preliminary work at the University of Kansas has demonstrated that HTL of wastewater-cultivated algae leads to high biocrude yields, low biocrude O/C ratios, low levels of high boiling point compounds in the biocrude, and high production of biochar.  Characterization studies have shown that the biochar produced is a calcium-deficient substituted hydroxyapatite (HAp) form of calcium phosphate.  HAp has been shown to have acid-base properties and be catalytically active for the dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions.  In this study, the liquefaction of algae and model compounds will be investigated to determine: 1) the impact of algal growth conditions (Ca, N, P) on the crystallization of HAp in the HTL reactor and the resultant impact on biocrude composition, 2) the impact of the HAp crystallite formation on the macromolecule monomers formed during the liquefaction reaction, and 3) the ability of HAp synthesized during liquefaction to catalytically alter the biocrude composition through dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions.  Coupling controlled HAp crystal growth with the production of biocrude is novel. Generating an understanding of the relationship between growth conditions, the formation of HAp, and the ultimate impact on biocrude yield and properties has significant merit for the ultimate commercialization of algal HTL technology. Another aspect of this project supporting the recommendation for award is the environmental focus. Increasing the fundamental knowledge about the application of algal treatment systems for phosphorus removal and recovery from municipal and agricultural wastewater should yield positive environmental and economic impacts.  Utilizing algal treatment systems as a low-cost alternative to nutrient removal, while generating biocrude and high-value catalysts and biomaterials, has the potential to turn a historically regulatory operation (wastewater treatment) into a revenue-generating operation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWastewater holds great potential as a point source to recover nutrients, especially phosphorous.  Wastewater effluent streams can provide the necessary water and nutrient inputs for algal growth.  Hydrothermal liquefaction is an algal conversion method that utilizes subcritical water to convert the proteins, carbohydrate, and lipids in wastewater-cultivated algae to a high-valued phosphorous containing solid product, biocrude, and an aqueous co-product.  \n\nThe characteristics of the growth media, specifically the N:P ratio, calcium concentration, and harvesting pH, determine the amount of bio-phosphorous (phosphorous incorporated in the algal cell) versus solid-phosphorous (phosphorous outside the algae cell) in the algal biomass.  The ratio of bio-phosphorous to solid phosphorous is critical in determining the fate of phosphorous in the products of hydrothermal liquefaction.  Higher calcium concentrations result in near 100% capture of phosphorus in the hydrothermal liquefaction solid product.  The solids produced include tri-calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate, and substituted forms of calcium phosphates and calcium carbonates.  The composition of the solids formed, varied with the properties of the growth media. \n\nIncreasing the calcium content of the growth media also had a positive impact on the biocrude properties including the H/C ratio, amide, alkene, and carboxylic acid content.  The results of this study suggest that the inorganic solids collected from high pH, flocculated harvesting may have an in-situ catalytic impact on the biocrude. \n\nCharacterization studies have demonstrated that the nitrogen originally contained in the biomass is primarily recovered in the aqueous co-product which affords the opportunity to decouple the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorous.  The temperature of the hydrothermal liquefaction reaction impacts the composition of nitrogen recovered and the distribution of nitrogen species in the aqueous co-product. Increasing the temperature resulted in the biodegradability of the dissolved organic nitrogen portion of the total nitrogen to decrease 20%. For the tested temperature range, even though the total nitrogen content of the aqueous co-product slightly decreased, the % of non-biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen fraction increased to 96%. In addition, the diversity of heterocyclic N-containing organic compounds also increased.  Higher concentrations of non-biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen and more diverse heterocyclic N-containing organic compounds were associated with greater toxicity of the aqueous co-product.\n\nThis project has demonstrated the feasibility and potential of manipulating reaction temperature to control the bioavailability and distribution of nitrogen in the aqueous co-product from the hydrothermal liquefaction of algae.  Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that the growth conditions can be manipulated to control the fate of phosphorus and the composition of the solid product of the hydrothermal liquefaction reaction.   The calcium phosphates produced during the hydrothermal liquefaction of wastewater-cultivated algae could have a significant impact on the agricultural industry in the form of fertilizers or hydrochar.  The ability to decoupling nitrogen and phosphorous recovery could provide for more tunable fertilizers.  Finally, with the ability to manipulate the structure of the calcium phosphates produced, it may be possible to create inexpensive catalysts or materials that have high stability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, high surface area, and ease of surface functionalization.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan M Stagg-Williams"
