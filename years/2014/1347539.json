 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past three years, the quantity and quality of synchrophasor measurements made on the U.S. electric grid have dramatically increased.  In addition, the performance and robustness of the systems used to collect and manage this high-sample rate, GPS time-stamped data have greatly improved.  The number of real-time phasor measurements in some Reliability Coordinator control rooms is now approaching the level needed for full analysis of the electric grid through synchrophasor measurements alone. This full analysis requires a Real-Time Phasor State Estimator (RT-PSE). \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop, test, demonstrate, and commercialize the RT-PSE.  The project team believes that the RT-PSE is necessary, if not critical, to realize the full value from synchrophasor measurements.  Through the capabilities enumerated above, the RT-PSE will provide more complete, higher quality, and more reliable synchrophasor data streams for use by control conter applications and operators.",
