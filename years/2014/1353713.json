 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why can salamanders re-grow amputated limbs but humans cannot? Understanding the mechanisms that favor tissue regeneration in lieu of tissue repair remains one of the great unanswered questions in biology.  A particularly intriguing hypothesis, though poorly investigated, is that the loss of regenerative capacity in higher vertebrates coincides with the presence of a strong adaptive immune response.  Now, the recent discovery of complete tissue regeneration in wild African spiny mice (Acomys) compared to the failure to regenerate in a co-occurring rodent (Myomyscus), allows a comprehensive examination of the links between immunity and regeneration in wild, pathogen-exposed, and fully immunocompetent adult mammals.  Specifically, this study tests the hypothesis that tradeoffs in immunity along (1) innate vs. adaptive and (2) pro vs. anti-inflammatory axes underlie variation in the ability and rate of regeneration between these wild species.  Quantifying immune and inflammatory changes at the cellular and molecular level in response to injury is expected to reveal a bias towards innate immunity and anti-inflammatory molecules in regenerators, and a shift towards adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory responses in non-regenerators.  Project results will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms that constrain regenerative ability in mammals.  \r\nBecause regeneration biology is a fascinating topic with great potential to excite students about science, the investigators will engage U.S. and international students of all ages in the project.  Graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S. will travel to Kenya, where animal work will take place, to actively participate in the study and collaborate with Kenyan students and scientists.  The project team will also make a series of visits to a local Kenyan girls' secondary school and a primary school to showcase basic concepts in regeneration biology using African spiny mice as a tool.  The international component of this study is co-supported by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities.",

By analyzing healing tissue across species, we found that cells in regenerating spiny mouse species were able to undergo cell proliferation and restore the missing tissue types, while cells in mice were induced to produce high levels of collagen. \n\nCells in spiny mice exhibited hallmarks of regeneration similar to other regenerating vertebrates (e.g., salamanders, newts and zebrafish) and using RNA sequencing, we found a distinct genetic signature of regeneration.  We examined fibroblasts from regenerating and non-regenerating mammals in more detail and found that cells from regenerating species were highly resistant to reactive oxygen species.  In contrast, cells from non-regenerating mammals were overwhelmed by the same reactive oxygen species and induced to senesce.  These results suggest that intrinsic cellular differences can partly explain species variation in regenerative ability and suggest that injury-induced cell proliferation is partly controlled by differential regulation of key tumor suppressor proteins. \n\nBy examining immune cells and their products during healing, we found that macrophages were required for regeneration.  We also uncovered that non-regenerating species exhibited higher concentrations of several pro-inflammatory molecules during tissue inflammation.  However, when we reduced inflammation in non-regenerating species it did not stimulate a regenerative response.  Interestingly, we found that T cells were more abundant in the early inflammatory period and together with an analysis of cytokine levels our results support regeneration-specific inflammation during tissue regeneration in mammals.  This project also contributed to sequencing the Acomys cahirinus genome and determining husbandry protocols for effectively raising and breeding these animals in captivity. \n\n            In addition to the intellectual contributions generated from this award, our project significantly enhanced research training opportunities for students from Kentucky and Kenya. This included training students from underrepresented groups in field biology, and regenerative and developmental biology.  The project supported a Kenyan PhD student based at the University of Nairobi who collaborated on aspects of the project and subsequently generated a parallel dissertation project.  The project also supported several exchanges for Kenyan students to work in the Principal Investigator?s (PI) lab at the University of Kentucky.  In the other direction, the project facilitated research experiences for two US undergraduate students (one black and one female) to gain skills in field biology by traveling to Kenya with the PI and his team.  While in Kenya, the project team worked with the Daraja Academy to give middle school girls the opportunity to accompany the team into the field and thus gain a window into biological research.  At the University of Kentucky, the project trained undergraduate and graduate students in cellular and molecular techniques.  Two postdocs affiliated with the project received training and mentorship that saw one transition to an independent position as an Assistant Professor (LSU Health Sciences Center) and the other transition into an Industry Position as a Scientist.  A lasting impact of this project has been the enhancement of the research infrastructure in the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology at the University of Nairobi.  Lastly, collaborative research through this award has also strengthened ties between researchers at the University of Kentucky and University of Nairobi which will facilitate the continued training and exchange of students between these institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ashley W Seifert"
