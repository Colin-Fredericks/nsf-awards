  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGalois representations are a fundamental area of study in modern algebraic number theory because they let us study symmetries of solutions to polynomial equations using linear algebra.  We frequently construct Galois representations by considering algebro-geometric objects with interesting actions of Galois groups and then taking linear algebraic data associated to the geometric side.  The resulting Galois representations frequently encode information about the geometric objects.\n\nFor example, given a Galois representation, one can construct a function called an L-function.  When the Galois representation comes from geometry, there is a deep web of conjectures (including the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture) about the relationship between the L-function and the geometric object.  L-functions should satisfy symmetries known as functional equations, which involve auxiliary constants known as epsilon-factors.\n\nIn addition, Galois representations often vary naturally in families.  More precisely, we say that two Galois representations are p-adically close if their coefficients differ by a multiple of a large power of a prime number p.  It is often possible and useful to study a particular Galois representation by studying Galois representations which are p-adically close to it.\n\nIn particular, it is natural to ask whether the L-functions attached to p-adically close Galois representations are themselves p-adically close.  In joint work with Otmar Venjakob, the PI showed that for certain families of Galois representations, epsilon-isomorphisms (which are closely related to epsilon-factors) vary nicely.  \n\nThis project involved constructing objects called Wach modules for certain families of Galois representations.  Previously, it was known that Wach modules exist for certain Galois representations, but how they behaved in families was not understood.  Our construction clarifies this, and should be useful far more broadly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca M Bellovin"
