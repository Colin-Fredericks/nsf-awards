 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smartphones and tablets with rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are\r\nbecoming increasingly popular.  Hundreds of thousands of specialized\r\napplications, called apps, are already available for these mobile\r\nplatforms, and the number of newly released apps continues to\r\nincrease.  The complexity of these apps lies often in the user\r\ninterface, with data processing either minor, or delegated to a\r\nbackend component. A similar situation exists in applications using\r\nthe software-as-a-service architecture, where the client-side\r\ncomponent consists mostly of user interface code.  Testing such\r\napplications predominantly involves GUI testing. Existing automatic\r\ntechniques for testing these interfaces either require a priori models\r\nof the interface and are thus hard to use, or operate blindly by\r\nsending random user events to the application and are typically unable\r\nto test the application in satisfactory depth.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates automatic GUI testing techniques that\r\nsystematically explore the state space of an application without\r\nrequiring an a priori defined model.  One insight behind this project\r\nis that the automatic construction of a model of the user interface\r\nand the testing of the interface are tasks that can cooperate in a\r\nmutually beneficial way. Furthermore, a guiding principle throughout\r\nthis research is to design algorithms that operate with abstractions\r\nand heuristics that are simple enough to be understood by humans who\r\ndo not necessarily understand the internals of the tested app. Such\r\nalgorithms are easier to comprehend and to incorporate into a\r\nwholistic test process that includes automated techniques, such as the\r\nones developed in this project, and manual testing and guidance.  The\r\ntechniques developed in this project benefit directly programmers for\r\nthese apps, and indirectly the numerous users of mobile and web\r\napplications.",
