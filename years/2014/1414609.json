 "awd_abstract_narration": "Negative acts committed by individuals from other nations, such as the tragic school shoot at Virginia Tech in 2007, often engender increased hostile and negative evaluations towards people from that nation. To mitigate these negative reactions, countries may issue an apology on behalf of the nation for the acts committed by their citizens. These apologies are defined as intergroup apologies, that is, apologies between two groups of individuals. The proposed project will investigate the role of intergroup apologies on ameliorating relationships and attitudes between groups. In addition, this study will advance our understanding of how cultural differences in group entitativity, that is, how strongly groups are viewed as cohesive, affect perceptions of intergroup apologies. This study will be conducted under the hypothesis that higher group entitativity will incite more of a need for group apologies as well as greater expectation for an apology, subsequently leading to more negative evaluations if no apology is given. This study will be carried out at Chungbuk National University in South Korea in collaboration with Dr. Sanghee Park. \r\n\r\nParticipants from United States and South Korea will be recruited. This study will employ a 2 (United States or South Korea) x 2 (Apology or No-Apology) factorial design with dependent measures being scale items on outgroup attitudes and an Implicit Associations Test (IAT).  Participants will be presented with a scenario depicting a negative intergroup event and then be randomly assigned to an apology or no apology condition. Following the apology, questionnaires will be given to assess perceptions of the apology, group entitativity, and outgroup attitudes. In addition, implicit negative associations towards South Koreans and Americans with the IAT will be assessed. Results from the IAT and explicit attitude measures will afford a test of whether apologies reduced negative intergroup attitudes. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNicholas Alt completed research on the effectiveness of cross-cultural intergroup apologies, that is apologies offered between two groups of people, with the support of the East Asian and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) program.  Through this program he spent two months in South Korea working with Prof. Sang Hee Park at Chungbuk National University.  During this time he focused on conducting data analysis, developing cross-cultural research competencies, and creating strong collaborative research ties with Prof. Sang Hee Park.\n\nOverall, the goals of this project were met.  In collaboration with Prof. Sang Hee Park, Nicholas investigated whether intergroup apologies were an effective means of ameliorating negative intergroup attitudes following an incident of international violence.  For the study, all participants (South Korean n = 122, American n = 77) first read a vignette regarding a negative intergroup event (i.e., a study abroad student attacks and injuries three ingroup students).  Next, participants were randomized assigned to either an apology or no apology condition.   In the apology condition participants read an intergroup apology in which outgroup government officials apologized for the actions of their citizen.  Then, all participants answered questions assessing their general opinion of the outgroup country, perceived remorse, and perceived power differences between the two countries.  Finally, participants completed an Implicit Association Test to assess implicit outgroup bias.\n\nResults for explicit outgroup attitudes showed a significant moderated mediation.  In summary, the model indicated that South Korean participants who read an intergroup apology from United States officials indicated less perceived remorse, which subsequently engendered less positive evaluations of the United States.  Furthermore, American participants did not show an effect for an intergroup apology in terms of changed negative outgroup attitudes towards South Korea.  A similar set of findings for implicit attitudes emerged, with marginally statistical significance, such that South Korean participants had slightly more ingroup bias after reading an intergroup apology due to lower perceived remorse following an apology.  Lastly, we investigated a potential mechanism for our findings, testing whether perceived power differences accounted for Country level differences.  Indeed, results showed that individuals who saw greater power differences between the two countries showed greater ironic effects of the intergroup apology.\n\nThis award led to a significant and on-going collaboration with Prof. Sang Hee Park at Chungbuk National University.  Nicholas and Prof. Park are currently working on follow-up studies testing how to make intergroup apologies effective between these two countries.  In addition, we are currently working on a separate project investigating person perception and political party affiliation. Furthermore, this project led to a poster presentation at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology annual conference, held in February, 2015.  Lastly, results from this project are being written up for submission and the manuscript will be under review shortly.  By disseminating these findings we hope to call attention to these ironic effects of intergroup apologies and engender more research on this topic.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas Alt"
