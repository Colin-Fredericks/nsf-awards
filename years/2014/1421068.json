 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the key challenges in trustworthy computing is establishing trust in the hardware layer, which is the execution platform of all software applications. Modern multiprocessor system-on-chips employ many specialized components, and scalable network-on-chips (NoC) are often deployed to efficiently connect these components. In the light of these trends, this project investigates secure and reliable computation, when the underlying NoC is compromised.\r\n\r\nThe project explores a range of threats posed by a compromised NoC in current and future multiprocessor systems. The layered security mechanisms in the multiprocessor firmware that can allow secure and reliable computation by tolerating a compromised NoC are investigated. The project enables trustworthy computing on next generation cost-effective hardware platforms driven by seamless integration of third party hardware components. Through educational activities, this project will disseminate vital skill sets to future work force to engage in trustworthy computer design.",
