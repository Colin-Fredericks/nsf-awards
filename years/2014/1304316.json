ARCUS provides organizational support to researchers, funding agencies, arctic communities and others involved in arctic research. Building on its major accomplishments, through this award ARCUS leads a collaboratory focused on networking, capacity building, increasing stakeholder involvement in the scientific process, disseminating information and providing effective outreach. Specific examples of activities include support for the Interagency Research Policy Committee (IARPC) to engage with stakeholders and develop across agencies collaborations; support for the Arctic Research Support and Logistics program to engage the research community to review program priorities and goals for the next five years; a report from a workshop on Arctic Field Safety Risk Management; facilitation of a network of sea ice modelers and the walrus subsistence community in the Sea Ice for Walrus Outlook. In addition to a number of specific tasks with deliverables, ARCUS provides a moderated email listserve, a newsletter, and undertakes activities that catalyze arctic research collaborations and broadens participation in arctic research.",
