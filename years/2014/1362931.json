 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division of NSF, Professor Gregory S. Girolami of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will develop new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin films.  The current work will develop new classes of transition metal compounds, especially as they relate to the use of such molecules as precursors for the deposition of metal diborides, metal nitrides, and metal oxides.  The work will enhance already existing interactions between Professor Girolami's group and leading companies in microelectronics development. The research will lead to deeper understandings of the chemistry of volatile transition metal compounds, and could lead to better ways to deposit the wires and insulators that are key components of modern-day computer chips. In addition, the award will contribute to the education of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and allow Professor Girolami to maintain his involvement in various services and outreach activities, such as library exhibits of rare books illustrating the history and advancement of science. \r\n\r\nThe proposed activity is aimed toward the synthesis of new volatile compounds (especially of the transition metals), investigations of their chemical reactivities, and studies of their volatilities and utilities as thin film precursors.  Some of the specific objectives of the current project are synthesis of new two-coordinate complexes of the late transition elements, and the chemical tuning of ligands to change the volatility, reducing power, and deposition activation energies of their complexes in a systematic way. In parallel, investigations of the use of these new CVD precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be carried out collaboratively with experts in these techniques.",
