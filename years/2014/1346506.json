 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project focuses on designing an eco-friendly, inexpensive cement hydrate with superior mechanical properties and applicable to several structural components. Cement is the key strengthening ingredient in concrete, the production of which accounts for ~2-3% of global energy use, and 5-10% of worldwide CO2 emissions. There is currently no other material on the horizon that can replace cement as the backbone material for infrastructure. This project will create novel protocols integrating state-of-the-art syntheses, characterizations and testing to synthesize a cement hydrate, which is not only twice as strong as than typical products, but eliminates a significant portion of both the energy consumption and CO2 emissions during cement manufacturing and use. The core of this project lies in topological functionalization of the basic building blocks of cement hydrate, Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate, and precipitation of nanoparticles of multiple sizes. This novel strategy provides a substantial opportunity to reduce the environmental footprint of cement, because it enables the use of less energy-intensive raw materials, and also leverages improved material mechanics to ?do more with less?.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial. Creating a cement hydrate with superior mechanical properties will not only benefit all concrete-based infrastructure by requiring less material to be used, but will also result in more streamlined products, which will confer several advantages across the construction sector, such as reduced labor, reduced transportation requirements, and faster construction. The domestic cement market size is $12 billion, indicating the potential for significant environmental and economic impacts. More importantly, the innovative research and development approaches of this project will have a significant influence on reducing the energy consumption and environmental footprint associated with cement manufacturing. The latter currently stand among the key technical challenges facing cement industry. Rooted in the inherent molecular features of materials, this transformative project will have a broad impact in the design of eco-friendly cementitious materials, and will also impact other fields such as ceramics and colloidal systems. As such, the overall project will create the potential for exploring an entirely new approach for manufacturing cement-based materials and other particulate systems.",
