 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pesticide resistance is a global issue that limits our ability to maintain increased agricultural production, and poses a threat to global food security. The proposed industry-university partnership plans to build on the extensive and complementary expertise in dealing with resistance across organisms and pesticide products of the assembled interdisciplinary team from University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Colorado State University to isolate the factors contributing to resistance evolution, to develop long-term sustainable pest management approaches, and to provide training and education to facilitate the adoption of sound resistance management practices. The research of the planned I/UCRC for Ecology, Evolution and Management of Pesticide Resistance (CEEMPR) will focus on pesticide resistance management across insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and transgenic traits. The planned research activities of the center are complemented by educational efforts specifically designed to provide knowledge of pesticide resistance management at all level of the agricultural production system. \r\n\r\nThe planned I/UCRC will enable the fostering of interactions among industry, commodity groups, governmental agencies, academic researchers, graduate and undergraduate students. The center activities are strongly targeted towards providing training and education to students, postdoctoral fellows, as well as agricultural professionals and North American growers with the goal of meeting sustainable and wise stewardship of modern agricultural technologies, and to prepare a highly skilled workforce.  Students will have the opportunities to participate in mentoring and professional development activities, and will be encouraged to seek opportunities for internships with industry partners.  The planned I/UCRC will coordinate joint activities to involve students and postdoctoral fellows from underrepresented groups with the help of the Office of Equity, Access and Diversity at UNL, and from the Vice President for Diversity from CSU. The center aims to make substantial contributions to the field of pesticide resistance resulting in improved crop yield and quality for growers that promote global food security, and reduce agricultural losses.",

The purpose of the planning grant was to organize the academic leadership, identify and recruit potential industry members, and develop research projects with industry support. The Strategic Planning Meeting was held in Lincoln, NE, at the Nebraska Innovation Campus Conference Center of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln from September 29 &ndash; October 1, 2014. The objectives were to explain the NSF I/UCRC model, provide networking opportunities, and evaluate research projects. Attendance at the Strategic Planning Meeting included 22 academic faculty, 22 industry representatives, 21 graduate students, 1 NSF representative, and 1 NSF program evaluator. The graduate students from the University of Nebraska and Colorado State University presented posters on their research projects to Strategic Planning Meeting attendees during a networking event, and additional networking opportunities were provided by receptions and meals. All 10 proposed research projects were presented and evaluated by the potential industry members in attendance. Feedback was used to revise the projects for subsequent ranking by potential industry members. An additional planning meeting for the Center academic leadership was held on July 16-17, 2015, in Fort Collins, CO. The Center website (www.ceempr.unl.edu) has been used to advertise the proposed Center, recruit potential members, communicate the proposed projects, and facilitate evaluation of proposed projects by potential members. The Center academic leadership is planning to submit a full proposal to the NSF I/UCRC.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/12/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Blair&nbsp;D&nbsp;Siegfried</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
