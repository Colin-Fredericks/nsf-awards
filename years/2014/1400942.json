 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnology is an emerging technology that enables many of the US industries that keep the US globally competitive.  This project is supporting the development of an associate in applied science degree and certificate course offerings in nanotechnology at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) and UDC-Community College (UDC-CC). UDC is one of 35 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in the US. The project is impacting underrepresented minorities at UDC-CC of whom 60% are females, a population which needs to be more strongly directed to opportunities in STEM. This nanotechnology education workforce (NEW) development project is also leveraging the expertise and resources of the ATE National Center Nanotechnology Application and Career Knowledge (NACK). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, courses in nanotechnology are being offered as interdisciplinary courses to students in all disciplines. Faculty and students are learning about the fabrication of nanomaterials and conducting research in nanomaterials. Seminars and distance learning offerings in nanotechnology are being supported. The project is fostering ongoing collaborative educational workforce development between UDC, UDC-CC and area university professors and researchers at government agencies.\r\n\r\nThe project evaluation is designed to assess the degree of program development and implementation, student learning and skills competency, and program effectiveness.",

Additionally, we have engaged faculty and students in leading-edge nanotechnology, materials science and nano-biotechnology research projects, to meet market demands for a skilled workforce. \n\nTo this end, we have developed a series of five nanotechnology courses and generated degree plan proposals for an AS in Engineering Science with a concentration in Nanotechnology as well as a degree plan for a non-engineering track AS in Nanotechnology.  While the full degree programs are still awaiting approval and implementation at the Community College, we have delivered the first two courses in the series to UDC students.  The Introduction to Nanotechnology course was offered as a science elective at the Community College and the Nanotechnology Processes and Fabrication course was offered as a senior elective for engineering bachelor?s students.  The later course became the most popular of our elective courses offered. Additional courses such as Research Experience and Senior Project have also benefited from ATE nanotechnology instruction and resources. \n\nHowever, perhaps the most valuable outcome has been in the hands-on lab and research experiences we have been able to offer our students with this support.  Over 40 students have had hands-on nanotechnology laboratory instruction and more than 15 students have done extensive nanotechnology research with the PIs on this grant.  In addition, we established a nanotechnology intern program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology with 7 student internships at NIST?s clean room facility.  Lastly, the PIs and their students have been active in advancing our nanofabrication and characterization laboratory facilities, to include a class-1000 certified clean room with photolithography and deposition capabilities and a suite of nanoscale characterization tools.  Our passion and progress in nanotechnology research is disseminated to the public through tours, workshops and outreach seminars.  The overarching outcome of this award has been to prepare a diverse, nano-savvy workforce that is increasingly inclusive of underrepresented minorities. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kate L Klein"
