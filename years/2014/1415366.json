 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to manage and coordinate the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) workshops until FY 2018. The team from Virginia Tech will provide support for the annual Summer GEM Workshops in June and the Mini-workshops held on the Sunday before the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in December.  In addition to the organization of the workshops this grant will provide support for approximately 64 students to attend the summer workshops.  The Virginia Tech team will work with the GEM Steering Committee to ensure a smooth and efficient operation.\r\nThe GEM program is one of the most success research programs in magnetospheric physics.  It supports basic research into the most important problems in magnetospheric physics and in so doing supports the National Space Weather Program (NSWP). The NSWP has major societal relevance.  GEM has a strong student orientation and a major educational element. As such it contributes to the training of the next generation of space physicists.  The GEM student organization has been formalized with student leaders  and student only sessions with tutorial talks by students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     The goal of this project is to provide the logistics support and venue for workshops that promote progress in the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program.  The GEM program is an NSF targeted research program with the scientific goal \"to understand the soar-terrestrial system well enough to be able to formulate a mathematical framework that can predict the deterministic properties of geospace (weather in space) and the statistical characteristics of its stochastic properties (climate in space).\"  Two workshops per year are supported.  The major GEM event is a week-long summer workshop at which researchers gather to collaborate, discuss the latest developments, and plan for future work.  These workshops have come to define GEM and its unique approach to collaborative science.  The GEM workshops have become an important annual gathering for magnetospheric physicists, both US and international.  The summer workshop is supplemented with a 1-day mini-workshop in December held in conjunction with the meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  While the GEM program addresses forefront science, the workshops are also important to promoting professional development of students and early-career scientists.  Most of the financial support in this project is utilized to support workshop attendance by graduate students and some early-career scientists and the occasional exceptional undergraduate student.  The workshops have special tutorial programs devoted to, and organized by the students.  There are two student representatives, elected by the students, that serve 2-year terms on the GEM steering committee.   Steering committee meetings are also organized at the end of both the summer workshop and the December mini-workshop.\n     GEM Summer workshops were held during June 14 - June 19, 2015, at Snowmass, Colorado, and 75 Students were supported and 148 scientists participated this workshop; during June 19 -June 24, 2016, jointly with the CEDAR workshop at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and 71 students were supported and 197 scientists participated; during June 18 - June 23, 2017, at Portsmouth, Virginia, and 73 students were supported and 156 scientists participated; during June 17 -June 23, 2018, back-to-back jointly with the CEDAR workshop in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and 73 students were supported and 224 scientists registered.\n     GEM mini-workshops are organized on the Sunday afternoon prior to the December Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.  These were held in 2015, 2016, in San Francisco, California, and in 2017, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and in 2018, in Alexandria, Virginia. Focus groups can push forward their activities at this meeting and the GEM Steering Committee is able to meet and consider various aspects of the GEM program and workshops.\n     The workshops continue to be well attended with significant participation from scientists supported through other than NSF funding.  There continues to be significant international participation, thus these workshops are highly leveraged. Graduate students report that they find the workshops very beneficial as a means to integrate themselves into research and the research community.  Interactions among students from a wide variety of institutions is highly valuable.  The Sunday \"student only\" program is rated highly -- students present their own tutorials on different research areas, hold a variety of discussion groups, and social activities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Calvin Robert Clauer"
