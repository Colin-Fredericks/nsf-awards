This conference has been held for more than 50 years and owes it continued success to the active and diverse nature of scientific research that employs high pressures. This conference attracts leading researchers in physics, chemistry, materials and geo-sciences, as well as biology, who use and develop methods for the study of matter at extreme conditions. Invited talks at this year's conference will cover all of these topics and include the very latest advances in methods for predicting structures and properties of materials at very high pressures to practical chemistry applications at very moderate pressures. The conference places a special emphasis on providing an environment for interactions of young researchers with the leading experts in high pressure research.",
