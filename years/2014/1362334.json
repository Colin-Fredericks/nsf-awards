 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kenneth Jordan, of the University of Pittsburg is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Method program in the Chemistry division to develop computational approaches for studying the binding of extra electrons to molecules and clusters of molecules. Moving electrons from one location to another is the key to processes as diverse as photosynthesis, the operation of transistors, and corrosion.  In spite of the importance of excess electrons in biology, chemistry, and physics, how they interact with their surroundings is still not well understood.  Professor Jordan and coworkers develop and apply new computational methods to accurately characterize interactions between molecules and of molecules with surfaces. The project provides training of young researchers (students and postdoctoral fellows) in the area of computer modeling.\r\n \r\nThe goal of this project is to provide a detailed understanding of the relative importance of electrostatics and long-range correlation effects in the binding of excess electrons and positrons by molecules and clusters.  Due to its scalability on highly parallel computer systems and its potential for giving accurate interaction energies, the diffusion Monte Carlo method is being increasingly applied to chemical problems.  However, the diffusion Monte Carlo method requires the use of a trial wave function to fix the nodal surface, and little is known about the magnitude of the associated errors.  This research project is designed to address this problem, with particular emphasis on establishing the flexibility in the trial functions for accurate prediction of interaction energies of water with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with the goal of extrapolating to the graphene limit.  The projects are ideally suited to provide the participating students and postdoctoral researchers a broad background in theoretical chemistry and computer simulations.  This is a skill set that is in high demand in the workforce.  Efforts are planned to recruit more undergraduates, especially women and members of underrepresented minorities, into the group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the course of this grant, we introduced a new computational strategy for calculating the probability of excitation of molecules into various vibrational levels upon electron impact, a process which is important in the operation of certain laser systems.  Significant progress was also made in the application of the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method to the electronic structure of molecules.  The DMC method, which is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, has as its primary approximation the fixed node approximation in which a trial function is employed to impose a nodal surface for exchange of electrons.  Our studies have shown that the use of simple Hartree-Fock wave functions for fixing the nodal surface can result in significant errors in the DMC values of the interaction energies of van der Waals complexes.  We also used model systems (specifically coupled Drude oscillators) to elucidate the long-range attractive interactions between atoms and molecules which arise from quantum fluctuations of the electronic charge distribution.  One study used Drude oscillators to illustrate how dispersion interactions lead to permanent dipole moments, and another study provided insight into why the random phase approximation gives the exact dispersion energy in the case of dipole-dipole coupling.  The results of this research has been reported in 14 peer-reviewed publications and at several major symposia and workshops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth D Jordan"
