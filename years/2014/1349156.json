 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broader significance.\r\n\r\nNatural gas, composed primarily of methane, provides approximately a quarter of the total energy in the US and is therefore a major cornerstone of the US economy. Coalbed methane (CBM) provided about 9% of the total domestic natural gas production in 2010 and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA) estimates that CBM will continue to be an important part of the US energy portfolio through 2035 and in subsequent years. Through recent work and observation of deep coal-bearing sedimentary basins, it has become obvious that microbes are controlling the generation of this methane, and yet surprisingly little is known about what controls these microbes. There is growing public, regulatory, and industrial interest in recovery of natural gas from unconventional sources because of the continued need to develop alternative energy sources and the publicity associated with gas recovery from such sources, especially hydraulic fracturing (fracking). CBM production is estimated to remain constant through 2035, averaging 1.8 trillion cubic feet (CF) per annum.  Based on a current price of $4.57/MMBtu and the USEIA 2013 average heat content for natural gas (1.025 MMBtu/103 CF), CBM production has a value of approximately $8.43 billion/year. The investigators on this project propose to identify the component organisms in the communities that generate CBM, and importantly, what influences their metabolic processes leading to methane production. Armed with this knowledge it may be possible to increase the biogenic production of CBM, and provide a significantly more stable and profitable fuel resource. Enhancing current biogenic CBM production by even a modest 0.1% would, based on the above annual production value, would have an economic return of $8.43 million/year.  This research is supported via the NSF Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials (SusChEM) initiative.\r\n\r\nTechnical description.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research focuses on characterizing the genotypes and regulatory networks that mediate CBM-associated microbial metabolism in the subsurface. It seeks to build on our initial biogeochemical investigation of changes in hydrocarbon composition that accompany microbial incubations with coal extracts by elucidating the microbial community structure and functional regulation in bioreactor enrichments under controlled laboratory incubations.  Specifically, we will determine the influence of low concentrations of terminal electron acceptors on microbial community dynamics associated with increased organic matter degradation and altered rates of methane production. We will describe the genotypes of key components of each system, and determine how their relative abundance shifts over time and across experimental manipulations of terminal electron acceptor concentration. We will also map the transcription of their genes in response to experimental conditions and time, to determine the potential influence on the metabolism of the complex organic carbon in coals. These data, in concert with the physic-chemical parameterization of each bioreactor experiment will be combined to generate a compartmentalized metabolic model of the microbial assemblage. This model will be a first of its kind, laying the groundwork for modeling the metabolism of more complex systems.",

A similar pattern was observed in bottles containing both granular coal and organic coal extracts.  The clear correlation between the presence of vitrinite macerals and the amount of methane production in the current experiments is consistent with our previous work and provides additional evidence that OM associated with vitrinite is more readily converted to methane than other coal macerals.\n\n                  The effects of three different concentrations of four different TEAs (oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), and sulfate) on methane generation were evaluated to determine if initial, partial oxidation of coal OM resulted in ?activation? of OM and increased subsequent methane production.  To summarize the results of these experiments with sub-stoichiometric TEA concentrations, in no case did we observe increased methanogenesis from organic matter activation as we had hypothesized.  As expected, however, high concentrations of oxygen and nitrate were inhibitory to methane production.  Interestingly, Fe(III) and sulfate did not produce any long-term inhibition of methanogenesis, even at the highest concentration used.\n\n                  We have also made contributions to the development of research techniques in coal biogeochemistry and microbiology.  Research progress in this area is impeded, in part, by sample heterogeneity and the utilization of different methodologies by different researchers.  In previous work and in the current experiments, we attempted to deal with intra-experimental heterogeneities through the use of solvent-extracted coal OM extracts, which allowed the use of a uniform initial substrate in all replicate bottles.  In the current project, the use of solvent-extracted OM was problematic due to the possible presence of residual solvent in some incubations along with potential extraction of toxic compounds from coals that may have inhibited subsequent methanogenesis.
