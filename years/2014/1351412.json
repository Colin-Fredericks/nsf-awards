 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Early Faculty Career Development (CAREER) Program award provides funding for the large scale, facile and cost-effective manufacturing of a range of different monodisperse, multi-phasic, organic, micro- and nanoparticles possessing virtually any size, shape, and chemistry using a novel and facile technique termed WETS (Wettability Engendered Templated Self-assembly). Although, different routes to fabricate bi-phasic (Janus) or tri-phasic particles have been explored in the recent past, a simple technique that allows for the manufacture of mono-disperse, multi-phasic particles of any desired chemical composition, with precise control over their geometries, has not been developed thus far. This project plans to use the WETS technique to fabricate a wide variety of such nanoparticles of complex shapes and sizes as small as 20 nm. A goal is to produce nanoparticles that are below 50 nm to benefit from the unique properties available at that scale. Other objectives include (i) fabrication of a prototype system for automated, rapid, large-scale manufacturing, (ii) studying the self-assembly of the synthesized multiphasic particles under a variety of environmental conditions, (iii) understanding the effects of nanoparticle addition on the rheological and thermal properties of different polymer melts, and (iv) testing the suitability of the novel biodegradable multiphasic nanoparticles for targeting and killing ovarian and breast cancer cells.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this work will allow for the manufacturing of a range of different multi-phasic organic nanoparticles on a very large scale that will impact a wide range of fields including, polymer nanocomposites, semiconductor technology, drug delivery, biotechnology, energy, chemical and biological detection. The outreach and educational activities of the project are motivated by the PI's commitment to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines. The activities include conducting a five week \"Saturday Engineering Exploration\" program for middle school students, multiple hands-on demonstrations for high-school students, recruiting of undergraduates and a graduate student in the research, and incorporating this work in different undergraduate and graduate courses.",

The developed technique, termed WETS (Wettability Engendered Templated Self-assembly) involves multiple, layered, depositions of polymers and/or particles within the patterned domains and subsequent release of the multi-phasic assemblies from the template using a pre-deposited release layer. This technique provides us with an unprecedented ability to manufacture, on a large-scale, multi-phasic particles of any size, shape or chemistry. Using the WETS process, we have fabricated multiphasic particles that comprise a variety of different polymers and inorganic nanoparticles. The fabricated monodisperse particles have dimensions ranging from 25 nm &ndash; 200 &mu;m. We also demonstrated the utility of the WETS technique in developing multi-functional nanoparticles and cargo carriers that can be independently loaded with multiple drugs, as well as, functional nano-particles or organic molecules that can aid in the imaging and transport of the drug carriers to the targeted location.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, we extended the WETS technique for the fabrication of multi-phasic biodegradable particles that are of significant importance for drug delivery. We fabricated multi-phasic particles that are composed of both charged, as well as, neutral biodegradable polymeric layers, while precisely controlling the thickness of each polymeric layer, as well as the shape and size of the particles. Such particles are known to be ideal candidates for combinatorial therapies and theranostic applications. Further, we also demonstrated stimuli responsive behavior of the multi-phasic WETS particles that can dynamically reconfigure their shape, size, and surface composition in response to a change in the surrounding environment. In addition, we developed mathematical relations that predict the configuration of the multiphasic particles upon shape shifting in response to external stimuli.</p>\n<p>Additionally, three graduate students and 7 undergraduate students were involved with this research.
