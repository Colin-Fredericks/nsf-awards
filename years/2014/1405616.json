 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to investigate the development of undergraduate students' mathematical understanding in the context of learning physics, particularly while solving challenging upper-division physics problems. The project team will conduct an integrated program of research, curriculum development, and assessment of topics covering a typical sophomore- or junior-level course in mathematical methods. The broad goals are to conduct research on student resources, study the process of transfer from mathematics to physics and the coevolution of knowledge in the two disciplines, and develop a set of Math / Physics tasks suitable for instruction, research, and assessment materials that will integrate challenging math content with topics covered in upper-division physics core courses.  This project has the potential to impact a gateway course to the upper division for physics majors.  Curricular materials will be shared through electronic clearinghouses and via published research and it is anticipated that the project will inform instruction - both of math methods courses and subsequent physics courses in which the mathematics is used - nationally and internationally. The student population at California State University Fullerton includes many students from groups traditionally underrepresented in physics, so this project will provide access to research-based materials for these students and also ensure a diverse research population. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project brings together physics education research (PER) and research in undergraduate math education (RUME). It blends efforts at identifying and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics with efforts toward understanding knowledge transfer in mathematics. The work targets a key course for physics majors, the mathematical methods course that is offered in most departments at the sophomore- or junior-level. This course is typically intended to be a bridge between introductory physics and calculus courses and the more challenging mathematics and physics encountered by students in the core courses of electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics / quantum mechanics. The project will strengthen the research base in a portion of the curriculum that has, to this point, largely gone unexamined, and will touch upon, and build upon, work in several related areas, including PER in other upper-division courses as well as the extensive research base in undergraduate mathematics education. This proposed work will provide significant insights into transfer by probing the extent to which the nature of student understanding depends upon the disciplinary context. The research team has many years' experience in PER and RUME and have collaborated on successful research and curriculum development projects at the upper division in thermal physics and the physics-mathematics interface.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary outcomes of this work may be divided into two categories: identifying the variety ways that students interpret the notation and concept of the definite integral, while carrying out data analysis at a much finer grain size than previous research; and unexpectedly revealing a number of obstacles that students encounter that can interfere with their use of a Riemann Sum (\"sum of products\") interpretation of the definite integral.  Participants in this study included undergraduate students in an introductory Physics course, and third-year Physics majors.\n\nConsistent with previous research, students useful conceptions of the definite integral could be classified under four kinds: a procedure for finding an antiderivative, an area under a curve, a sum of products, and a finding entailing the average value of a function.  A more fine-grained analysis of student interviews showed greater complexity of thinking beneath these four categories. \n\nSome students, using what appears to be a procedural interpretation for the definite integral, can be shown to have more conceptually rich interpretations that support them in sense-making within certain contexts.  Their behavior speaks to the context sensitivity of the interpretations that they are using.\n\n\nContrary to what some previous researchers have suggested, Riemann sum reasoning and sum-of-products reasoning can be held quite distinctly by some students, and their failure to use sum-of-products is more than a mere failure to cue their knowledge of Riemann sums.\n\n\nInterpreting the definite integral as a computation that invokes the (weighted) average value of the integrand, though somewhat unusual, can be a powerful means of sense-making for some students.\n\n\nThese findings fit well into Wagner?s Transfer in Pieces framework for understanding knowledge transfer.

In addition, they suggest the current efforts to teach Riemann sum reasoning may require more care than previously recognized.\n\nThe research also revealed obstacles that students encounter that can limit their use of a Riemann Sum (\"sum of products\") interpretation of the definite integral.  The difficulties encountered by students appear to be rooted in a discrepancy between the process of computing a Riemann sum (which formally involves the limit of a sum of products) and the standard symbolic process of integration (which formally involves the use of antiderivatives of functions and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).  Generally speaking, students seem reluctant to use a Riemann sum interpretation to explain the antidifferentiation process.  In other words, if they find the value of an integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, they are reluctant to interpret the value they have found using the idea of Riemann sums.

A disbelief in the notion of \"infinitesimally small\" products led one student to conclude that Riemann sum interpretations were \"hokey,\" while another insisted that transformation of a function into its antiderivative was ultimately a mysterious process that is \"impossible to explain.\"\n\n\nA number of researchers in both physics and mathematics education have observed that many students, even those with a strong calculus background, fail to use Riemann sum-based interpretations of the definite integral, despite its unique value to supporting sense-making in many applied contexts.  This research suggests that part of the reason is that students may struggle with the peculiar marriage that must take place between the reasoning of Riemann sums and their limits, and the algebraic symbols and symbolic manipulations that represent the process of integration by means of antidifferentiation.  At face value, there is no obvious reason that students can find for using Riemann sums to interpret antidifferentiation procedures that not only appear to be, but actually are, algebraically unrelated to the complex limit and summation procedures they have learned for Riemann sums.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph F Wagner"
