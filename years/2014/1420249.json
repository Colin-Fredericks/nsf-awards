 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, to be conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and Wesleyan University, will study how children between ages 1 and 4 learn number words, the basic building blocks of mathematical learning.  The main research question will be how the grammar of a child's native language affects number word learning, leading to earlier or later progress in math.  The project will compare different languages (English, Arabic, and Slovenian) that have different grammatical rules for expressions about numbers.  This work will help improve understanding of how early language exposure fosters learning about numbers and math.  This project will advance the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in studying the cognitive basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning.\r\n\r\nThe project will compare English, Arabic, and two dialects of Slovenian, which vary in terms of grammatical marking for numbers.  The research will investigate a syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis in which finer grammatical distinctions support earlier learning.  The project will use various age-appropriate measures of number word learning, including looking time, set creation counting, and matching.",

They label groups of objects (\"Look there are three cups!\") and they teach them to count while pointing at objects in a group (\"One, two, three, four...\"). This project trained a large and diverse team of post doctoral researchers, PhD students, and undergraduate researchers to investigate this question. Specifically, the project explored how the grammatical structures of language that parents use while talking to children might affect the learning of basic number concepts. Language provides subtle but important grammatical cues to the meanings of number words. In English, we use the word \"one\" with singular nouns (\"one cup\") but we use larger numbers with plural nouns (\"two cups\"). Other languages, like Arabic and Slovenian, have special plural forms for describing sets of two things, and therefore mark a difference between singular, dual, and plural nouns. In order to explore the general question of how grammatical structure affects number word learning, the study tested the effect of these specific cues, and how they compared to other sources of input, like training with counting routines. The study found that children learning Slovenian, a dual language, were significantly faster to learn the meanings of the words \"one\" and \"two\" than children in any other culture, despite the fact that they were almost completely unable to count, and were significantly poorer counters than children in the US. In another part of the project, the research team explored the age at which children first learn number words and how this is related to understanding grammatical forms like the singular, plural, and dual. Also, the project tested how children learn the differences between grammatical forms like the singular \"a\" and the number word \"one\" and why it takes many months longer to learn \"one\". Together, these studies suggest that number word learning - a critical foundation to childhood numeracy - is strongly influenced by parents use of number words in natural conversation, in informative grammatical structures. The results of the project suggest that parents and early childhood educators should balance training on counting routines with robust amounts of natural number talk.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/14/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Barner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
