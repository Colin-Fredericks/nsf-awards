The food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, medicinal, polymer, and oil and gas industries routinely process emulsions and foams.  One of the key requirements in making useful, long-lived products from emulsions and foams is to guarantee that they are stable by preventing the drops or bubbles from coalescing with each other, which can degrade product quality.  This project will use a microtensiometer developed by the investigators to examine the physical and chemical properties of drop and bubble interfaces and determine how those properties influence the coalescence of two drops under carefully controlled conditions.  Using the microtensiometer, the investigators will examine the coalescence process while simultaneously acquiring information about the interfacial characteristics of the drops.  The influence of emulsifiers that can stabilize emulsions by adsorbing onto drop interfaces and preventing coalescence will be examined.  Then, the team will explore the effectiveness of a novel stabilizer consisting of nanoparticles coated with surfactants.   The results will provide new tools to scientists and engineers who formulate emulsions and foams and design systems to process them.\r\n\r\nA microtensiometer will be used to study the interfacial rheology of small drops and bubbles with radii between 50 and 150 micrometers.  By monitoring the pressure inside the bubble and the interfacial area, the dynamic surface tension and interfacial elasticity of the interface can be determined.  To access conditions where the adsorption of surfactants onto the interface is kinetically limited, the device will be modified by adding a convective flow past the interface.  The microtensiometer will then be used to observe the coalescence of two drops or bubbles with identical curvature, composition and history, which will help eliminate ambiguities that occur in other coalescence measurements.  The results will be used to ascertain the relationship between interfacial rheology and coalescence.  The effects of particle-laden interfaces on coalescence will be characterized using a model system of surfactant-coated nanoparticles that readily adsorb onto interfaces.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe processing of many materials important in our daily lives involve emulsions, or mixtures of immiscible liquids; from food and pharmaceutical processing through oil recovery, industries vital to our economy often require the processing and control of a complicated multiphase fluid.  Emulsion studies are often macroscopic and made complicated by inconsistencies in mixing, break-up and coalescence occurring simultaneously and a lack of understanding of the impact of additives in the system.  Coalescence is the process of droplets joining and growing and is a complex and poorly understood process dominated by the liquid-liquid interfaces.  Coalescence studies are often attempted in multi-droplet systems leading to complications in separating collisions and coalescence.   Numerous mechanisms contribute to the dynamic process of coalescence, but interfacial rheology, or the mechanical properties of the interface, is often argued to be relevant without a fundamental connection between this (usually) ill-defined property and the coalescence phenomena.  In this work, we are driven by the hypothesis that the relationship between interfacial rheology and coalescence can be quantified.  We have used an experimental approach to develop fluid-fluid interfaces with well-defined properties and determine the impact on controlled coalescence. \n\nThe intellectual merit of the work comes from targeting two objectives. First, we build on current work in our laboratories to develop an approach to quantify coalescence between fluid-fluid interfaces with the same curvature, composition and history, and second, we characterize the impact of adsorbed particle-laden interfaces on coalescence using a model system of surfactant/nanoparticle complexes.  Meeting this second objective provides a fully characterized model system to investigate the nebulous connection between \"interfacial rheology\" and emulsion stability.   We have developed two model systems for use in this work and these two systems also provide model interfaces for the broader field of interfacial characterization.  Nanoparticle/surfactant (NS) complexes and polyelectrolyte/surfactant (PES) complexes are chosen as potential model systems and fully characterized.   In both cases, the rate at which material reaches an interface is controlled by one part of the complex, the surfactant, while the ultimate properties of the interface are controlled by the other component (nanoparticle or polyelectrolyte).  The understanding of this synergy provides a tool to engineers to design complexes for processing of emulsions.  The two systems also offer two different types of interfaces; the NS complex results in rigid interfaces for potential use in capsules and coalescence inhibitors, the PES complex results in elastic interfaces that are appropriate for coalescence studies.   The characterize coalescence itself, we have developed methods to measure coalescence time between to equivalent interfaces.  Results indicate that the NS treated interfaces are either fluid, with very low dilatational modulus, or rigid, and essentially solid.   Since the interfaces appear to transition from \"fast coalescence\" to \"impossible to coalesce\", this is not an ideal system for coalescence studies, however the PES system will provide a wider range of interfacial properties to study.\n\nThe broader technological impact of this work is transformative as it provides new tools to formulation scientists and engineers for the design and optimization of multiphase fluid/fluid systems like emulsions.  The approach developed as part of this work provides a tool to characterize the detailed nature of coalescence of complex interfaces. This level of understanding will allow these complex formulations to be optimized (reduction of additives) and allow novel materials to be utilized.
