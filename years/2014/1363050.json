Despite the fact that these materials have become important in a large number of consumer electronics applications, there are aspects of their microscopic behavior that remain poorly understood.  Prof. Peteanu and her group are working on improving our understanding of some of the molecular-level behavior of these materials, with an eye towards making improved materials.  The young scientists working with Prof. Peteanu will receive interdisciplinary training in experimental physical chemistry and macromolecular science. \r\n\r\nProf. Peteanu and her group are carrying out a multi-pronged research program to obtain a better understanding how molecular-level behavior influences the photophysical properties of organic oligomers that mimic important classes of organic polymers.  Specifically, Peteanu and her students are:  (1) performing experimental and theoretical studies of the ways in which electric fields lead to emission quenching in a variety of engineered materials; the theoretical work benefits from collaboration with David Yaron (Carnegie Mellon University), Sergei Tretiak (Los Alamos National Laboratory), and Jing Ma (Nanjing University); (2) conducting experimental and theoretical studies of aggregate spectra; experiments will benefit from collaboration with the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory; and (3) developing higher-resolution imaging of confluent films and device structures to understand the photophysical behavior of differing regions (core/shell) in aggregates.  Students working with Prof. Peteanu receive training in modern physical chemistry methods.  Prof. Peteanu and her group are also involved in educational outreach efforts to the larger community, including National Chemistry Week activities at the Carnegie Science Center.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn important area in chemistry is the development of new and precisely tailored organic molecules for opto-electronic devices including lightweight and flexible photovoltaics and light emitting diodes.  These are used for the conversion of solar energy to electricity and for the production of energy-efficient displays and lighting, respectively.   This field has had some recent successes that have reduced the gap between the performance of organic materials and that of existing technologies that do not have the advantages of being lightweight or flexible. \n\nOne well-recognized limitations of organic molecules for device applications, however, is that they are not stable against damage by light and oxygen.  Another is that the properties that are most important for their use in these applications depend very sensitively on how they are processed. Processing involves taking the molecules from the solution phase and creating a solid state film that can be used to manufacture a device.  Frequently, the important properties of a molecule for device applications, such as how much light it can emit, the colors (wavelengths) that it emits, and its ability to conduct electricity, can change from solution to the solid state in ways that are not predictable and are sometimes deleterious.  This proposal focused on addressing these two limitations on the efficiencies and longevities of organic devices.  \n\nThis project consisted of an in-depth investigation of the ways in which the properties of the solvent in which the organic molecules and polymers are dissolved determine the amount of light they emit and the wavelengths of light that are emitted in solution and in thin film form.  We showed that adding the simple step of filtering the solution prior to forming a thin film could increase the amount of light emitted by the film by up to a factor of five and create much more uniform and higher quality films.  Filtration works by disrupting agglomerates or clusters of molecules that form in solution and that are non-emissive.  Though these agglomerates are formed at extremely low concentrations, they nonetheless adversely affect the performance of the material.  We also found that addition of a polar solvent (ie acetonitrile or methanol) to a solution of a conjugated polymer decreased its emission in solution but increased it, sometimes significantly, when the sample was processed into the solid state.   In addition, films made from samples after polar solvent addition are much more stable against light and oxygen damage than are those made without polar solvent addition.  This suggests a path to forming both more emissive and more stable films that may lead to superior devices. \n\nDuring this project, a second methodology was developed to improve the emission properties and longevity of organic materials.  It involves depositing the organic polymer thin film on a very thin film of a metal.  This takes advantage of what is known as a plasmonic effect to improve the stability of the molecule against light and oxygen-induced damage by up to an order of magnitude.  It turns out to be a very generally-applicable method of improving molecular stability that can be used in a wide range of applications including for imaging biological specimens using organic dyes. \n\nThe technological impact of the work lie in the enhancement of the emission properties of organic polymers that can lead to more efficient devices for solar energy conversion and for lighting and displays on phones and televisions.  Improvements made in the sensitivity of biological imaging using plasmonic effects could have a significant impact on research in biology and biophysics.  The educational impact of the work was in the training of several Ph. D. and undergraduate students and through outreach activities to K-12 students and the general public. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda Peteanu"
