Mohammad Iqbal, University of Northern Iowa (UNI) and Tara N. Bhattarai, Head, Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University (TU) for environmental research on the Bagmati River in the Kathmandu Valley. The goal of this project is three-fold: 1) provide US-students with exposure to environmental problems in Nepal, 2) engage with the Nepalese counterparts to develop field procedures that may be applicable nationally and internationally, and 3) conduct innovative research and exchange technical expertise to prevent further degradation of the environment. The Bagmati River has become highly polluted in recent decades due to the dramatic increase in population and urban development. TU will provide laboratory and office space for data analysis and management, and project coordination. Dr. Bhattarai will facilitate access to the hydrologic and meteorological data base maintained by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) in Kathmandu. This proposal requests funding for the first phase of this project.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators will apply scientific principles and methodology to solve an important environmental problem. Faculty and students will focus on developing an effective hydrological assessment scheme for a polluted body of water in a densely populated urban setting. A detailed procedure for water and sediment analysis will be applied to the Bagmati River study. The hydrologic characteristics will be studied to develop maps of pollution hotspots in an attempt to develop best management practice guidelines. Severe damage to watersheds resulting from accelerated urban growth is a worldwide problem. Globally, environmental policy makers are looking for new approaches to watershed management. The Bagmati study will provide insights into elements that are of primary importance to understanding temporal and spatial distribution of urban pollutants.\r\n\r\nBroader description \r\nThis investigation establishes linkages among three critical aspects of urban watershed studies:  ecosystem management, environmental health, and cultural awareness. Scarcity of fresh water is currently recognized as one of the greatest challenge of the 21st century. The research team proposes to deal with this challenge by sharing technical knowledge, expertise, and resources that will reduce the impact of environmental pollution in the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. The project will create unique opportunities for US students to gain experiential learning at an international location. They will work as a team with Nepalese students in an interactive learning environment that includes observation, syntheses of data, scientific reasoning, and conclusions. US and Nepalese students will learn to understand different cultural perspectives, and for the PI, this project will contribute to teaching effectiveness and the ability to work with international partners. A follow-on proposal to this CNIC award will be submitted to the NSF/DUE Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUES) program.",

The project deals with environmental assessment of Bagmati River in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The river has visibly turned into a highly polluted water body due to the dramatic increase in population and urban development in the valley in recent decades. The goal of this project is to find the primary avenues of pollution and recommend remedial measures to prevent a probable human environmental disaster in the area. The outcomes of the project were assessed in several different areas, including accomplishments of project goals and objectives, ensuring data quality, development of sampling and analytical skills, understanding of the hydrologic environment, final recommendations, and pursuing dissemination plans.</p>\n<p>Eleven (11) sites along the Bagmati River were weekly sampled from middle of May through late July both in 2015 and 2016. Additional sampling was conducted during December &ndash; January of 2015-16. Water samples were analyzed for temperature, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, E. coli, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate, total phosphorus (TP), and chloride. According to 2016 data, the average TDS value increased from 52 mg/L in Sundarijal (site 1, near source) to 595 mg/L near Teku (site 6, mid-town). Several sites before and after site 6 show an excessively high TDS during the month of June, the peak monsoon time. TDS concentrations at most sites dramatically drops to around 200 mg/L by late July (late monsoon). TSS increases from 43 mg/L at site 1 to 659 mg/L at site 6, indicating a contamination hotspot around Teku site. Although DO in the upper reaches (Sundarijal and Jorpati) were mostly recorded between 5 and 7 mg/L, the values quickly dropped below 2 mg/L at all sites in the city areas downstream. This is an extremely depleted water body in oxygen content so is not expected to support a sustainable aquatic environment. E.coli increases from around 4000 MPN/100 mL in Sundarijal (site 1) to 46,000 MPN/100 mL in the Teku area (site 6). The high concentrations of E. coli and very low DO along the urbanized section showed influence of direct sewage disposal from the city. As the river flows out of the core city areas, water quality starts to improve near site 9 (Sundarighat) and site 10 (Chobar). The relatively low TP and N concentrations indicate that the watershed is not impacted by agricultural practices. The Water Quality Index (WQI) sharply drops from &ldquo;medium&rdquo; to &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; category near the Gaurighat (site 2A) area. This is where the river meets with large scale municipal and industrial dumping directly into the river. The WQI values remain in bad category all the way to the final sampling spot at Chobar. The results clearly reflect the negative impact of urbanization on the water quality. The impact of this degraded water quality condition has been on the people directly relying on the river for household as well as recreational activities.</p>\n<p>Each project participant received thorough training in sampling protocol, storage, and analysis according to standard data quality policies and procedures. Their performance in field work constantly improved during the project. There were evaluations of data to determine if they were of the right type, quality, and quantity to support their intended use. Besides, data were qualitatively checked against external factors, such as dilution by episodic rains or seasonal fluctuations in dissolved nutrients. All field and lab data matched with their expected levels based on seasonal trends. Critical problem solving skills and reasoning of students were assessed in field situations where real life problems were encountered. Field-oriented questions were incorporated in preplanned brain-storming sessions to evaluate students&rsquo; critical thinking skills. It was found that exposing students to field activities significantly added to their understanding of scientific concepts. As the work progressed, through hands-on work and data analysis they showed better understanding of how science works. We also sought comments from all participants about the impact of the project on their overall understanding of the problem. They showed considerable enthusiasm about the project because of their ability to connect with the causes and effects of water pollution. Initial ideas have been shared with the scientific community through conference presentations and published abstracts. We are now preparing short reports to share our ideas and recommendations with the Nepal city government. The city Mayor has already been contacted and we are in the process of meeting with his team to discuss our findings. We met with numerous families in the immediate vicinity of the river to understand their views and make our findings known to them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
