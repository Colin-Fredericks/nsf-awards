 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports three annual \"Georgia Topology Conference\" meetings to be held at The University of Georgia in Athens, GA on May 21-25, 2014, and subsequently in May 2015 and May 2016. Topology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of the space we live in, particularly of the properties of the space that are not changed as the space is continuously deformed.  There are deep relationships between topology, geometry, and physics, as well as applications to topics such as fluid dynamics, robotics, and image analysis. It is this diversity of approaches to central problems that has always energized research in topology.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia Topology Conference is an annual event that has been organized by topologists at the University of Georgia over the past half-century. An important aspect of this conference is that the organizers have consistently stressed the participation of new and recent doctoral recipients as speakers and encouraged participation by graduate students. With a format featuring the participation of several senior mathematicians and a larger group of junior researchers, this conference series plays a significant role in both disseminating the newest research and preparing graduate students and postdocs for a successful career in mathematics. The conference encourages and supports participation by members of under-represented groups. The Georgia Topology Conference in 2014 will be centered on the theme of automorphisms of surfaces. \r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the conference web site\r\nhttp://www.math.uga.edu/~topology/",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSince 1961, the Georgia Topology Conference has served as a valuable venue for the dissemination of important new results in geometric topology and for the career development of young topologists.  Most years, the organizers choose a special topic in geometric topology and invite a mixture of established researchers and strong early-career mathematicians working in that area to give one-hour talks at the conference.  Support is also provided for Ph. D. students with relevant interests to participate.  The conference is designed with an eye toward encouraging communication and collaboration between the particiants, with an unhurried schedule for the talks and time allotted for less formal interaction.  For many of the younger participants, this is one of their first opportunities to present their work to a broad audience, and there are many successful topologists around the country who look back on their past participation in the conference as a formative event in their careers.  \n\nEvery eight years the conference is much larger, lasting two weeks and covering major developments from many subfields from the past few years.  These international conferences usually attract around 200 participants, many of whom are early-career mathematicians who benefit both from cutting-edge research talks and from expository talks and other activities that provide relevant background.  \n\nThis grant funded three of the annual smaller conferences, and also provided part of the funding for the large international conference that was held in 2017.  Among the smaller conferences, the 2014 conference was organized by Will Kazez and Dan Margalit and concerned mapping class groups of surfaces.  Michael Usher organized the 2015 conference on topics related to symplectic topology and dynamics.  The 2016 conference, organized by David Gay, Juanita Pinzon, and Michael Sullivan, brought together students and researchers in multiple areas who use tools from parametrized Morse theory.  In each case, the conference provided a stimulating environment that fostered new mathematical interactions and gave helpful experiences to young mathematicians.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Usher"
