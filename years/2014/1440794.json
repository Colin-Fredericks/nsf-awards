 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution serving over 33,000 students in the heart of the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. Many scientific research projects carried out at the university require high bandwidth network connections. While regional and national networks provide such connections to the Metroplex, the campus infrastructure cannot currently support these higher rates. Modern networking technologies like Science DMZ's and Software Defined Networks also require changes to the core campus network design. This project improves and modernizes the UT-Arlington network infrastructure by deploying high performance routing equipment in order to support research on the university campus at the Exabyte scale.\r\n\r\nScientists at UT-Arlington are studying data from the Large Hadron Collider to measure the properties of the newly discovered Higgs boson, and to search for new laws of physics. Researchers are studying data to advance the fields of genomics and bioinformatics, and to prepare a foundation for developing individualized approaches to medicine and the treatment of illnesses. Research in earth plate movements, brain research, and mathematical modeling of bioengineering, global environments, data mining and chemical structures provide crucial quantitative assessments on many issues ranging from local to global environmental concerns, healthcare, and advance our scientific understanding and engineering expertise. Water management research is crucial to environment stewardship in the Southwest region. In supporting these and other research areas, improved campus networking provides benefit to the region, advances scientific knowledge, and helps train the diverse student population at UT-Arlington.",
