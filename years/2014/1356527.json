 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Expanding Career and Education Learning in Information Technology (EXCEL-IT) project combines financial aid with advising and support services to low-income and under-served students at Green River Community College who are pursuing Applied Associate's and Bachelor's degrees in Information Technology. EXCEL-IT is awarding a minimum of 89 scholarships from 2014-2017 and is improving student access to careers as IT professionals in an area of high national importance via outreach and concurrent enrollment in K-12 school districts. Not only can project graduates meet employers' workforce needs more economically than foreign labor, but such careers deter reliance on government subsidies and empower graduates to be responsible citizens and taxpayers.\r\n \r\nThe technical merit of the project lies in its coordinated approach to increasing student retention and graduation rates through advising, tailored support services, and cohort-based activities. In addition, the project is producing a diverse body of well-educated and skilled graduates who are increasing the breadth of perspectives and backgrounds in the Computer Science and Information Technology profession. Moreover, the project is advancing scientific understanding of how four-year degrees pursued and obtained through community colleges can effectively broaden access to STEM careers for low-income and under-represented students. Relevant data and identified best practices are being shared through professional associations and external partners, which include a statewide IT workforce agency and a regional ATE Center, thus contributing to the larger knowledge-base about the undergraduate STEM education enterprise.",
