 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean surrounding Antarctica is home to an extraordinary assemblage of fishes, dominated by a single group that are extremely well-suited to life in icy waters and which are of significant ecological importance there. Of great concern is the capacity of these fishes to withstand increases in temperature as the region of the Western Antarctic Peninsula warms at a rate faster than any other area in the Southern hemisphere. One particular group of Antarctic fishes, known as the icefishes, are particularly vulnerable to increases in temperature because unlike all other vertebrates on earth, icefishes are white-blooded due to their lack of the oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin. This greatly reduces their capacity to transport and deliver oxygen to tissues compared to red-blooded Antarctic fishes. Previous studies have shown that icefishes are indeed less tolerant to elevations in temperature but the underlying factors are completely unknown. Additionally, it is not understood if red- or white-blooded Antarctic fishes can adjust, or acclimate, to modest increases in temperature, similar to those changes in temperature the animals might experience as the earth warms. The investigators will determine if heart function and/or nervous system function limits thermal tolerance of Antarctic fishes, and will determine their capacity to acclimate to warmer temperatures.  The project will further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists by training graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, the project will collaborate with a high school biology teacher from a school which serves a largely minority student body. The students will learn about the marine environment, and will construct a camera to be used in the field to learn more about Antarctic fishes. Two students and the teacher will also attend a summer marine biology internship program.\r\n\r\nAntarctic fishes within the suborder Notothenioidei (called \"notothenioids\") are among the organisms on earth least able to deal with changes in temperature. The hemoglobinless icefish are even less able to withstand temperature changes than are red-blooded notothenioids. While this is well documented, the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms responsible are unknown. The investigators will test the hypotheses that cardiac work is significantly greater in icefishes compared to red-blooded species, and that as temperature increases, the greater cardiac work of icefishes, coupled with reduced blood oxygen-carrying capacity, results in cardiac failure at a lower temperature compared to red-blooded species. They also hypothesize that neuronal function limits thermal tolerance of red-blooded notothenioids. These hypotheses will be tested using a wide variety of experiments. For example, the investigators will measure heart rate concurrently with critical thermal maximum. They will also characterize metabolic and gene-expression responses to elevated temperature and determine if mitochondrial function contributes to thermal tolerance using a variety of techniques. To determine if neuronal function limits thermal tolerance they will quantify behavioral responses to warming of whole animals and to warming of only the brain area. They will also determine if acclimation to warmer temperatures impacts heart function and they will measure activities of a variety of enzymes from central metabolic pathways.",

The Antarctic fish fauna is dominated by members of the Notothenioidei suborder, which includes both red-blooded fishes that have hemoglobin to transport oxygen, and the unique icefishes, whose blood is startlingly white due to their lack of hemoglobin. These fishes have evolved for approximately 20 million years in an icy cold, oxygen-rich environment where water temperatures historically have hovered near -1?C with little seasonal variation. Yet like all other places on earth, the Southern Ocean is rapidly warming. As a result of their long evolution at cold temperature, Antarctic fishes are exquisitely sensitive to increases in temperature, especially the icefishes. Survival in a warming world will require adjustments in physiological and biochemical processes to accommodate an increase in temperature (thermal plasticity), and sufficient genetic diversity within populations (adaptive capacity). Our studies sought to characterize the thermal plasticity of Antarctic fishes in key traits that constrain thermal tolerance to better assess their ability to survive in a warming climate.

Encouragingly we found that icefishes have a greater capacity to modulate cardiac function than previously thought, significantly increasing both heart rate and cardiac output in response to an acute increase in temperature. We determined that thermal limits of cardiac performance are influenced by cardiac mitochondrial function and the ability to maintain ATP levels, which are higher in the red-blooded <em>N. coriiceps</em> compared to the icefish <em>C. aceratus</em>. Cardiac performance is also associated with membrane integrity.

Encouragingly we found that cardiac performance of <em>N. coriiceps</em> improves with warm acclimation. Hearts of warm-acclimated <em>N. coriiceps</em> failed at a higher temperature and maintained a higher cardiac output than animals held at ambient temperature.
