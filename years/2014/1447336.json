 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Overview\r\n\r\nThe PI will engage in research to develop a new philosophical account of collaborative explanations, an important kind of scientific explanation that answers questions about how complex systems work in terms of their interacting parts; they produce understanding by unifying causal systems at multiple levels. The key notion to be explored and analyzed is jointness, the relation among components working together. The PI will investigate how collaborative explanations contrast with other philosophical accounts of explanation, determine what analogies (if any) are there between collaborative explanation and collaborative scientific practices, and explore the kinds of knowledge or understanding that results from collaborative explanation. The study will yield an account of collaborative explanation explicitly distinguished from alternatives, a cogent analysis of jointness that yields plausible diagnoses of several important cases, and provides epistemic grounds for distinctive features of collaborative explanation.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe proposed research fills a significant gap in current philosophical accounts of scientific explanation. The latter fall mainly into two classes: covering-law views, and causal theories that take physics to be fundamental. But neither clarifies the remarkable progress in biology since the mid-20th century. Though recent accounts of mechanistic explanation do so, these treat it as a special case of causal explanation. Focusing on collaboration, the PI's approach offers a fresh perspective on a traditional topic. The proposed research also contributes to social epistemology. Though science is intensely collaborative, philosophers often downplay this aspect. By making the concept of collaboration central to scientific explanation, the proposed research is well-suited to explore analogies (and perhaps stronger connections) between features of scientific explanations and the practices that give rise to them. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has potential to open new theoretical terrain in philosophy of science, foster ties with allied fields of study, and promote greater participation of women in philosophy. It will articulate new theoretical connections with social epistemology thereby forging connections with other disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. The PI participates in several interdisciplinary initiatives that will bring results before diverse audiences; results of the proposed research will be communicated to historians, anthropologists, environmental philosophers, biologists, social scientists, and policy researchers. Finally, the PI belongs to an under-represented group, women philosophers of science, and support for this research will help redress this imbalance",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funded project is part of longer-term research aimed at articulating a new account of scientific explanation.  Explanation is a central activity of science, and a core aim of philosophy of science is to characterize this activity and its epistemic products, so as to illuminate the value of explanation and suggest guidelines for how we might better accomplish it.  So although the primary impact of this research is academic, the ideas developed could potentially be of broader use for public understanding of science, and for scientists\u00c6 own progressive improvements to their practice. \n\nOne fact that has long been known is that explanations vary across the sciences, ranging from mathematical derivations to details causal models to robust results of computer simulations.  Accordingly, no single philosophical account is accepted for all sciences, and the alternatives on offer differ widely, emphasizing universal laws, unifying formulas, fundamental processes, or difference-making causes.  The increasingly interdisciplinary character of scientific research means that different styles of explanation are often implicated in a single research program.  The various established philosophical accounts of explanation, however, are not designed to accommodate pluralism, but rather to characterize all scientific explanations, across the board.\n\nThe new account of scientific explanation that I am developing takes pluralism and tolerance of diversity as the starting point.  The basic idea is that some scientific explanations involve understanding that can rightly be called \u00e6collaborative,\u00c6 and that this collaborative character has implications for scientific practice.  Understanding these aspects of explanation could facilitate collaborative research practices, particularly across fields and disciplines.  During the period of funding, I made considerable progress on this account of \u00e6collaborative explanation,\u00c6 although the basic idea and early analyses pre-dates the award.  Outcomes of the funded research (July 2014-June 2015) were as follows:\n\n1) Clarifying the kind of pluralism that is needed, and the ways this contrasts with traditional philosophical aims.  My account is oriented toward the ways different kinds of explanatory models/practices can reinforce or undercut one another in science.  My ongoing project is to extract heuristics for \u00e6collaboration\u00c6 among different approaches to explanation.  To this end, explanations in molecular and cell biology are of particular significance, as they combine several different styles of explanation in a single model. \n\n2) Articulating contrasts as well as continuities between my account of explanation and other accounts (Craver\u00c6s account of mechanisms, Bechtel\u00c6s view of same, Woodward\u00c6s interventionism, and Kitcher\u00c6s explanatory unification). These distinctions show that my account is a genuinely new contribution to the philosophical literature, which nonetheless does not seek to displace all predecessors, but rather to support pluralism about explanation, and suggest ways to fruitfully deploy it in interdisciplinary contexts.\n\n3) A more nuanced and effective view of explanation in interdisciplinary contexts, such as systems biology and (certain strands of) social theory.  Briefly, different approaches and standards of explanation should be viewed as complements that can provide resources for one another, rather than as competing alternatives.  This idea needs to be developed further, and analyzed more systematically, but the basic contours of the account are in place.\n\n4) Detailed case studies showing that \u00e6complementary\u00c6 relations figure prominently in explanatory models of molecular biology processes, theories of the chemical bond, and some models of human collaborative activity.  These cases show that explanations featuring mutual relations connecting diverse parts are found in biological, chemical, and social sciences. \n\n5) The above explanatory models are \u00e6unifying explanations,\u00c6 in multip..."
