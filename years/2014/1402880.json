Single particle analysis is employed across a wide range of disciplines such as molecular biology, analytical chemistry, biomedicine, biophysics, physiology, genomics, and proteomics. Despite their success to date, single molecule studies suffer from certain limitations: They typically use a single detection mechanism; they detect particles transiently in flow or tethered to a surface which can interfere with the molecular properties; and they rely on complex apparatuses or techniques that require a lot of expertise. This project will address these challenges by developing a new device for sensing and analyzing of individual molecules. It will enable holding a single particle in place for prolonged observation without compromising biological function and then investigate the particle for an extended period of time. The integration of these capabilities on a single chip will simplify experimental procedures and enable researchers to analyze many single molecules in rapid succession. \r\nIn addition to graduate student training in nanoelectronics, micro/nanofabrication, and single molecule analysis, undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be involved through the IMMERSE program at BYU, and the UC LEADS and CAMP programs at UCSC. Additional outreach to K-12 schools will be implemented at BYU with a program called ?Chip Camp? which is conducted through the MICRON Foundation with the assistance of IMMERSE students. In Santa Cruz, a new and unique partnership between UCSC, a local K-8 school, and a children?s museum will be developed to strengthen the connections between the University and the community, and to provide exposure to nanobiology and nanobiosensing at an age-appropriate level.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY: \r\nThis collaborative effort between the Applied Optics group of Holger Schmidt (UC Santa Cruz), the molecular biology group of Harry Noller (UC Santa Cruz), and the Microfabrication group of Aaron Hawkins (Brigham Young University) will explore a new approach to sensing and analyzing single biological nanoparticles by combining nanopore-based electrical detection and fluorescence analysis in a single-particle trap. Detection and analysis of single biological nanoparticles is a critical tool for understanding biological processes on the molecular level and employed across a wide range of disciplines such as molecular biology, analytical chemistry, biomedicine, biophysics, physiology, genomics, and proteomics. The transformative impact of this project will be to create the first integrated device that can trap and analyze single biomolecules using both electrical and optical readouts. This will enable researchers to investigate hundreds to thousands of individual molecules such as viruses or ribosomes in rapid succession, creating robust statistical data sets.",

After measuring their performance, we discovered that the modes from our waveguides were not overlapping properly at the intersection region and we could not effectively control fluid flow through the same channels which we were using for optical interrogation.  This led to a third-generation design described as the octagon.  This uses an octagonal shaped excitation region capable of four optical inputs and four fluid inputs.  In this way, we were able to independently control particle movement with positional feedback.  We successfully fabricated octagonal-design chips and tested them for optical throughput and trapping efficiency.  They proved to provide trapping in 2 dimensions and measureable improvement in particle trapping time compared to 1 D trapping chips.\n\n \n\nTwo graduate students and five undergraduate students worked on this project.  The two graduate students have now completed their Ph.D. degrees.  The subject of this project forms at least part of their dissertations.  All student participants were exposed to a variety of engineering fields including optics, materials, bioengineering, and semiconductor processing.  All students who worked on the project are now employed in the semiconductor industry or working on graduate degrees.\n\n \n\nEtching and deposition recipes used for the construction of our devices were posted on the BYU cleanroom website (http://cleanroom.byu.edu) and made available to any internet users.  These recipes including information about film stresses under different deposition conditions.  The cleanroom and our fabrication work has also been featured prominently during Chip Camp, a summer day camp held at BYU for 7th and 8th grade students.  During Chip Camp, students participate in a variety of learning activities including dressing in a bunnysuit and going into the BYU cleanroom to see microfabrication equipment in action.  During the summer of 2015, 120 students participated in Chip Camp.  During the summer of 2016, 130 students participated.  During each of the summer sof 2017, 2018 and 2019, approximately 160 students participated.
