 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: 1351545\r\nPI: Desjardins, Olivier\r\n\r\nThe proposed CAREER project is focused on the computational investigation of the fluid physics at the interface between two fluids moving in the turbulent flow regime. This research and education project aims at improving the state of theoretical understanding of turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows using recently advanced numerical methods in conjunction with high performance computing resources. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive mechanistic and statistical theory of turbulence for interface interactions in liquid-gas flows.  The proposed theory could have far-reaching impacts in the way such flows are approached by scientists and engineers, including new predictive models to enable simulations of engineering devices and natural processes that were impossible to do before.  \r\nThe main outcomes of this effort are expected to be a significant leap forward in first-principle modeling of turbulent liquid-gas flows, a new massive open online course (MOOC) on multiphase flows to maximize the educational impact to engineering students, and an iPad multiphase flow simulator to inspire students and the general public.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nWhile a significant body of work deals with fundamental stability of liquid-gas interfaces, a comprehensive mechanistic and statistical theory of turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows remains to be proposed, its development hindered by lack of experimental data and, at least until recently, inadequate numerical methods. The proposed work is centered upon unique, high fidelity numerical simulations of the interactions between turbulent eddies and active interfaces.  The proposed work will not only lead to a new theory, but also to new large eddy simulation (LES) models that will be based on the concept of optimal estimators and on the transport equation for sub-grid scale kinetic energy. Such models can change the way engineers make predictions for such flows.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nComplex turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows are ubiquitous in both nature and industrial applications, with relevance in climate modeling and oceanic transport, fire suppression, technical devices such as pumps, combustors, and pipelines, and applications such as fuel injection, nuclear cooling, hydropower, and concentrated solar power among many others. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which turbulence interfaces behave can lead to the design of safer and more efficient processes in these systems. The PI plans to make code developed in this project available to the scientific community, enabling research elsewhere. The educational activities of the proposed project will improve education and scientific literacy at different levels. A philosophy of ?accessibility of research? will be used to form and mentor two undergraduate students per year, chosen from under-represented minorities. The proposed multiphase turbulence theory will be integrated into a new graduate course on multiphase flow dynamics. To impact a larger number of engineering students, this course will be offered as a MOOC. Finally, an iPad app will be developed that exploits rapid and robust schemes for real-time computation and rendering of two-dimensional multiphase flows, providing a physics-based entertaining and educational application to inspire and educate middle school students about fluid dynamics science and engineering.",

Such flows are complex in part because of the interactions between phase-interface dynamics -- impacted in particular by surface tension -- and the surrounding turbulent eddies. While our mechanistic and statistical understanding of single-phase turbulence has progressed enough to enable the efficient computational modeling of a wide range of turbulent flows, the same cannot be said about turbulent multiphase flows. In this project, we endeavored to elucidate key aspects of the dynamics of liquid-gas interfaces in turbulence. Specifically, three objectives were pursued: (1) the exploration of the scales of interfacial corrugations from direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows with interface tracking, (2) the development of new capabilities for capturing and modeling interface dynamics at the sub-grid scale, paving the way toward large-eddy simulations of turbulent two-phase flows, and (3) the creation of a modern, tutorial-based short course on multiphase flow modeling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The central enabling tool of this project is a novel canonical two-phase flow configuration ideal for probing the scales of interfacial deformation, and their impact on the underlying turbulence. Over the course of this project, a database of over 50 different combination of Reynolds number, Weber number, and forcing conditions was developed, and analyzed extensively (see Figure 1 for an illustration of the flow studied in this project). A key outcome of this effort was the direct measurement from simulation data of the Kolmogorov critical radius, i.e., the critical scale that separates large interfacial corrugations that are controlled by turbulent eddies from small scale corrugations that are rapidly damped by surface tension. This scale plays a critical role when deciding how fine of a mesh should be used for capturing the dynamics of turbulent two-phase flows. Additionally, the spectral scaling of interfacial corrugations was characterized, as well as the inter-scale energy transfer rate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using the same flow configuration, the concept of numerical surface tension was explored. All computational methods for interface tracking or capturing suffer from numerical errors. Interestingly, that error can take the form of artificial surface tension, wherein tracked shapes have the tendency to become less curved even in the absence of surface tension. This numerical surface tension property shares many similarities with numerical dissipation: while it promotes stability and robustness in simulation, it can lead to incorrect predictions. The level of numerical surface tension for state-of-the-art interface reconstruction methods for Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) simulations was characterized as part of this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In terms of sub-grid scale modeling for turbulent multiphase flows, two key outcomes can be reported. First, a new modeling strategy for turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows was studied in collaboration with researchers at Chalmers University in Sweden. This strategy was extensively validated against the simulation database developed in the project and was shown to be a good candidate for modeling sub-grid scale liquid atomization. Second, a novel interface reconstruction strategy for VOF simulations was introduced based on a multi-plane interface assumption within each computational cell (see Figure 2). This approach enables the capture of sub-grid scale interfacial features such as ligaments and sheets by standard VOF simulations, even on coarse meshes, as illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the formation of a micron-thick liquid sheet in a turbulent atomization simulation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of this project, a comprehensive, open-source software library has been developed to enable easy implementation of state-of-the-art geometric VOF methods, including a suite of interface reconstruction methods (and the aforementioned multi-plane reconstruction). This library was developed using modern software engineering practices with a focus on usability and performance. The library has already been used to rewrite several in-house flow solvers consisting of structured, unstructured, and adaptively refined meshes. For example, it is now being using by a group at Los Alamos National Laboratory to simulate multi-material flows in advanced metal casting simulations. We hope that this library will be adopted by other researchers in the near future.

This course combines elements from a semester-long course taught at Cornell by the PI that focuses on multiphase flow theory, as well as a 10-session tutorial that uses a 2D multiphase flow solver demonstrator developed specifically for education. This course has been offered twice already: once as a 2-week long course at IIT Kanpur for approximately 50 students, and a second time in a compressed version as part of the Burgers Summer School at University of Maryland. Both editions are available online to anyone. Additionally, several graduate and undergraduate students were involved with the research in this project, and gained experience in many aspects of computational sciences, including method development, high performance computing, turbulence theory, presentations at scientific conferences, paper and proposal writing, among others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/12/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Olivier&nbsp;Desjardins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1351545/1351545_10289637_1562946502988_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1351545/1351545_10289637_1562946502988_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Interactions Between Turbulence and Interfaces with Surface Tension\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1351545/1351545_10289637_1562946502988_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Interactions Between Turbulence and Interfaces with Surface Tension\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Liquid-gas interface shape (in blue)  and velocity magnitude for different Weber numbers.
