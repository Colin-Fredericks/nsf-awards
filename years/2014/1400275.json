Talks will be arranged under four main headings: subfactors, free probability, and random matrices; approximation properties for groups, von Neumann algebras, and subfactors; classification of subfactors; conformal and quantum field theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
