 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal by Professor Miriam Freedman of Pennsylvania State University is co-funded but the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program in the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Division, both at the National Science Foundation. The research results obtained in this proposal will be used to determine the sensitivity of cirrus cloud properties to chemical composition. In addition, while seeking to apply surface science techniques to address questions in the atmospheric sciences, the results of the study will also impact the environmental, biological, and materials sciences. As a result, articles that stem from the proposed studies will be disseminated primarily in journals that will attract these different audiences. Professor Freedman is committed to the professional development of undergraduate and graduate students in her research lab and courses. In both environments, she works with students to enhance their ability to communicate science. In this proposal, she will build on her interest in teaching communication skills and increasing scientific literacy by working with science and communications undergraduates to develop a miniature online course in atmospheric chemistry and clouds aimed at teachers of secondary education. Based on the online course, the investigator will hold summer workshops for groups of teachers to develop demonstrations and labs for the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe long-term goals of the research are to apply fundamental ideas from surface and materials science to advance the field of atmospheric chemistry through 1) investigation of the physical and chemical processing of aerosol particles using novel methods that combine spectroscopy and microscopy techniques and, 2) exploration of how the organization of organic compounds on single-crystal surfaces influences water and ice adsorption on the molecular scale with application to heterogeneous ice nucleation. The results of the proposed studies will be used to determine the sensitivity of cirrus (ice) cloud properties to chemical composition. The effect of competitive adsorption of water before and after adsorption of organic molecules will be explored. Mixtures of organic compounds and oxidized organic compounds will be used in this study. Professor Freedman has designed and built a novel variable temperature ultrahigh vacuum chamber equipped with instrumentation for the study of these insulator materials.",

Aerosol particles are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and their physical and chemical properties are not well understood. As a result, modeling the impact of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, including their role in chemical reactions, cloud droplet or ice particle formation, and interaction with solar and terrestrial radiation, is difficult, which limits our ability to model processes in the atmosphere. In terms of specific systems, aerosol particles are often composed of organic compounds and salts and the most common ice nuclei are mineral dust. To investigate the role of aerosol particle surfaces on ice nucleation, we initially worked with aluminosilicate clay minerals, which are among the most common type of mineral dust found in the atmosphere. Literature has questioned why the ice nucleation activity of aluminosilicate clay minerals decreases when these minerals are exposed to sulfuric and nitric acid, which can happen in the environment due to the interaction of mineral dust aerosol with urban pollution. We determined that the reaction product that forms could be responsible for the decrease in ice nucleation. We also determined that the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the mineral increases with acid treatment, but that this increase does not affect the ice nucleation activity. Because mineral types found in the atmosphere are limited in scope, we began to investigate synthesized materials. In these systems, we can tune the surface properties to determine how defects, functional groups, and surface structure affect the ice nucleation activity (Figure 1). For carbon nanotubes, we found the highest ice nucleation activity for inner diameters of 2-3 nm, due to the formation of a different structure of ice in pores of this size. We also found that for aluminum hydroxides and oxides, crystallinity is more important in determining the ice nucleation activity and crystal structure is second most important. Working with a very complex system, we found that the composition of fly ash, which is emitted from power plants, affects its ice nucleation activity. For studies of the interactions of organic and inorganic components in aerosol particles, we focused on investigating liquid-liquid phase separation in submicron aerosol particles. This phase separation occurs when organic compounds have limited solubility in salt solutions. We found that at particle sizes less than approximately 30 nm, this phase transition is inhibited (Figure 2). The inhibition of phase separation is observed both at fast and slow drying rates and occurs because small particles cannot overcome the activation barrier needed to form a new phase. In terms of relevance for the atmosphere, we determined that whether a particle undergoes phase separation or not affects its ability to form cloud droplets. We also investigated the effect of pH on the relative humidity at which phase separation occurs. We found that the separation relative humidity is highly sensitive to pH because of the changing protonation state of the organic compounds and because of the changing composition of the salts in solution. Broader Impacts: This grant has had a profound impact on the development of human resources. Eight graduate students and eleven undergraduate students have been trained in the methods of scientific inquiry through their involvement on this project. Six of the graduate students have defended their PhDs and moved into research jobs in industry and government labs; the other two are making good progress toward their degrees. Many of the undergraduates have moved on to graduate school. All but one of the graduate students and half of the undergraduates are women, which is a group that is underrepresented in STEM fields. In terms of educational outreach, we participated in 30 outreach events focusing on science outreach to the surrounding rural community, lab visitations by middle school students, science activities with middle school girls, and outreach at the Special Olympics. In addition, we participated in outreach events for military families, a library summer camp for elementary school students, and an afterschool program for middle school students. In addition, the PI gave lectures to K-8 teachers and postdoctoral researchers interested in academic careers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Miriam&nbsp;Freedman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351383/1351383_10322102_1603980801222_icenucleationillustration--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351383/1351383_10322102_1603980801222_icenucleationillustration--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351383/1351383_10322102_1603980801222_icenucleationillustration--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration of how surfaces of materials can affect the nucleation of ice.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Miriam Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Miriam&nbsp;Freedman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351383/1351383_10322102_1604064093244_phaseseparation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351383/1351383_10322102_1604064093244_phaseseparation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351383/1351383_10322102_1604064093244_phaseseparation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A phase separated particle (left) and a well mixed particle (right).
