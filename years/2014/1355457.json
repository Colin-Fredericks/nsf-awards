The project is innovative and potentially transformative displaying considerable possibilities for advancing knowledge and discovery about Sustainable Ecological Aquaculture (SEA) within Maine?s coastal social, economic, and environmental nexus.  Other coastal regions face problems similar to those in Maine and results could inform sustainable solutions to coastal community and aquaculture problems on a global basis.\r\n\r\nMaine develops research and education activities to engage a wide number of constituents.  The project will increase public scientific literacy and train a modern STEM workforce.  New STEM programs, mentoring, and research opportunities will specifically recruit females, Native Americans, and other minority students.  Other initiatives include student internships, innovation workshops and the creation of a statewide collaborative network of faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students working together with stakeholders.  Middle and secondary teachers will also be supported to engage in curriculum development.  Economic development activities include the creation of Geographical Information Systems maps that identify the risks and carrying capacity for high valued commercial harvest species.  The activities strengthen areas noted to be important within the State?s Science and Technology Plan such as workforce training and development in the areas of marine ecology and aquaculture.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThis project seeks develops SEANET to determine the social and environmental carrying capacities of aquaculture systems in Maine?s coastal bioregions.  SEANET is envisioned as a statewide, multi-institutional, academic research network that will advance knowledge and discovery about SEA within coastal Maine?s social, economic, and environmental nexus.  SEANET capitalizes on Maine?s diverse Spcio- ecological systems contexts by comparing and contrasting three coastal bioregions, south, midcoast, and downeast, which comprise important research gradients in amounts of oceanic versus freshwater inputs, physical oceanography, degrees of urbanization and nutrient inputs, social-economic demographics, and intensities of fisheries and aquaculture developments.  A suite of new buoys and sensors, industrial partnerships and models will be used with existing data to assess and monitor the carrying capacity of these areas for aquaculture species over time.  Social research will engage local stakeholders using focus groups, surveys, and interviews and combined with modeling will address perceptions, attitudes and local values related to aquaculture.  The project involves many of the institutes of higher education across the state including community colleges as well as local producer groups and state government agencies.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Maine EPSCoR's Track I project, the Sustainable Ecological Aquaculture Network (SEANET) was the first multi-year effort to research sustainable ecological aquaculture systems (SEASs) in Maine. The project has encouraged expansion within the state's aquaculture sector, and the resulting research and Workforce Development (WFD) outcomes have played a key role in informing sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>SEANET researchers extended Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) to aquaculture farming, which brought to the fore the challenge of how to deal with complex SESs where multiple types of actors interact in different ways that depend on and impact multiple resource units within a resource system. The SESF was applied by the project team as a guiding tool to execute interdisciplinary research in areas including Social and Ecological Carrying Capacity, Location of Sustainable Ecological Aquaculture, and Resilience.</p>\n<p>As aquaculture expands, it is increasingly important for coastal communities to use the best possible information in the siting process. The jagged nature of Maine's coast means there are hundreds of potential estuaries for prospecting. Researchers have taken advantage of advancements in aquaculture science and oceanographic tools to create a new site selection tool, which uses information from numerical models, oceanographic cruises, satellite imagery, and buoys to help new growers choose sites and diversify Maine's marine economy. The tool has already been used to locate several new farms in coastal estuaries.</p>\n<p>The Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) has identified food safety as a priority research area. For this reason, SEANET researchers collected data regarding the presence of pathogen indicator species of bacteria on farmed sea kelp in Saco Bay. This research was the first of its kind in Maine, and the results indicate that while there are low levels of bacterial indicators and pathogens detected on the surface of farmed sea kelp, they are present. This highlights the need for best practices in food safety.</p>\n<p>Current predictions foresee continued warming in the Gulf of Maine, but even slight temperature increases could have a dramatic effect on Maine's seaweed industry. SEANET researchers investigated seaweed varietals that could withstand such change. Through field surveys, lab-based thermal acclimation experiments, and other tests in aquaculture research mesocosms and sea farms, researchers found that the kelp Alaria esculenta demonstrates thermal tolerance and holds promise as a candidate for future expansion within the Maine seaweed industry.</p>\n<p>The effects of increasing ocean temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) on calciferous invertebrates were also studied. American lobsters were used as a model organism. The lobsters were exposed to acidified environments and temperature ramping. Results suggest that lobsters may have a significantly reduced ability to deal with thermal stress under OA conditions, which could be particularly problematic for this species in the face of climate change. This could also indicate a higher susceptibility to other stressors, such as disease. This work was repeated with oysters, and preliminary results indicate that oysters may also be more susceptible to stressors such as disease with higher rates of OA and rising ocean temperatures.</p>\n<p>A strong Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce is critical for Maine's economic future. Maine EPSCoR and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension 4-H's Summer of Science (SoS) program promotes positive youth STEM and workforce development. College interns and teen teachers deliver STEM-related activities, experiments, and lessons to Maine youth at more than 50 food sites throughout the state. Teaching these lessons to younger students builds skills and increases the understanding of the teens and college interns. This program has been nationally recognized as a scalable model and has been published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at various national conferences.</p>\n<p>ME EPSCoR and the UMaine Cooperative Extension 4-H also created four curricula toolkits that can be used by educators, scout groups, summer camps, and afterschool program staffs. Each of the toolkits provides all the materials necessary for the delivery of hands-on learning activities for students. Educators throughout the state can borrow these assembled toolkits from their local county Cooperative Extension office. Two of the curricula toolkits have been nationally peer-reviewed and certified and are now being used throughout the nation. Combined, SEANET STEM education and workforce development programs directly supported over 30,000 students per year throughout the state.</p>\n<p>SEANET's projects are complete, yet project personnel believe there will be continued research and implementation in these areas, and that Maine communities (and the environment itself) will benefit from the knowledge and activities shared. This is also inspired by the fact that the Aquaculture Research Institute (ARI) at the University of Maine has been designated as the institutional home to SEANET following the grant's end. The ability to advance collaborative aquaculture science at this level of excellence did not exist before SEANET, but will continue well beyond the life of the grant.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/14/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Khodadad&nbsp;Varahramyan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1355457/1355457_10327485_1581696815337_AllHandsMeeting--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1355457/1355457_10327485_1581696815337_AllHandsMeeting--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SEANET All Hands Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1355457/1355457_10327485_1581696815337_AllHandsMeeting--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SEANET All Hands Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SEANET personnel gathered yearly for an All Hands meeting.

For this reason, SEANET researchers collected data regarding the presence of pathogen indicator species of bacteria on farmed sea kelp in Saco Bay. This research was the first of its kind in Maine, and the results indicate that while there are low levels of bacterial indicators and pathogens detected on the surface of farmed sea kelp, they are present. This highlights the need for best practices in food safety.\n\nCurrent predictions foresee continued warming in the Gulf of Maine, but even slight temperature increases could have a dramatic effect on Maine's seaweed industry. SEANET researchers investigated seaweed varietals that could withstand such change. Through field surveys, lab-based thermal acclimation experiments, and other tests in aquaculture research mesocosms and sea farms, researchers found that the kelp Alaria esculenta demonstrates thermal tolerance and holds promise as a candidate for future expansion within the Maine seaweed industry.\n\nThe effects of increasing ocean temperatures and ocean acidification (OA) on calciferous invertebrates were also studied. American lobsters were used as a model organism. The lobsters were exposed to acidified environments and temperature ramping. Results suggest that lobsters may have a significantly reduced ability to deal with thermal stress under OA conditions, which could be particularly problematic for this species in the face of climate change. This could also indicate a higher susceptibility to other stressors, such as disease. This work was repeated with oysters, and preliminary results indicate that oysters may also be more susceptible to stressors such as disease with higher rates of OA and rising ocean temperatures.\n\nA strong Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce is critical for Maine's economic future. Maine EPSCoR and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension 4-H's Summer of Science (SoS) program promotes positive youth STEM and workforce development. College interns and teen teachers deliver STEM-related activities, experiments, and lessons to Maine youth at more than 50 food sites throughout the state. Teaching these lessons to younger students builds skills and increases the understanding of the teens and college interns. This program has been nationally recognized as a scalable model and has been published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at various national conferences.\n\nME EPSCoR and the UMaine Cooperative Extension 4-H also created four curricula toolkits that can be used by educators, scout groups, summer camps, and afterschool program staffs. Each of the toolkits provides all the materials necessary for the delivery of hands-on learning activities for students. Educators throughout the state can borrow these assembled toolkits from their local county Cooperative Extension office. Two of the curricula toolkits have been nationally peer-reviewed and certified and are now being used throughout the nation. Combined, SEANET STEM education and workforce development programs directly supported over 30,000 students per year throughout the state.\n\nSEANET's projects are complete, yet project personnel believe there will be continued research and implementation in these areas, and that Maine communities (and the environment itself) will benefit from the knowledge and activities shared. This is also inspired by the fact that the Aquaculture Research Institute (ARI) at the University of Maine has been designated as the institutional home to SEANET following the grant's end. The ability to advance collaborative aquaculture science at this level of excellence did not exist before SEANET, but will continue well beyond the life of the grant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Khodadad Varahramyan"
