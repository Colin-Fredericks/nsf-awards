 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genomics and 'big data' approaches to health today promise a better understanding of the pathology and treatment of a wide range of diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer's. However, mining genomic and other digital health data require practices for collecting and processing large amounts of biomedical data that challenge longstanding commitments to privacy and ownership and control of one's own body. This clash of ethos of sharing with those of privacy and autonomy has sparked a public debate about who owns bodily tissues and how health-related data should be collected and shared for the public good. To bring these growing concerns to the level of national policy, we will convene a two-day long agenda-setting workshop at UC Santa Cruz. The workshop will bring together international leaders in genomics research, women?s health, informatics, healthcare, civil rights, indigenous rights, science policy and the sociology of medicine. The goal will be to innovate novel approaches to navigating the tensions between rights of privacy and consent and desires to share biomedical data.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of the workshop will be on how big data research infrastructures might be built that benefit diverse populations, especially Native Americans and indigenous peoples, respecting different approaches to owning and interpreting bodily tissues and genomic data.  This project thus develops novel policy approaches to questions of science and justice, utilizing and enhancing the infrastructure of the UCSC Science and Justice Research Center (SJRC). The results of the research will be translated to broader contexts through publishing results in biomedical journals and the popular press. Videos of workshops and publications will be made available on the SJRC website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Precision medicine promises to bring massive amounts of data to the clinic, revolutionize healthcare and guide Obama?s moonshot to cure cancer.  It also promises to play a central role in a fundamental transformation of societal institutions, one in which digitized data move to the heart of decision-making practices&mdash;whether in science, law, policing, or medicine.  This workshop mapped out the profound questions of science and justice that stand before us as we enter these brave new worlds of biomedical big data.  It delineated the problems of trust that face biomedical institutions when data portals, not doctors, deliver health information, and when health data is used to understand risks for disease today, but may be used in lawsuits or a national security investigations tomorrow.  It helped to define the problems that may arise understanding disease and caring for patients when access to data expands exponentially for some, but not others. It began a critical discussion amongst public health practitioners, biomedical researchers, patient advocates and policy makers about what we need to understand and what should we do if we want better knowledge, better care and more just, equitable worlds to be the guiding goals of open, big data approaches to health. \n \nOne outcome of the meeting was to broaden the public discussion about big data and health from ethical and legal questions about privacy and informed consent to these more fundamental questions about the right and just constitution of care, trust, and knowledge in an age of biomedical data.  It did so in a moment when social inequalities are the widest in U.S. history and the premium on trust relationships is at its highest.  To address these social justice and equity issues, and to ensure that open biodata creates a more open health system that welcomes and supports all, workshop participants pushed beyond traditional approaches to institutional bioethics, or \"ethical, legal, and social implications\" (ELSI) frameworks. Like tailored ?personalized? treatments, standard governance tools in the ELSI toolbox&mdash;such as privacy protection and informed consent&mdash;focus on the action of individuals.  However, to respond to the major transformations in healthcare in an age of big data, the workshop demonstrated that we must focus on the goals, orientations and actions of institutions, and the values and interests that shape them.  The goal then might usefully be re-conceptualized not as creating ethical science so much as ?good science.? Good science, as laid out by Charis Thompson (2013), starts from the assumption that research practices always have ethics and politics, and what we require is a more robust institutional integration of ethics, politics and science.\n \nThe workshop elevated the need to produce ?good? precision medicine&mdash;one that addresses questions of equity and social justice&mdash;to the level of national policy discussion.  It gathered international leaders in genomics, health and informatics, civil rights, bioethics, indigenous rights, science policy and the social study of health and medicine, as well as key representatives from organizations and institutions leading big data approaches to health.  The meeting both discussed critical challenges and engaged in collaborative work to set the science and justice agenda of big biodata and precision medicine.  Outcomes of the meeting included the writing of agenda-setting documents, a published call to integrate social justice into precision medicine, and strengthened networks for ongoing research and policy work.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer Reardon"
