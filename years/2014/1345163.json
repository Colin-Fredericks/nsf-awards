 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support and in response to the Materials Genome Initiative for Global Competitiveness, California State University San Bernardino will establish a Center for Materials Science to develop and study new organic ferroelectric materials. Although inorganic and organic polymeric ferroelectric materials are widely used, organic single molecule ferroelectrics have untapped potential for environmentally friendly materials with superior activity. Many of the known ferroelectrics have shortcomings with regard to applications, such as cost, toxicity, or limited electronic properties. While applications are not the main goal of the Center project, the computational models and experimental results should prove to be valuable tools in designing materials with desirable properties.\r\n\r\nScientific Merit: The Center consists of a disciplinarily diverse research team whose collective goals are to develop and study new organic ferroelectric materials, while at the same time strengthening active research collaborations and personnel exchange between partner institutions. The Center's systematic search for new organic ferroelectrics relies on subproject teams in three distinct areas: (1) Theory and Computation; (2) Synthesis and Structure; and (3) Experimental Investigation. In the theory/computation subproject, crystallographic databases, first principles computations, and experience-based intuition will be used to predict likely candidates. The synthesis/structure team will prepare organic compounds, grow thin films, and explore polymorphic behavior of the crystalline materials.  The experimental investigation team will then determine ferroelectric and related piezoelectric properties experimentally, as a function of temperature, pressure, film thickness, and composition, as appropriate. These results will be utilized in subsequent iterations to predict the next set of ferroelectric candidates. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nFerroelectricity and the closely related properties piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, non-linear and high dielectric constant properties of materials have broad impacts on an extremely large range of areas. These include: scientific instrumentation, consumer products, national defense, medical devices, energy harvesting, energy storage, robotics, and aerospace. These applications represent billions of dollars to the economy and many high tech jobs. With its numerous applications, this research provides an excellent entry point to attract, then retain, encourage and motivate students, including underrepresented students. The potential for replacing environmentally unfriendly materials such as one of the leading piezoelectric, lead zirconium titanate, with more environmentally friendly organic materials should be particularly appealing. Students will receive a wide range of training on research grade instrumentation, experience with specific computational packages, and gain hands-on experience in synthetic organic chemistry and general laboratory techniques and procedures. The proposed research collaborations will further enhance the professional development of faculty at CSUSB and the partner community colleges.",

Located at the California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB), our center faculty and students partner with: College of the Desert (COD), Victor Valley College (VVC), University of Nebraska Lincoln- Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (UNL-MRSEC), the State University of New York, Buffalo (UB) and the NASA-Armstrong Flight Research Center (NASA-Armstrong). During the initial six years, the Center addressed four goals: (1) Increase the research productivity of faculty members; (2) Advance the scientific understanding of organic ferroelectrics; (3) Enhance research capabilities at multiple minority-serving institutions through the establishment of a sustainable, interdisciplinary, and inter-institutional advanced materials research center; and (4) Increase the recruitment, retention, and degree attainment of STEM students, including members of underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>The CAFM Program: The Center sponsored research by faculty members who mentor undergraduate research students. Faculty conducted research in three interrelated materials science thrust areas: theory and computation; synthesis and structure; and experimental investigation. CSUSB faculty members collaborated with UNL-MRSEC and UB faculty members, and hosted four visiting graduate student from either UNL-MRSEC or UB who enhanced partner research collaborations, and co-taught a course at CSUSB. Undergraduate students conducted research in CSUSB faculty members? laboratories throughout the year, and many travelled conduct research at UNL-MRSEC, UB, and NASA-Armstrong each summer. Students at community colleges (i.e., COD and VVC) participated in January-session research experiences at their own institutions. Community college students participated in summer research experiences, at either CSUSB (COD students) or NASA Armstrong (VVC students). High school students participated in CSUSB-based summer research.</p>\n<p>Results</p>\n<p>Goal 1: Increase the research productivity of faculty members.</p>\n<p>The CAFM program allowed faculty members to make research a priority. The annual number of papers published by participating CSUSB faculty members more than tripled from the pre-grant baseline. In addition, the CAFM program resulted in increased collaboration, with a number of papers co-authored by participating faculty members from across institutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Goal 2: Advance the scientific understanding of organic ferroelectrics. Functional materials play a vital role in making everything from advanced computer memory to medical ultrasound devices.</p>\n<p>Our work to discover and explore novel organic ferroelectric and related materials depended on understanding the fundamental structures and dynamics of solids, the ability to formulate those solids into useable forms, and investigation of their properties. These investigations involved extensive interactions between researchers. Our team has performed first-principles calculations for, and synthesized several new ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials candidates. We have uncovered other potential functional materials among known compounds through database searching, including one known compound with non-linear optic properties. Our team has also investigated thin films of known functional materials, seeking information on structure vs. function at the nanoscale. We have published our results in reviewed scientific journals and filed one patent.</p>\n<p>Goal 3: Enhance research capabilities at multiple minority-serving institutions through the establishment of a sustainable, interdisciplinary, and inter-institutional advanced materials research center.</p>\n<p>NSF funding resulted in increased capacity for research at CSUSB and community colleges. New equipment, including an in-house organic deposition system, a piezoelectric force microscope, and equipment purchased through other funds, such as an inorganic film sputtering system were used by students and faculty to advance scientific understanding of the solid state. In addition, the CAFM program helped attract two accomplished new faculty members to CSUSB?s physics and chemistry departments. A Master?s program in materials science was proposed as a result of the CAFM program and has been added to CSUSB?s campus Master Plan. At community colleges, the Winternship model resulted in new research opportunities for students, including Winternships funded by other grants and the development and implementation of independent research courses.</p>\n<p>Goal 4: Increase the recruitment, retention, and degree attainment of STEM students, including members of underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>Sixty-two percent of the 258 undergraduate students who participated in the CAFM program during the grant period, belonged to underrepresented minority groups. Student researchers reported increased confidence as a result of participating in the CAFM program, noting that participation allowed them to refine their career interests. Across years, CAFM student participants gave 166 presentations at student and professional research conferences. In addition, ten students served as co-authors on peer-reviewed publications. First-time freshman CSUSB CAFM program participants had a higher four-year graduation rate (31%) than a group of matched comparison students (7%). CSUSB CAFM program graduates were also more likely to attend graduate school (43%) than matched comparison graduates (21%).</p>\n<p>https://www.csusb.edu/center-advanced-functional-materials</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/03/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
