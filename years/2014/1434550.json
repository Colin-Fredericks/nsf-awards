 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Northwest is subject to earthquake and tsunami hazard associated with the Cascadia subduction zone, due to recurring slip on the plate boundary fault that separates the North America plate and the downgoing Pacific plate. Slip varies in time and space along the fault and understanding the slip patterns can lead to new insights about which fault sections are most likely to produce damaging 'megathrust' events (greater than magnitude 8). By studying smaller events that occur throughout a seismic cycle (loading, rupture, post seismic, reloading etc) this study can provide context for updated regional hazard assessment. An undergraduate intern and a PhD student will receive seismology training using both onshore and offshore data. \r\n\r\nA portion of the spectrum of slip behaviors along the Cascadia megathrust fault will be studied using seismic data from the Amphibious Array- reoccupied EarthScope Transportable Array sites and OBSIP ocean bottom seismometers. Small repeating earthquakes will be documented for the 4-yr duration of Cascadia Initiative (CI) and their distribution will be interpreted in terms of fault character and possible along-strike variation in structure within the subducting plate. The offshore coverage is expected to eliminate a current bias in observations where onshore-only results suggest that low frequency events (LFE) only occur in the down-dip part of the seismogenic zone. A pilot study confirms that the planned automated spectral detection method can succeed on CI ocean bottom seismometer data. There is potential for shallow repeating events to occur in the up-dip portion of the megathrust zone and there may be variations in level and type of source signature, including possibly new LFE, along the Cascadia subduction zone. A lesson designed for an undergraduate course will be developed and archived on the IRIS InClass and SERC servers. The event catalog and source parameter results will be made available via publication supplements and at least one NSF-supported open database (IEDA).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSubduction zones, where one tectonic plate is consumed beneath another, produce the world?s largest earthquakes and tsunami because of the massive fault zone separating the two plates.  Along the northwestern coast of the US and Canada, the Cascadia subduction zone extends nearly 1100 km from northern California to central British Columbia where the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer plates subduct beneath the North American plate.  This subduction zone has hosted very large earthquakes, estimated at magnitude 9, in the past; however, the current activity is largely silent with fault slip occurring in very small tremor-like events and very slow aseismic movement. Because the seismic networks traditionally available for recording earthquakes are on land, it is possible that small magnitude earthquakes in the offshore portion of the fault can be missed.  Thus the unique Cascadia Initiative onshore-offshore seismic experiment was deployed along the Cascadia subduction zone in part for use to record offshore small magnitude earthquakes. Our project used this amphibious network and advanced subspace scanning techniques to detect hundreds of small magnitude (between magnitude less than 1 to 4) earthquakes along the subduction zone, previously missed by land-based seismic catalogs.   A primary result is that indeed small magnitude earthquakes are occurring within the Cascadia subduction zone, although fewer than at other active subduction zones such as Japan and Sumatra.  We also detected a large number of earthquakes along central Oregon, in a region of a subducted seamount.  Our locations of these seamount-related earthquakes place them at shallow depth, suggesting that the incoming seamount is deforming the North American plate, leading to shallow faulting and slip in support of recently proposed models for seamount subduction.  The catalogs resulting from this work can be used to better understand regions of the Cascadia subduction zone that produce the small magnitude earthquakes relative to the slip in the largest earthquakes.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan L Bilek"
