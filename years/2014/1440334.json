BIOMED is a multidisciplinary conference\r\naimed at not only biomedical optics researchers, but basic scientists and clinicians, who are actively developing biomedical optics technologies or utilizing optical technology to advance clinical medicine and basic research. In addition to this core of biomedical optical scientists, the organizers also hope to attract scientists with new or upcoming photonic technologies that may have practical application in biomedicine, including the field of nano-technology, optical\r\nprobes and agent chemistry.",
