Research includes projects on particle transport, stochastic modeling, ecological modeling, bio-informatics and spread of disease. A number of well-developed broadening participation activities in education and research are also proposed.\r\nThis project is leveraging the established network of 2- and 4-year colleges for collaborations and is facilitating  integration of research and education through training opportunities for students and high school teachers.",
