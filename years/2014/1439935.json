 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to improve power density in\r\npower electronics, while lowering the economic hurdles keeping students from participating in this\r\nfield. The approach is to make efficient switching power converters with frequencies at least ten times\r\nhigher than conventional designs with no magnetic materials and small-valued capacitors. Resulting\r\ndesigns will have all passive components embedded in an inexpensive circuit board.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Recent advances in power density have been mostly due to improved semiconductors\r\nthat switch faster but these advances are reaching a plateau when used in conventional circuit\r\ndesigns. This is due to frequency-dependent losses in semiconductors and in energy storage devices.\r\nThis research looks to implement a value-added strategy using inexpensive printed circuit boards by\r\nfabricating all passive devices with conductive traces, transforming the printed circuit board into a\r\nthree-dimensional resonant structure. This will eliminate post-fabrication tuning and component variation\r\nwhile maintaining extraordinary levels of performance at reduced cost.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: To enhance outreach, educational modules on resonant power converters tied to the\r\nresearch outcomes will engage students and increase access to this developing field. This coursework is\r\nrarely available to students, specially Hispanic, who will be a particular focus of the proposed outreach.\r\nThe program will follow the approach of: dramatically enhance the power electronics curriculum at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan, employ educational outreach to encourage Hispanic students to learn power\r\nelectronics, and use low-cost technologies to make the design and fabrication of resonant converters\r\navailable to a wider public.",
