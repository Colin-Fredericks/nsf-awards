These models provide a critical bridge between the powerful tools of mathematical network theory and the unpredictable real world. Stochastic networks have been used to model manufacturing systems, call centers, health care systems, and a wide variety of electronic communication systems, including the Internet, wireless and wireline networks, and sensor networks. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together mathematicians and applied researchers who share an interest in stochastic network models, and will highlight areas of greatest current activity, providing intellectual guidance to young researchers and to the larger community of applied probabilists. In particular, this workshop will connect mathematicians developing powerful abstract tools with the applications communities that can translate these tools into major improvements in real network performance. The supported activity will allow the organizers to broaden participation in the workshop by partially defraying travel costs.",
