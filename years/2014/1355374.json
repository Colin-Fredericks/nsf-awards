 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental goal of this research is an understanding of how traditional groups maintain and adapt social ties over time and across large geographic areas in spite of their low population density and changing natural environment. The research is focused in the United States Southwest where significant long-term environmental changes set the scene for observing societal network changes over time. Improved understanding of how historic societies adapted provides insight into how modern-day traditional societies might adapt and maintain their own social networks. \r\n\r\nWith National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Mills and Dr. Jeffery Clark will collaborate with a team of researchers to look at the dynamics of social and spatial networks in the archaeology of the Chaco region of the U.S. Southwest. The research team will combine social network analysis and geographic information systems to analyze ceramic, lithic, and architectural data in the Chaco region. Chaco Canyon World Heritage Site is at the spatial center of what has been called the \"Chaco World\" during the 10th to early 12th centuries, and contains a concentration of architectural features known as great houses and great kivas. How it came to prominence and the social relationship of the central canyon to contemporaneous communities are enduring archaeological questions of broad interest. \r\n\r\nThe research builds on a considerable amount of past research in the Chaco region by compiling a new dataset integrating architectural and material culture data from within and outside Chaco Canyon. The database will add to the Chaco World database at the Chaco Research Archive and ceramic and lithic data for the post-A.D. 1200 period from the Southwest Social Networks Project. New ceramic analyses of existing collections and obsidian provenance analyses will augment data from published and unpublished reports. These data will be used to address the following questions: (1) How were Chaco great houses related to each other? (2) Were Pueblo Bonito and other Chaco Canyon great houses socially central in the regional network? (3) How did trajectories of great house and great kiva social networks change over time? And (4) how did great houses and great kivas relate to their surrounding communities of small houses? Recent research has suggested the need to analyze data from throughout the region, without assuming it was an integrated system, to better understand the ways in which great house communities were connected to each other and the central canyon. The research has the potential to resolve several questions currently being raised in many archaeological regions, not just Chaco. These include the relationship of hierarchy and centrality, and the role of specific historical processes such as migration, social diversification, and inequality in non-state societies. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include: (1) collaboration with the Chaco Research Archive to provide updates to the Chaco World Database; (2) creation of a new database that integrates artifact data on great houses, great kivas, and selected outlier communities; (3) public talks to interested audiences throughout the region; (4) a special issue of the magazine, Archaeology Southwest, which is widely used for public outreach and in classrooms; (5) a series of journal articles; and (6) training of graduate students in the application of social network analysis to archaeological datasets.\r\n",

These were built by Ancestral Pueblo people who had a hierarchical sociopolitical organization&mdash;unlike their more egalitarian descendants. Although a significant amount of research has taken place within Chaco Canyon, especially at the largest great house of Pueblo Bonito, less is known about monumental architecture in the broader Chaco World, encompassing nearly 100,000 sq km, and regional syntheses have been limited. Our project studied how great house and great kiva sites were socially and visually connected across the Chaco World through time. This allowed us to better understand the trajectory toward inequality as well as population movements that were associated with the origins and decline of Chaco.</p>\n<p>With funding from the National Science Foundation, archaeologists at the University of Arizona, Archaeology Southwest, and Arizona State University amassed all available architectural, ceramic, and flaked stone data from great house and great kiva sites in the Chaco World from A.D. 800 to 1200 in a single database. Site occupations and artifact assemblages were divided into 50-year intervals during this 400-year period. Of approximately 400 sites in the database, we were able to update locational data on most settlements and add material culture data to over 75%. Material culture included ceramic frequency data for 340 of these settlements, totaling 1.8 million artifacts, and 157,331 flaked stone artifacts from 81 great house and great kiva sites. Data were collected from a number of national and regional museums and archives, including the online resource, the Chaco Research Archive.</p>\n<p>Once the database was compiled, we applied a suite of methods, including social network analyses (SNA) and geographical information systems (GIS), to address several questions about the Chaco World. SNA looks at how each site &ldquo;node&rdquo; is related to other nodes and the effects of those relationships over time, both on individual nodes and on the overall structure of the network. We addressed two basic questions. Were <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?id=9DD0CCC0-155D-451F-672BC96BA092D2B7\">Pueblo Bonito</a> and other Chaco Canyon sites central in the regional network and within their respective communities and for how long? And how were great houses across the Chaco World related to one another and how did those relationships change over time? Underlying both questions was how these changes corresponded to environmental changes and related population movements in the broader region.</p>\n<p>Our analyses showed that Pueblo Bonito and other Chaco Canyon settlements were not initially central within the Chaco World. Instead, settlements to the south and west gained prominence during the 9<sup>th</sup> century as did some settlements in the Northern San Juan (Mesa Verde) area. However, by the 10<sup>th</sup> century, Pueblo Bonito and its surrounding settlements in Chaco Canyon became central in the network and did not lose that position until the early A.D. 1100s when Aztec Pueblo and other settlements along the Middle San Juan River to the north of Chaco Canyon gained prominence. We also found that great houses were in visually prominent locations with respect to other community sites, reinforcing interpretations about inequality within communities. However, an analysis of the distribution of an elite style of ceramic decoration among small and great houses did not find much evidence for inequality.</p>\n<p>Using SNA, we also identified distinctive clusters of great houses and great kivas that interacted more closely with each other than with other sites. All sites were not connected in a single network until the late 11<sup>th</sup> century. Two major clusters were defined&mdash;one in the Northern San Juan area and the other in the Southern San Juan Basin that included Chaco Canyon and its surrounding areas. The Middle San Juan formed a third group during the A.D. 1100s. The theory that the founders of Pueblo Bonito were migrants from the Northern San Juan was rejected and we were able to show that the earliest network of sites around Chaco Canyon formed as a result of interactions with settlements to the south and southwest. This interpretation was reinforced by distinctive technological attributes of the ceramics and by imported flaked stone artifacts. We also showed how Chaco Canyon and surrounding areas emptied as populations moved to better-watered areas of the Chaco World during the drought of the A.D. 1100s.</p>\n<p>Our results illustrate how inequalities can develop within a couple of generations, as population coalesced, and how quickly regional networks changed as the influence of central settlements waxed and waned. Ultimately, however, these networks were insufficient as environmental deterioration and conflict led to regional depopulation and migration.</p>\n<p>Our data are available to researchers through the Archaeology Southwest web site and on a publicly accessible web site (without site location data) in the near future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/07/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Barbara&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mills</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1355374/1355374_10292664_1528414157439_AD1050--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1355374/1355374_10292664_1528414157439_AD1050--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Chaco Social Networks AD 1050-1100\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1355374/1355374_10292664_1528414157439_AD1050--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Chaco Social Networks AD 1050-1100\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Chacoan great house and great kiva networks, AD 1050-1100.
