 "awd_abstract_narration": "A typical web application is a complicated distributed system\r\nthat consists of multiple components that run concurrently on multiple\r\nmachines and interact with each other in complex ways via the Internet.\r\nAs one would expect, developing such software systems is an error-prone\r\ntask, and existing software development processes are not robust enough\r\nto produce dependable web applications. The tools developed as part of this\r\nproject could have a broad impact by enable software developers to eliminate \r\nprogramming errors in web applications before they are deployed to end users.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental building block of a web application is the data model that\r\nspecifies the types of objects and the relations among the objects stored by\r\nthe application, the constraints on the relations, and the actions that update \r\nthe data by sending queries to the back-end datastore based on the user input.  \r\nThe project develops techniques that automatically extract a formal \r\nmodel from a given web application that characterizes how its data is stored\r\nand modified based on user actions, and infers properties about the formal data\r\nmodel.  It is then possible to check the inferred properties by converting correctness \r\nqueries about the data model to queries about satisfiability of logical formulas,\r\nand repair the data model to enforce the properties that are expected\r\nto hold.",
