 "awd_abstract_narration": "Creating sustainable buildings that optimize energy efficiency, in part by relying on renewable energy sources, has several benefits to society. From an environmental standpoint, non-renewable energy sources often produce harmful emissions in the environment and most non-renewable energy sources are based on fossil fuels, which have a finite supply and are difficult to harvest and transport. Therefore, finding ways to develop sustainable buildings that use renewable energy sources has distinct environmental and societal value.\r\n\r\nThe International Living Future Institute (ILFI) is encouraging programs that assist in the development of \"greener\" buildings that are also architecturally interesting. The Living Building Challenge (LBC) is a building certification program, administered by the ILFI, which measures sustainability. Williams College is pursuing the LBC as part of the Kellogg House renovation project. The Kellogg House was originally built in 1794, and upon completion of the renovation project, it will be the first historic building in the country to achieve LBC certification with a \"net-zero\" energy usage\r\n\r\nThis project supports instrumenting the house with sensors and devices that accurately monitor and display energy consumption and generation crucial for measuring usage and guiding occupant behavior and that is designed to be sustainable and rely on only renewable energy sources. The main contribution of this project, therefore, will be the development of a scalable and robust sensing infrastructure that may serve as a model for future LBC participants. The energy usage data that is collected from the building will be anonymized and made publicly available. These data will facilitate future research in sustainability worldwide. Once completed, the Kellogg House will serve as a learning laboratory, teaching occupants to lead more sustainable lives even beyond the confines of the house.",
