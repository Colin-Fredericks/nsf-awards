Hatcher, Jr, which will be held 30 March?4 April 2014 2014 in Asheville, NC. The conference will provide a forum to synthesize our understanding of orogenic systems, with specific emphasis placed on the consistent integration of multiple datasets that characterize process linkages and reconciliation of theoretical-numerical vs. field-derived models. For example, in many orogens, fault kinematics control the redistribution of heat-producing material and drive advection, which in turn sets up the thermal structure of the orogen. Thermal structure controls lithospheric rheology, which determines the nature and distribution of deformation and strain localization. The structural architecture governs fault kinematics, which act in conjunction with climate to focus erosional and exhumation processes. Therefore, explicit characterization of these links and their associated feedbacks are critical for understanding the evolution of orogenic systems. This conference represents a unique opportunity for graduate students to present their own research results within a focused scientific venue and to interact and network with scientists who are conducting innovative research on collisional orgogenic belts. Support for students in the conference will directly enhance science education through the participants increased awareness and ability to integrate field, analytical, and model based science. Participants will be in an excellent position to disseminate these ideas to the research community and the general public, and the experience will greatly enhance their future scientific careers.",
