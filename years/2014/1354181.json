 "awd_abstract_narration": "All organisms must be able to sense and regulate the levels of acidity (low pH) and alkalinity (high pH) in their internal fluids. However, the mechanisms by which organisms sense acidity and alkalinity are not well understood. Sharks undergo pronounced variations in blood pH as part of their normal physiology, and therefore are excellent models to study mechanisms for pH sensing and regulation. This project will use biochemical, molecular, cell biology, and physiological tools to determine how sharks sense changes in pH and to characterize downstream regulatory processes. This information will help us understand and predict how organisms respond to environmental and metabolic stress. Because this project will focus on cellular pathways that are shared with other organisms, the results will also be applicable to a broad array of additional subject areas.  Additionally, some of the information will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate physiology courses taught at UCSD. This project will train one postdoctoral researcher and one minority graduate student in biological research, as well as several undergraduate students. To reach the general public, this project will establish a partnership with Birch Aquarium at Scripps to build awareness of shark biology, ecology and conservation issues through an innovative interpretive internship program for high school students.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus in the bicarbonate-sensing enzyme soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), and in putative pH-sensing G-protein coupled receptors associated with transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (GPCR/tmAC). Using a combination of experimental techniques over the entire complexity spectrum from molecules to cells to live sharks, the proposed research will: 1) identify pharmacological inhibitors selective for sAC and tmACs, for their use in cell and whole-organism experiments in this project as well as by other researchers; 2) characterize the mechanisms of sAC and GPCR/tmAC stimulation in shark cells in response to internal and external carbon dioxide, pH and bicarbonate stimuli; and 3) explore the presence of sAC in the cell nucleus and its role in regulating gene expression, using a combination of experiments with isolated nuclei, cells and organs, and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on tissue samples from starved.  This project will characterize reagents and generate testable hypothesis for future physiological and interdisciplinary studies. Results will be disseminated through journals, conferences, and public databases such as NCBI.",

Together, this is known as <em>acid/base levels</em>, and dynamically changes as a result of internal factors like energy metabolism, feeding and exercise, as well as environmental factors such as acidification and hypoxia. In seven peer-reviewed publications (and four more that will be submitted for peer review shortly), research supported by this grant established the enzyme <em>soluble adenylyl cyclase</em> (sAC) as an essential molecular acid/base sensor in fish from diverse lineages (hagfish, shark, ray, bony fish). The specific physiological roles that were discovered include the regulation of blood acid/base homeostasis by gills, heart beat rate, and food digestion in the gut. In addition, sAC was detected in multiple other organs including muscle, eye, rectal gland, and otolith organ, as well as in subcellular compartments such as the cytoplasm, nucleus and Golgi apparatus. This suggests sAC is involved in regulating multiple other essential physiological processes in each of those organs. Research supported by this grant additionally discovered that acid/base sensing, regulation, and energy supply take place at the cellular level, without the input from hormonal or central nervous system signals. On a more technical note, this research established the presence of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling microdomains, one depending on sAC and the other on another set of enzymes called <em>transmembrane adenylyl cyclases</em> (tmACs). Briefly, both sAC and tmACs make the signaling molecule cAMP. However, each produces a pool of cAMP that acts on a set of proteins located on specific locations within the cell (hence the name <em>microdomain</em>). These findings have greatly improved our understanding about how the same signaling molecule can have differential effects on cell and organismal physiology. Importantly, sAC and tmACs are present in all animals, so the results from this grant have broader implications and are not restricted to fish. Indeed, biochemical analyses in combination with bioinformatics analyses have identified specific residues in the sAC amino acid sequences from different animals likely to confer responsiveness to species-specific physiologically relevant acid/base levels. The ability to sense acid/base stress and regulate physiological processes accordingly is essential for maintaining homeostasis and sustaining life. Therefore, understanding the fundamental molecular cellular mechanisms has great importance from evolutionary and physiological perspectives. In turn, this information is relevant for understanding and predicting effects of metabolism and environmental stress on fish health, as well as for more applied aspects including aquaculture and fisheries (and therefore food security). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/04/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Martin&nbsp;Tresguerres</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354181/1354181_10389239_1543960456873_Image1(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354181/1354181_10389239_1543960456873_Image1(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The molecular acid/base sensor soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is present in acid- and base-secreting cells in shark gills.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354181/1354181_10389239_1543960456873_Image1(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The molecular acid/base sensor soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is present in acid- and base-secreting cells in shark gills.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">sAC (stained in green), is highly abundant in shark gill acid-secreting cells (identified by sodium pump staining in red in A) and base-secreting cells (identified by proton pump staining in red in B).
