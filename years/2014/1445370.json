 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much has been learned and written about the fragility of today's Internet routing architecture because of inherent limitations in traditional network routing protocols and the way they are used. Whether by accident or with malicious intent, network operators routinely  disrupt network traffic on a regional and global scale, causing both service disruptions and data privacy breaches.\r\n\r\nThis project works towards alleviating these problems in the global network infrastructure by exploring the feasibility of a trusted routing architecture based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). This research effort will identify and overcome barriers to the design, deployment and operation of networks with secure, trusted routing information. The results of this effort will include a working example, from which network operators can learn how to ultimately create a more reliable international communications infrastructure with fewer threats to data security.",
