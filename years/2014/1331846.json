 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Critical Zone is a new concept for the biological and geological system that extends from the upper leaves of plants to the groundwater deep below the soil. Scientists consider these systems to be \"integrated\" because aboveground climate, plants, animals, and human management all interact with the belowground biology, chemistry, and physics from surface soils to deep aquifers. A new Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) is located in the USA's Southern Piedmont that extends from Virginia to Alabama, a region characterized by ancient, deep, and highly weathered landscapes that between 1800 to 1950 experienced some of the most severe agricultural soil erosion and land and water degradation in America.  The new Calhoun-CZO leverages more than 60 years of research on land degradation and recovery based at the USDA Forest Service's Calhoun Experimental Forest in Union County, SC.  The CZO researchers and educators are from Duke University, University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, University of Kansas, Mississippi State University, Roanoke College, as well as the USDA Forest Service. \r\n\r\nA key objective of the Calhoun CZO is to help integrate land management, disturbance, and recovery into CZ science.  To that end, the scientists include hydrologists, soil scientists, agriculturists and foresters, geochemists, ecologists, and modelers but also an environmental historian and anthropologist.  The overall hypothesis is that land use accelerates CZ processes associated with vegetation, atmosphere, water, and surface soils, thereby stressing temporal and spatial networks that connect surface and deep subsurface components and processes of the CZ.  Land degradation may even isolate the CZ's surface from its subsurface components with adverse long-term consequences to water quality, soil fertility, and plant productivity.  Researchers will focus their studies on CZ evolution, rates of recovery from land degradation, and CZ re-integration.\r\n\r\nThe Calhoun-CZO is a center for research and education.  The CZO is linked to a Duke University IGERT-training center on intelligent sensor networks, annual CZO science meetings will have oral and poster presentations, discussions, and training sessions that involve scientists and students on equal footing. We plan several kinds of outreach efforts to local, regional, and national publics with multi-media science, history, and community-based pieces from hardcover books to op-eds to Facebook and Twitter.  An important emphasis of the CZO is on undergraduate research and education.   Central to this effort will be the development of a set of classroom-tested, web-based laboratory and classroom activities for undergraduates and advanced high school students based, in part, on real-time and historic data from the Calhoun CZO.",

The research was based at the US Forest Service?s 75-year-old Calhoun Experimental Forest in South Carolina, home of forest, soil, and watershed experiments that test long-term effects of land-use change. Geologically, the Piedmont has ancient, highly weathered, and infertile soils, yet due to warm humid climates and gentle terrain, cotton, tobacco, corn, and wheat were farmed from ~1800 to ~1950. While Piedmont farming helped fuel the agricultural economy of the young United States, farm labor was often enslaved labor and by the 1930s, farming had left behind seriously eroded fields, gullies, debt-ridden farmers, and rivers that will carry legacy sediments for centuries to come. The Calhoun?s geological and human histories make for effective education-outreach projects and popular field tours.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong><em>Human Transformation of Landscapes</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>By 1950, most Calhoun old-fields were abandoned and growing forests that greatly diminished erosion.&nbsp; Many land managers, scientists, and the public viewed the land-use change as a kind of recovery. Ecologists studied the changes in the land as plant succession.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Calhoun scientists are impressed by forests regrowing in rain-gullied old-fields (Fig.1), we have repeatedly detailed how Piedmont reforestation was often more mask than recovery. Our work demonstrates how agriculture altered this region?s critical zone in ways that cannot possibly be attenuated over decades much less centuries. Perhaps the most important lesson from the Calhoun CZO is that ?ecological restoration? is not applicable to how human-altered soils, ecosystems, and landscapes evolve through time.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LiDAR flights of the CZO produced high-resolution topographic maps that are publicly available and used by non-CZO students and scientists. Our studies of ground-surface roughness detail stunningly persistent alterations of the land?s surface by human activities. One study estimated that only 0.3% of the Calhoun CZO continues to have relic, relatively smooth Holocene surfaces. Another estimated that about 5% of the CZO is within agricultural gullies and that gullies have removed &gt;750 Mg/ha of upland soil.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accelerated erosion has inundated valley-bottoms with 1 to &gt;2-m of ?legacy sediment? (sediment from human-accelerated erosion), thus farming transformed many floodplains into well-drained terraces that no longer flood.&nbsp; Today, small Piedmont valley-bottoms support upland tree species such as shortleaf pine and mesic-oak species that regenerate in well-aerated legacy sediments. Whether legacy sediments serve as global sinks for carbon is an on-going scientific debate, and Calhoun CZO models and observations indicate that carbon sinks in Calhoun legacy sediments are relatively modest.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong>Critical Zone Formation from Top-Down and Bottom-Up</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A topic of research throughout 75-years of the Calhoun Experimental Forest is captured by the title of our 1995 paper, ?How Deep is Soil?,? and CZO studies have added much to what we know about the depth of biologic influence of weathering profiles (top-down effects). Plagioclase, a primary mineral in the bedrock?s granite, is completely weathered away even to &gt;10-m, dissolved largely by soil-respiration?s carbonic-acid weathering. CZO data detail seasonal cycles of soil CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, moisture, and temperature down to 8.5-m depth in patterns that contrast greatly between cultivated fields and forests. Estimates of root density demonstrate surficial agricultural crop rooting and effects on gases and soil moisture compared with forests. Moreover, rooting and rooting effects of 60 to 90-year-old pine forests are not as deep as those in old reference hardwoods (Fig.2). The data raise questions about whether the accumulation of forest biomass and carbon belowground lags that aboveground.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geological studies demonstrate that weathering of underlying granite extends to ~40-m, and that the particle conveyor from bedrock to the soil surface averages ~7 m/Ma. The critical zone and soils are thus clay factories with feldspar weathering producing sand- and silt-sized clay minerals between 38- to 3-m depth and with soil formation between 3 and 1.5-m increasing clay-sized micelles from 5 to &gt;50% due to lessivage and (hypothetically) comminution. Finally, we are most impressed by the persistence of even a small fraction of bedrock-derived interlayered clays that ensure soil bioavailability of K<sup>+</sup> and other nutrients.</p>\n<p><strong>New Concepts</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calhoun CZ scientists have produced a variety of papers that resonate far beyond the Calhoun CZO. The papers combine scientific disciplines in ways that demonstrate the future potential for CZO science. One organizes the landscape not by ordering streams and rivers but by ordering interfluves, hills, hillslopes, and hillsheds (Fig.3). Interfluves and hillshed orders are highly correlated with geomorphic features, land-use history, accelerated erosion and gullying, and weathering-front depth. This geomorphic approach can be readily applied to other regions. Another concept-advancing paper asserts that the central concepts of the Earth and ecological sciences, the critical zone and ecosystem, are entirely congruent and mutually supportive (Fig.4). These system sciences can benefit greatly from wider recognition of their overlap.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;D&nbsp;Richter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1331846/1331846_10286393_1640876585297_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1331846/1331846_10286393_1640876585297_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Outcomes Fig.1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1331846/1331846_10286393_1640876585297_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Outcomes Fig.1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig.1.
