 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Prof. Tanya Luhrmann, Ph.D. student Alexa Hagerty will investigate the practices of forensic scientists involved in humanitarian exhumation. By using semi-structured interviews, surveys and participation in the daily activities at exhumation sites, labs, storage facilities and family homes, the researcher will explore what humanitarian exhumation means to those most intimately involved: forensic teams and families of the missing. \r\n\r\nDespite the stated aim of engaging in 'science in service of families',forensic scientists undertaking humanitarian exhumation are often shocked and dismayed to learn that family members oppose exhumation.  By undertaking ethnographic research with a forensics team that pioneered this young field and is the leader in terms of  training of other teams internationally, the co-PI will be able to advise forensic scientists on how to better achieve their aims. In addition to resulting in a dissertation, the findings will be shared with forensic scientists  at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences conference.",
