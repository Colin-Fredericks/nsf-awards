 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this 1-year project is to organize a 2.5-day EarthCube Workshop that brings together experts in observations, theory, data analysis, data-driven 3D modeling, data management and high performance computing of the Sun-Earth system.  The goal is to identify the current challenges and cyberinfrastructure needs related the access, sharing, visualization and synthesis of the existing and future large, multi-wavelength datasets covering solar-terrestrial observations and modeling all the way from the surface of the Sun to the Earth's upper atmosphere.  The intellectual merit of this activity will materialize in two ways. The workshop will introduce the solar-terrestrial community to the general vision behind the EarthCube framework while providing consensus feedback from this community to the EarthCube initiative.  The scientific challenges and related cyberinfrastructure needs identified during this workshop will drive subsequent activities aiming to implement cyberinfrastructure solutions.  These activities will result in expanding the computing infrastructure of the participating universities and accommodate postdoctoral and graduate student involvement from a wide range of disciplines including physics, computer sciences, and mathematics; thus, these activities will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning, which will directly impact the students' careers.  Such activities will facilitate the transfer of innovative data analysis, data visualization, and data-driven modeling techniques to other fields of research that may benefit from a similar framework.",
