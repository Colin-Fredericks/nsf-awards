 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Human Engineering Research Laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh and the Hiram G. Andrews Vocational Training Center are partnering to conduct an NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) project entitled People with Disabilities Achieving Career Employment (PACE). PACE will extend advanced manufacturing certificate training and employment opportunities to veterans and people with disabilities. The project focuses on individuals with orthopedic and cognitive impairments. This project has the potential to provide significant societal benefits by creating opportunities for veterans and people with disabilities to become full participants in the advanced manufacturing educational and workplace arenas. Advanced manufacturing is an area of critical importance to the national economy.  Currently, advanced manufacturing industries are reporting difficulties in finding entry-level employees with appropriate skills. Veterans and people with disabilities have the potential to obtain meaningful employment in advanced manufacturing, but the lack of training programs and workplace facilities that are accommodating to veterans and people with disabilities keep this from being a reality. The contribution of veterans and people with disabilities to the advanced manufacturing workforce benefits not only those individuals, but also society as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe PACE program will work with a broad range of industry, academic and advocacy experts to design, develop, and deliver didactic and experiential training curricula tailored to veterans and people with disabilities in the advanced manufacturing field. The project will provide guidance to academic institutions and industry on making their advanced manufacturing programs accommodating to veterans and people with disabilities.  Project goals include delivering an advanced manufacturing curriculum that is integrated into for-credit certificate programs. The certificates are: National Institute for Metalworking Skill (NIMS) Certified Machining Level 1, Machining Level 2, and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) Additive Manufacturing Certificate. PACE will also design and disseminate professional development materials and guidelines for education and industry for inclusion of and accommodations of veterans and people with disabilities in advanced manufacturing. \r\n\r\nFindings from PACE will contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge in the areas of educational curricula, engineering education, engineering public policy, and inclusiveness. The project evaluation work includes design of a criteria-based evaluation instrument to review the program characteristics developed through this work. In addition, stakeholder perceptions will be compiled including analysis of the qualitative data gathered from partners and participants. Evaluation design includes the development of survey instruments of potential broad use by similar programs. Findings regarding formative data will serve to document the need for program modifications and provide insights to help disseminate the project innovations to other interested groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of the PACE/AIM (AIM) project was to extend Advanced Manufacturing (AM) training and employment opportunities to Veterans and people with disabilities (V/PwD), with a focus on individuals with orthopedic, neurological, or cognitive impairments.  Working with a broad range of industry, academic, and advocacy experts, AIM designed, developed, and delivered didactic and experiential training curricula tailored for V/PwD and provided guidance to academic institutions and industry on making their AM programs accommodating  to V/PwD.\n\nAIM had the following major goals: (1) create curricula materials that promoted inclusion; (2) design and develop accommodations to maximize participation; and (3) provide technical and job skills training to V/PwD.  We had activities addressing each of these initiatives that are partnerships between the University of Pittsburgh/Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) and the Hiram G. Andrews Center (HGA).\n\nAIM is the first program to systematically evaluate existing AM training curricula, tailor the curricula and AM facilities to be accommodating to V/PwD with orthopedic, neurological, or cognitive impairments, and advance the knowledge base of accommodations needed for V/PwD in the AM workplace.\n\nStudents were trained within AIM through three primary pathways: (1) students pursued an Associate degree from HGA; (2) students could come directly to HERL for training; or (3) students may complete the HGA program then transition to HERL.  The structure of the AIM program provided a layered approach to training.  Students followed a detailed schedule that provided a road map for acquiring technical and machining skills and knowledge that will benefit them in their search for full-time employment or transition to higher education (primarily in an engineering discipline).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rory A Cooper"
