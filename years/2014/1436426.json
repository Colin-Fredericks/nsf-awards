The project at Kentucky State University seeks to undertake institutional reform and establish transformational strategies to strengthen and enhance STEM teaching, learning, and research and to improve students' access to and retention in STEM programs. Kentucky State University enrolls a significant number of students from groups underrepresented in STEM - minority students, low-income students, and non-traditional students, such as home-schooled students and students returning to college.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to enhance the teaching pedagogies and research capacity in STEM fields, fostering a competitive learning and research environment, and developing new project-based and inquiry-based curricula and programs that will provide academic support to the students. The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) increase the enrollment of students into the STEM programs; 2) develop experiential research projects to enhance students' opportunities in a broad range of scientific inquiry; 3) enhance STEM curricula to address the diverse backgrounds and learning styles of the students; and 4) develop student retention, faculty development, and research enhancement programs. The project is projected to impact 250 students at Kentucky State University, as well as 60 pre-college or high school students.",

During the course of the project implementation, many innovative teaching, research, recruitment, and retention activities were adopted including active and project based learning modules in the classrooms. Students involvement in experiential research projects provided them opportunities for enhancing their hypothesis formulation, data analysis and interpretation, communication and leadership skills in a broad range of scientific inquiries. Participating faculty were provided funding and pedagogical assistance to develop and enhance curricula and teaching methods, and create active learning opportunities for students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. The project created new opportunities for collaboration between high schools, community college and stakeholders in the areas of experiential research and in monitoring of natural and farm resources. These exposures have increased the visibility of Kentucky State University for problem solving in agricultural land management, robotic and drone education, and organizing STEM summer programs for college readiness efforts. Students who participated in the project have received job offers at many federal and state STEM offices such as Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Census Bureau, IBM, County GIS Offices, etc. These students pursue STEM-based research and outreach at their workplace. &nbsp;Student participants have found outlets that allow them to use the skills they develop at KSU as part of the experiential learning projects as well as innovative course work with faculty and staff.&nbsp; During the project period, about 91 high school students participated in three-week long Summer Apprenticeship Program (SAP) every summer from 2015 to 2018 and obtained exposure in research and college preparation. &nbsp;The project also provided financial assistance to promote geospatial lab with data, software, infrastructure, and learning tools. Eighteen undergraduate students were supported with assistantships for conducting STEM experiential research with their mentors. These students presented scientific papers and posters in the professional society conferences and some of them won awards. The project increased interaction and continued coordination with high schools, state and federal agencies for recruitment, collaborative research and career opportunities for faculty and students. &nbsp;The intellectual merit of this project was achieved with enhanced and innovative curricula in cross-disciplinary teaching, learning, and research pedagogy of faculty in STEM discipline. &nbsp;The broader impact of the project was evident by increased visibility of Kentucky State University via presentations, publications, dual credit courses, and site visits and networking with state and county government offices and industries. &nbsp;Additional broader impacts are noticed in strengthening of KSU?s STEM undergraduate programs and expansion of such programs to high schools and underserved communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322377092_IMG_7914--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322377092_IMG_7914--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322377092_IMG_7914--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mr. Deyshon Ward talks about use of Drones in farm and property management</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buddhi Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322528274_IMG_5796--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322528274_IMG_5796--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster observation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322528274_IMG_5796--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster observation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A middle school student is viewing a poster in the Youth STEM Symposium Day</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buddhi Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster observation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322755055_IMG_5820--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322755055_IMG_5820--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drone demonstration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1436426/1436426_10323883_1572322755055_IMG_5820--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drone demonstration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Middle school students viewing and inquiring about drones</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buddhi Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drone demonstration</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
