 "awd_abstract_narration": "MaSTEC TF/MTF Capacity Building Project\r\n\r\nFlorida Memorial University is partnering with Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS) in a capacity building project to develop a full Robert Noyce Teaching Fellowship and Master Teaching Fellowship (TF/MTF) project. The project is  developing an innovative integrated science and mathematics master's degree program to prepare a cadre of highly qualified science and mathematics teacher leaders for urban, high-need school districts.  The primary objectives for this capacity building project include 1) identifying sources and obtaining cost sharing commitments; 2) conducting a needs assessment to determine the interest level among STEM professionals in Miami Dade and Broward Counties; 3) developing an evidence-based and practical approach to curricular and laboratory activities to guide the professional and leadership development of Master Teachers in urban high-need schools; 4) designing a robust outreach plan for recruiting and retaining Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows; and 5) developing effective assessment strategies and other tools to be used in the TF/MTF full proposal.\r\n\r\nThis project's success contributes to increasing the number of highly qualified minority mathematics and science teachers equipped to work with students and their families from diverse backgrounds in urban schools. The goal is to prepare teachers who are knowledgeable in best practices for improving science and mathematics literacy and competent in conducting action research to determine which interventions are best suited for the students they will be teaching.",
