 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"CC*IIE Networking Infrastructure: Accelerating Science, Translational Research, and Collaboration at the University of Pittsburgh Through the Implementation of Network Upgrades\" project adds new capacity and capabilities to the University's cyberinfrastructure enabling research and e-science using high performance computing (HPC) and big-data resources. This project upgrades the campus network connection to the regional gateway, increases network capacity to the University data center, and provides improved utility to collaborators engaged in local, regional, and international science projects. The foundation provided by this new capacity enables enhancement of Pitt's cyberinfrastructure to meet rapidly expanding needs in collaborative and multi-disciplinary data-driven research. Using the ScienceDMZ design pattern improves the movement of scientific data flows and allows new modes of sharing and collaboration. Research projects benefiting from this include scalable approaches for use of extremely large-scale genomics data sets for research in personalized medicine, interdisciplinary collaborations expanding the state-of-the-art in high-fidelity predictions of turbulent reacting flows, and contributions to the ATLAS project involving discoveries in high-energy particle physics.\r\n\r\nImproving researchers' ability to exploit capacity and knowledge brings broader impacts within and beyond domain science areas such as high energy physics. Numerous sponsored projects benefit from the improved capacity to local, regional and international scientific resources. New network capacity and capabilities spur new collaboration and education opportunities for undergraduate research, teaching, training, and sharing of data with a larger community of research scientists and network engineers. Project communications include on-campus workshops, meetings, presentations and regular e-based communications to communities of faculty, students, and researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project upgraded portions of the University of Pittsburgh\u00c6s campus network with increased capacity and functionality to support scientific research using high performance computing, big-data resources at campus/regional/national sites and intra/inter-institutional collaborations in data-driven science.  The project provides the necessary foundation from which further network enhancements can be developed to meet the rapidly expanding needs of collaborative and multi-disciplinary data-driven research and further enables the University\u00c6s participation in activities involving data access, collaborative research, real-time analysis, and science education.\n\n \n\nThe project established a ScienceDMZ network at Pitt distinct from the general-purpose campus network, engineered specifically to support data-intensive science.  The Science DMZ provides a network-architecture approach optimized for high-performance scientific applications and the transfer of large research data sets over high-speed wide area networks.  It supports big data movement by improving security, cost-effectiveness, and handling of large scientific data sets. ScienceDMZ works by \"carving out a small part of the campus network\" to provide friction-free, high-performance networking in an environment separate from the business or enterprise systems that constitute the great majority of the campus local area network (LAN). This separate environment provides a relatively small space optimized for the wide area data-movement needs of systems whose effectiveness depends on high-speed flows of big data. It also gives researchers greater networking capacity to work with colleagues at other campuses, institutions, or national labs. \n\n \n\nThe ScienceDMZ will benefit current and future projects including: Increasing access to and improving analyses of particle physics generated by the Large Hadron Collider; accessing large genomic datasets stored on publically available repositories; connecting communities of scientists to large-scale datasets from simulation and modeling conducted at supercomputing facilities; developing a secure repository of de-identified TCGA data at the University of Pittsburgh linked to enterprise clinical data at UPMC.  Scientists will use this repository for the purposes of understanding the molecular basis of cancer and to develop new methods for improving cancer care.\n\n \n\nThe project has enabled these goals by upgrading key campus networking connections and implementing new tools for data movement.  The campus connection to the 3Rox GigaPoP (providing access to the major research and education network backbones, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and XSEDE resources) was upgraded to 100Gb/s.  The campus to data center connection was upgraded to 100Gb/s.   New equipment and software were used to build an enterprise data-transfer node (DTN) connected to the ScienceDMZ and cluster resources at the data center.   Additionally, an extension of the ScienceDMZ was delivered to a campus building to connect a DTN attached to a local cluster.\n\n \n\nImproving researchers\u00c6 ability to exploit capacity and knowledge brings broader impacts within and beyond the immediate subject areas.   New network capacity to HPC resources will spur new collaborations and educational activities for undergraduate research, teaching, training, and sharing of data with a larger community of researchers.   New modes of research collaboration can be developed to further Pitt\u00c6s contributions to the \"grand challenges\" facing society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Stengel"
