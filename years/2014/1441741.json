 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support travel grants to students from the US to attend the Doctoral Consortium of the 2014 Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) conference to be held in Vienna, Austria. The field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is important to build intelligent computer systems and in recent years it has been highlighted with respect to initiatives and successes such as the Semantic Web and the Watson system. However, with respect to some measures (such as percentage of papers submitted), the USA has fallen behind other countries, in this field. Recognizing this and the importance of KRR, a Workshop on Research Challenges and Opportunities in Knowledge Representation was organized by NSF in February 2013. The KRR conference series, established in 1989, is the premiere conference in this field. This award will enable US students to meet and interact with the top researchers in the field of KRR.  This will have a long term impact on developing qualified researchers in the USA in this field and this will have further impact on both the academia and industries in the USA.\r\n\r\nThis award will address a bottleneck in student education in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). The PIs are among the main drivers of the conference series. They are established researchers with high visibility and proven track record of successful student mentoring. The KRR conference is a premier event attended by prominent researchers in the area. This award will help the students supported by the award to be better researchers in the field of KRR. This field is not only important to building Intelligent Systems, but  has implications in many related areas such as: Event recognition in video analysis, Question answering, Machine reading, and Analysis of big mechanisms. \r\n\r\nFor further information on the 2014 KRR conference see the conference web page: \r\nhttp://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/kr2014/",

In total 8 US doctoral students were supported by this project; 4 for the 2014 conference and 4 for the 2016 conference. They attended the corresponding doctoral consortiums and presented their research. Severeal of these students were women and minorities. Many of them also presented papers in the conference. They continue to be active in the field and several of them have published other articles since then.

Another event during the DC was the industry&nbsp;dinner, where students had the chance to speak with people from&nbsp;industry, who work with KR related topics and to evaluate possible&nbsp;career path outside of academia. This event was again positively&nbsp;evaluated by both students and industry participants. Finally,&nbsp;students had the chance to present their research to the overall&nbsp;conference audience in a short 1 minute presentation, where the slides&nbsp;were collected beforehand to allow for smooth transitions, and a&nbsp;poster session that was joint with the poster session of the main&nbsp;conference to really attract broad interest. These events allowed for&nbsp;a broad interaction with the general KR conference and was also&nbsp;another opportunity for the students to discuss their research work&nbsp;with their mentors.
