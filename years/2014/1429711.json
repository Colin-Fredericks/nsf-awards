 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Liviu Mirica from Washington University and colleagues Robert Blankenship, William Buhro, D. Andre d'Avignon and Sophia Hayes will acquire an EPR spectrometer that would operate at X-band. This instrument will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species behave when they possess unpaired electrons. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Washington University as well as institutions in the entire St. Louis area.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigating and developing metal-based catalytic systems; (b) characterizing metal-containing biomolecules biological importance; (c) studying biological macromolecular assemblies relevant to solar energy conversion; (d) characterizing nanomaterials; and (e) understanding the electronic characteristics of inorganic compounds.",
