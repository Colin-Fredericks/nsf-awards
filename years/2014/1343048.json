 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the influence of solar variability and greenhouse gas increases on upper atmospheric hydrogen distributions from both an observational and modeling perspective. Fabry-Perot observations of upper atmospheric hydrogen Balmer-alpha emissions from Northern mid-latitudes over the time period spanning three solar minima establish a reference data set that can be used to compare with future observations and with atmospheric models. This data set shows an apparent upward trend in hydrogen optical emissions of greater magnitude than predicted alone from increases in hydrogen abundance due to the rise in greenhouse gases. In order to ensure that this is not a result of a calibration artifact, the accuracy of the Northern hemisphere long-term Balmer-alpha data set will be improved through use of updated knowledge of the background Galactic emission intensity, current analysis tools, and an updated tropospheric scattering correction code. In addition, observations from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere will be compared.\r\n \r\nThe major science questions to be addressed by this project are as follows: What are the solar cyclic and climatic influences on mechanisms governing lower to upper atmospheric coupling of hydrogenous species? What are the solar cyclic and possibly longer-term trends in emission observations from geocoronal hydrogen, the upper boundary of the Earth's hydrogenous species distribution? What are the predicted magnitudes for changes in hydrogen-containing species? To address this, the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) will be used to carry out sensitivity studies of solar cyclic and climatic influences on middle and upper atmospheric hydrogeneous species distributions. The NCAR Global Mean Model will be used to study how these forcings propagate through the thermosphere.\r\n\r\nA faculty member at a two-year UW college campus and undergraduate students will be involved in this work. Public outreach activities will be carried out aimed at increasing public literacy about the science of climate change, and facilitating opportunities for youth exposure and involvement in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report: CEDAR Solar Cyclic and Climatic Influences on Upper Atmospheric Hydrogen Distributions\n\n \n\nLong-term data records are essential for understanding natural variability and human impacts on our climate system.  Atomic hydrogen is a key constituent of the thermosphere and exosphere, the uppermost region of the Earth's atmosphere.  Hydrogen is involved in reactions with ions in the plasmasphere [Krall et al., 2017] and is a byproduct of lower altitude constituents containing hydrogen such as methane and water vapor, two species with large influence on the energy balance of the Earth's atmosphere [Brasseur and Solomon, 2005].  The 11-year solar cycle is a major source of natural variability in the upper atmosphere.  The research supported by this grant focused on the investigation of solar cyclic and longer term influences on hydrogen in the thermosphere and exosphere, the upper-most region of the Earth's atmosphere.  We used both observations and modeling studies.\n\nGround-based hydrogen emission observations from Northern mid-latitudes span multiple solar cycles, facilitating study of natural variability in the hydrogen response to solar activity and of possible longer-term influences.   Scientific questions addressed by this research included the following.  What are the solar cyclic and climatic influences on connections between atmospheric species containing hydrogen in the lower and upper regions of the atmosphere? What are the solar cyclic and possibly longer-term trends in emission observations from geocoronal hydrogen, the upper boundary of the Earth's hydrogen-containing species distribution? What are the predicted magnitudes for changes in hydrogen-containing species?   To address these questions, a major goal was to determine if the apparent upward trend in the Wisconsin hydrogen emission data set is geophysical or an artifact of the calibration or analysis.\n\nThe research sponsored by this grant focused on analysis and comparison of a long-term data set of observations of geocoronal hydrogen emissions (~400 km and above) taken by ground-based Fabry-Perot optical instruments at Wisconsin and at the Kitt Peak, Observatory in Arizona.  We reanalyzed ground-based Fabry-Perot hydrogen emission observations from the early 1990s and compared them with observations obtained in 2000-2001 in the context of the extended Northern hemisphere mid-latitude geocoronal hydrogen emission data set.  These observations span two solar cycles and indicate a likely increase in the geocoronal hydrogen emission intensity between the 1990-1991 solar maximum (solar cycle 22) and the 2000-2001 near-solar-maximum (solar cycle 23) periods, with the caveat that this is a limited data set [Nossal et al., submitted to JGR, 2019].   Solar activity was higher during the earlier solar maximum period.  The apparent increase in intensity is counter to previous observations from mid-latitudes in which the observed intensity increases with higher solar activity.  Further, the apparent increase in intensity is also of larger magnitude than models predict the response would be due to increases in greenhouse gases.  \n\nWe also conducted modeling studies with the National Center for Atmospheric Research?s one-dimensional Global Mean Model of the upper atmosphere.  These indicated that thermospheric hydrogen would be predicted to increase due to both increases in tropospheric methane, a source of hydrogen, and to cooling due to carbon dioxide [Nossal et al., 2016].\n\nThe broader impacts of the work sponsored by this grant include contributions to whole atmospheric studies of natural variability and climate change processes.  The grant provided summer support for a faculty member at a two-year University of Wisconsin system school and support for two undergraduate student researchers, as well as partial support for a graduate student.  We participated in a number of science outreach activities, including giving talks about climate change science for college student audiences and facilitating hands-on optics activities and discussion of climate change science for youth and the public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan M Nossal"
