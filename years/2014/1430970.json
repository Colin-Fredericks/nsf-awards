 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is 3-year ethnographic study of the emerging field of social science genetics which pairs genome-wide association and structural DNA analysis with social research to find genomic causes for non-disease social phenomena such as educational attainment, promiscuity, gang behavior, and debt.  Such research is being led by scientists new to genomics, yet dedicated to revolutionizing its foundational theories and methods so that social outcomes can be linked to genetic traits.  Already judges, state officials, and preschool administrators have implemented techniques from this emerging field to test criminals and prospective students for pro and antisocial traits. Despite the science's growing impact on the broader landscape of science, public health, and public discourses and practices, no studies have yet analyzed this emerging field. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will facilitate more fruitful collaborations between the natural and social sciences, and the public in order to promote and sustain our national health.  Upon completion of the study, the PI expects to be equipped to recommend more efficacious and socially responsible genetic and social science research ethics. The PI will ensure the impact of this research by circulating recommendations for best practices of multidisciplinary research to study institutions, funding agencies, researchers, and universities that are not only trying to foster inter- and transdisciplinary research within academic arenas but also across university-industry ties.",
