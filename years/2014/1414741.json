 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voice disorders affect many people in the United States but effective clinical treatment is limited by knowledge of the physics of voice production proper diagnosis  and by challenges in diagnosis. Laryngoscopy, use of a specially designed endoscope to examine the vocal folds, is an important technique for vocal fold visualization in both clinical and research settings. However, the technique is limited to providing information regarding movement in two dimensions when the motion of vocal folds has been shown to be three-dimensional. Dr. Isao Tokuda at the Ritsumeikan University in Japan has developed a method for reconstructing three-dimensional vocal fold motion using a laryngoscope with two cameras, but the technique has not yet been extensively validated. In collaboration with Dr. Tokuda, this project will use synthetic vocal fold models, recently used in voice biomechanics research, to validate the stereo-endoscopy system. \r\n\r\nSynthetic vocal fold models have recently been used in voice biomechanics research and will be used in the proposed project because they offer more control, are more robust, and are easier to acquire than excised animal models. Multiple cameras and common computer vision techniques will be used to validate the stereo-endoscopy system by recording and reconstructing the vibrating surface of synthetic, self-oscillating vocal fold models with both the stereo-endoscopy and high speed systems and comparing the results. The validation of the stereo-endoscopy system will allow its use in clinical settings as well as for quantitative analysis of vocal fold motion, leading to improved understanding of the dynamics involved in phonation. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

Effective clinical treatment of voice disorders is limited by understanding of the physics that affect voice production, as well as the ability to properly diagnose some voice disorders.  Laryngoscopy has long been an important technique for vocal fold visualization in both clinical and research settings, but presently the technique is limited to providing information regarding movement in two dimensions.  However, the motion of the vocal folds have been shown to be three-dimensional, and diagnosis of certain voice disorders are difficult without information regarding the third dimension.   Dr. Isao Tokuda from Ritsumeikan University in Japan (the host scientist) and his associates are developing a method for reconstructing three-dimensional vocal fold motion using a special laryngoscope with two cameras.  The accuracy of the technique needed to be quantified before it could be implemented in clinical and research settings.  This project tested the technique in a controlled but dynamic environment by simultaneously recording the surface of vibrating vocal fold models with external cameras and three-dimensional laryngoscopy system.  The tests provided valuable information regarding the capabilities and limitations of the new technique which will be incorporated into its used and further development.\n\nThe project created valuable opportunities for collaboration between research groups in the United States and Japan and has led to further collaboration and discussion on this and related projects.  The project provided valuable learning and networking opportunities for the visiting researcher from the US.  The host lab in Japan gained experience in fabrication of synthetic vocal fold models, which have been recently used in voice biomechanics research.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly A Stevens"
