 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most flowering plants are capable of forming symbiotic associations (called arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis) with soil fungi. These associations develop in the plant root, where, in exchange for carbon, the fungus transfers phosphate from the soil to the root. Currently, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of symbiotic development. This project aims to determine the functions of two novel plant proteins that are essential for development of AM symbiosis. The project also focuses on symbiotic phosphate transport and aims to determine how plant cells sense phosphate delivery by the fungus.  The investigators will use genetics, molecular and cell biology techniques to assess the sub-cellular locations and functions of these proteins in plant cells. It is expected that these studies will reveal new information about how plant root cells build symbiotic membranes and also how they sense phosphate. This fundamental knowledge will advance the current understanding of AM symbiosis and aspects of plant cell biology in general.  The broader impacts of this work include the potential for future improvements in phosphate acquisition by plants. Phosphate is essential for plant growth and is often limiting for crop production. Phosphate fertilization costs are increasing and fertilizer runoff contaminates aquatic ecosystems, consequently, improvements in the efficiency of phosphate fertilizer use are needed. Fundamental knowledge of AM symbiosis and phosphate sensing by plant cells may provide the basis for new approaches to increase phosphate use efficiency in crop plants. This project will provide training for researchers at various stages of their careers from high school students to postdoctoral researchers. In particular, it will introduce high school students and minority undergraduate students to concepts of plant genetics and plant cell biology.",

In these associations, the fungus lives partly in the root cells and partly in the surrounding soil, thus further enhancing connectivity between plant roots and the soil. The association is beneficial for both partners and enables each to obtain essential nutrients; the fungus supplies phosphorus (as phosphate) to the plant while the plant provides carbon, in the form of fatty acids and sugars, to the fungus. &nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange of nutrients takes place within the plant root cells, where the fungus develops branched hyphae called arbuscules. In many soils the plant-available phosphorous levels are low and limit plant growth and in these situations, additional phosphate captured and delivered by the fungal symbiont is particularly beneficial and increases plant growth.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>In this project, we focused on the intracellular phase of the symbiosis and addressed questions about the molecular mechanisms underlying development of the arbuscule/root cell interface as well as details of the lipid content of the membranes and overall ultrastructure of the interface.&nbsp; Using a combination of genetics and cell biology, we analyzed two plant proteins that are essential for enabling the plant cell to build a membrane around the arbuscule. Our studies demonstrated that these two protein interact and function to direct membrane deposition around the growing arbuscule branches. Using light microscopy and fluorescent probes capable of detecting lipids, we examined the lipid content of the membrane that surrounds the fungus and revealed specific membrane regions that are rich in specific classes of lipid that have roles in signaling and in the recruitment of proteins to the membrane (Figure 1). &nbsp;Using electron microscopy, we examined the ultrastructure of the membrane and also the intervening matrix material. This high resolution approach revealed several new and unexpected features; first, the membrane is much more extensive than originally reported and second, the space between the fungus and plant is filled with additional membranes (Figure 2). Furthermore, it revealed that the plasma membrane of the fungus displays regions of tubular extensions and that these are juxtapositioned adjacent to the regions rich in plant membrane. We propose that the extensive membrane development may facilitate the movement of molecules between the two organisms. In particular, the matrix membrane compartments may facilitate the movement of lipids from the plant to the fungus in a similar manner to potentially analogous membrane-rich environments observed in animal cell-parasite interfaces.</span></p>\n<p><span>The second aspect of this project addressed the roles of phosphate transporter proteins at the interface.

Additionally, through transcript profiling, we discovered a unique transcriptional program which is activated in the plant cell as the arbuscule dies. The genes encode secreted hydrolase proteins, including chitinases and lipases, and we propose that their role is to disassemble and recycle the membrane interface and the remnants of the dead fungal hyphae. &nbsp;This hypothesis is further supported by the phenotype of a mutant in which the program cannot be fully activated.

P-based fertilizers are costly and fertilizer runoff contributes to the contamination of aquatic ecosystems. In addition, the source material for P-based fertilizers is a non-renewable resource. Consequently, there are strong economic and ecological incentives for increasing the efficiency of P-fertilizer usage and modifying agricultural practices to improve sustainability. In this project, we advanced an understanding of several fundamental aspects of the nutrient-exchange interface of the symbiosis.
