 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Herbert of the Ohio State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop improved electronic structure-based methods for simulating electronic excitation and ionization in condensed-phase systems, specifically macromolecules and aqueous solutions.  Herbert and his research group develop algorithms to locate minimum-energy crossing points along conical seams, based on spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory, which allows them to explore and characterize excited-state potential energy surfaces in large systems such as fully-solvated DNA with multiple nucleobases described quantum-mechanically.  A major goal is to make contact with femtosecond laser spectroscopic measurements in DNA.  Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) methods that are compatible with an arbitrary description of the QM region are being developed for this purpose as well.  QM/MM methods, with various descriptions of the solvent's polarization response following ionization, are being developed and tested for calculation of vertical ionization energies of molecules in liquid solution; such quantities can now be measured via liquid microjet photoelectron spectroscopy.  Improved, numerically-robust versions of continuum electrostatics are being developed as low-cost boundary conditions for these simulations.\r\n\r\nTime-resolved (femtosecond) laser spectroscopy is an important tool for interrogating the molecular-level chemical dynamics of complex systems, but often these experiments need assistance from detailed quantum-mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations in order to assign a mechanistic interpretation to the time constants and/or energy gaps that are measured experimentally.  The Herbert research group is developing the computational tools to simulate these experiments at the molecular level.  Although the computational machinery and software that they develop is quite general,  Herbert and his coworkers focus on a few important chemical problems.  These include the photophysics following UV excitation of DNA, where they seek to understand where the input energy goes, how can it damage the molecule, and what sorts of \"traps\" exist to prevent such damage.  They are also interested in the ionization of liquid water and other aqueous systemsas a means of understanding the dynamics and energetics of the water radiolysis process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe term \"photochemistry\" describes chemical reactions that are initiated when molecules absorb light, but which would not proceed in the absence of light.  Important examples include human and animal vision, wherein a complex chemical signaling pathway is initiated when molecules in the eye absorb light, as well as solar energy technology, wherein the electrons that generate electrical current are themselves generated when certain materials absorb light.  The design of novel solar energy materials or human-engineered systems for performing artificial photosynthesis requires an understanding of the basic molecular-level mechanisms underlying these photochemical processes.  A promising means to do this at relatively low cost is to perform some of this research not experimentally but rather computationally, where a potentially large number of candidate materials (many of them destined to be failures, but some potentially promising) can be screened on a computer, and only the promising ones synthesized and tested in the laboratory.\n\n \n\nComputational photochemistry involves numerical solution of the basic equations of quantum mechanics that govern the structure and function of molecules.  These calculations are time-consuming, and in practice mathematical approximations must necessarily be introduced, so a major challenge in computational chemistry is to develop new algorithms that reduce the cost and do a better job of more accurately describing a molecule's extended environment, yet without making the calculations prohibitively costly.  The intellectual merit of this work is that we have developed new computer algorithms and software that address these challenges.  We have implemented these algorithms in easy-to-use computer programs such that, while a knowledge of chemistry is still necessary in order to make educated guesses about which materials to explore, specific expertise in quantum mechanics and/or computer science is not required. The broader impacts of this work is that our algorithms are now available to numerous researchers in chemistry, materials science, and related fields and can assist those researchers in their understanding of photochemical processes, thus potentially accelerating the discovery and synthesis of new molecules and materials. \n\n \n\nThe primary outcome of this project is the development of several new, more efficient computational tools for understanding the basic mechanisms of molecular photochemistry.  These tools have since been provided to the research community.  In addition, our own group has used these methods to examine (on a computer) the elementary steps in water radiolysis and biomolecular radiation damage, which is to say, what happens at the molecular level when human cells, and specifically human DNA, absorb high-energy radiation?  While that complete picture has yet to be unraveled, our work has placed some theoretical limits on the  mechanisms might be reasonably be responsible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John M Herbert"
