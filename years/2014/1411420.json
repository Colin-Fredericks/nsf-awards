 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists need to predict the impacts of human-caused change on plant and animal populations. These predictions are often made using demographic models, which combine vital rates (birth, growth, and death rates) into estimates of how population size changes in response to changes in the environment.  Variation in vital rates is usually modeled as \"white noise\", meaning that rates in one year are not correlated with rates in the recent past or recent future.  However, there are good reasons to believe that variation may be \"red\", meaning good years tend to follow good years (due to trends in environmental conditions or carry-over through physiological condition), and there is evidence that some species experience \"blue\" noise, meaning bad years tend to follow good years (for example, if reproduction depletes stored resources).  In the few cases where researchers have looked for \"colored\" noise in plant and animal populations, these effects have substantially changed predictions about population dynamics.  \r\n\r\nThis project will develop methods for estimating \"colored\" stochasticity and also evaluate how important this variation is for population dynamics.  The research will compare population dynamics of three species of perennial wildflowers, representing different extremes: 1) a perennial wildflower of arid environments, which experiences high costs of reproduction, typical of \"blue noise\"; 2) a wildflower that lives along meandering rivers, which experiences directional changes in the environment, typical of \"red noise\"; and 3) an orchid near the northern edge of its global distribution. In this this latter species the color of noise is unknown, but likely important for life-history evolution and responses to climate change.  \r\n\r\nAs part of this project, the researcher will also evaluate if and how hundreds of short-term (3-10 year) studies of different plant species (more than 300 have been published  to date) can be used to infer long-term effects of environmental change for plants in general.  Additional broader impacts include developing statistical methods for analysis of short time series, educating students in mathematical biology and ecological forecasting, and promoting international awareness through collaboration with botanists in Oulanka, Finland (near the intersection of the Arctic Circle with the Finland/Russia border) and with statistical ecologists in Brisbane, Australia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor the past twenty-five years, plant ecologists have used a standard set of tools (matrix population models) to build demographic models for plant populations.  Use of this standard method has led to hundreds (possibly thousands) of data sets that have collected data in comparable ways, summarized with the same metrics, for plant populations around the world.  These data have created an unparalleled opportunity for comparative analyses in ecology.  Unfortunately, these methods were developed before modern methods in statistical computing became widely used.  Although the standard methods are very good at quantifying average vital rates, and have more recently been expanded to include one particular form of vital rate variation (\"environmental stochasticity\"), they are less well-suited to quantifying the sources and nature of variation in vital rates.\n\n \n\nThe goal of this project was to promote use of a newer statistical technique, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for analysis of demographic data from plant populations, and to use GLMMs to explore the significance of different kinds of vital rate variation for plant population dynamics.  We explored three kinds of variation among years (i.e., \"environmental stochasticity\"): white noise, i.e., uncorrelated random variation in vital rates, the typical assumption in population models that include variation; blue noise, i.e., variation that is negatively correlated among years, which might occur if plants have a limited pool of resources that gets used up making seeds or fruits and takes time to refill; and red noise, i.e., variation that is positively correlated among years, which might occur if plants live in environments that change gradually through time, such as light gaps in forests that slowly fill in.  We also compared variation among years to spatial variation among habitat patches (i.e., \"spatial heterogeneity\"). \n\n \n\nFor most species, we were able to detect blue noise when we looked for it.  When plants had years in which they produced very large seed crops, these tended to be followed by years with low reproduction, and often lower growth or survival.  The most charismatic example of this phenomenon is that we detected blue noise in sugar maples (Acer saccharum).  Sugar maples rarely produce two large seed crops in a row.  In addition, years with high seed crops are followed by years in which trees have lower amounts of stored sugars, so there is less sugar in maple sap, and maple syrup yields are lower.  The relationship between previous seed production and sap sugar filled a gap in the knowledge of sugar maple husbandry, and was picked up by local growers\u00c6 associations, the press, and a recent USDA summary of the future of maple syrup production.\n\n \n\nAnother interesting result of the research was the importance of spatial heterogeneity for plant population dynamics.  Demographic models that include variation usually only include environmental stochasticity, and there are now fairly standard techniques for doing so.  Spatial heterogeneity is much less often included, and methods for including spatial heterogeneity are much less consistent among studies, and in the past have been much less amenable to the typical forms of empirical data.  We used GLMMs to estimate the amount of small-scale heterogeneity in vital rates of plants, and expanded standard matrix models to include variation among sites.  We found that spatial heterogeneity affected predictions as much as environmental stochasticity, and provided a framework that other empirical ecologists can use to evaluate the importance of spatial heterogeneity for other plant populations.\n\n \n\nIn addition to research, we conducted workshops on the use of GLMMs in ecology, targeted at professors from undergraduate oriented colleges.  Ecological statistics have been changing rapidly in recent years, and there are few opportunities for faculty from institutions without Ph.D. programs to keep up.  We also collaborated..."
