 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early, accurate detection of breast cancer has long been a top medical priority. Recent clinical\r\nsuccess using Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) developed by our Massachusetts General Hospital\r\n(MGH) research partners shows reduced false alarms relative to conventional mammography.\r\nHowever, despite DBT?s enhanced detection capability, the 1% radiological contrast between\r\ncancerous tissue and commonly-occurring fibroglandular tissue limits the unequivocal characterization\r\nof diseased tissue. Alternatively, due to the relatively high contrast (10%) between cancer\r\nand fibro-glandular tissue, microwave imaging has a strong potential to distinguish diseased\r\nfrom healthy tissue. However, the often highly heterogeneous nature of breast tissue, where\r\nfibroglandular tissue is randomly interspersed in the adipose background, results in disorganized\r\nmicrowave images resulting in degraded image reconstruction.\r\nIn collaboration with our research partners at Northeastern University?s Gordon Center for\r\nSubsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (Gordon-CenSSIS) ERC, HXI proposes to fuse the DBT\r\nX-ray imagery with microwave Nearfield Radar Imagery (NRI), and by building upon the image\r\nextraction techniques developed by ERC platform technology, to significantly improve the cancerous\r\ntissue detection rate.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities will help the scientific/medical community to advance the knowledge\r\nand understanding of the effectiveness of microwave NRI method in detecting breast cancer.\r\nOur approach is based on the use of high resolution X-ray-based DBT imaging to obtain the\r\nspatial organization of heterogeneous breast tissues and on coupling it as prior information\r\nto NRI for 3-D reconstruction. This completely new transformative concept has not been previously\r\ninvestigated, and it has the potential to overcome the limitations of a single-modality breast\r\ncancer imaging technology.\r\nThis project brings together expertise from multiple disciplines:\r\n1) HXI, world experts in radar design, will build the NRI sensor and antenna array;\r\n2) CenSSIS will provide its platform technology algorithms to perform the sensing, imaging\r\nand feature extraction of biological tissues and conduct phantom experiments; and\r\n3) Consultants from the MGH will provide medical expertise.\r\nOur approach, using new but validated imaging systems, allows for rapid transition to industrial\r\nproduct development. The project furthers the ERC?s strategic plan through the application\r\nof translational research for commercialization, with appropriate licensing of CenSSIS? IP\r\nto HXI. Additionally, the NRI/DBT system has the potential to expand HXI?s portfolio of marketable\r\nmicrowave and RF products.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are multifaceted, including improving breast cancer detection\r\nrates, minimizing the cost of treatment by reducing the number of false-positive screenings\r\nand preventing patients from going through the anxiety that callback examinations create.\r\nToday, mammography allows 10-15% of cancers to go undetected and present themselves within\r\none year. In the United States approximately 45 million mammograms are performed annually\r\nwith false positive rates of 8-10%. This equates to more than 4 million callback examinations\r\nper year. With the global market growing at a CAGR of 15.4% developing better imaging systems\r\nis a high priority, in terms of women?s health, emotional toll, and medical costs.",
