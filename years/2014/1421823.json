 "awd_abstract_narration": "Big data applications demand high speed, reliable, and energy  \r\nefficient data storage systems. Traditional storage architectures have  \r\nfundamental limitations because of legacy systems that have centered  \r\non spinning hard disk drives. With rapid advances in nonvolatile  \r\nmemory technologies such as NAND-gate flash, phase change memory, Memristor, and  \r\nmagnetic RAM, a great opportunity arises for revolutionizing storage  \r\narchitectures. The objective of this research is to start a paradigm  \r\nshift in storage architecture to meet the increasing demand of big  \r\ndata applications. It is envisioned that future storage systems will  \r\nhave machine intelligence that learns, analyzes, predicts, and  \r\ncontrols the system at runtime dynamically. A novel accelerator  \r\narchitecture is introduced with machine intelligence to enable high  \r\nspeed processing of storage data operations that are critical to high  \r\nperformance computing in general and big data computing in particular.\r\n\r\n   The newly introduced I/O accelerator, residing either in a  \r\nmany-core CPU chip or on a storage controller board, enables  \r\nsufficiently accurate predictions for effective optimization of  \r\nstorage I/Os. With new architecture features, the proposed I/O  \r\naccelerator can carry out complicated I/O tasks in the speed  \r\ncomparable to the emerging nonvolatile memories, which is critical to  \r\nI/O performance because it no longer operates in milliseconds as  \r\nspinning disks do. The project will explore and implement the I/O  \r\naccelerator that can effectively deal with the complexity and high  \r\ndimensionality of factors related to diverse storage technologies, a  \r\nlarge variation of application workloads, different  \r\nreliability/availability requirements, and power consumptions of  \r\nvarious storage components. The result is a new heterogeneous storage  \r\narchitecture that is optimized for future computing infrastructure.  \r\nWith the accelerator as an enabler, comprehensive methodology will be  \r\ninvestigated that proactively learns system behavior to anticipate  \r\nlong-term trends and to respond quickly to fast changing I/O events.  \r\nThe new architecture is believed to be the first of the kind providing  \r\ndynamic optimizations by means of 1) intelligent data placements and  \r\nreplacements across heterogeneous devices, 2) optimal resource  \r\nallocation and provisioning to applications' workloads, 3) effective  \r\ndata deduplication based on content locality, and 4) smart policy  \r\ndecision on data protection and recovery adaptive to different data  \r\ntypes. Furthermore, the new accelerator enables fast in-situ data  \r\nanalytics in active storage systems. \r\n\r\nThis research project is expected  to have the following broader impacts: \r\n1) In today's cloud computing and big data  \r\napplications, servers generate a large amount of I/Os that can take  \r\nfull advantage of the new storage architecture. 2) The new accelerator  \r\ncan be incorporated into many core CPUs as a specialized core for  \r\nfuture heterogeneous processors. 3) The new storage architecture will  \r\nspeed up the adoption of emerging storage class memories. 4) The new  \r\nmethodology will stimulate more research in applying machine learning  \r\nto storage systems. 5) The new CPU-and-data centric Computer Engineering curriculum will train  \r\nboth graduate and undergraduate students for real world needs. 6) The  \r\noutreach program will continue the success stories of prior NSF  \r\nprojects to help the economic development of the state of Rhode Island and the  \r\nnation.",
