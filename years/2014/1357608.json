 "awd_abstract_narration": "53.3% of employed US mothers were on leave one month after having a child, versus only .8% for fathers [Han et al., 2009]. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act is exceptional in being a US policy mandating unpaid job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons, including childbirth. Surprisingly little is known about the first-order labor market effects of this policy, principally for data reasons. Benefit mandates like the FMLA have costs and benefits which are notoriously difficult to assess. The PI will use new administrative data to evaluate whether FMLA affected retention of female employees, turnover, promotion, earnings, and (in matched survey subsamples) childbearing decisions. \r\n\r\nMandated benefits for demographically-identifiable groups may be expected to affect wages, employment, or work hours [Gruber, 1994]. The PI will analyze administrative data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and available through the New York Census Research Data Center. The proposed analysis will help inform whether US leave policy affects the gender wage gap. The basic data analysis is readily modified to assess other key dimensions of social policy implemented using firm size thresholds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe analyzed maternal labor attachment following childbirth relative to that of fathers using Census Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data and the American Community Survey (ACS) data.   Childbirths were identified in 2001-2014 ACS data.  Labor supply outcome measures were constructed using LEHD Employment History File (EHF). \n\nWe find that mothers and fathers have fairly similar employment trajectories leading up to childbirth.  However, starting two or three quarters prior to childbirth, mothers? ties to the labor market falter.  Moreover, this faltering connection to the labor market is strongly persistent well after childbirth.  The persistence of the effect may be related to the nature of family leave policies in the United States, which are less generous both in duration and compensation than those in many other wealthy countries.  Still, we might expect that the introduction of even relatively rudimentary US family leave protections might allow parents to better combine childbirth with consistent labor force attachment.\n\n \n\nWe therefore considered whether the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 may have been used by parents to protect their employment position during a period of temporary job leave related to the birth of a child.  Because mothers \"taking up\" the leave would differ in other ways from mothers who did not, we exploited a feature of the FMLA legislation that required a firm size of 50 or more employees in order for workers to be eligible to take a job-protected FMLA leave at that firm.  We then compared workers who were \"just eligible\" for a leave (by virtue of their firm?s size) to those who were just not eligible (while controlling for firm size). Previous research on the FMLA was unable to make this \"sharp\" comparison because exact firms size was not recorded in the other datasets analyzed.  \n\n \n\nOur findings on this score were surprising to us.   First, we saw no evidence that firms manipulated or restricted firm size below 50 employees so as to avoid being required to provide job-protected FMLA leaves to their eligible employees (which firms might find costly to provide to workers). More surprising to us still, we saw no consistent evidence that FMLA-eligible leaves increased for employees who were employed at firms at or above the 50 employee threshold around the time of childbirth than those parents employed at firms who were ineligible to take an FMLA leave.  Apparently, this feature of the FMLA eligibly criteria did not have its intended effect of increasing job-protected leaves for personal reasons at larger firms, even for mothers recently giving birth and who seem to bear the brunt of labor market consequences of childbearing.  \n\n \n\nThe faltering connection of mothers to the labor market around the time of childbirth has previously been shown other countries and in other US datasets. Ours is the first to consider the response to childbirth in the LEHD-ACS matched dataset, which offers a substantially larger sample and information on additional features of the employee-firm relationship.   For example, we consider to what extent characteristics of the firm help explain the large deterioration in labor market outcomes for women following childbirth.   These turn out to explain very little of the consistent, gendered labor market response to childbearing.  Indeed, working at a predominantly female-firm or even having firm leader who is female (as proxied by a woman having the firm?s highest wages) does not appear to mitigate the deterioration in labor market attachment for women that persists well after childbirth. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas V Almond"
