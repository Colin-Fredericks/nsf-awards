 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kathleen Morgan of the Department of Chemistry at Xavier University of Louisiana will study the chemical energy content of simple sugars and related compounds.  These data are of significance in helping advance our understanding of how biomass, a renewable and carbon-neutral source of energy and chemical feedstock, degrades into useful fuels or chemical building blocks.  Xavier University of Louisiana is both a primarily undergraduate institution and a Historically Black College with hundreds of science majors.  This project will help train undergraduates with the laboratory and presentation skills needed for future Ph.D. studies or other science-oriented careers.  Outreach activities involving K-8 students are also part of the funded project, with a focus on public schools in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates are ubiquitous in nature, yet there are still major gaps in our knowledge of sugar thermochemistry. In this study, heats of formation will be determined for simple monosaccharides having 2-4 carbons; remarkably, these values are unknown.  A combination of reaction calorimetry, vaporization measurements, and high-level calculations will be used to obtain the heats of formation for sugars and related compounds such as 1,2-diols.  Although high-level calculations can often be used to obtain high quality thermochemical data, the compounds of interest have a large number of important conformations, making accurate calculations far from routine.  The heats of formation determined in this study will be used in conjunction with bond energies determined by collaborators, which afford the heats of formation of radicals that are involved in the degradation of biomass.  Together these data will help move forward our understanding of the mechanism of biomass degradation.",
