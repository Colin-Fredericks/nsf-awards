The CZO-NO will facilitate coordination of research and educational programs of the network of Critical Zone observatories (CZO) and provide a centralized entity, which will represent the network with the scientific community and the public. On behalf of the CZO program, the CZO-NO will coordinate activities like sharing of protocols, cross-science programs, training institutes, and integration with other major research initiatives. To facilitate communications with the scientific community and the public, the CZO-NO will update and maintain a program website and implement an outreach and education plan for the CZO program. The CZO-NO will work with the CZO community to share CZO discoveries, data and research opportunities with the broad community capable of using these data and information. The CZO-NO will provide a venue where scientists, students, and the public can communicate concerning the sustainable future of the Critical Zone.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Critical Zone Observatories CZO program established six sites for intensive interdisciplinary study of the Critical Zone, to better understand the interaction between geology, water, atmosphere, and ecosystems in both natural settings and settings with intensive land use.  The task of the CZO National Office was to provide create mechanisms and a platform to allow those observatories to work together and have broad collective impacts.  The CZO-National Office worked to promote contact among scientists, develop means of hosting and sharing data, provide a forum for discussions of techniques and protocols and identify common challenges.  The CZO National Office also developed scientific foci on cross-site science questions, those that could be best answered by comparing processes across multiple locations.  It also coordinated the development of outreach and educational materials about the individual CZOs and the overall concept of the Critical Zone for the general public and for use in both K-12 and higher education.
