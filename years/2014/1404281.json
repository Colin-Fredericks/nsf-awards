 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the strong nuclear force under extremely high temperature and energy density is one of the key areas of investigation in nuclear physics. The theoretical framework of the strong force is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), whose fundamental particles are the quarks and gluons. These in turn build up protons and neutrons, which are understood to be the low-energy phase of quarks, bound by the strong nuclear force.  At the very high temperatures reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions, the aim of this project to study how protons and neutrons melt into constituent quarks and gluons, which are no longer bound.  This high-temperature phase of nuclear matter is called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy-ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider have produced striking evidence for QGP formation. The field is moving towards a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the QGP.\r\n \r\nGiven this background, the project focuses on the experimental measurement of three distinct thermodynamic properties of this novel state of nuclear matter with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The first property to be measured is the temperature produced in the hottest stages of the collision. This is done via the study of Upsilon mesons, a bound state of heavy \"bottom\" quarks. In the hot, early stage of the collision even heavy-quark bound states, like the Upsilon, are expected to melt in the collision. The group will study the melting pattern of Upsilons and their excited states with STAR and with CMS in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. This measurement will provide crucial information to test models of the deconfinement of quarks in the high-temperature QGP. The second goal is to study the thermodynamic phase structure of the strong force. In particular, testing the existence of a predicted QCD critical point is a key component of this goal. This study is done with STAR by varying the collision energy, and thereby exploring the transition between normal nuclear matter and QGP matter. The third goal is to study the density of the medium using events in which a neutral electroweak boson, the Z0, is produced in coincidence with a quark jet. The Z0 is unaffected by the QGP, providing a clean estimate of the transverse momentum of the quark jet. As the partner jet traverses the dense QGP medium and loses energy, these Z0 + quark jet events are one of the best ways to study the energy loss of quarks.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work are aimed at underrepresented minorities and women. The first is to communicate the excitement of high-energy nuclear physics to Latino students at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), through mentoring activities at the conference and support of the UC Davis SACNAS chapter. The second component is promotion of science and physics to elementary and high-school students through visits to elementary schools with large Latino populations, and via participation in the Adopt-A-Physicist program for high schools. Finally, the PIs in the project will mentor undergraduates, including NSF REU students, every year. A key part of these goals is the mentoring of our own graduate students to become leaders in these activities, since many are women and underrepresented minorities, and are therefore excellent role models.",

And yet solids and liquids can be bound by the subtle electric dipole moments of these atoms. Similarly, neutrons and protons are compound objects made up of quarks interacting through the strong nuclear force also known at the color force. Nuclei are bound by subtle dipole moment interactions between the neutrons and protons.&nbsp; When normal matter is exposed to extremes of temperature and pressure the electrons can be dissociated from their nuclei forming and electromagnetic plasma. Likewise, when nuclear matter is exposed to event greater temperature and pressures the quarks are dissociated forming a quark and gluon plasma. This project aims to study properties of this quark-gluon plasma. The temperature of a electromagnetic plasma can be measured through the distribution of excited states. Likewise, in a quark gluon plasma the temperature can be measured by the distribution of excited states of mesons which are created within the quark-gluon plasma. This project has measured the yields of the upsilon meson and its two bound excited states. The ratios of these states are observed to be quite different in relativistic collisions of lead ion than in similar energy collisions of protons. In proton collisions, it is assumed that the upsilon mesons are produced directly into empty space whereas in collisions of lead ions it is assumed that the upsilons are created inside the hot quark-gluon plasma. The upsilons are produced early in the collision and thus their excited state ratios give information about the temperature of the quark-gluon plasma very shortly after it is created. The second part of this project aims to study the nature of the of phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma state and a state of particles bound by the color force, which are generically called hadrons. Initially the plasma which is created in a heavy-ion collision is very hot, however at the plasma expands it cools and eventually it must freeze out into a gas of bound hadrons. At the highest temperature and densities created in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collide (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there is a cross-over transition between quark-gluon plasma and the dense hadronic gas as most of the hadrons created and very light mesons called pions. These pions are made up of a quark anti-quark pair and are essentially preformed within the plasma. However, for plasma which has an excess of quarks with respect the anti-quarks, the some of the plasma must distill into neutrons and protons. The theory of the color force suggests that for such systems there will be a first order phase transition similar to the phase transition when vapor distills into water droplets. By varying the energy of the colliding ions, one is able to create plasmas which has a varying ratio of quarks to anti-quarks. The Beam Energy Scan at RHIC aims to study heavy ion collisions over a wide range of energies to find the region of energies for which there is a first order phase transition and the region for which there is a cross-over transition. An initial energy scan survey, completed in 2011, suggested that the critical point, which marks the boundary between the first order phase transition and the cross-over transition can be found in heavy ion collisions with a center of mass energy between 20 and 7 GeV. RHIC will run a second more detailed energy scan in 2019 and 2020. In order to maximize the potential is determine the nature of the phase transition several upgrades have been made. The collider has been upgraded with electron cooling of the ion beams to increase the luminosity. The detector has seen three subsystems upgraded: the main tracking chambers have been rebuilt, a new array for forward particle identification has been added, and a new trigger system has been installed. The final upgrade has been the development of a fixed-target program. The collider can not be run for energies below 7 GeV, therefore if nature places the critical point near 7 GeV, as some theories predict and some of the results from the first scan indicate, it will not be possible to observe a change in behavior. To address this challenge, a fixed-target program has been developed to cover the center-of-mass energy range from 3 to 7.7 GeV. This ensures that the critical point will be found if it exists.
