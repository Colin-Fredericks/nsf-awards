 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Roger Rowlett from Colgate University and colleagues Richard April, Catherine Cardelus and Randall Fuller will acquire a TXRF (total reflection X-ray fluorescence) spectrometer.  In general, in a TXRF spectrometer, X-rays are directed to the surface of a material in a process that excites atoms in the top layers thus generating fluorescence. The measurement of the fluorescence in a detector provides information on the material composition. The technique is very sensitive and allows quantification of minute amounts of materials with minimal sample manipulation allowing characterization of complex, heterogeneous matrices. The instrumentation will be used in research and inquire-based laboratories not only in Chemistry but also in Biology and Geology.\r\n\r\nThe award will enhance research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigatiion of beta-carbonic anhy drase (beta-CA) to understand the mechanism of allosteric regulation in this enzyme; (b) understanding the effects of acidic deposition on northeastern deciduous forests of the United States; and (c) studying aluminum toxicity in acid-stressed stream ecosystems.",
