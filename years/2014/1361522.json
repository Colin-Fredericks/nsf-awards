 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students.  Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals.   The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in retaining students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees.  For those students entering the STEM workforce directly from a tribal college, it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology.\r\n \r\nThe overall goal of this project is to model how and why TCUP supported innovations, such as early exposure to research, have contributed to the enhancements of teaching and learning among STEM students in the tribal college.  This proposal builds on prior research conducted in relation to the two TCUP projects conducted at Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC) over the last ten years and addresses key issues concerning tribal college student retention and completion in STEM fields. One of the major findings of the past ten years of TCUP capacity building at the college is that students who are involved with research at the two-year college tend to remain engaged longer in the educational process. The research projects have served as a tool to keep students involved in STEM fields and helped them choose STEM areas for degrees and for workforce placement. The first objective of this work is to increase the number of students choosing STEM majors and continuing in those majors upon transfer to four-year colleges. The Research Engagement Across Curricular Tracks (REACT) project proposed here includes exploring the use of research as a tool for recruitment, retention and success among CDKC students. The second objective is to increase the number of STEM students entering the STEM workforce. The addition of a new Associate of Applied Science degree program to the college addresses this objective and will help students focus their skill sets and fulfill local STEM employer needs. The third objective of this work is to increase number of students choosing STEM majors upon enrollment in the Tribal College. To help accomplish this objective, the college will offer a summer research experience for area high school students. Students will interact with current research and older college age science research interns helping facilitate the transition from secondary school to college STEM programs.",

Mathematics course completion is the ?gatekeeper? for enrollment in science and technology courses. Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC) has learned from previous NSF funding that close integration of research within the classroom is a powerful mechanism for increasing student comprehension of the mathematical and scientific world. We have found that students also benefit from partnerships with other educational institutions. Students are best served when programs integrate local reservation based research with broader research programs at major statewide institutions in Montana.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Impacts</strong> <strong>of this funding</strong> - Partnering with the four year institutions and the local ?feeder? high schools in areas of research, math-science integration and academic course delivery strengthens STEM students beyond the tribal college ?boundary?. Because the checkpoints separating secondary education from community college and then university education are becoming increasingly blurred with ?distance?, ?online?, dual enrollment, and ?Advanced Placement? options for students, the tribal college is positioned to prepare students for a seamless transition from high school to the university degree. At Chief Dull Knife College this has been accomplished by establishing networks of support, exposure to research, and integrated instruction for the student.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through efforts and strategies employed during the TCUP grant, Chief Dull Knife College has seen remarkable results in the area of student interest in, enrollment in and completion of math and science courses. The use of research to expose students to STEM careers combined with improvement of students? capabilities in gatekeeper courses has had a positive effect on students seeking degrees beyond the AA and AS offered by CDKC. The college has continued its efforts to offer research opportunities to students at the state?s colleges and universities, but has expanded research experiences on the reservation at Chief Dull Knife College. Research concepts, processes, and outcomes have been incorporated into science and math course work at the tribal college giving students real world applications of scientific concepts that can be applied in a culturally relevant manner. Northern Cheyenne related research was carried out on germane sites and topics important to the tribe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The college significantly refined the scope of computer-delivered mastery based math courses delivered on campus. Utilizing TCUP developed concepts regarding math delivery and retention of students, the college expanded the self-paced mastery program with huge effects on completion rates and preparedness for science courses and upper level mathematics courses. Increased preparation in mathematics coupled with scientific research exposure resulted in additional choices in all areas of science, technology, and mathematics for the student. Incorporating research into current curricula in science and mathematics has been a major focus of the TCUP projects undertaken at CDKC over the past decade. Students and interns have been asked to take on increasingly complex leadership role throughout the research exposure program. High school students have become models for the younger grades, tribal college students have modeled for high school students and partner university students have provided models for tribal college students. Connecting the campuses together research projects allowed a unique type of mentor/leadership interaction for Northern Cheyenne students. Students involved in research at the tribal college are also able to link with their own siblings and relatives working at university research labs.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Hooker</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583417175_DSCN0418--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583417175_DSCN0418--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students at Lab Table\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583417175_DSCN0418--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Lab Table\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two students enjoying a lab day.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CDKC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;Hooker</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students at Lab Table</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583520257_ipadjuly232019448--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583520257_ipadjuly232019448--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students at MSU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583520257_ipadjuly232019448--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students at MSU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students at Montana State University involved in collaborative research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CDKC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;Hooker</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students at MSU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583605687_IMG_3825--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583605687_IMG_3825--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Water Research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583605687_IMG_3825--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Water Research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student interns sampling Tongue River on the reservation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CDKC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;Hooker</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Water Research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583717940_IMG_7733--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583717940_IMG_7733--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Carroll College Interns\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583717940_IMG_7733--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Carroll College Interns\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interns working with Carroll College upper class-men in Helena, MT.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CDKC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;Hooker</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Carroll College Interns</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583866995_Intern_group_2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583866995_Intern_group_2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interns\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1361522/1361522_10337129_1639583866995_Intern_group_2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interns\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bonding cohorts at summer research opportunities.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CDKC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;Hooker</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Interns</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
