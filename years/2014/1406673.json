 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the understanding of physics required to implement a new concept for optical communication systems with ultralow energy costs. This involves the understanding and use of novel type of physical pattern, called a polariton, which is a pattern of light and electrical energy bound together and is capable of moving through small tubes and cavities in semiconductor chips. Better understanding and use of polaritons is still a great challenge to understand and predict how they will behave. This project will bring together three disciplines of basic science/engineering, in order to develop a better and more unified understanding of how polaritons behave for  communication application. The project involves a collaboration with France, which will provide experimental tests of the new models, and collaborations on theory with Germany and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThe application of polariton patterns for low-energy optical communication devices will have a significant impact on the overall energy savings in electronic systems.  PI intends to write a graduate-student-level text book on nonlinear semiconductor optics,  integrate the outcome of his research into the teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate students? course and train them in interdisciplinary research concepts involving semiconductor quantum wells, excitonic interactions, semiconductor microcavities and exicton polaritons.  The PI further plans to develop MATLAB codes for use by undergraduate students to simulate holographic optical interconnection maps.  \r\n\r\nThe project will bring together the physics of many-particle correlations in exciton systems (including semiconductor quantum wells and semiconductor microcavities), the physics of pattern formation, the mathematical branch of catastrophe theory and the engineering science of communication devices. It will study the basic physical mechanisms that can lead to pattern formation in polariton systems, in particular generalizations of stationary Turing patterns to polariton quantum fluids.  For the initial phase of the project the examples of possible devices include an all-optical switch or transistor and an all-optical controllable fan-out interconnect.",
