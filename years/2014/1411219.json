 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ILSAMP) is a senior-level alliance comprised of universities and community colleges throughout the state and one federal laboratory.  The specific partners include the following four-year institutions:  Chicago State University, DePaul University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Illinois State University, Northeastern Illinois University, Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, Edwardsville),  University of Illinois at Chicago, and Governors State University. Additional partners include five two-year institutions (Harry Truman College, Kennedy King College, Olive Harvey College, St. Augustine College, \r\nWilbur Wright College) and one non-academic partner, Argonne National Laboratory. \r\n\r\nThis project will have four primary objectives.  These objectives are to: (1) develop interventions to bridge the achievement gap by recruiting, retaining and graduating underrepresented students of color in STEM; (2) develop partnerships with 2- and 4-year institutions, school systems, industry, government and veteran affairs; (3) continue international opportunities that will enable students to understand and participate successfully in global science endeavors; (4) continue institutionalization of effective activities begun during earlier levels of ILSAMP. The activities proposed will be designed to accomplish the central goal of increasing the number of historically underrepresented students who select STEM disciplines and persist to graduation from baccalaureate-producing institutions and who are prepared to successfully matriculate in graduate schools or obtain professional positions in STEM. The project will provide students with the academic and professional skills to function at the highest levels of competency.\r\n\r\nILSAMP activities will broaden the participation of historically underrepresented groups, including ethnic and racial minorities in the STEM enterprise, by providing access to research and science programs. The alliance will not only help to close the gap created by the paucity of underserved individuals who are STEM professionals functioning creatively, it will also encourage others who have been reticent to attempt baccalaureate-level science work, e.g., veterans and students with GED education.  Advisory boards and committees will help to broaden the impact of ILSAMP through wide dissemination of project results. Input and assistance will also be furnished by a Technical Advisory Committee, the composition of which provides a connection with the Illinois business community, the public high schools, graduate schools, state and national policy makers and national research institutions. Results of process and impact evaluations combined with internal project assessment will provide insight on effective strategies for fostering student success in STEM and the effectiveness of the ILSAMP model. Findings will be shared at regional and national meetings and through social networking where the foci on underrepresented minority student persistence, performance, and advancement in STEM fields are discussed.",
