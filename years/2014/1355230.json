 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chitons (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) are ecologically important marine invertebrate animals common on rocky shores. They typically have eight overlapping shell plates supplied with numerous sensory organs, which in certain lineages are further developed into tiny image-forming shell-eyes. Chiton shell-eyes are the only eyes known to focus light using lenses made of the calcium carbonate - mineral aragonite. This study will establish how many times, when, where, and how shell-eyes evolved in chitons, employing phylogenetic analyses from DNA for most living chiton species, plus fossils. Chitons are well suited for investigating the origin and evolution of eyes because there is considerable variation in shell-eye morphology that permits comparative studies, behavioral and molecular experiments are feasible, and chiton shell-eyes evolved recently compared to the eyes of other animals. \r\n\r\nThis grant will benefit society because chitons have unique traits including not only mineral-based lenses but also magnetite-coated teeth used for feeding and a robust and flexible form of natural armor that are of interest to the field of biologically-inspired design. Better understanding of chiton relationships will help researchers use comparative methods to study these traits and others. The grant will help develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by funding the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers and fostering collaboration between research- and teaching-oriented universities.",

Eernisse?s (California State University Fullerton) portion of a collaborative grant to use a phylogenomic method known as exon capture to investigate the origin and diversification of those mollusks known as chitons (Polyplacophora) that have shell eyes embedded in their eight overlapping shell plates. More details of the outcomes have been separately submitted by Co-PI T. Oakley (University of California, Santa Barbara), whose lab was responsible for most of the exon capture laboratory methodology and analyses, and Co-PI D.I. Speiser (University of South Carolina, Columbia), who contributed substantially to the project even though Co-PI Speiser did not receive funding directly from this grant. PI Eernisse coordinated the project and obtained appropriate chitons studied with both morphological and phylogenomic methods. We have called the subject of our study shell eyes because these quite tiny but numerous eyes, distributed across much of their dorsal shell surfaces, have aragonite lenses the same common calcium carbonate biomineral found in their shells. Each of hundreds of shell eyes have typical eye structures such as a retina and cornea that experiments have revealed can enable a chiton to see objects such as a shorebird potential predator, whereas other chitons smaller organs known as aesthetes that are still have light sensitive but are incapable of resolving images. Chitons are an ancient molluscan lineage but their shell eyes are not. Although more familiar Mollusca such as snails, scallops, or octopuses are each thought to have convergently evolved eyes, these are generally similarly ancient to the eyes of vertebrates and arthropods, whereas chiton shell eyes are perhaps the most recently evolved eyes for any animal group. We used an exon capture method with about 100 chiton species sequenced for over 300 gene regions to estimate a robust phylogenomic estimate across a large taxon, Chitonina, which includes over half of the more than 1,000 living chiton species. Performing a phylogenomic analysis across Chitonina was necessary because the affinities of one of the genera that have shell eyes, <em>Schizochiton</em>, has been difficult to resolve within Chitonina with conventional sequencing. Even though its shell eyes are similar to those of other shell eye chitons, the affinities of <em>Schizochiton</em> have been difficult to resolve, typically with extremely long branch length. From morphology, this genus is conventionally classified in its own family apart from a subclade within the family Chitonidae, which includes all of the other chitons with shell eyes. &nbsp;However, in the lab of PI Eernisse,&nbsp;<em>Schizochito</em>n was found to share some other shell features with members of Chitonidae besides its possession of shell eyes, so it is at least plausible that shell eyes in <em>Schizochiton</em> and other shell eye chitons are homologous, also present in a shared common ancestor of all shell eye chitons. We were able to test the separate or a single-origin hypotheses for the origin of shell eyes within Chitonina, and our exon capture results strongly support not only a phylogenetic position of <em>Schizochiton</em> well apart from those Chitonidae with shell eyes, but <em>Schizochiton</em> was resolved as sister taxon of all other Chitonina, i.e., the large clade of most living chiton species. We found this to be a surprising result considering the morphological affinities that <em>Schizochiton</em> was found to share with members of Chitonidae, even besides its possession of shell eyes. This is an exciting result but is still subject to the same criticism as for conventional sequence comparisons, such as the potential for genome-wide artifactual long branch attraction. With plenty of setbacks, we eventually did get the exon capture method to work on a non-model molluscan taxon and our results have in general led to a much better resolved phylogenetic estimate for Chitonina. Meanwhile, over 30 Masters or undergraduate students in the lab of PI Eernisse benefitted directly or indirectly from the funding provided by this grant, and these included a high proportion of students from under-represented ethnic groups, especially Hispanic but also African American students. This reflects the considerable diversity at the teaching-oriented California State University Fullerton campus, and likewise a number of Eernisse lab students were first-generation college students.
