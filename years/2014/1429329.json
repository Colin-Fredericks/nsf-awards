 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at the State University of New York at Albany (SUNY-Albany) will acquire a ambient high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer with this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program. Mass spectrometry is a basic tool used by chemists and biological scientists to identify and characterize materials and chemical species. The instrument provides an accurate measurement of the mass and fragmentation patterns as the ions are analyzed in the mass spectrometer.  An ambient ionization mass spectrometer forms the ions outside the mass spectrometer under ambient conditions and usually requires little sample pretreatment.    This important analytical tool will advance the research of students at all levels.  It will also be used to train undergraduate students in laboratory course work. The instrument will be used in the institution's B.S./M.S. Forensic Chemistry program, and an applied MS program in Organic Chemistry which is heavily patronized by students working at area biotech companies.  The instrument will be available to serve educational institutions in the New York State Capital District including six undergraduate colleges. It will also be a resource for the research-oriented Albany Medical College and Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis acquisition will be used in a diverse body of research, especially in areas such as (a) investigations of metal complexation of bowl-shaped heterocorannulenes; (b) synthesis and structural investigations of volatile heterometallic molecular precursors to energy-related materials; (c) tracking of plant-derived volatile organosulfur compounds (VOSCs), and their environmental fate; (d) investigations of fluorinated compounds; (e) developing applications of hybrid nanomaterials for diagnosis and treatment of major diseases; (f) studies of modified RNA systems of both biological and evolutionary significance.",

Several individuals for whom DART-MS data was an important part of their graduate research have graduated and either obtained excellent positions or continued on to graduate school. These include: Dr. Ashton Lesiak (Ph.D. May 2016) who not only received the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Dissertation Award, but also received the Department of Chemistry Award for Excellence in Research, and took a position at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Nuclear Forensics Division; Dr. Paul Savoie (Ph.D. May 2016) who accepted a postdoctoral position with Jean-Francois Pacquin at the University of Laval, Laval, Quebec; Cortney von Hahmann, who earned a MS degree in 2016, and is now a doctoral student at Humboldt University, Berlin; Dr. Cristina Dubceac, who graduated in 2017 and also received a College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Dissertation Award. She recently accepted a position at L&rsquo;Oreal Cosmetics; and Dr. Stephen Kasper, who graduated in 2017, and recently accepted a position at Merck Pharmaceuticals. It should also be noted that the ease of DART-MS instrument operation, together with the fact that the data obtained can be quite difficult to obtain by other means, has dramatically increased the volume of publications as well as the number of conference presentation opportunities that our students now enjoy. This can be seen from the steady increase in both publications and conference presentations that have occurred within the 2.5 years that the instrument has been operational. Over the course of the final year of the project, there were a total of &gt;70 articles and conference presentations that featured experiments involving DART-MS, compared with 34 and 7 in the 2016 and 2015 reporting periods respectively. Another dividend is that the physical resources not only at the University at Albany-SUNY, but also in the Capital District of the State of New York have been enhanced in that the DART-MS is the only instrument of its kind within a 150 mile radius of Albany, NY. Intellectual property featuring the coupling of the DART-MS with a laser ablation system has also been developed.
