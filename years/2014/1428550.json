 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research seeks to advance understanding of how research-based, highly innovative technology tools that support student learning can be implemented in schools in a sustainable way.  This is an important and basically unchartered area of research.  Both public and private agencies and business have invested significant sums in designing and testing technology systems and applications for education.   While exciting and potentially transformative, many of these innovative tools have not been successfully implemented, in part because of a lack of knowledge or theory about what is needed in the schools.   Different designs (e.g. whole unit, replacement units, tutoring systems, etc.) may require different levels of support.  There is very little research on what it takes to implement and sustain technology enhanced educational systems and products that lead to increased student learning.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of case studies, this project will study what is needed to implement three very different types of  digital resources that can be implemented and sustained in schools.  The case studies will focus on technology difficulties, systems integration and pedagogical support.  The findings could have broad impact on the how educational technology is developed and implemented.",
