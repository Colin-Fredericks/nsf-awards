 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Savannah. The R/V Savannah is a 92 foot coastal research vessel, owned and operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.\r\nSince put into service in the fall of 2001, this 92-foot coastal/local class research vessel has proven to be a capable and cost-effective platform for a range of research and education projects. The primary working area for the vessel has been the continental shelf, coastal and estuarine environments of the Southeastern United States. The ship has also conducted cruises that have crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso Sea and as far as Curacao in the SE Caribbean. In 2013, the R/V Savannah completed 111 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 37% (41 days) of the total sailing schedule. In 2014, R/V Savannah is scheduled for 189 days with NSF days accounting for 64% or 121 days of the total sailing schedule.\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\tMooring Deployment /Overboard Handling Gear\t$20,272 \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe R/V Savannah is a 92-foot coastal/local class research vessel owned by the University System of Georgia and operated by the University of Georgia, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (UGA SkIO).  The ship is a coastal/local class vessel within the University National Oceanographic Laboratories (UNOLS) research fleet.  The primary operational range for the R/V Savannah has been the estuarine, coastal, continental shelf and shelf break waters off the US SE Atlantic coast.  Research projects from a range of disciplines utilize the vessel and most of these rely on ship equipment to conduct key project operations.    \n\nThis project, funded through the NSF Oceanographic Instrumentation program, funded acquisition of a set of shared-use equipment that supports mooring operations from the R/V Savannah (acoustic release, transponders, tag poles/lines/clips).  Successful deployment and recovery of moored instrument packages is critical to a number of the research projects employing the R/V Savannah.  As part of the ship\u00c6s equipment inventory, the crew is familiar with this gear, providing operational consistency between various projects and enhancing the safety of these over-the-side operations.  Project operations supported by the R/V Savannah that have used this equipment includes maintenance of buoys that report ocean conditions in near real-time, support of a buoy network that monitors Right Whale activity near shipping lanes (winter calving grounds are off the Georgia coast), and deployment/recovery of a variety of bottom-moored instrument packages.  Observations provided by the latter have included:  acoustic measurements of currents through the water column; time-series records of hydrographic, chemical and optical properties, and water chemistry; and estimates of exchange across the sediment-water interface.  The equipment acquired through this award has extended the depth range for mooring operations conducted from the vessel (to more than 2000 m) and has helped ensure that project operations on the R/V Savannah involving moored instrument packages are conducted efficiently and safely. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James R Nelson"
