 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fragile objects and mission-critical building contents such as hospital equipment may be placed on rolling isolation systems in order to protect them from damage during earthquake event.   Rolling isolation systems consist of a matched pair of horizontal rectangular frames with rigid shallow dishes fixed to their corners.   The dishes in the lower frame are concave up, and those in the upper frame are concave down.   A large steel ball located between these dishes allows the upper frame to roll over the lower frame. The intensity of shaking that rolling isolation systems can protect against is determined largely by the diameter of the steel dishes.  Currently one of the limiting factors for rolling systems is that they can protect objects only from horizontal shaking.  Further, the best bowl shape and the proper amount of energy-damping for a particular application remain open questions.   This award supports research to develop rolling isolation systems that can protect fragile building contents from severe horizontal and vertical motions.   The resulting systems will incorporate specialized components for vertical isolation and multiple isolation layers.   In developing these systems and assessing their promise for earthquake hazard mitigation, this research will lead to a better understanding of the true three-dimensional aspect of earthquake ground motions and their impact on fragile objects and structures.  Ultimately, the proper design and implementation of rolling isolation will ensure that irreplaceable objects, critical hospital and telecommunications equipment, and digital infrastructure will remain operational during and after severe earthquakes, thereby mitigating the costs of these potentially disastrous events.  Research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students will broaden the participation in this research.  An industrial-outreach program will enhance the practical dissemination of the results.\r\n  \r\nThe non-holonomic constraints inherent to rolling isolation systems result in nonlinear coupling between lateral and rotational dynamics. Uniaxial and linearized models are therefore not sufficient to predict the response of these systems.  The objective of this project is therefore to advance the performance and implementation of high-capacity isolation systems for equipment and components subjected to three-dimensional ground-motions. New mathematical models for the nonlinear dynamics of three-dimensional isolation systems will be derived and validated with experiments on a six degree of freedom shake table.  These validated models will accelerate the design of new bowl topologies in order to maximize the effective displacement capacities of these systems.   New methods of seismic hazard analysis will be developed that recognize the three-dimensional nature of ground motions and the threshold-sensitive behavior of buildings and contents.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe protection of valuable objects from earthquake ground shaking can be accomplished by isolating the objects from the vibrations of the floors on which they sit. Objects can be isolated from floor vibrations by placing them on a flexible layer made of foam or rubber, or placing them on rollers. This research focuses on optimizing a rolling isolation system from floor vibrations that occur in three dimensions, two horizontal dimensions and a vertical dimension.\n\nRolling isolation systems have been deployed in thousands of installations as a means of mitigating seismic hazards on fragile building contents. These contents include mission-critical telecommunication components that provide essential services following a strong earthquake, financial data-center systems, hospital systems, and works of art. The use of rolling isolation systems has been very broad because the systems are easily manufactured, but despite the fact that no predictive mathematical model for their behaviors had been developed. The lack of development of these models is for good reason: the dynamics are highly complex and chaotic, involving nonholonomic constraints, impact, and non-linear coupling between response coordinates. Linear models for such systems are of no use in predicting their capacity to protect objects during strong earthquakes ground motions.\n\nThe rolling isolation system considered in this study consists of several pairs of steel plates shaped like shallow dishes. The lower plate is curved upward, the upper plate is curved downward, and a large ball bearing sits between the plates. Three or more of these plates create a platform on which an object can be placed to isolate it from horizontal floor motions. Despite the fact that many rolling isolation systems such as this are in use today, they have not yet been critically assessed for their performance in realistic three dimensional floor motions.\n\nThe vision of this project is to develop a method to tailor the design and implementation of rolling isolation systems so that the degree to which the system will protect contents can be statistically quantified.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this research is the development of mathematical models that represent the three three dimensional behavior of rolling isolation systems, the use of these models to determine the best shape (slopes and curvatures) of the dishes for use in realistic earthquake-induced three dimensional floor motions, and the introduction of novel vertical isolation systems that can be used in combination with the rolling isolation system. The primary challenge in developing these models relates to the coupling of the nonholonomic constraints to the vertical components of motion. A new method of incorporating constraints in this context was developed.\n\nThe primary finding of this research is that the vertical component of floor motions must be accounted for in order to mitigate the risk of earthquake-induced damage in building contents. Additionally, this research has shown that the best shape of the curved dishes is practically flat, and that the dishes must have a layer of rubber to dampen the response. Further, this research has resulted in the design of a simple and novel vertical isolation system constructed of buckled strips of spring steel.\n\nThe broader impact of this research is the potential to improve the protection of the contents of buildings, such as data center components, artistic statues, precision manufacturing systems, and any other fragile and valuable object from breaking due to earthquake ground motions and the resulting motion of building floors. This project has also served to mentor and equip future engineers with the skills to contribute to the engineering workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: HenriPGavin\n"
