 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tohoku (2011), Christchurch (2011), and Canterbury (2010) Earthquakes affected two nations known for their pioneering advances in earthquake engineering; yet both nations experienced extreme levels of destruction. These events are poignant reminders that many lessons are yet to be learned to ensure we can engineer truly resilient communities. Post-earthquake reconnaissance missions are absolutely vital to the experience-based learning process required to advance our understanding of natural hazards and their impact on geotechnical systems. While post-earthquake reconnaissance has provided a wealth of learning experiences, current practices suffer from drawbacks due to inefficiencies in manual collection of large perishable datasets, high costs associated with deployment of teams, accessibility limitations, and safety considerations. Unmanned Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs), using the latest technological and computational tools available, will enable engineers to collect higher quality, more objective, and more extensive perishable datasets on the performance of geotechnical systems during reconnaissance missions.  This project paves the way for the use of UAAV technology for extreme-event reconnaissance of geotechnical systems. The societal benefits associated with UAAV-based post-event reconnaissance are significant and  include more effective learning from disasters abroad before they hit our nation, more efficient post-event responses leading to more resilient civil infrastructure systems, and quicker economic recovery of affected regions.  \r\n\r\nA transformative framework for post-event reconnaissance and decision making is planned based on the use of highly-mobile and sensor-rich UAAVs. Adoption of UAAV technology represents a paradigm shift in post-event reconnaissance because it allows geotechnical engineers to more efficiently collect large, higher quality, and more objective reconnaissance data. The platform will have the ability to also process large collected datasets to (a) automatically detect and map damage features at a regional scale; and (b) generate more accurate 3D maps of surface deformations and geometry using LIDAR-enhanced imagery. In addition, the UAAV's ability to communicate with field-deployed wireless sensors and collect additional site characterization data will be investigated.  Towards this end, the project aims to prove that the UAAV and a network of wireless geophones can execute surface wave measurements to estimate shear wave velocity using weights dropped by the UAAV and characterize conditions to greater depths than currently feasible by reconnaissance teams. The UAAV communication platform will also efficiently disseminate geo-referenced data to a community of experts who can analyze the data and provide expert advice to ground-based reconnaissance teams.",

UAVs can be equipped with various sensors, most commonly optical cameras, and can be deployed in disaster-affected areas to assess the condition of infrastructure. Using ultra-high definition overlapping imagery collected by UAVs, 3D models of affected areas can be developed and used, not only for qualitative assessments, but also for quantitative assessment of infrastructure damage, measurement of deformations and displacements. This is particularly valuable as the geotechnical profession is pushing towards what is known as performance-based earthquake engineering, i.e., design on the basis of expected performance of infrastructure. Key to assessing infrastructure performance is the ability to reliably estimate displacements following an earthquake. The 3D models that are created from UAV-enabled reconnaissance studies have embedded information that is valuable to calibrate or validate these next generation performance-based design approaches. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>3D model creation (3D point clouds or 3D surfaces) is achieved through the Structure-from-Motion technique, which is a digital image analysis and photogrammetry technique. As part of this grant, 3D models of targeted sites following several natural disasters including the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2015 Lefkada earthquake in Greece, the 2016 New Zealand earthquake as well as following floods, and hurricanes were generated. The 3D models are representative of the entire range of geotechnical infrastructure including slopes, landslides, ports, retaining walls, foundations, bridges, roadways, railroads, dams and levees as well as sites affected by fault rupture. The SfM-based 3D models were compared against other established mapping techniques, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) that also create 3D point clouds, and the results were found to be comparable in accuracy and resolution.&nbsp; UAV-enabled SfM 3D models can have cm-level resolution and can cover areas of several square kilometers, thus allowing the collection of better, higher quality, higher resolution data relatively inexpensively. Due to these advantages, the technique is expected to be used widely in geotechnical engineering practice.</p>\n<p>The creation of 3D models is an important advancement. However, many additional scientific opportunities arise from the collection of this data and can advance geotechnical engineering research and practice. The 3D and 2D model outputs can be further manipulated to automatically (or semi-automatically) identify features of interest. For example, identify landslides in a multi-square km area following an earthquake, or cracks along a paved road or other surface. In this study, computational routines for feature identification were developed, with specific emphasis on characterization of rock masses and landslides. Computational routines were developed to identify fractures in rock masses that are then used to estimate the strength and stability of the rock masses.</p>\n<p>Finally, in this grant, the use of UAVs for underground mapping was investigated. UAVs were used to drop a mass (up to 7 kgr) from different heights (up to 60 m) generating stress waves that propagate into the subsurface. The stress waves are captured by sensors that are placed on the ground. Processing of the sensor signal can allow for an assessment of the stiffness of the subsurface to depths of 30 m or more. &nbsp;Thus, this grant highlights the opportunities of automation in characterizing efficiently the surface, but also the subsurface conditions. More research is needed to advance such approaches, but through the efforts of this grant (as well as others) it is clear that automation and robotics will revolutionize geotechnical engineering, will influence the methods used to respond to natural disasters, will improve field data acquisition based on which decisions are made and risk is assessed and lead to enhanced resiliency of civil infrastructure.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/14/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dimitrios&nbsp;Zekkos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238723480_Structure-from-Motion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238723480_Structure-from-Motion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Structure-from-Motion at collapsed bridge site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238723480_Structure-from-Motion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Structure-from-Motion at collapsed bridge site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visual illustrating Structure-from-Motion Methodology of overlapping imagery at the site of a failed bridge due to pier scour in Greece.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dimitrios Zekkos & John Manousakis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dimitrios&nbsp;Zekkos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Structure-from-Motion at collapsed bridge site</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238770248_Picture1-Hawaii--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238770248_Picture1-Hawaii--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UAV inspecting cliffs in Hawaii\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238770248_Picture1-Hawaii--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UAV inspecting cliffs in Hawaii\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">View of a UAV inspecting a steep cliff in the Big island of  Hawaii</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dimitrios Zekkos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dimitrios&nbsp;Zekkos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UAV inspecting cliffs in Hawaii</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238823748_DamFailure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238823748_DamFailure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D model of failed dam and downstream area generated using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238823748_DamFailure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D model of failed dam and downstream area generated using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UAV-enabled 3D point cloud using Structure-from-Motion of a failed irrigation dam in Greece</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dimitrios Zekkos & John Manousakis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dimitrios&nbsp;Zekkos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D model of failed dam and downstream area generated using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238867289_Picture1-Fracturesin3D--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238867289_Picture1-Fracturesin3D--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Overlay of 2D imagery and fractured identified using a fracture detection algorithm for a rock slope in Nepal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1362975/1362975_10319990_1542238867289_Picture1-Fracturesin3D--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Overlay of 2D imagery and fractured identified using a fracture detection algorithm for a rock slope in Nepal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overlay of 2D imagery and fractured identified using a fracture detection algorithm for a rock slope in Nepal</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William W.
