 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new instrument that will be able to measure the frictional properties of rock that is simultaneously subjected to high confining pressure and slipping at rates typical of faults during earthquakes. No machine like this currently exists anywhere in the world.  As with any development of new instrumentation and procedures, there is considerable benefit to a wide range of interested parties if the project is a success. The individuals participating in the project, including an early career scientist, will benefit from the professional growth represented by overcoming the challenges the project presents.\r\n\r\nThe increase in understanding of the physics of the earthquake source made possible by the new experimental capability will benefit many earthquake scientists and lead to a better understanding of the generation of seismic waves, including those producing strong damaging ground motions. Experimental rock deformation has already made important contributions to our understanding of earthquake physics, but critical questions remain that can only be addressed by laboratory experiments. Although there are other ways in which such experiments are relevant to understanding earthquakes, this project focuses on friction, since friction plays such an important role in understanding the occurrence of earthquakes and what takes place at the earthquake source. Gaining this understanding is not only of intrinsic scientific interest, much of the greatest uncertainty in understanding when and why earthquakes occur and the contributions of the earthquake source to damaging strong ground motions is due to our limited understanding of friction on faults.",

Earthquakes involve sliding two sides of a fault at depth in the Earth at slip rates of about one meter per sec, the speed that one walks. However, during the long period of time between earthquakes, faults are either stationary or moving about a billion times slower than during earthquakes, namely at about the rates that fingernails grow. Prior to this project, the only machines that could measure friction by sliding long distances at high speeds could do so only at low pressures, much lower than the real pressures existing on earthquake faults at depth in the Earth. To better understand frictional behavior during real earthquakes it is important to conduct experiments at the actual pressures felt by faults in the Earth and to do this over a wide range of sliding speeds. This new motor and motor-control system allows test surfaces to slide long distances at both high speed and high pressure and is available for use by the research community. It also has the capability of precisely controlling the sliding speed over an astounding billion-fold range of speeds which allow studying the physics of friction during all parts of the earthquake cycle.</p>\n<p>Before the new motor, we had conducted friction measurements by slowly rotating an existing piston in our pressure vessel that rotates the lower member of a pair of ring-shaped samples. The pair of samples are rather like a pair of thick-walled napkin rings stacked one on top of the other, the upper one stationary (Figure 2, right side). The resistance to rotating the lower ring via the rotating piston is a measure of the friction on the experimental fault where the two rings contact on their flat faces. In essence the goal of this project is to rotate the piston over a billion-fold range of speeds with the top speed being at least a meter per second. The first plan was to buy a large commercial motor and motor-control system which would rotate the existing piston via pulleys and belts, the motor sitting off to the side of the piston. This indirect drive system would have involved significant &ldquo;slop,&rdquo; namely would not be as rigid as we wanted, so precise control at low speeds would have been impossible. However, as the project began we discovered that components existed that we could use to build a motor (Figure 1) that would be compact enough that it could fit into the machine (Figures 2 and 3) and attach directly to the piston. This direct-drive arrangement has provided a connection between the motor and our experimental sample which allows us to have high-resolution control of slip on the fault, resolution similar to atomic dimensions.</p>\n<p>The original goal of the project was primarily to allow sliding at earthquake slip rates at realistically high pressures. However, the direct-drive arrangement has also led us to design a control system for the motor position and speed that can precisely control speed over a factor of one billion. This means that with one sample we can explore the entire range of speeds relevant to both the short period during earthquakes and the long period between them. We attained this by combining several different approaches for measuring the position and speed of the motor and sending that information to the motor&rsquo;s power supply in different ways depending on the sliding speed on our fault.</p>\n<p>The new motor and motor control system (Figures 4, 5, and 6) is more complex and more capable than any existing hardware and software. For this reason, the duration of the project extended well beyond the original schedule. In spite of this, we had minimal cost overruns (1%) which we covered with personal funds. We have yet to perform experiments that combine the highest speeds and highest pressures that the system is designed for. However, the equipment is now ready to simultaneously attain them. We plan to gradually use these higher speeds and pressures, being mindful not damage the equipment in the process; other experiments are underway that would suffer in this case.</p>\n<p>The increased capability of our machine will make it an attractive destination for visitors wishing to conduct experiments not possible elsewhere, and it opens the way for developing even more capable machines in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Terry&nbsp;E&nbsp;Tullis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1359596/1359596_10334941_1673131232573_Fig_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1359596/1359596_10334941_1673131232573_Fig_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
