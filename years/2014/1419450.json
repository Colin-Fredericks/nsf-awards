 "awd_abstract_narration": "The four main Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) regions, i.e., the U.S. West Coast, the Humboldt Current, the Canary Current, and Benguela Current, are host to some of the most productive marine ecosystems on the planet. All four are also characterized by large inter-annual to inter-decadal variability and vulnerability to climate change through systematic changes in alongshore winds, upwelling, cloud, and gyre-scale ocean currents. Unfortunately, the evolution of these critical environments over the coming decades has received comparatively little attention. This is partly because their essential characteristics (alongshore winds and cloud shaped by local topography and upwelling ribbons) are only tens of km in width and are not well-resolved by current climate models. In addition, processes smaller in scale than the model resolution mediate the relationship between key ecosystem properties and the physical system, making it very difficult to understand consequences of changes in the physical system for marine ecosystems based on model output alone. In this project the team of investigators will address this gap by undertaking an unprecedented suite of high-resolution regional earth system model simulations. The result of this project will be a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of climate change and its interplay with decadal variability over the coming decades for all four EBUS regions. Members of a cross-disciplinary team consisting of a climate scientist, two oceanographers, a marine biogeochemist and a software engineer will train two graduate students. The project will lay essential groundwork for further study of climate impacts on upper trophic levels and prediction of fish populations in EBUS regions. Moreover, the earth system model development work will lay the groundwork for the scientific community to study higher-trophic-level response of marine ecosystems to climate variability and change. Marine ecosystem variability has profound implications for natural resource management, and it is anticipated that this project will be of great interest to stakeholders and the general public. With the help of an environmental communications expert, the team will develop and execute an outreach effort that includes identification and coordination of stakeholders for the U.S. West Coast EBUS. A stakeholder workshop will be organized where the project team will present their research, and stakeholders will present information needs to the project team. An outcome of the workshop will be a white paper outlining research needs and next steps for marine conservation and management in the context of a changing climate. \r\n\r\nThis project is focused on the future evolution of the four Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS). Three interconnected research themes will be pursued: (1) Air-sea-land interaction at the regional scale, (2) Climate change signals in EBUS regions, and (3) Climate controls on marine ecosystems. A suite of high-resolution regional earth system model simulations will be undertaken. They involve: (1) Historical reconstructions of the variations of the recent past in all four EBUS regions. These reanalysis-driven simulations will be used to validate the regional model against available observations and characterize the substantial variability of the regions' physical and ecosystem states. All sets of experiments will be performed for the U.S. West Coast and Humboldt EBUS regions first, and then the lessons learned will be leveraged to perform the same series of experiments for the two other major upwelling systems. (2) Mid-century future climate simulations for all EBUS regions. These simulations, driven by global climate model (GCM) output, will be used to quantify and understand physical and ecosystem changes due to anthropogenic forcing. They will also be analyzed together with the historical reconstructions to quantify the importance of anthropogenic signals relative to the regions' natural variability, and detect anthropogenic signals in the recent past. To maximize relevance to decadal prediction, the future climate experiments will emphasize the mid-21st-century time frame. However, we will also undertake one experiment focused on end-of-century to have a more extreme climate change signal to analyze. (3) Process evaluation simulations in select EBUS regions. These are also reanalysis-driven, but with key processes disabled. These experiments will allow for a quantification and understanding of the key processes shaping variability and change. The EBUS regions will be compared to one another to understand processes driving upwelling variability and associated biogeochemical responses. The major ecosystem dynamics of interest will include: controls on magnitude and seasonality of upwelling and temperature; controls on magnitude and seasonality of productivity; controls on intensity and spatial scale of hypoxia, and its relationship to circulation and productivity.",

Several regions have been simulated including: the US West Coast, the Southern Africa, the Humboldt Current System (South America) and over the Gulf Stream (North Atlantic) in order to extend our results. Our studies call for a change of paradigm in our representation of the atmosphere-ocean interface. In a recent study, we developed and succesfully tested parameterizations of the atmospheric response to the air-sea interactions.<br /><br />We also developed physical-ecosystem simulations over the US West coast over a long time period (up to 15 years) at various spatial resolution (from 4km to 300m resolution). We first propose a validation of these numerical simulations using both satellite and in situ data. Then, based on these configurations, we assess the importance of fine-scale currents in determining the connectivity and determine the main processes that drive the California Under Current. We also assess the importance of the fine-scale wind on the productivity, the role of fine-scale current in determining the biogeochemical variability and mean state, the role of anthropogenic forcing in determining the ecosystem, and the consequence of climate change on anchovies habitat and productivity.<br /><br />Providing a brief sum up of our main outcome, in air-sea interactions, we would highlight two topics. The first topic lies on the origin and&nbsp; consequences of the slackening of the wind (the wind \"drop-off\") in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. In a series of studies we demonstrated its importance in determining the mean and mesoscale circulation, and, overall, the net primary production (See Drop-off Figure). More importantly, as a second achievement, we would cite our recent work on the mechanical interaction between the ocean surface currents and the atmosphere, the so-called Current Feedback (See Air-Sea Figure), which I summarize as all showing how surface ocean currents affect the surface winds and the ocean in profound ways, one of which is to attenuate small-scale ocean eddies and controlling Western Boundary Currents. We have termed the main effect an \"eddy-killing\" process. Our studies call for a change of paradigm in our representation of the atmosphere-ocean interface.&nbsp; In physical-biogeochemical interactions, we demonstrated the importance of the oceanic fine-scale in determining the ecosystem and the role of the anthropogenic forcing in shaping it (See Habitat Figure). We further highlight the loss of anchovy's habitat due to climate change and how may evolve in the future.&nbsp; The Kessouri et al (2021) paper in PNAS (See Figure PNAS) already had an impact on the skateholder in California as indicated in the OPC' strategic plan : The model is now considered a state-of-the-art global example and has resulted in numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications. In the Southern California Bight, this effort has demonstrated that coastal anthropogenic nutrients, mainly from wastewater treatment plant effluent, are having a significant impact on OAH in this region.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/09/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lionel&nbsp;Renault</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1419450/1419450_10319760_1615281853432_Screenshot2021-03-09at10.00.40--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1419450/1419450_10319760_1615281853432_Screenshot2021-03-09at10.00.40--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Impact of Wind drop-off\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1419450/1419450_10319760_1615281853432_Screenshot2021-03-09at10.00.40--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Impact of Wind drop-off\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Impact of wind drop-off on total upwelling and NPP (See Renault et al., 2016)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Renault, L., Deutsch, C., McWilliams, J.
