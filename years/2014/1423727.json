 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juries are the bedrock of the American judicial system.  Six or twelve people join together in a collaborative effort to arrive at a verdict.  During deliberation, jurors must not only come to a verdict based on the evidence presented during the trial, but they must also remember the evidence.  To a large extent, jurors must rely on their own memory.  Here, the assumption of the Courts is that the collective memory of a jury is likely to lead to a better, more complete recollection than any individual effort.  The difficulty with this position is that there is burgeoning psychological evidence indicating that groups often remember less than the sum of what individuals are capable of remembering.  Moreover, extant research demonstrates that what one person says in a conversation can alter the memory of other participants - by imposing misleading information or inducing forgetting, for example.  Although both types of conversational effects can affect subsequent decision-making, it is possible that, even more critically, both types can be mitigated in certain circumstances.  To this end, the present research explores the way jury deliberation might reshape the memories jurors have of the evidence presented during the trial, the effect any change in memory might have on the verdict of the jury, and the means of mitigating these deliberation effects.  \r\n\r\nThe research involves seven experiments employing a mock jury methodology.  They will examine whether (1) research concerning collaborative remembering applies to jury deliberations; (2) the emergent consensus story of a jury reflects the conversational dynamics consistent with what is known about conversational remembering; (3) the verdict of a jury can be traced to these conversational influences on memory; (4) the conversational influences on memory are a function of the composition of the jury; and (5) ways exist to mitigate these potentially negative conversational effects through instruction or use of mnemonic technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAmerican jurisprudence depends on an effective jury system.  In recognition of their responsibilities, jurors will often seek guidance from the Courts to help them understand what is expected of them and how they might conduct their deliberations.  These instructions might better serve the Courts? needs if there was a full understanding of the dynamics of how the conversations jurors have while deliberating affect their final judgments.  In particular, while deliberating, jurors must remember what was mentioned during the trial.  Although memory is often thought of an individual effort, it rarely is.  Rather it is a joint activity, with the memory constructed through conversational interactions.  To date, the Courts have averred that this joint effort will produce more reliable recollections than might be expected if an individual were remembering in isolation.  As a large body of psychological research has established, however, this is not always the case, at least for everyday conversations.  Although everyday conversations about the past may reshape memories of those involved in the conversation through cueing people to remember what they might have initially forgotten and reinforcing some memories over others, they can also implant misleading memories and induce forgetting.  In some instances, these dynamics might yield a more reliable memory; in others, a less reliable one, indeed, one that might adversely affect the judgment of a jury.  We know little, however, about the extent to which the well-established malleability of memory in everyday life applies to jury deliberation.  Are the stakes involved in determining the fate of an individual such that the adverse effects on memory as a result of conversational interactions mitigated?  Or does the conversational interaction lead to a collective rendering of the testimony that may produce a consensus, but not necessarily an accurate one?\n\n \n\nIn order to address this issue, the funded research examined the conversational interactions of mock jurors.  The mock jurors viewed a redacted version of an actual trial, Bias v. State of New Jersey, and then deliberated to determine a verdict.  These deliberations were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed.  The data focused on what testimony was remembered during the deliberation, how accurately it was recalled, and how the conversational interactions during deliberations shaped both what was remembered during deliberation and the verdict.  At a more basic level, the research produced a greater understanding of how conversations can shape memory.  At a more applied level, the research indicated that the conversational interaction with a jury setting reshapes memory in ways that might not occur in everyday life.  Surprisingly, jurors spent much of their time discussing their interpretation of the charges rather than reviewing the evidence.  The evidence seemed to lurk in the background.  However, when it was mentioned, it tended to elicit, rather than inhibit, related items.  The result was a more complete recollection than might be expected from remembering in isolation.  Such retrieval facilitation is not routinely observed in everyday conversations.  Distortions were rare.  More detailed analysis of how the conversation flowed within the deliberation is still being explored, as is the role of different gender and ethnicities/race in shaping the deliberations.\n\n \n\nThe results of the research underscore how the goals of a jury deliberation can shape the impact the conversation has on the memory of the participants.  Although deliberation did lead to the recall of more details  than might arise if recall occurred in isolation, recall was still incomplete and shaped in part by the conversational interactions of jurors. Courts should attend to the consequence of conversational dynamics when instructing jurors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Hirst"
