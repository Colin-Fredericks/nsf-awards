 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps Site, at the University of Utah Center for Medical Innovation, enhances and builds upon their existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. The Center for Medical Innovation (CMI) at the University of Utah developed as a collaborative effort between The College of Engineering, The University of Utah Health Sciences Center, The David Eccles School of Business and The Technology and Venture Commercialization Program. Their's is an integrated activity that supports faculty and student professional development, develops multi-disciplinary educational programs in medical device entrepreneurship and has the potential to improve national healthcare delivery through commercialization of student and faculty innovations.\r\n\r\nThe I-Corps Site will help bridge gaps and enhance the translation of University-based Innovations to commercialization. This will allow the University of Utah to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of prospective and under-represented participants enhancing the diversity of entrepreneurial teams in the I-Corps program and regional commercial sector. \r\n\r\nThe University of Utah I-Corps Site Grant will enable the University Center for Medical Innovation to facilitate and accelerate the development and commercialization of student and faculty innovations through entrepreneurial education, mentorship and seed grant funding to help bridge the gap between early prototype development and commercialization. These entrepreneurial teams will translate their innovative research ideas through early stage product development into full commercialization resulting in regional economic growth and job creation. This Site's partnership network includes University of Utah programs that support underrepresented student and faculty groups that offer the support and resources needed to help underrepresented groups thrive and participate in the process.",
