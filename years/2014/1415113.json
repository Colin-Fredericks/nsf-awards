 "awd_abstract_narration": "Korean Hanwoo cattle display an extremely high percentage of fat marbling- a phenomenon not observed in other species and a much-desired trait in regards to meat quality. While previous studies have aimed to determine the cause, results have been inconclusive. This project will investigate the cause of this marbling, potentially assisting in the improvement of cattle farming and meat quality around the world through selective breeding. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Heebal Kim at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea. This collaboration affords a unique opportunity to have access to data gathered from a native Korean species that will enable new insights into the Hanwoo genome.\r\n\r\nThis project will use RNA-sequencing to understand the underlying transcriptome make up and regulation behind high fat marbling in the meat of Korean native cattle. More than 80 RNA-seq samples obtained from various tissues and organs of both male and female Hanwoo, including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and omental fat; muscle; liver; brain; and pituitary gland will be analyzed. By aligning the RNA-profile of the fat and muscle of Hanwoo to that of other cattle species, it is possible to identify differentially expressed genes associated with this trait. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",
