 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless communication is one of the fastest growing technologies worldwide creating ubiquitous access to mobile broadband services. The transition from one to several (typically two to four) antennas at both ends of the wireless link, known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), was a key enabler for the growing data rates during the last decade. However, as the demands for data rates on the network are expected to increase by more than 1000x by 2020, novel transmission technologies beyond small-scale MIMO become necessary. This project will leverage recent theoretical results in massive MIMO, which promise that the use of hundreds of antennas at the base-station will enable orders-of-magnitude higher data rates than conventional small-scale MIMO systems. Since existing algorithms and current integrated circuit architectures are unable to sustain the excessive complexity caused by the massive amount of received data streams, this project will jointly consider algorithms and efficient (in terms of cost and power) computing architectures. The project will analyze system trade-offs to develop low-complexity algorithms and corresponding integrated circuits that will enable the capabilities of massive MIMO. Another goal of this project in terms of broader impact is to develop open-access education materials and semester-length courses on algorithms and hardware design aspects of massive MIMO. \r\n\r\nThe computational complexity of existing data detection, multi-user interference suppression (pre-coding), and impairment-compensation algorithms in systems relying on massive MIMO grows super-linear in the number of base-station antennas. Thus, the associated computational complexity prevents the use of these algorithms in wireless systems having hundreds of antennas. To enable massive MIMO in future systems, the project develops a set of novel computationally efficient algorithms for detection, pre-coding, and impairment compensation that can be implemented in dedicated digital very-large scale integration (VLSI) circuits at low complexity and power. The proposed methods will rely on approximate algorithms using series expansions and convex optimization, which approaches optimal performance as the number of base-station antennas increases. Furthermore, novel antenna-selection schemes are developed with the goal of reducing the complexity and hardware costs incurred by the presence of hundreds of base-station antennas. In addition to theoretical analyses and algorithm development, experimental evaluation of the developed baseband accelerators will be conducted on early-stage academic prototype platforms. The results of this evaluation will be used to assess the performance, complexity, and power consumption of the developed algorithm accelerator designs in realistic environments and to identify both the potential capabilities and limits of massive MIMO systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGeneral Summary\n\nThe goals of this project are the design of novel algorithms and corresponding hardware accelerator designs for massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems.  Next generation wireless systems will use a large number of antennas at the basestation to improve performance and efficiency.  Specifically, this project investigates several algorithms including data detection and precoding.  To reduce the computational complexity of data detection, exact and approximate linear and nonlinear data detection algorithms and hardware architectures that can be used in coded and iterative MIMO systems were developed.  To reduce the computational complexity of precoding, exact and approximate linear precoding algorithms and hardware architecture, as well as methods relying on convex optimization were created.  A hardware-based performance and complexity comparison was performed to assess the efficacy of the devised algorithms and architectures in practical systems.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nIn this project several massive MIMO methods for uplink data detection (from multiple users to the basestation) and downlink pre-coding (from the basestation to multiple users) have been created.  The focus has been on numerical methods, parallel algorithms and FPGA architectures.  Related research has also been performed on power amplifier analysis related to digital pre-distortion and dynamic spectrum sharing.  Parallel algorithms on a number of research machines were implemented to study the computational and communication complexity of algorithms for massive MIMO.  With the rapid improvement of both multi-core architectures and graphic processing units, these systems are well suited for the parallel algorithms in massive MIMO systems.  However, there are challenges in the design tools needed for efficient implementation.  Many of the parallel processing environments for supercomputers can be adapted to these problems including the NVIDIA CUDA environment and also the OpenCL, OpenMP, and MPI frameworks.  Several parallel machine at the Texas Advanced Computing Center containing both multi-core and GPU processors were used in this research.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project seeks to enable massive MIMO in practice using novel algorithms and corresponding hardware architectures.  This is an important area which has immediate implications when massive MIMO will be included in future wireless communication systems.  The reference ASIC and FPGA designs of new data detection algorithms demonstrate that throughputs in the Gb/s regime can be achieved at moderate hardware complexity for systems with 128 basestation antennas serving 16 users.  Industry coordination has been with Xilinx, Inc. on FPGA systems and with Nvidia, Inc. on GPU accelerator in massive MIMO systems.  An ongoing Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) team at Rice has been created to study parallel systems called ?Parallel Hardware Applications in Science and Technology (PHAST).?  The VIP team focus is on 5G wireless communications.  Undergraduate and graduate students are using the Open Air Interface software defined radio environment to study system extensions for massive MIMO and to use GPU acceleration for some of the numerical kernels.  The goal of VIP is to develop teamwork and leadership skills through multi-year research projects.  These teams include freshman through graduate students which will have broad impact in STEM fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph R Cavallaro"
