 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aging and tissue death is a normal part of plant growth, but a leaf-feeding moth (Philodoria) has developed an extraordinary life-history strategy: its larvae can delay plant tissue from aging thereby giving the moth an adaptive advantage when food resources are limiting. This phenomenon has helped the insects achieve extraordinary localized diversity and become a major component of island ecosystems. This remarkable process is little understood, but has the potential to transform a broad spectrum of biological processes and increase understanding of the interactions between insects and plants. This project will generate a systematic framework, integrating molecular and morphological data, to revise the taxonomy and test hypotheses on the moth evolution, biogeography, and diversification. \r\n\r\nEducating the next generation of biologists is essential at a time when global natural resources are diminishing. Project participants will teach the importance of biodiversity to the public through workshops and the PIs will train students of many levels (graduate students, undergraduates and high school students). Students, including minority and underrepresented students, will participate in fieldwork and disseminate information broadly via social media. This project will increase public awareness of the need to conserve endemic island biodiversity, including these plant-insect interactions that are important to horticulture and agriculture.",

The Hawaiian Islands are just 0.02% of the size of the United States, but accounts for nearly 70% of the United States&rsquo; historically documented plant and animal extinctions. In all, &gt;360 Hawaiian animal and plant species are listed as either threatened or endangered under the federal and state Endangered Species Acts. More than 38% of native Hawaiian plants are threatened and 94% of Hawaiian insects are endemic. The majority of the moth species in the family Gracillariidae are leaf miners, in which their larvae live internally inside of leaves. There are approximately 70 species of endemic Hawaiian leaf mining insects of which approximately 40 are in the moth genus <em>Philodoria</em>. Because of their close association with native Hawaiian plants, many of these moths are threatened and face extinction risk. <em>Philodoria</em> moths have not been studied in nearly a century, and before the start of this project, it remained unclear how many species still remain in existence. This study examined the evolution and conservation status of these moths, by sampling species on all main Hawaiian Islands. The project examined the evolution of these moths using DNA sequences, host plant information, and biogeography. The ancestors of these moths likely arrived to Hawaii ~23 million years ago, feeding on one of three host plant families, on the now partially submerged North West Hawaiian Islands. The study discovered that most species of <em>Philodoria</em> still remain in existence, although there are at least two species that likely have gone extinct. The project also uncovered that there are seven species new to science. Some species are very rare and are highly threatened and may go extinct unless conservations measures are taken. One minority graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, and several undergraduate students helped collect data in Hawaii. Students of all stages of schooling (high school, undergraduate, graduate students, postdocs) and volunteers from many demographic backgrounds helped pin, label, digitize and curate specimens, allowing them a window into natural history museums and education of organismal biology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/03/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Akito&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Kawahara</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354585/1354585_10288578_1522757561397_P_costalis_sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354585/1354585_10288578_1522757561397_P_costalis_sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Philodoria specimen image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354585/1354585_10288578_1522757561397_P_costalis_sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Philodoria specimen image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Philodoria costalis habitus photo</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akito Kawahara</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akito&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Kawahara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Philodoria specimen image</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354585/1354585_10288578_1522757653080__MG_9259--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354585/1354585_10288578_1522757653080__MG_9259--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Philodoria leaf miner leaf mine\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354585/1354585_10288578_1522757653080__MG_9259--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Philodoria leaf miner leaf mine\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Philodoria leaf miner leaf mine</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akito Kawahara</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akito&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Kawahara</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Philodoria leaf miner leaf mine</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
