 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insider attacks are a critical issue for companies and governments in scenarios involving trade secrets,\u00a0sensitive information, intellectual property, personally identifiable information, classified documents, and\u00a0more. Too many existing approaches for responding to these attacks rely on\u00a0mechanisms that assume the recovery of locally stored, unencrypted data. These techniques fail on the\u00a0growing number of devices that employ file system encryption and cloud storage. This project advances\u00a0novel methods of offering to an attacker's system covert evidence of their attack that may remain after\u00a0primary data and documents are encrypted or securely wiped. The data has precise meaning to\u00a0investigators that is demonstrable in court and to other third parties. The data is obfuscated from\u00a0interpretation by third parties without investigator assistance, and thus is privacy preserving. The long-range outcome of this project will be the enabling of research including: \u00a0generalized methods of attack\u00a0response when the computers involved are outside or partially outside the administrator's control,\u00a0automated methods of discovering channels for offering evidence, and defenses against these\u00a0techniques. Our research is an important stepping stone towards the broader topic of privacy-preserving, proactive investigation of attacks committed using networked computer systems.",
