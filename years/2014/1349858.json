 "awd_abstract_narration": "A New approach to the Archean sulfur cycle from marine carbonates\r\n\r\nBy \r\nJess Adkins, Woodward Fischer\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThe rise of atmospheric oxygen from an originally reduced planet surface is a central problem in Earth history. It is widely believed that the oxygenation of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere occurred in abrupt steps.  The Great Oxygenation Event at the Archean-Proterozoic boundary is one of the better studied of these deep-time jumps, chiefly through the mass independent fractionation (MIF) of the stable sulfur isotopes.  However, most of this evidence comes from the reduced forms of sulfur, chiefly pyrite being enriched in the MIF signal.  The current understanding assumes that the complementary light MIF signal resides in oceanic sulfate at this time, a trace phase in carbonates that has been analytically inaccessible until now.  PIs will use a new MC-ICP-MS method that lowers the current detection limit for sulfate in Archean carbonates by over three orders of magnitude. Micro-drilling of specific textures to unravel the simultaneous evolution of the sulfate and sulfide phases in Late Archean rocks will be used to better understand how it is that the early earth transitioned from an anoxic atmosphere to one with substantial amounts of molecular oxygen.  PIs will collect new outcrop and drill core samples during a field campaign to the Campbellrand Platform in South Africa and make hundreds of new sulfur isotope measurements on these samples.  Their goal is to create a history of seawater sulfate evolution during this key moment in earth history.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have discovered that sulfur cycled on the early earth in a way different than previously reported.  Our isotopic analyses show that microbes were actively generating energy from the reduction of sulfate in the ocean, much the way they do in anoxic sediments today.  During this time of low atmospheric oxygen our data show that SO2 (a product of outgassing from volcanoes) was both photo oxidized and completely photolyzed in the uv rich Archean atmosphere.  After this initial destruction, the isotopes of sulfur recombined to favor heavy masses being incorporated into the oxidized forms (sulfate) that were then deposited in the ocean.  This is the opposite of what has traditional been thought about the Archean ocean?s sulfate reservoir.  Through careful fieldwork and precise sampling in the lab we have shown which textures in rocks are good archives for sulfur isotopes and which are not.\n\nThis work has impacted our field?s ability to measure small amounts of sulfur to high precision for its isotopic variability.  By lowering the detection limit for sulfur, we have opened up carbonate rocks for analysis throughout earth?s history.  This advance will allow many scientists to probe the history of life on the planet.  Our method is better established in this work and is already being adopted by other fields of science to make low level sulfur isotope measurements.  We trained a post-doc and three graduates students as part of this work.  The two senior post-docs/graduate students have found new positions and are continuing their careers in science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jess F Adkins"
