 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\nSoftware development for mission and safety critical systems is critical to the United States economy, national security, and growth. The use of appropriate design, development and testing techniques is particularly important when a system must sustain human life or has the capability to injure humans through mal-operation. This REU experience makes students aware of and begins to get them used to designing, programming, debugging and testing for reliability. Even if students do not end up working professionally on or researching mission critical systems, these same techniques can help prevent software errors which may cause mal-operation or leave the software susceptible to attack and compromise.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site introduces students to the design criteria of mission critical systems. They are gaining hands-on experience working on a real mission-critical cyber-physical system and gaining an appreciation of the importance of design processes. The participating students will visit the nearby Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex, Missile Launch Area (home to the United States but now deactivated, anti-ballistic missile defense system). The participants will be involved in the design of an Open-Source/Open-hardware CubeSat class satellite (Open Orbiter) that has been under development at University of North Dakota (UND). Open Orbiter (OPEN) is a student led effort that is building up the full spectrum of systems required to develop, launch, and manage a CubeSat space mission. In order to test the variety of systems required and provide the participants with hands-on experience of conducting a real mission, the PIs are conducting one launch per year of an Open Orbiter prototype on a solar balloon. This includes the preparation and testing of the prototype, the launch, the recovery operation, and the post mission debriefing. Participants play key roles in all of these aspects. As Open Orbiter uses a Raspberry Pi and four Gumstix computers for the on-board processing, multithreaded programming/parallel programming is required to manage the satellite. In fact, the Open Orbiter system requires development in all areas of computer science, control software (operating system), ground station software and graphics, payload sensor interfacing and data management, mission and spacecraft planning software (task scheduling), software testing (validation), providing the participants with a variety of topics to focus on. At the end of their participation at UND, participants will travel to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where they will be mentored by scientists in the mission and software design groups and conduct a review of their work at UND and a mock mission. They will also tour the facility and learn about the importance of software design systems and processes for past JPL missions.  Finally, as an aerospace system, software development will abide by DO-178B/C (Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification).",

The first year we had thirteen participants (twelve funded by NSF and one funded by the Brazilian government). Of the thirteen we had one African-American male, one Asian-American male, two Hispanic females (one was the student from Brazil), and two Caucasian females. Five of the students came from non-research institutions. The second year we had eleven participants, including one South Asian female, one Hispanic male, and one Middle Eastern male. Four of the students came from non-research institutions. The third year we had seven participants, including two African-American females, and one Hispanic female. Three of the students were from non-research institutions. Several of the students also had stories written about their work at UND in their local media outlets. Including articles in the Knoxville Daily Sun (&ldquo;Knoxville student researches high altitude spacecraft test platform development in North Dakota&rdquo;), Delano Herald Journal (&ldquo;Shoot for the stars&rdquo;), and The Charlotte Weekly (&ldquo;SouthMeck grad could send research into space&rdquo;). Each year during the three-year period, we went on several field trips and enjoyed weekend activities. Our two major field trips were a tour of the cold war sites in Northeastern North Dakota. The second field trip, during the first year, was a trip to the Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites. Along the way, to and fro, we camped; camping was something that few of the participants had ever done. The second field trip, during the second and third year, was a trip to the NASA's Johnson Space Center, by way of Chicago on Amtrak; travel by train was also something that few participants had ever done. While at NASA, Mario Runco, a NASA Astronaut (with ties to UND) gave the group a personal tour, a tour of many facilities that the public are normally not allowed in. While in Chicago, the group visited the Museum of Science and Industry. We camped in Texas on the first trip, but decided for the second trip to NASA we would stay in a hotel. Weekend activities included a trip to Itasca State Park in Minnesota (where the Mississippi River starts), the Fargo Street Fair, local concerts, cookouts, etc.</h1>\n<h1>Intellectual Merit: The research conducted over the three year period involved a variety of topics related to space systems. Topics such as communications security, image processing, image/target recognition, system and software engineering and design, as well as topics relating to the design and fabrication of a CubeSat-class satellite. As space-borne systems are expensive to develop and place into orbit, we also devoted some resources to developing a very low-cost CubeSat-class satellite that would be launched on a solar balloon. The goal was to create a complete system costing less than $400.00. The balloon is made up of 32 garbage bags cut and taped together forming a tetrahedron. The satellite has a frame work made up of 3D printed components. The computer system uses an Arduino computer to manage the both the power conditioning and release mechanism. The main flight computer is a Raspberry Pi. The most expensive part of the entire system is the APRS transmitter that broadcasts the balloon&rsquo;s GPS location throughout the flight. Use of an APRS transmitter also requires the operator to have an amateur radio license (HAM), which several of the participants studied for and earned. All of the designs that were developed for the CubeSat-class satellite that would be launched on a solar balloon (BalloonSat) have been completed and will be put on a publically accessible website in the near future. Finally, thirteen Conference Presentations/Papers were produced, nine Juried Conference Papers were produced, and four Journal articles were produced (of the four, two are pending publication).</h1><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/22/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ronald&nbsp;A&nbsp;Marsh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359244/1359244_10338889_1506087658938_Reagan2015--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359244/1359244_10338889_1506087658938_Reagan2015--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reagon2015\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359244/1359244_10338889_1506087658938_Reagan2015--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reagon2015\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">First year (2015) participants (including visiting student from Brazil) at Ronald Reagan/Oscar Zero Site, Cooperstown, N.D.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ron Marsh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ronald&nbsp;A&nbsp;Marsh</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Reagon2015</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359244/1359244_10338889_1506087733518_Nekoma2015--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359244/1359244_10338889_1506087733518_Nekoma2015--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nekoma2015\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1359244/1359244_10338889_1506087733518_Nekoma2015--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nekoma2015\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">First year (2015) participants (including visiting student from Brazil) at Stanley R.
