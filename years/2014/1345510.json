With recent advances in cognitive radio frequency technologies, there is a strong need for new wireless test, measurement and validation equipment with novel capabilities that are not available in current products. The research objective is to develop a spectrum processor that can perform real-time RF spectrum analysis on digitized data streams with ultra-wide bandwidth and has the capability of operating for cognitive radio frequency and dynamic spectrum access systems. Specifically, it takes advantage of the intelligent adaptive compressive sensing technology to significantly reduce the computational load while preserving the fidelity of spectrum analysis. Anticipated technical results include wide instantaneous bandwidth, integration of spectrum analysis and intelligent RF sensing, real time analysis capability, preliminary RF testing and demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a commercial broadband, high-speed digital radio frequency spectrum processor that will be used in academic, military, homeland security and industrial research laboratories worldwide with applications spanning the wireless communication, radio and television, GPS and other navigation systems. The success of this project will provide novel features to existing products in the market and has the commercial potential is substantial. The development of this technology has also important societal implications due to the wide range of scientific and industrial topics that this technology can be applied.",
