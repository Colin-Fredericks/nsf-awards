This project addresses this basic question, with respect to Myxococcus xanthus, a simple developmental bacterial system.  M. xanthus cells grow in social groups called biofilms, in which the growing cells pool their secreted digestive enzymes to breakdown complex large molecules from the environment.  When nutrients become limiting, M. xanthus responds by activating a developmental program that results in the construction of a multicellular structure called a fruiting body.  Within this structure, a subpopulation of cells forms environmentally resistant myxospores.  This project specifically focuses on determining the molecular mechanisms that promote the formation of myxospores, while other cells either undergo self-destruction or form a different type of cell called a peripheral rod cell. \r\n\r\nThis project tests the hypothesis that the fate of a cell (spore, rod, or death) is determined by how far along it is in the cell division cycle when it encounters the signal to begin fruiting body formation. Experiments are designed to test this hypothesis using molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches.  The project is expected to advance our understanding of bacterial development, molecular signaling, and starvation physiology.  M. xanthus is a representative of a family of pharmacologically important bacteria, whose production of antibiotic, anti-tumor and anti-fungal compounds is tied to multicellular development. This project will continue to serve as laboratory training to graduate, undergraduate and high school students, who will continue with long-term careers in science. Finally this project provides community outreach to a title 1 local elementary school.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur work focused on understanding how chromosomal replication during development of the gram negative social soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus controls the development process.  Previous work had shown that the developmental program required completion of chromosome replication for cells to progress through development.  This strongly suggested that a signaling pathway existed that controlled and monitored the chromosome replication during this process.  Our goal was to identify the components of this predicted pathway. \n\nDeveloping the use of RNAseq techniques we could identify transcriptional profiles of developing cells in bioreactors that we developed using that allowed us to precisely control nutrient levels.  Using this technique, we identified a variety of novel regulatory pathways including one involving the small secondary messenger molecule c-di-GMP.  In conjunction with a lab in Marburg Germany we characterized the role of the gene responsible for its production in development. \n\nIn conjunction with our transcriptional approach to define the pathway that controls development-dependent DNA replication, we also began a genomic and computational approach to the problem, emphasizing the evolution of novel regulatory features to identify and understand the evolution of this novel group of bacteria.  It should be noted that the Myxobacteria is a taxonomic Order within the Class of Deltaproteobacteria.  The Myxobacteria are unique within the Class, primarily encompasses Orders of bacteria that are obligate anaerobes, with small genomes, and relatively few complex phenotypic behaviors.  The Myxobacteria stand out within the Class because they are predominately obligate aerobes, with extremely large genomes, some of the largest of bacteria (up to 15 Mbp) and have complex social and phenotypic behaviors, such as multicellular development.\n\nWe compared the genetic organization within the myxobacteria to understand the evolutionary origins and diversity of the genes involved in constructing the Pili-dependent motility system. We found that these genes are organized as large clusters in one suborder, whereas in the other two suborders, the genes are dispersed throughout the genome.  Based on the genomic organization, the relatedness of conserved proteins, and order of the genes within operons,\n\nwe propose that the genes encoding the Pili-dependent motility system within three suborders of Myxobacteria, evolved independently from different orders within the class Deltaproteobacteria. This independent evolution may have resulted in the two versions of Pili-dependent motility system gene organizations now present within myxobacteria.  Considering a major role for Pili-dependent motility, our findings further proposes the origins and evolution of social motility in myxobacteria and provides a foundation for understanding how complex-behavioral traits, such as gliding motility, multicellular development, etc., might have evolved in this diverse group of complex organisms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mitchell Singer"
