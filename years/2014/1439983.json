The meeting will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics from around the Nation, who will be discussing future directions of research and research challenges in these research areas. The meeting will focus on addressing challenges that need to be overcome in order to advance the field for the next five to ten years.\r\n\r\nAbout 100 attendees are expected to attend, including engineers and mathematicians involved in all aspects of theoretical, computational, and experimental biological fluid dynamics and scientists from adjacent fields including comparative and integrative biology, oceanography, marine science, medicine, molecular and cellular physics, and epidemiology. The American Institute of Physics Publishing (AIP) will publish proceedings from the conference in an open-access format.",
