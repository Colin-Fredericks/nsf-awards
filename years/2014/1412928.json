 "awd_abstract_narration": "The slow-neutron-capture-process or s-process, which occurs in stars near the ends of their evolutionary lifetimes, is a major contributor to the chemical evolution of our Universe, producing roughly half of all isotopes of elements heavier than iron.   The abundances and distribution of these neutron-capture elements in nebulae and stars within our galaxy are not well determined mainly due to a lack of atomic data.  This project will combine theoretical, laboratory, and observational astrophysics to study the s-process in two such heavy elements; bromine (Br) and rubidium (Rb), in order to determine the process and rate by which these elements are synthesized within evolved stars.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the details of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis through the study of Br and Rb, which have been recently been detected in planetary nebulae (PNe), HII regions and the interstellar medium of other galaxies.   The project will compute photoionization cross-sections for the neutral state and first six ions of both Br and Rb.  The calculated cross sections will then be verified through experiments on the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  The new atomic data will be incorporated into the Cloudy photoionization code where it will be used to derived corrections for the abundances of unobserved ions of Br and Rb in astrophysical nebulae.  The Cloudy abundances, in turn, will be applied to high-resolution PNe spectra that were previously observed by the PI.\r\n\r\nThis Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project offers numerous and wide-ranging opportunities to train new scientists with a strong emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented groups into STEM fields.  This will be the first RUI award at the PI?s institution and should help to build the infrastructure necessary to facilitate further faculty-student research collaboration.  The project will communicate its results to the public through public open houses held at the observatory on the campus of the PI's home institution and through public demonstration nights organized through the PI?s department.  The PI gives lectures at local K-12 schools and will incorporated the results of the research into those presentations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAccording to the Big Bang theory, the Universe exploded out of an infinitesimal dot, and in its early years consisted of hydrogen and helium. Somehow, matter clumped together to form stars and galaxies. And here we are -- carbon-based creatures that breathe an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen, living on a planet with a surface of rock and metals. As preposterous as it sounds, there is very strong evidence that elements from carbon to zinc were formed by nuclear fusion deep in the cores of a previous generation of stars. Elements heavier than zinc (\"neutron-capture elements'') were produced by more exotic processes called neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, in neutron star mergers, supernova explosions, or in low-mass red giant stars.\n\nThe chemical evolution of the Universe describes how it changed from its initial hydrogen and helium composition to its current make-up of about 2% heavier elements.  Elements form inside stars (or stellar explosions), but an important question is which stars produce which elements?  The answer matters because of the lifetimes of stars: massive stars (more than about 10 times the Sun's mass) live fast and die young, burning through their fuel in millions of years.  But less massive stars are much more miserly with their fuel.  For example, the Sun has a total lifetime of about 10 billion years.  So knowing which stars produce which elements, astronomers can piece together the answers to questions such as how the Milky Way and other galaxies formed and when life in the Universe could have began. \n\nWhile astronomers have a pretty good idea of how elements lighter than zinc form (with some exceptions, such as carbon), the origins of neutron-capture elements are more of a mystery. Astronomers aren't interested in neutron-capture elements in and of themselves, but rather the information we can learn from them.  It turns out that the abundances of such heavy elements are extremely sensitive probes of the star-forming histories and evolution of galaxies, the interior structure of giant stars, and the details of neutron star mergers and supernova explosions.\n\nBut to properly interpret observations of neutron-capture elements, we need a better understanding of their sites of origin, and that requires determining their chemical abundances in a variety of objects.  Abundance determinations are obtained via spectroscopy, in which the light emitted by a star or nebula is spread into its constituent colors.  At specific wavelengths, absorption (dark) or emission (bright) lines can be seen.  Each element or ion has its own unique spectral ``fingerprint.''  That is, it produces emission or absorption lines at specific wavelengths and therefore can be uniquely identified in the spectrum of an astrophysical object.\n\nAtomic physics lies at the heart of spectroscopy.  Not only do we need to know the wavelengths at which different elements and atomic ions produce spectral lines, but we have to be able to interpret the strengths of those lines.  To do so, astronomers must understand how atomic ions interact with light (which ionizes and excites atoms) and electrons (which collide with atoms and ions in astrophysical plasmas).\n\nIn this project, we determined how high-energy photons ionize low-charge states of bromine and rubidium, and how these same species can be excited by or capture electrons in a plasma.  These processes are called photoionization, electron-impact excitation, and recombination, respectively.  To conduct this research, we performed state-of-the-art atomic physics calculations, as well as experimental photoionization measurements conducted at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.\n\nRubidium and bromine were chosen for our study because they are among the few neutron-capture elements that have been detected in astrophysical nebulae.  Nebular spectroscopy is a new and potentially powerful tool for studying the formation or \"nucleosynthesis'' of neutron-capture elements.  Planetary nebulae mark the deaths of low-mass stars (up to a few times the Sun's mass), and are the stage of evolution following the red giant phase during which neutron-capture elements can be produced.  Moreover, it turns out that carbon (the building block of life, as we know it) is formed in low-mass giant stars in the same layer in which neutron-capture elements are produced.  Therefore neutron-capture element abundances in planetary nebulae are direct probes of carbon enrichments, which are notoriously difficult to accurately determine in ionized nebulae.\n\nBut the lack of atomic data for neutron-capture elements has presented a major impediment for studying these species.  Our project directly addressed this need, producing the atomic data needed to accurately determine  bromine and rubidium abundances in nebulae and in stars for the first time.  \nIn our project, 18 undergraduate students (10 female, and two African American) at the University of West Georgia and University of Montana made substantial contributions to our computational and experimental atomic physics research.  Undergraduate research has been shown to improve student retention rates, and we actively involved students from underrepresented groups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas C Sterling"
