As proposed, the current Frontier Scientist?s schedule of science reporting will be enhanced by a broadcast TV series titled Frontier Scientists to engage a larger viewing audience. A ?Do It Yourself? (DIY) component will help scientists to create their, professional-caliber media that will sustain the publics? interest and feedback in their research. An evaluation regime will insure appropriate quality and depth of communication, throughout the lifecycle of each science story.",
