 "awd_abstract_narration": "Being a mode of collective transport, transit tends to thrive in densely populated areas. In the US, unfortunately, suburb sprawl has made the condition progressively unfavorable for transit development since the 1950s.  To reverse the trend of declining transit use in the US requires a concerted effort of planning, policy-making and engineering. Critical to this effort is to transform the way by which transit systems are designed and operated. In order to succeed in lower density areas where traditional transit systems fail, the next-generation transit systems must better interact with passengers, more closely cater to their demands, and operate efficiently to minimize costs.   This award investigates a new kind of transit system called the CybeR-Enabled Demand-Interactive Transit system that takes into account these needs.  The knowledge and insights gained from this project benefits the design and implementation of next-generation transit systems.  The proposed evaluation framework, including a smartphone-based transit routing and data-collection tool, offers a platform to engage transit users, agencies and students. The passenger GPS traces collected in this project will form a large crowd-sourced database of high-fidelity transit demands that does not exist today. This wealth of the new data source will benefit researchers, policy-makers and practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to create theories and methods to characterize, analyze, operationalize, and evaluate the CybeR-Enabled Demand-Interactive Transit system. This system can be viewed as a hybrid system that integrates traditional fixed-route service and demand-responsive transit. The research activities are organized under three interwoven thrusts. The first thrust addresses the characterization and strategic design of the proposed system. The second thrust investigates mathematical problems arising from the need to operationalize the system which are: (1) the vehicle routing problem that determines the on-demand vehicle itineraries according to passenger requests; (2) the tactical design problem that coordinates schedules and adapts services to demands; and (3) the trip planning problem that generates optimal trip guidance for passengers using a data-driven and simulation-based framework that is based on a discrete-event simulation platform and a smartphone-based transit trip planning application known as TransitGenie. Different system designs and operational policies will be evaluated using case studies, which will be created from synthesized transit supply and demand data obtained from open sources and local transit agencies. TransitGenie will be instrumented with the ability to collect de-identified GPS traces from its users.",

CREDIT can be viewed as a hybrid system that integrates traditional fixed-route service (FRS) and demand-adaptive services (DAS) transit.  The main features of the CREDIT system are described below.\n\nDAS connects FRS stations to passengers? origins and destinations, and can only be used through reservation arranged either a priori or in real time.  DAS may be operated directly by transit agencies, by a third-party operator (e.g. a dial-a-ride firm), or via outsourcing to Transportation Network Companies like Uber.\nPassengers may request a DAS service to board and alight at specified checkpoints through various interfaces (e.g. a mobile app, a web portal or an automated phone service).  The interface will present a few trip options generated by the Trip Planner. These options may have different pickup points, starting times, paths, and prices.  Once the passenger selects an option, the system commits to the selected service.   \nEach on-demand vehicle is assigned to feed one fixed-route transit line or operate within a designated zone. The exact itinerary of each DAS vehicle is generated by on-demand router according to the confirmed requests.  To be efficient, each vehicle?s service area must be restricted and optimally configured. Unless their desired origin and destination checkpoints happen to locate in the same service area, passengers are expected to transfer to FRS at regular stops. \nReal-time information, such as location and projected arrival times of any transit vehicle, is collected and distributed via displays at stops, web portals, mobile apps and text messages.   The Trip Planner will continuously monitor such information and update the trip guidance throughout the journey.\n\n\nThis project develops new theories to explain the working mechanisms of CREDIT systems and to guide their strategic designs.  It also creates a suite of mathematical models and algorithms for tackling challenging operations problems arising from CREDIT.  In particular,\n\nNew routing strategies and novel algorithms are proposed for finding optimal journey plans in real-world transit networks with partial online information and realistic headway distribution.  These mathematical tools forms the foundation for the Trip Planner module in CREDIT.\nConceptual models under idealized conditions are developed and analyzed, which enables the research team to examine various design options for the CREDIT system.  A novel line-based CREDIT system called Demand Adaptive Paired-Line Hybrid Transit (DAPL-HT) was first developed.  The unique feature of DAPL-HT is that it operates the demand-adaptive service with a stable headway to cover all stops along a paired fixed-route line.  It was found that DAPL-HT outperforms the existing systems (fixed route and flexible-route systems) under a wide range of demand levels and in various scenarios of input parameters.  DAPL-HT is also found to compare favorably with a more traditional zone-based design, which operates DAS vehicles within a zone surrounding stops.  The impact of different route structures on the efficiency of CREDIT is also investigated in this project and the findings suggest that a pure radial route structure has a slight advantage of the grid route structure. \nTo evaluate CREDIT, a discrete-event simulation model is developed and test using NetLogo3, a multi-agent programmable modeling environment.\nTo perform detailed CREDTI design, model and solution algorithm are proposed and tested for (1) a bi-modal (auto vs transit) traffic assignment problem and (2) a transit routes design problem. \nPossible integration/collaboration between transit agencies and the Transportation Network Companies (TNC) are examined.   Transit agencies around the world is now struggling to position themselves in the competition with TNCs.  CREDTI provides a decision-support framework that can be used to guide them. In particular, the team has analyzed trajectory data of vehicles for public transportation, particularly taxis.  Since taxis compete fiercely with TNCs in recent years, studying TNC-taxis market dynamics helps understand the roles TNCs plays in shaping the future of mass transit.\n\n\nThe project has so far produced nine journal publications, a software tool, case studies created from real-world data sets, and teaching materials related to hybrid transit.  The work has also been broadly disseminated through numerous invited talks, presentations at international conferences and outreach efforts.  Four PhD students (including a visiting PhD student) and a postdoctoral researcher have received research trainings through this project.  One PhD thesis is completed based on research related to this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yu Nie"
