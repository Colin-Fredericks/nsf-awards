 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an historical study of changing definitions of \"intelligence\" during the 20th century. The project focuses on debates about IQ in the US from 1945, just after World War II, through the 1970s. It will result in a critical intellectual history that focuses on changing views among psychologists on intelligence and cognitive ability. Most of the historical scholarship on intelligence and IQ has focused on the period prior to WWII when attention was given to quantifiable nutritional and socio-economic factor believed to shape intelligence. Following WWII, a new approach emerged that gave attention to influences that were certainly a part of the environment but not easily quantifiable, such as the beliefs of parents, teachers and learners about a given learner's potential. This project will explore the conceptualization or construction of intelligence as a more broadly conceived debate about both epistemic and personal worth. The project will provide a new perspective and historical focus that will result in a welcome contribution to an area that has not received and is very deserving of attention.\r\n\r\nThe project not only aims to tell a new story about the development of intelligence studies but also wants to demonstrate how the new approach shaped educational policy at a national level. As a result, it will be both timely and important in terms of its relevance to current issues of standardized testing and other related educational challenges. Tracing connections between levels of policy, theory and educational practice will serve to enhance the relevance of this study for contemporary debates.",

Thus my analysis has addressed: 1) the theorization of intelligence within psychology, 2) continuities between psychology, federal-level legislation, and school-place testing, and 3) the influence of broader Cold War/Civil Rights-era contexts on all these developments.\n\nThis National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (award #1431314) has made possible research at an array of archives housing the papers of key actors in my historical inquiry.  Specific collections examined: Anne Anastasi, (Center for the History of Psychology, OH), Benjamin Bloom (University of Chicago), Urie Bronfenbrenner, (Cornell, NY) Kenneth Clark and Mamie Clark (Library of Congress, DC), Robert Coles (Michigan State University), James Bryant Conant (Harvard University, MA), Cynthia Deutsch and Martin Deutsch (Deutsch residence, Maplewood, NJ), ETS documents (Harvard University, MA in Conant collection), John Flanagan (Center for the History of Psychology, OH), John W.

Indeed, this research effort has yielded nearly 25,000 digitally captured pages of highly relevant documentary evidence from 9 different sites, and has worked to advance both prongs of the NSF merit criteria: intellectual merit and broader impact.\n\nI have recovered a rich repository of archival documents that pointedly addresses the questions and research aims of my dissertation.  These materials have validated my joint thesis that 1) scientific constructions of intelligence were tightly bound to and deeply influenced by perceived social and political needs in my time period, and that 2) measured \"intelligence\" was heralded during the Cold War years as a presumably more fair and objective&mdash;and thus less prejudicial--differentiator of worth and educational opportunity.\n\nIndeed, ideas about individual differences in \"intelligence\" worked&mdash;often implicitly--as a powerful political and rhetorical tool that could be used to 1) weaken rural-conservative resistance to increased federal involvement in local and state-run school systems, 2) ease white middle class fears about \"race\" and school integration in the early years after the Brown v.

I have combined this reading of psychologists\u00c6 and policy-makers\u00c6 materials with a wide range of testimony from Congressional hearings for the National Defense Education Act to show that these multiple and particular rhetorical uses of \"intelligence\" worked continuously and in mutually supportive ways across these bodies of thought.\n\nNSF funding has also allowed for the recovery and analysis of a new strain of discourse that followed from and was powerfully propelled by psychologists\u00c6 recommendations and NDEA mandates.  This new discourse, produced in great volume across a range of media and literatures (specialist and popular), worked to construct the category of the \"academically talented\" and \"gifted\" child.  Yes, the idea of the \"giftedness\" is indeed an old one, but it was repurposed in ways very specific to this time period, and it was reimpressed at this hist..."
