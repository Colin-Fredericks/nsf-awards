 "awd_abstract_narration": "Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds of 195 mph.  The storm surge was several meters high and came and dissipated quickly. The inundation reached 1 km inland in some places. Thus, there is potential for extensive seawater contamination of coastal groundwater.  Countless rural coastal villages are dependent on coastal aquifers; these villages might have to contend with the long-lasting effects of seawater contamination of groundwater.  The PI team established a 150 m long shore-perpendicular transect to investigate the physical and chemical dynamics associated with infiltration of the seawater through the vadose zone and its fate in the aquifer. Using electrical resistivity (ER) tomography, they will track the saline seawater that has now sunk a little bit below the water table and appears to be following postulated groundwater flow paths towards the sea.  The scientific objective is to improve our understanding of the physical and chemical processes occurring in coastal aquifers after inundation by seawater due to storm surges.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by EAR/HS and ISE/GVF",

Through flood mapping, groundwater measurements, geochemical analysis, geophysical observations, and modeling, we documented the impact of Haiyan?s up to 7 m storm surge in one small village on Samar island and the contamination of critical coastal aquifers with seawater. We found that the sole-source aquifer used by the residents of the Barangay San Antonio was contaminated by up to 15% (by volume) seawater, and anecdotally the villagers report that the water was impacted within a few hours of the surge event, leaving the village without a local water supply.  Even groundwater in an underlying deeper aquifer was contaminated immediately after the storm, but we also found that the salinity decreased significantly after only 6 months.\n\nBased on geophysical measurements, examination of the shallow soil and water table dynamics, and numerical modeling, we found that the surge injected about 1 cm of pure seawater into the soil, and this percolated down to the water table within a few weeks of the storm.  The modeling also suggests that the amount of seawater that enters the soil zone is not strongly correlated to the surge height as the infiltration capacity of the surficial material is immediately exceeded and only a small amount of seawater can enter.  This layer of seawater mixed with the fresh water at the water table, and then sank through the aquifer due to its higher density, going down a few meters after a year.  Based on modeling results we anticipate that this layer of salt water contamination will continue to sink, mix with freshwater, and be slowly flushed out to discharge in the ocean over the next 10 years.\n\nHowever, these results do not explain the almost immediate contamination of the deeper aquifer, the rapid flushing of the very salty water pumped from more than 10 meters below the land surface, or the geochemical dynamics that we have documented.  Based on our geochemical analysis, spatial mapping of surge height and contamination intensity, and an understanding of the basic physics of groundwater flow, we propose that seawater was directly injected into the deeper aquifer through the more than 330 hand-pumped shallow wells used by the village residents.

After 18 months many of the wells had significantly freshened, but were still just above drinking water standards (equivalent to about 1.5% seawater mixed in aquifer water), and there appears to be a plateau in improvement probably due to the reversal of ion exchange processes and the co-mingling of each of the 330 miniature plumes of salt water that are slowly being flushed out to sea.\n\nWhile there has been substantial short-term improvement in water quality, the modeling results suggest that the deeper aquifer remains vulnerable to the infiltration of the overlying seawater lens that is slowly percolating through the shallow groundwater zone.  We anticipate that the actual water quality in each well will be variable over time due to the slow flushing of the deep contamination, the reversal of ion exchange reactions, and the slow arrival of the overlying shallow contamination.

Surficial contamination cannot be mitigated, but the deep injection of seawater through wells could potentially be mitigated through pre-event well maintenance, event-triggered well protection efforts, or post event rapid pump-out of the injected volume of seawater.  These efforts may help to ensure a reliable source of drinking water in the critical days immediately following a disaster event.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meinhard B Cardenas"
