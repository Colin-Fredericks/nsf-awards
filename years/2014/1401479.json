For the simplest variation we consider, imagine an infinite d-ary tree (the root has d children, each of which has d children, and so on).

Serguei Popov asked a simple question about this process in the early 2000s: will all particles wake up eventually? Of course, there are infinitely many particles, so at no time will all of them be woken. But for any particular particle, will it be woken up eventually? This question remained entirely open until my collaborators Christopher Hoffman and Matthew Junge and I showed that in fact, the answer depends on d: On a binary tree (d=2), all particles eventually wake with probability 1. On the other hand, when d is 5 or higher, some particles remain asleep forever. (The cases d=3,4 remain open.)
