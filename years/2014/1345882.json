 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need to improve the state of the art in efficient air disinfection by introducing a novel disinfection reactor developed around an optimized proprietary optical design in conjunction with an engineered suite of wavelengths delivered by Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes (UV LEDs). Despite the numerous benefits of LED based units, high UV LED costs currently restrict the commercial viability of UV LED based Air Disinfection units. Dot Metrics Technologies is proposing to develop a 10X to 20X cheaper disinfection unit by dramatically improving efficiency of the disinfection unit. This will be accomplished by creating an optimal optical design solution to air disinfection.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is project is immediate and long-term. Over 1.7 million healthcare associated infections (HAI) occur annually in the U.S. alone with an overall annual direct medical cost of HAI to U.S. hospitals ranging $28.4 to $33.8 billion. Drug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms that cause HAI is a growing problem. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging worldwide as a community acquired infection, and M. tuberculosis, which is known for its significant airborne transmission potential, has also become multi-drug resistant. As drug treatments grow increasingly inadequate against airborne pathogens, innovative, engineered UV disinfection systems such as the proposed solution may be one of the few remaining means to resolve the problem. In addition, increased use of mercury free UV technology will results in reduced hazardous environmental risks, and reduced costs associated with hazardous materials disposal.",
