 "awd_abstract_narration": "In terrestrial communities, grazer-facilitation of fungal disease in plants has been studied for over a century. Despite the prevalence of this interaction in terrestrial systems, it was not considered relevant to the structure of marine plant communities until the investigator's recent work in salt marshes. By manipulating both grazer and fungal presence, he demonstrated that snail grazing and subsequent fungal infection in live grass led to drastic reductions in plant growth and, at high grazer densities, destruction of canopy. If grazer promotion of fungal disease in marine plants is not limited to marshes (as suggested by preliminary data from a world-wide survey of 4 marine plant ecosystems) then small grazers that take small bites out of plants could be exerting similarly strong, but undetected control over marine plants globally. In addition, since physical stress commonly reduces plant immune responses, intensifying multiple stressors associated with marine global change could intensify and destabilize these unstudied grazer-disease-plant interactions. To test the global generality of this potentially keystone ecological interaction, this project will answer the following questions with a combination of multi-site surveys and manipulations across 4 ecosystems spanning 2 continents: 1) Is grazer facilitation of fungal disease in marine plants a common but overlooked interaction? 2) What is the resultant impact of grazer-facilitated fungal infection on marine plant growth? 3) How do multiple stressors impact the strength of grazer facilitation of fungal disease in marine plants? The work represents a transformative step forward in our understanding of plant-grazer interactions in marine ecosystems as it fills a > 100-year intellectual gap in our understanding of top-down control in marine plant ecosystems: Do small grazers commonly facilitate fungal disease in marine plants and does this interaction suppress plant growth?\r\nEvidence for this cryptic, yet powerful mechanism of grazer regulation of marine plants will compel marine ecologists to reevaluate our understanding of top-down control and lead to widespread integration of disease dynamics in marine food web ecology.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of marine plant ecosystem health are far-reaching for humans, since these communities provide many essential services. Results from this study will allow managers to better predict effects of disease and global change on marine plant systems and formulate effective strategies for conservation. To help integrate plant disease dynamics into marine ecology and conservation, the investigator will: (1) produce an edited volume on Food Webs and Disease in Marine Ecosystems and (2) work closely with The Nature Conservancy to incorporate findings into their global marine learning exchanges. In addition, an integrated educational plan will increase student: (1) understanding of disease and food web dynamics in marine ecosystems and (2) consideration of marine science careers. This goal will be accomplished through class development and early student exposure to field-based learning and independent research. Over the past 3 years, the investigator has organized a successful undergraduate marine field course at UF. He will enhance its curriculum by incorporating new lectures and laboratories based on food web disease-plant interactions. He will expand this integrated educational effort to high school students by engaging students that are excelling (boy scouts) and at-risk (low grades, attendance) in hands-on, field science and potential career opportunities through: 1) a two-week field class with integrated web support, 2) mentored summer research on marine plant disease and 3) presentation of results at the Marine Symposium initiated at UF in 2008.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project was provided by the Biological Oceanography Program, Ocean Science Education Program, and Office of International Science and Engineering Americas Program.",
