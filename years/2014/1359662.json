 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes Geometry Conference 2014 will be held at the University of Notre Dame on April 26-27, 2014. The conference will feature a diverse range of topics in geometry and topology, although a common theme is the study of geometric and topological structures using partial differential equations. The conference will feature seven speakers, who are experts on different topics, ranging from the Ricci flow and Kahler-Einstein metrics, to gauge theoretic invariants of knots and symplectic manifolds. The conference will expose graduate students and early career researchers to new developments in these different areas.\r\n\r\nThe Great Lakes Geometry Conference has been held annually in the Great Lakes region, and this conference will be the 13th in the series. The use of partial differential equations in geometry and topology has produced many spectacular advances, for instance the solution of the Poincare conjecture and understanding the topology of four dimensional manifolds. The conference will draw together seven well-known experts on a diverse range of topics in geometry and topology, who use techniques either directly or indirectly related to partial differential equations. We expect that a large number of graduate students and junior mathematicians will attend from Midwestern universities and beyond, and we encourage the participation of women and members of other under represented groups. In addition to exposing early career mathematicians to recent advances in geometry and topology we hope to foster interactions between different areas.\r\n\r\nThe website for the conference is: www.nd.edu/~gszekely/GreatLakes",
