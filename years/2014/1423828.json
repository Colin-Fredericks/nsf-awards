The project pays attention both to the level of education and school-leaving credentials (i.e., diplomas, degrees, and certificates) and to fields of study within these levels.  It then analyzes the strength of the link between specific educational outcomes and specific occupations.  The research is novel in applying recent developments in multigroup segregation research to the measurement of the strength of linkage between school outcomes and occupations.  It uses these techniques to study the pattern of linkage between school and work across a set of countries which differ both in the structure of their educational systems and in the ways that education and training are linked to occupational entry via licensing, apprenticeships, internships, and other formal or informal skill requirements or opportunities for skill acquisition while on the job. It then addresses the question of whether country differences in the structure of school-work linkage produce country differences in the relative pay of occupations and in the overall structure of wage and earnings inequality.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research  lies in its potential to significantly increase knowledge of how the structure of linkage between education and the labor market varies, both at different levels of the educational system and across different types of national educational systems. The project employs data from six important countries: the U.S., Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. To test hypotheses, the project utilizes segregation measures from the generalized entropy family of segregation meaures.  This approach allows an assessment of the relative importance of educational levels and fields of study within levels to the total linkage strength of a country.  It also allows a study of the extent of country differences that are structural and the extent of country differences that arise from (compositional) differences in the distribution of educational outcomes and occupational positions across these countries. The research will be novel in determining the extent to which fields of study provide clear pathways to jobs at different educational levels and how the pattern varies cross-nationally. It will highlight routes involving specific fields of study and tertiary credentials whose value in the labor market differs considerably across countries. Such information is of scientific importance for explaining differences in wage and earnings distributions, career mobility, and educational attainment across countries.  It also points to potentially important social policies to better realize the potential of varying educational routes within the differing social and economic institutional structures under study in this project. This research product is of particular importance in the U.S., where completion rates in American higher education are relatively low. The research may also improve harmonized educational schemes now widely used in comparative research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project has developed a new way to conceptualize and analyze the pathways between schooling outcomes including field of study and the labor market, meaning specifically the occupational destinations of workers as a function of the level and field of their education. Existing research in the social sciences on this topic has typically either taken a macro or a micro approach.  Studies with a macro approach have taken countries as units of analysis and have studied how the \"returns\" to educational attainment vary systematically with country-level characteristics of a country's educational or labor market institutions.  Studies with a micro approach have focused on the returns to educational attainment or to educational fields of study.  A literature exists on the effects of \"match\" or \"mismatch\" between a worker's education and his current job.  This literature recognizes that educational outcomes and occupations need to be studied in relation to each other, but it typically takes a micro approach, i.e., outcomes for individual workers are theorized to depend on the quality of the \"match\" or \"mismatch\" between skills and jobs.  When the matching approach is applied in a comparative context, studies typically characterize countries in terms of often ad-hoc \"macro\" country-level characteristics. \n\nOur project, in contrast, has called attention to the fact that \"structure\" is sub-national as well as national, that pathways between the educational and occupational system are structured, and that this structure varies across countries and over time in the same countries.  We have developed a consistent method for measuring linkage and comparing it across countries and over time by using multi-group segregation measures that can be rigorously operationalized and that have attractive decomposition properties.\n\nWe find that the structure of linkage between educational and occupational outcomes affects worker outcomes in the labor market and also modifies the effect of individual skills on labor market outcomes.  This finding has important scientific as well as policy relevance. A recurring question in public and scientific debates is whether occupation-specific skills enhance labor market outcomes. Is it beneficial to have an educational degree that is linked to only one or a small set of occupations? In comparative analyses of France, Germany, and the United States, we find that workers have higher earnings when they work in the occupations that best link to their particular educational level and field of study, but that the size of this earnings boost depends on the structural alignment between educational credentials and the labor market. Generally speaking, workers do better not only when they individually are well matched but when their field of study has more predictable pathways to specific occupations.  Moreover, we find that strong linkage between educational outcomes and occupational destinations reduces unemployment risk. \n\nOur research shows that the predictability of occupational outcomes for specific educational credentials is not simply a function of the skills characteristics of particular educational outcomes; the strength of pathways varies depending on how they are institutionalized.  This malleability is visible in the cross-national variation of linkage strength between educational outcomes and occupational destinations.  Our findings provide evidence against often-made arguments that countries with loosely structured educational systems have more flexible labor markets and produce better labor market outcomes for workers.  They also demonstrate the potential to improve the coherence of pathways between school and work and thereby improve the quality of labor market outcomes for workers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas A Diprete"
