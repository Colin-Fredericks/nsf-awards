 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to design, develop, operate and analyze the results of a CubeSat mission named Electron Losses and Fields Investigation (ELFIN). The mission is designed to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for removing high-energy electrons from the Earth?s radiation belts through precipitation into the upper atmosphere.    Electrons at very high energy (near the speed of light) are part of the radiation environment in near-Earth space that poses a danger to satellite systems and instruments.  The amount of radiation is highly variable especially during solar and geomagnetic storms known as space weather.  It is governed by a delicate balance of acceleration and loss processes none of which are well understood at present.    ELFIN measurements will provide unique observational evidence to help understand the physics behind the loss mechanisms at play. \r\n\r\nBeyond its impact on radiation belt physics, ELFIN aims to demonstrate that major breakthroughs in our understanding of the space environment can result from low-cost missions with meaningful student and young researcher participation. The project will form part of an effort to develop an inter-disciplinary program of education surrounding microsatellites. ELFIN will be used as an educational vehicle for dozens of undergraduate and graduate students from Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Earth and Space Sciences (ESS), either being employed on the project or receiving independent study credit.  Outreach to local K-12 schools will be conducted as part of on-going efforts at UCLA. The project also builds on an established collaboration with the Aerospace Corporation on-going CubeSat development program. Components will be purchased through a subcontract to Aerospace, and mentorship will be provided by named participating collaborators at Aerospace.  The project is also receiving partial support from NASA?s Low Cost Access to Space (LCAS) program. \r\n\r\nThe ELFIN cubesat is specifically designed to provide the first pitch-angle resolved, high energy-resolution measurements of relativistic electron fluxes in the loss cone, extending to the high energies critical for understanding radiation belt dynamics.  It will carry an energetic particle detector, measuring 50-500keV ions and 0.1-5MeV electrons and a flux gate magnetometer, which will be located at the end of a 0.75m extendable boom. Both instruments are miniaturizations of instruments developed by the PI and the proposing team for several previous NASA and DOD missions. The proposed measurements of electrons within the loss cone as a function of energy and pitch-angle will be examined and compared to recent theoretical predictions to determine whether the precipitation bears the characteristic signatures of resonant scattering by electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves or is due to other processes.  In this way, the project aims to provide a crucial test of equatorial pitch angle scattering by (EMIC) waves as a leading candidate for radiation belt electron losses.",

In particular, whether electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are the primary scattering mechanism or other waves are responsible for the losses. The 3U CubeSat carries a magnetometer on a boom normal to its long axis (Fig. 1) and is spinning stably about an axis perpendicular to the long 3U dimension and the boom. The spin plane is controlled to be on the orbit plane, and thus from a polar orbit the spin plane contains Earth&rsquo;s magnetic meridian to within ~15deg when crossing the auroral / subauroral zones where energetic particles are predominantly scattered and lost to the atmosphere. Thus, as it spins, ELFIN is able to measure the pitch-angles of the particles (angles to the magnetic field direction) from near-zero to near-180 degrees. This allows ELFIN to measure the flux of particles precipitating to the atmosphere (along the field), and compare it to the flux of particles that are trapped in the radiation belts (perpendicular to the field), and from their ratio determine the rate of particle loss through wave scattering. Different plasma waves are implicated in the scattering. At energies between 0.5-2MeV EMIC waves are thought to be responsible. They create a pitch-angle signature in the precipitation spectrum that should be visible and recognizable at low altitude. The goal of ELFIN is to measure this signature and ascertain the presence of EMIC waves, alone or combined with other waves (such as chorus and kinetic Alfven waves) which may be operating at the same time. Conjunctions between ELFIN and other, equatorial spacecraft (THEMIS, MMS, Van Allen Probes, ERG) are expected to either confirm the findings with supportive evidence of direct waves measurements at the equator, or complement ELFIN&rsquo;s investigation should the picture be more complex than anticipated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The project was funded jointly by NSF and NASA. The ELFIN team proposed to NASA&rsquo;s CubeSat Launch Initiative and was placed on the Educational Launch of Nanosatellites 18<sup>th</sup> ride (ELaNa XVIII) which was a rideshare with the IceSatII prime mission on a polar (94deg inclination, 450km altitude) orbit for initial launch date of Aug. 2018. A launch slip by a year (revised launch date: September 15, 2019) allowed NASA to approve an option for delivery of a second identical CubeSat proposed by the ELFIN team, should time and funding were available. The objective of the second satellite was to distinguish between spatial and temporal ambiguities of energetic particle precipitation. The second satellite (ELFIN-B) was launched together with the first (ELFIN-A) thanks to additional NASA funding. ELFIN-B follows ELFIN-A by 6500km currently, drifting away at 0.06m/s (the drift rate is increasing with time). The revised 2-satellite mission received continued funding by NASA for satellite operations through the end-of-mission which are expected to be through February 2021.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The two ELFIN satellites are performing nominally. The team first focused on calibration of energetic electron data from the EPDE (energetic particle detector for electrons) instrument. Data for 3 storms have already been captured (Figures 2-5), and are fully capable of addressing minimum science objectives. All data captured are already on-line (<a href=\"https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/elfin-science/\">https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/elfin-science/</a>). Science operations (at least for one instrument, EPDE), has started as of August 20, 1019. Fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) calibration to reveal the EMIC waves when they manage to propagate to low altitude is still on-going, but data are being collected and will be processed once calibration is done.
