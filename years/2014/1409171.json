 "awd_abstract_narration": "ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) awards focus on transforming an entire institutional setting to be a more equitable academic environment for women scientists. Oregon State University (OSU) will create an equitable work environment for women and others from traditionally underrepresented groups through a series of new and unique programs.  These programs will focus on educating university faculty and administrators about how gender, race/ethnicity, and social class combine to disadvantage women in academic Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The centerpiece will be a new program called Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) where faculty will be educated on how gender-based inequality in the workplace can be removed through changing our behaviors.  Activities aimed at recognizing and reducing discrimination of women and underrepresented groups in STEM can be used at other universities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of OREGON STATE ADVANCE is to transform the institution's climate, structures, and relationships to create an equitable and just workplace.  OREGON STATE ADVANCE will institutionalize supportive policies and processes and revolutionize understandings, relationships, and practices by fostering greater comprehension of the roles difference and power play in social institutions.  Progression toward this goal will be guided by three major objectives: (1) Recruit, retain, and promote more women STEM faculty across the majority of OSU's Colleges by building upon established initiatives and implementing new policies and programs that will lead to a significant increase of women STEM faculty at OSU; (2) Recognize the importance of gender's intersections with race/ethnicity, social class, and other axes of oppression in affecting women's lives; (3) Develop OSU's Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) faculty development program to provide targeted educational opportunities for STEM faculty and administrators.  Theorists have developed a well-defined understanding of systems of oppression.  OREGON STATE ADVANCE operationalizes these theories within an effort to transform the institution through changing behavior, relationships, policies, procedures, and structures. Additionally, researchers have found that \"sense-making\" activities further institutional transformation. This project will examine the impact of utilizing systems of oppression theories as a way of helping administrators and faculty understand the ways difference, power, and privilege construct institutional experiences, disadvantaging women in STEM fields.  Additionally, the project assesses the effects of understanding oppression on institutional transformation and an improved climate for women in STEM.  In very tangible terms, the availability of OREGON STATE ADVANCE individuals and teams to lead DPD seminars at other institutions and the provision of summer institutes and online support resources offer an opportunity for widespread influence for the project.  Additionally, the development of a peer-reviewed online ADVANCE journal will further disseminate ADVANCE findings, as well as other research on women and other underrepresented groups in STEM.",

The signature program within OREGON STATE ADVANCE was a 54-hour, two-week, immersive seminar for senior faculty and administrators across the university who had, as part of their responsibilities, a commitment to faculty success. The seminar asked participants to engage in personal reflection about their own location in relation to power and privilege, and it challenged them to examine how their disciplines/units have been constructed in ways that reproduce hierarchy and dominance. One hundred fifteen people completed the seminar over four summers. The underlying theory for the seminar was a systems of oppression perspective with strong emphasis on intersectionality. At the end of the seminar, each participant submitted an action plan proposing changes they would lead in their units that challenged structural inequities and could result in more inclusive and just policies and practices. The ADVANCE team engaged in annual follow-ups with participants to document their work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The most impactful action plans were those proposed and implemented by department heads and dean-level personnel. These individuals held positions that allowed them to change the policies and practices around hiring and retaining faculty. Actions included, but were not limited to, requiring the use of Search Advocates (individuals trained in inclusive search and selection processes) for all searches, requiring search chairs and department heads to be certified as Search Advocates, working with faculty and administrators to articulate their commitment to equity and inclusion in their position descriptions and holding them accountable for these commitments, and restructuring promotion and tenure committees so that they better represented the diversity among the faculty. The result of these efforts was an increase in the gender diversity within all STEM colleges. Data show that 23% of tenure-line STEM faculty in 2014 were women. This increased to 27% by 2017 and to 29% in 2020. The largest gains were in the colleges of Agricultural Sciences, Engineering, and Science. &nbsp;From 2014 to 2020, percentage increases in women STEM faculty were found at the assistant (31 to 41%), associate (22 to 31%) and full professor (21 to 24%) ranks, suggesting improvement in both recruitment as well as retention. [See the accompanying Tables]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As part of the broader OREGON STATE ADVANCE program, a research project was designed to evaluate the ADVANCE seminar's effectiveness in empowering and motivating institutional leaders and faculty members to contribute to campus climate transformation. Recruited participants were administered pre- and post-seminar surveys and completed pre- and post-seminar interviews. In addition to the structural changes noted above that resulted in greater diversity among STEM faculty, we found that faculty and administrators found the seminar useful when facing personal challenges. For example, data from post-seminar interviews with women participants revealed ongoing experiences with microaggressions that left them feeling dismissed and/or professionally suspect as competent scientists. After completion of the seminar, participants shared a variety of responses to microaggressions from individual to structural strategies. Women felt more confident in their ability to interrupt oppressive situations and identified the value of the seminar in creating a supportive community. Women who held positional authority were able to use their new knowledge and relationships to transform policies and practices in the STEM academic environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In addition to efforts focused on local institutional transformation, OREGON STATE ADVANCE created an online, peer-reviewed, open-access journal that provides a forum for sharing scholarship related to broader efforts concerning inclusion, equity, and justice in higher education, particularly in STEM. The <em>ADVANCE Journal</em> (<a href=\"http://www.advancejournal.org\">www.advancejournal.org</a>) published its first issue in 2019. In addition to general issues that include research articles, data reports and invited narratives, the online format of the journal allows for special issues that call attention to timely events affecting the academic workplace.
