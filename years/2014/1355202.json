 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last century, a large number of neural circuits in the brain and throughout the body have been described. These neural circuits mediate such critical functions as perception and behavior.  However, we understand much less about the genes involved in building these circuits. This project will use a unique fluorescent marker to visualize synaptic contacts between specific neurons in live nematodes, allowing us to advance our understanding of neural circuit formation by investigating the role of a conserved cell surface molecule. The broader impact of this project is to encourage students to develop critical thinking skills through the use of the scientific process. Toward that goal, the project will include direct participation of undergraduate and Master's-level researchers; mentorship of a community college professor in genetics research during the summer; and development of modules for a new course, which will include data\r\ngenerated by this research project. In addition, the PI has and will continue to actively seek to increase participation of underrepresented minorities and women in science through these activities.\r\n\r\nMuch is known about early steps in neural circuit formation, including the migration of neuronal cell bodies and axons to the correct regions of the body. Much less is known about how neurons recognize the correct partners from the many potential partners they may encounter in a target region. This project will utilize the trans-synaptic split-GFP based marker, NLG-1 GRASP (Neuroligin-1-mediated GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners), to visualize synaptic contacts between individual neurons of interest in live animals. NLG-1 GRASP, together with a circuit-specific behavioral assay to assess synaptic function, will be used to characterize the novel role of a conserved receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) in synaptic partner recognition. Further work will determine which domains are required for RPTP function. Finally, genes that function with this RPTP will be identified and studied, with the goal of elucidating a\r\nnew synaptic partner recognition pathway. The primary intellectual merit of this research is advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the specificity of neural circuit formation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFinal Outcomes Report\n\nThe nervous system is a system of interconnected cells in animals that mediate critically important functions such as perception, behavior and thought. Cells in the nervous system called neurons link together into circuits during development, and it is these circuits that carry out different functions.  For example, olfactory circuits allow animals to smell, motor circuits allow animals to move, etc.  While we know a great deal about how these circuits function in mature animals, we know comparatively little about how these circuits form.  One step we know very little about is how individual neurons recognize the correct partners with which to form neuronal connections, called synapses, during neural circuit formation.  We call this step synaptic partner recognition.  Neurons that send signals at synapses are called presynaptic cells, while neurons that receive signals at synapses are called postsynaptic cells.  If synaptic partner recognition is not precisely controlled, neural circuit formation would fail as would the critical functions that they regulate.  Our goal in this project was to identify key genes that regulate the process, and understand how they work together to achieve synaptic partner recognition.  We have approached this by studying a microscopic round worm called C. elegans, which has a nervous system very similar to that of humans at the morphological and molecular levels. Our work has identified a critical role for the clr-1 gene in synaptic partner recognition.  clr-1 is a member of a conserved family of molecules called receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases.

Understanding this new mechanism by which synaptic partner recognition is mediated bring us one step closer to understanding the logic that regulates the immensely intricate and critical development of the nervous system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miri Vanhoven"
