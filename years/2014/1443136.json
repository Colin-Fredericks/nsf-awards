This workshop will explore mathematical tools for addressing these needs. The workshop will also address the ongoing concerted effort to create practical solutions and new technologies based on these mathematical developments.  The workshop will be open to all potential participants, and the findings (including videos of presentations) will be distributed to the public for comments and engagement. This award will support students to attend the workshop, and the PI will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds. The mathematical tools that will be considered include integer lattices, elliptic curves, bi-linear and multi-linear maps, codes, and computational learning theory.",
