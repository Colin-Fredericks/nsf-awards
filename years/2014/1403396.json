 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores uncharted regimes of 'strongly correlated matter' (matter which behaves notably differently from what one would expect based on knowledge gained by studying only the constituents in isolation) by pushing the experimental state-of-the-art in atomic physics, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. In addition, the group actively collaborates with theoretical groups to develop frameworks for understanding these novel tools and complex systems.  The project focuses on the diversity of quantum many-body phases that may arise from the unusual properties of the element dysprosium under the influence of specialized excitation by laser radiation.  This program will build the experimental capability to seek these phases using the successful machine assembled under a prior NSF CAREER grant for laser cooling and trapping dysprosium. The research concerns physics and technical skills that find application in a variety of significant areas of technology, most notably lasers and photonics for telecommunications and advanced novel solid-state materials for electronic devices. The research provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student education in a state-of-the-art laser lab. \r\n\r\nSeveral groups have realized a synthetic magnetic field using alkali atoms either in traps or in optical lattices as well as one-dimensional spin-orbit coupling. Spin-orbit coupling in a Bose gas can lead to superfluid phases with stripe order and a rich phase diagram. These achievements announce an exciting new frontier for exploring quantum many-body physics in quantum gases, connecting to existing phenomena and challenges in condensed matter systems.  The group aspires to pursue brand-new phenomena barely, or perhaps not at all, realizable in the solid state by employing high-spin quantum gases of dysprosium atoms.  Dysprosium (Dy) offers several advantages for realizing unusual, strongly correlated states and exotic spinor phases beyond those phases widely discussed in the context of utilizing dysprosium?s large magnetic dipole moment. The large spin and narrow optical transitions of Dy atoms should allow for the generation of synthetic magnetic fields one order of magnitude larger than those in the alkalis, but with considerable reduction of the heating rate. Consequently, creating quantum Hall states in Dy may be more practicable than in the currently employed alkali atoms.",

This program built the experimental capability to seek these phases.  Theory work by our group and collaborators supported the project to generate a large synthetic magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling via Raman coupling with very low spontaneous emission in this non-S-state atom. \nThis grant, ending July 2017, supported research involving the first generation of synthetic gauge fields in Dy as well as studies of dipolar collisions and Feshbach resonance spectra in this system.  Observations of novel hydrodynamic effects in Dy, specifically the anisotropic expansion of a thermal dipolar Bose gas, were made, among other studies.  \nSpecifically, we accomplished the following tasks:\n\nThe first measurement of Dy Feshbach resonances\nThe experimental observation of universal inelastic dipolar collisions\nThe first BECs of 162Dy and 160Dy \nThe first long-lived spin-orbit-coupled dipolar Fermi gas using Dy\nThe first observation of the anisotropic expansion of a dipolar thermal Bose gas\nThe direct observation of dipolar scattering in the halo of atoms arising from collisions of two Dy BECs \nThe first observation of an ultra-dense spectrum of Feshbach resonances in an atomic gas using fermionic Dy at large field\nIdentification of a \"tune-out\" wavelength in the scalar polarizability of ground state Dy near the 741 nm transition.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Lev"
