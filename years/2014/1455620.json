SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has over 300 attendees. \u00a0It is co-located with two smaller workshops, ALENEX (Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation) and ANALCO (Meeting on Analysis of Algorithms). \u00a0SODA is attended by researchers from all over the world. \u00a0The field of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.\r\n\r\nThe award will provide partial support to approximately\u00a0twenty students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging.  Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups.",
