The conference will be held July 6-11, 2014, in Boston, MA.  This year, the SBC will be held in conjunction with the 7th World Congress of Biomechanics (WCB).  Both the Summer Bioengineering Conference and World Congress of Biomechanics are highly regarded conferences with excellent technical content and offering ample networking opportunities.  Features of the conferences include plenary lectures, student competitions, and cutting-edge presentations and posters that are peer-reviewed.  The Scientific Program Committee and the thus far scheduled Keynote Speakers include nationally and internationally recognized experts in the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine field.  \r\n\r\nThis year, a Symposium Focused on Neural Functionality Failure Analysis and Augmentation will be initiated.  This Symposium will be organized jointly by the ASME Design, Device, & Rehabilitation and Tissue & Cellular Engineering Technical Groups, and it will address the challenges posed through the Obama administration?s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative.  Funded students will be specifically encouraged to attend this Symposium, which enhances the scientific content of the conference and offers attendees, including students, the opportunity to be exposed to this exciting and challenging area of research.  Conference attendees include engineers and scientists from various disciplines.  Thus, the conference enables exchange of ideas among scientists with different backgrounds and serves an important cross-fertilization role.  The conference organizers pay special attention toward increasing participation of students and young investigators, women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities with targeted efforts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary aim of this proposal was to provide an opportunity for students to attend the conference so as to energize these future researchers and offer them opportunities to experience emerging biomedical technologies that apply across disciplines and to enhance their professional development at the 2014 SBC/WCB. \n\nOn July 6-11, 2014, this conference was held in Boston, MA.  The organizing entity was the World Council of Biomechanics with collaboration from the American Society for Mechanical Engineering (ASME) Bioengineering Division, the American Society of Biomechanics (ASB), the Canadian Society for Biomechanics (CSB), the European Society of Biomechanics (ESB), the International Society for Biomechanics (ISB), the Australian and New Zealand Society of Biomechanics, the Asian-Pacific Association for Biomechanics, the Global Enterprise for MicroMechanics &amp; Molecular Medicine, and the German Society of Biomechanics (DGfB).\n\nOver 4200 delegates attended the 6-day meeting.  There were 440 podium sessions with 4 &ndash; 6 papers each, over 2150 posters (divided into five poster sessions), and 16 plenary sessions.  This is the largest ever conference focusing on the area of biomechanics.  Attendees came from around the world &ndash; representing 58 countries from North America, Europe, Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. \n\nThe $5,000 in NSF funding supported the effort to offer reduced registration to students.  Early registration for regular attendees was set at $500 for the meeting (including an opening reception, 2 lunches, and a banquet).  Early registration for students was set at $325, and included all of the benefits of full registration.\n\nStudents continued to be an important part of this conference.  Over 1700 students attended the conference and participated fully in the scientific program.  ASME-BED sponsored a highly successful Student Paper Competition, which was divided into BS, MS, and PhD categories.  Over 1000 abstracts were submitted for this competition, including over 700 at the doctoral level.  All abstracts were reviewed by at least 3 reviewers to select the finalists for the on site competition.  The 700+ doctoral submissions were reviewed to select 36 finalists for podium presentations.  33 students received awards that included cash prizes (BS &ndash; 6; MS &ndash; 9; PhD &ndash; 18).  In addition, the NSF supported an Undergraduate Design Competition through a separate grant, which featured 6 finalist teams.\n\nThe overall assessment of the conference by attendees was that it was a success.  The next World Congress of Biomechanics will be held in 2018 in Dublin, Ireland.  The ASME Summer Bioengineering Conference (SBC) has now become the independent Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport Conference (SB3C).  The 2015 SB3C was held in Snowbird, Utah, at the end of June.  The 2016 conference will be held in National Harbor, MD, from June 29 through July 2.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michele J Grimm"
