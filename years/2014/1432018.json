 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborators at North Seattle Community College (NSCC) and Central Washington University are developing a model for institutionalizing an interdisciplinary and research-based curriculum.  The project goals are to (a) provide progressive and innovative STEM curriculum that significantly improves preparation of diverse student populations for upper level courses and careers in science, (b) establish the foundation for a Pacific Northwest Collaboration focused on excellence in STEM education at the community college level, and (c) make a significant contribution to the body of knowledge regarding our understanding of how students think, learn, and problem solve in a research and interdisciplinary context early in their college experience.   \r\n\r\nThe \"thinking is valued\" framework, in which developing thinking dispositions within and across disciplines is seen as the key to academic success, is embedded in the curricular changes envisioned.   The collaborators will use undergraduate research and interdisciplinary experiences as vehicles to cultivate meaningful thinking opportunities in the first and second years of the college experience.  Formative and summative evaluation will address three questions (a) Does the project provide evidence of new \"habits of thinking\" from students and faculty who participate in the interdisciplinary and research-based STEM curricula? (b) Does interdisciplinary and research-based curriculum enhance teaching practices and student learning outcomes? and (c) Is the project reaching other community colleges and universities?  A combination of faculty/administrator review panels, student classroom assessment, student/faculty/staff interviews, and institutional presentations will be used to document, analyze, and update project findings.  Dissemination of new materials and results will impact a wide range of educators through direct partnerships with practicing faculty, a web presence that serves to distribute curriculum, and presentations at national meetings throughout the duration of the project.",
