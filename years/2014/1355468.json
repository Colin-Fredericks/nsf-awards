 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to conduct a geophysical survey of the Hawaiian arch to characterize crust and mantle-mantle boundary (Moho) structure for one of three (and, by most accounts, the leading) candidate sites for the international Moho drilling project. This project is a collaboration with JAMSTEC, the Japanese cience funding agency. Almost all funding for this project is coming from JAMSTEC. The PI?s are seeking ship time and funding for an expedition to recover ocean bottom seismometers deployed at the beginning of the project. Of special interest is whether or not there is evidence for magmas related to the nearby Hawaiian Islands hot spot having been injected into the region of interest. If so, this will be an unsuitable site for drilling. Of more general scientific interest will be the reference section established for mature fast-spread ocean crust and characterization of crustal warping related to loading by the Hawaiian Volcanos. The seismic data will be immediately provided the data to the Academic Seismic Portal and, hence, to any investigator who wishes to further interpret or process the data. Graduate students are involved in both shipboard work and data analysis. This is a US contribution (at very moidest cost) to a large, highly visible international project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe used the R/V Marcus Langseth to deploy five Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBS) on the Pacific Plate NE of Oahu, Hawaii in August, 2018.  The R/V Kairei of Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) fired airgun shots along a ~1000 km long NNE-SSW line over the OBSs.  The OBSs were then recovered by the UH group using the R/V Kilo Moana in September/October.  We confirmed that all five OBSs received and recorded the airgun shots.  Reflections from the airgun shots were also recorded by a 6000-m hydrophone array on Kairei, providing regional subsurface data.\n\nThe 2D reflection data are being processed at UH (pre-stack migration) and at JAMSTEC (post-stack migration) to enhance reflections from the Moho horizon in preparation for IODP drilling.\n\nWe also collected and processed multibeam bathymetry data during the OBS deployment and recovery cruises that will be used to help guide future drill sites.\n\nThe crustal thickness deduced from preliminary analyses of the refraction data was typical for oceanic crust, which suggests that magmatic underplating does not occur, at least in our survey area, although the crustal seismic velocity may be influenced by flexure of the lithosphere on the arch.
