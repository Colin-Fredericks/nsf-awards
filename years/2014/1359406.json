The program uses a three-pronged design of mentoring, networking, and professional development using known best practice to support women and underrepresented minorities throughout (and beyond) the program.  Participants can choose from a wide array of interdisciplinary research projects with applications in soft matter, biomaterials, nanomaterials, opto-electric materials (including solar applications), and thin films.  Participants will be closely mentored by research-active faculty who have strong extramural funding and experience in the supervision of undergraduate research students. Activities will connect participants with peers, graduate students, and faculty within AiMM and to scientific professionals at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) and industry.  The program culminates with AiMM students participating in Annual Summer Research Symposia at both UC Merced and LLNL. \r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL PART:\r\nParticipants will be selected primarily from four year and community colleges that provide few opportunities for undergraduate research experiences.  Housing and meals will be provided in on-campus facilities, and each student will receive a stipend to cover additional expenses.  Professional development activities include active participation in faculty-led group meetings, formal and informal discussions (e.g. during weekly research seminars), and workshops on research ethics, graduate school and fellowship applications, writing personal statements, and oral and poster presentations.  These activities, in conjunction with the opportunity to participate in a cutting-edge materials research project, are designed to prepare the participants for the next steps in becoming an independent researcher in the materials field.  Contacts will be maintained with participants after their summer on the UC Merced campus as part of an assessment plan designed to measure and improve the effectiveness of the program.",
