Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities). The Conference has grown in recent years and attracts over one-thousand participants. Covering all the major areas of atomic, molecular and optical physics, this conference series is of outstanding importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the United States. This Conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. In addition, a one-day graduate student symposium in conjunction with the conference has been organized to introduce students to cutting-edge topics in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.",
