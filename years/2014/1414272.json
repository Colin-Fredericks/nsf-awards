The INC10 meeting brings together some of the world's most renowned and technologically advanced researchers to exchange information and ideas on nanotechnology, nano-optics and nano-electronics.\r\n\r\nElectronics, a two-trillion-dollar enterprise, has been the major enabler of the computer, communication and consumer industries throughout the 20th century, and has propelled the growth of the global economy for last several decades. Most of the building blocks of these industries will reach fundamental limits by the end of the next decade. It is of fundamental importance that these limits are overcome in the next 10 years, possibly through the use of devices enabled by nanotechnology. The meeting (INC10) will provide an important forum for discussion and dissemination of relevant information to young scientists and researchers.",
