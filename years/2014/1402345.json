Examples include allergic reactions, wound healing, and cancerous transformations. Even when many \"identical\" cells are exposed to the same conditions in a laboratory, some respond faster; such differences are clues to understanding how an entire process unfolds, and perhaps how medicine can influence it.  Unfortunately, most methods of measuring cellular responses have one of the following limitations: (a) they only calculate averages over many cells, (b) they measure each cell only once, or (c) they inject chemicals that alter the cells' function.  In this project, a new microscope system will be built without these limitations.  Using only low levels of light, many individual cells will be monitored for extended periods of time, producing chemical and structural \"histories\" of the cells as they respond to stimuli.  This measurement technique will be useful for identifying early-responding cells and understanding how they lead to large-scale behavior in the human body.  In a particular case of interest, a cellular transformation called \"platelet degranulation\" will be studied because it is associated with increased levels of neurological illness in HIV-positive individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThis project applies a new biophotonic measurement technique, holographic angular-domain elastic scattering (HADES), to studies of single cells responding to stimuli.  Angular scattering is highly sensitive to the average size of organelles, and therefore to changes in cellular contents.  Holography will enable first-principles analysis of single cells? angular scattering for the first time.  The HADES technique will be combined in a microscope with Raman spectroscopy, a complementary technique that provides chemical specificity.   This instrument will acquire morphological and chemical \"histories\" of single cells as they undergo changes, for example (a) endothelial cells receiving damage to their mitochondrial membranes, (b) immune cells being stimulated, and (b) platelet cells undergoing degranulation, a process of interest to research on HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).  Such reactions can vary greatly from one cell to the next, and these differences can be important parameters to study.  Yet many analytical methods do not provide single-cell data, and many that do so require exogenous labels that alter the very process being studied.  There is therefore a need for non-labeling, non-destructive methods that can obtain detailed information repeatedly from single cells, without affecting cellular function or viability. The HADES microscopy platform will provide rich information for characterizing cellular transformations and their variability on a cell-by-cell basis.\r\n\r\nThis award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Biophotonics, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes\n\nThis project developed a new technique for measuring the size distribution of organelles in a single biological cell.  As in traditional microscopy, a beam of light shines through the cell and is imaged by a camera.  In the new approach, however, the image contains information about how much light scattered from the cell at different deflection angles, and this in turn permits size distributions to be estimated.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n1) Discovery of the angular range needed to characterize cell organelle distributions.  Initial work on this project used the angular scattering range of 20 to 60 degrees to measure the diameters of various organelle-sized beads successfully.  Each bead distribution tested, however, was narrow.  Measurements on broader size distributions , such as those for a cell?s organelles, did not lead to robust size estimates because the scattering versus angle becomes more featureless.  Through simulations and experiments, we established that one can counteract that effect by measuring to a minimum angle of 10 or 15 degrees instead of 20. \n\n \n\n2) Development of a holographic (interferometric) method of recording a cell?s angular scattering.  Previous angular scattering analysis of cells by our group had been done by illuminating one cell at a time, because otherwise our detector would not know which photons had been scattered by which cell.  To overcome this, a holographic system was developed.  In essence, this provided an image field in which one can click on a chosen region of interest (say, a single cell) and calculate the angular scattering from that region alone.  The developed system was based upon a little-used approach that has drawbacks for imaging but desirable properties for calculating angular scattering.  The key technical equipment for the imaging system was a programmable spatial light modulator.  This component enabled us to split the light coming from the cell into two parts and combine it in various ways to reveal the angular scattering.  The performance of the new system was tested on bead samples and shown to provide the angular scattering patterns expected.\n\n \n\nBroader impact:\n\n1) Training of graduate and undergraduate students in research.  Two doctoral students received PhD degrees in optics; both of them are now faculty members in physics departments.  Two other students are currently in the midst of their doctoral studies.  In addition, two students received Masters degrees through work on this project, and three undergraduate students (all female) worked on the project.  One of them worked for four years and is now an NSF graduate research fellow at the University of Illinois in another biomedical optics group.  Another student spend two years in the group and is now working for a research project at NIH.  All of the above students recevied extensive and regular mentoring from the PI.\n\n \n\n2) Dissemination to the wider community.  The PI gave talks about biomedical optics, including this research, to groups of graduate students, to undergraduate students, to visiting high school students applying to the University of Rochester, and to high school students at the department?s summer Photon Camp.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew J Berger"
