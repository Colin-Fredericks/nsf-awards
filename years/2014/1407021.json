 "awd_abstract_narration": "Captive breeding programs have been used to supplement imperiled populations or to re-establish locally extinct populations. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of supplementation and reintroduction attempts are unsuccessful because animals fail to survive and reproduce in the wild. Genetic diversity of a population is a key variable that can influence fitness and, therefore, survival. Because most breeding programs inadvertently select for adaptation to captivity, genetic diversity is often radically altered. To examine the impacts of captive breeding on vertebrate populations, we established six captive populations of white-footed mice and propagated the populations using three breeding schemes typically used in zoos. The existing pedigree will be supplemented with DNA data to form a complete genetic picture of the captive populations. \r\n \t\r\nThrough the use of a multi-faceted assessment of genetic diversity via pedigree, marker, and sequence data, this project will compare the evolution of populations bred and maintained in captivity.  By utilizing replicate, experimental populations of white-footed mice propagated via different captive breeding protocols, we will also evaluate the efficacy of theoretical approaches to limiting inbreeding, drift, and selection in captive populations.  The resulting data will be useful in understanding how different genes and genomic regions evolve, which will be important in further captive breeding programs for recovery of endangered species and for biomedical research.",

Typically, the goals of such conservation programs are to keep species in captivity until the natural habitat is able to sustain wild populations. However, captive breeding can lead to long lasting changes in genetic diversity due to the inbreeding and selection that occurs within even carefully managed populations. These changes impact the ability of released individuals surviving and forming self-sustaining wild populations. The aim of this project was to use replicate experimental populations of white-footed mice to assess effects of three distinct captive breeding regimes on the genetic diversity over 20 generations in captivity. We began by generating genome sequencing data, which we subsequently assembled and annotated. Next, we generated genetic diversity data for individual mice, sampled across the 20 years of captive breeding and across the six captive populations. Using the genome sequence annotations combined with the genetic diversity data, we found that particular genes were related to particular behaviors within our captive populations. This finding is important because behaviors are often altered when species are held in captivity, which sometimes leads to poor survival of individuals born in captivity and later released. Using the genetic diversity data, we also found that some methods of managing captive populations result in less changes in genetic diversity over time. This was a result of limiting both inbreeding and the effects of selection in the captive environment. These results have direct management implications, as retaining genetic diversity in captive populations is important for the long-term success of the captive population and critically important for improving the probability of survival and reproduction of individuals ultimately released into the wild.
