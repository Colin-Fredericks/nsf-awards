 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for junior scientists to attend Hot Quarks 2014:  A Workshop on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for Young Scientists.  The format of this workshop is unusual in that only junior scientists (graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty members) can attend.  The workshop is focused on the exchange of scientific information related to understanding the behavior of matter at extremely high densities and/or temperatures.  Such a state of matter is expected to have existed soon after the Big Bang.  Participants will be discussing results from experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab, and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, in Switzerland.  Research in this area contributes to our fundamental understanding of the nature of matter and has implications for other areas of science, such as cosmology.  Focusing on the participation of junior scientists plays an important role in educating the next generation of experts in nuclear science who will be essential to the Nation's future in this area.",
