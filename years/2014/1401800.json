 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology to Rachel M. Mitchell supports research entitled `Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models to Predict Patterns of Diversity.` NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology intersects with other scientific disciplines; this research is at the intersection of biology and mathematics, specifically statistical modelling.  Fellows are expected to be leaders of the nation`s  scientific workforce of the future. The host institution for this fellowship is Duke University and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Justin Wright and Dr. Alan Gelfand, who can help train Dr. Mitchell in building a hierarchical Bayesian model. Thus Dr. Mitchell is gaining valuable skills in hierarchical Bayesian modelling with applications to ecology.  She is also expanding outreach and teaching opportunities; partnering with the Museum of Life and Science allows her to share with children from diverse backgrounds a hands-on activity directly related to the research question. She is also implementing an abbreviated science outreach and communication seminar for graduate students at Duke University.\r\n\r\nThe last decade has seen a tremendous growth of interest in plant functional traits, which are measurable traits that impact plant fitness. These traits are now understood to be actively selected on by abiotic filters like rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions. Such selection is hypothesized to determine how plant communities form and explain why some areas have more species than others. Until recently, the trait variation among individuals within a species (= intraspecific variation) has been largely ignored, but recent research has revealed that this variation is substantial and ecologically important. Although plant traits and intraspecific variation are known to be critical in shaping communities, they have yet to be fully incorporated into models predicting patterns of species presence and diversity.  The model being built by Dr. Mitchell incorporates plant functional traits, abiotic filters, and intraspecific variation to predict patterns of diversity at both large and small scales in the southeastern United States. This model - the first of its kind - is a significant contribution to the fields of both ecology and statistical modeling.\r\n\r\nThis project has implications for conservation on local and global scales. The model quantifies how traits mediate species presence in response to abiotic conditions, an issue of importance under projected climate change scenarios. Furthermore, it serves to identify areas of high diversity in terms of both species identity and functional traits; such areas are of high conservation value in a changing world. It clarifies the link between species and functional diversity, a link that must be understood if ecosystems and the services they provide are to be preserved.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project set out to integrate plant functional traits (morphological or physiological traits that impact fitness), and the variation in these traits, into models that predict trait values, and species presence or absence given environmental characteristics.  To successfully address this goal, I used data collected in the fynbos of South Africa.  At the same time, I wanted to understand how plant traits determine where individual species live.  For example: Do species with a great deal of variability occur in highly variable habitats? Do species with low variability only occur in very specific habitats?  Do traits respond to the environment in a way that makes all species in the same environment express similar traits?  To address these questions, I used trait data collected in the longleaf pine forests of North Carolina.  This data had been collected for many species, and many individuals within species.\n\nI discovered that highly variable species were not necessarily found in more variable habitat types.  Some traits, like specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf weight to leaf size) were correlated with wider habitat variation, but overall, being highly variable in terms of traits did not predict variability in habitat type.   Furthermore, we found that species were not necessarily closer to an \"optimum\" trait values in environments where they occur frequently and abundantly.  This contrasts with the assumption that species and individuals are likely to be more similar in habitats that are similar.  Using these same data, I, along with my postdoctoral advisor and a fellow postdoc, explored conceptually how trait variability might contribute to habitat stability in disturbed ecosystems.  If dominant species have high trait variability, they may be able to survive variable environmental conditions, and provide a stable plant community when disturbance strikes.   This conceptual exploration has led to additional experiments and grant proposals.\n\nOne of the main aims of this project was to develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that integrated traits, trait variability, and environmental conditions to predict where species and traits will occur.  After several years of work, this model was developed and, at the time of this writing, is in press.  This model is a fundamental contribution to ecology, as making predictions about species presence, absence, and abundance is a key aim of trait-based ecology.  We were successfully able to predict trait values given environmental conditions for several genera of fynbos plant, and to explore how these traits are correlated, in order to predict one trait, if we have measured another.  Currently, this model is being applied to understand trait overlap and n-dimensional trait space in other ecosystems.\n\n            The results of these projects have been published in several ecological and statistical journals, and communicated to professionals at conferences and seminars.\n\n \n\nAnother major goal of this project was for me to gain college-level teaching experience.  To this end, I co-taught both an undergraduate level biodiversity class and an upper-division undergraduate/graduate level class on ecology at Duke University.  I worked alongside my postdoctoral advisor and a Professor of the Practice to hone and improve my teaching style and strategy.  I gave several lectures, and led fieldtrips and discussions.  I found this experience to be invaluable, as it prepared me for the teaching duties of a professor position.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rachel M Mitchell"
