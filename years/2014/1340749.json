 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transfers of carbon, nutrients and pollutants from the land to streams and their changes as they move through river networks are issues that motivate environmental scientists and water resource managers.  Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a central chemical in streams and rivers that affects the forms and movements of contaminants, light penetration through the water, metabolism of life in the streams, pH, and the efficiency of water treatments by municipalities.  This study aims to improve predictions of DOM formation and movement from small headwater streams and our understanding of the factors that change the amount and forms of DOM during as it moves downstream.  One goal of this research is to greatly improve a computer model of DOM transport and transformation as it moves through a watershed and into the headwater streams.  This model links rainfall and runoff that generate streamflow to the biological and chemical processes that lead to changes in the amount and forms of DOM.   The model will be tested against actual measurements of DOM made in several headwater streams of the Connecticut River along its length.  Measurements will then also be made in larger parts of the Connecticut River downriver that will help explain how DOM changes along the entire drainage network.  This project challenges a long standing picture of how streams and rivers work, called the River Continuum Concept, proposing that a newer view may be required, referred to as the Pulse-Shunt Concept.  \r\n\r\nThis project will involve graduate students and a post-doctoral associate in the laboratory, field, and modeling ends of the research.  It will also build on a partnership with the Connecticut Science Museum to construct educational activities and displays related to watershed ecology and management for the general public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome Report\n\nThe goal of the NSF project \"Collaborative Research: RUI: The Pulse-Shunt Concept: A Conceptual Framework for Quantifying and Forecasting Watershed DOM Fluxes and Transformations at the MacroSystem Scale\" was to understand how terrestrial organic compounds influence the water chemistry of downstream ecosystems.  Namely, how dissolved organic matter, or DOM, which moves off of land with storms, impacts streams, rivers and ultimately the coastal ocean.   Dissolved organic matter is important to the chemistry of these aquatic systems.  It absorbs light, carries pollutants, and is a main food source for bacteria.  It also reacts with chlorine during drinking water disinfection to create hazardous compounds and is regulated in the United States and abroad. \n\nThis project set up an unprecedented set of \"nested\" field sites.  Tiny headwater streams that were nested inside of small rivers, which were themselves nested in bigger rivers.  All sites were outfitted with probe systems to take measurements every 15 minutes.  Automatic samplers were also deployed to take a physical water sample every few hours during storms. These samples were then brought back to the lab to help calibrate the probe systems, but also to provide more in-depth measurements on water quality. \n\n             The Pulse-Shunt-Concept has now been published in a leading ecological journal.  It lays out a theoretical basis, backed by a mathematical model, for understanding how the terrestrial transfer of materials responds to storms. Our work has advanced knowledge around how river chemistry is altered by variability in river flow.   We have published 16 works of scholarship to date.  A few of these projects were at the scale of the entire United States, including a national synthesis of how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varies with discharge across thousands of sites, a second study looking at the controls on the composition of DOM across the United States, and an analysis of the controls of nitrogen and phosphorus in US waters using over 200,000 measurements.  We also learned a lot about temperate watersheds through our focus on the CT River watershed.  This included developing a new model of storm DOC concentrations, a study on the relative importance of sunlight to DOC removal, a study of how the chemical composition of DOM varies at a station during single storms and how greenhouse gas concentrations respond to rain and snowmelt events (to name a few).\n\n             This project trained 3 post-docs and 5 PhD students between Yale and Northeastern.  All of the post doc\u2019s have positions at Universities, 1 PhD student has moved on to a teaching position, 3 are in post doc positions and 2 are finalizing their dissertations.  We also trained several interns through the New Haven Promise program.  As part of the project we partnered with the Connecticut River Watershed Councils citizen science program.  This program is aimed at taking a snapshot of the entire watersheds nutrient chemistry during a signal day.  A Yale team formed and added Connecticut to the sampling, prior it was just New Hampshire and VT, and added DOM to the sampling, prior it was only nitrogen species.  Furthermore we began a partnership with the Metropolitan District of CT, the water utility for Hartford and its surrounding communities.  In order to understand how reservoirs impact water quality our sampling included streams that are the fresh water source for these reservoirs as well as the reservoirs themselves.   Finally, Raymond worked with the Yale New Haven Teachers Institute for the spring semester of 2017.  The Yale-New Haven teachers Institute is an educational partnership between Yale and New Haven public schools with a mission of strengthening teaching locally and regionally.  Pete worked with 11 teachers to produce an original curriculum unit on \"Watershed Science\".  Each of these teachers attended a series of 12 2 hour seminars led by Raymond and prepared a curriculum unit that they will bring to their own teaching but also posted online for other teachers around the country to use.  Examples include a unit called \"Follow the water\" for second graders and a unit called \"Cheers to your health: The connection between water sources and disease\" for high school juniors and seniors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Raymond"
