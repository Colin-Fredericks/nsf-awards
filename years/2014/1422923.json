 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades flash-based storage has crept up from a niche and relatively unknown storage technology to the mobile and embedded medium of choice, and made significant in-roads in the laptop and server arenas in the incarnation of Solid State Disk (SSD). Increasingly, many applications use SSDs and trends indicate that SSD usage will grow significantly. However, SSDs are no silver bullet - in reality, the flash firmware in all commercial SSDs is very rigid and highly unadaptable across input/output (I/O) workloads creating sincere challenges which include the added cost of firmware per SSD, firmware inflexibility, and assisting SSD hardware limitations. This work will address these key issues.  \r\n\r\nThe research will investigate how SSDs should achieve the flexibility they need to perform best for a variety of I/O workloads by being software-defined. This manages the repeating cost of a copy of inflexible firmware for each SSD, and will push the current firmware into the more general and malleable software space. Another area of exploration will be to investigate how SSDs could be made capable of collaborating with the host such that resources on both sides can be shared towards a more flexible and higher-performing I/O device. This will prevent on-board SSD assisting hardware from being vastly over/under utilized, enabling the host to take advantage of workload-specific optimizations on the SSD itself instead of pushing the data back to the host. Increased flexibility in the mechanisms that drive flash-based SSDs will provide system administrators the ability to tune their flash storage for workloads in use. Increased cooperation and transparency between the host and the flash device should enable improved application/library/device-level optimizations that are impossible under the current rigid and protocol-obfuscated regime. Intelligent sharing of assisting hardware (mainly compute and memory) across the host and SSD will enable more expensive SSD optimizations to be performed given the host's compute and memory power, and more clever I/O optimizations to be performed given the SSD's locality to the underlying data. Further, bringing SSD related tasks to the host side can enable co-optimization of application threads and I/O threads, improving potentially computation, communication, and I/O, and similarly, SSD tasks can be co-optimized with application threads on the SSD side, leading to a more efficient active flash system.",

This TRAnsistor-level Programmable (TRAP) fabric allows simultaneous storage of four independent configurations, along with the ability to dynamically switch between them in a small fraction of a clock cycle. We term this&nbsp;<em>board-level virtualization</em>&nbsp;in that each configuration in effect implements an independent chip.&nbsp;&nbsp;TRAP also supports&nbsp;<em>chip-level virtualization</em>&nbsp;in which a single IC design is partitioned over a set of configurations and the computation cycles from one configuration to the next in the set. This allows a design that requires more computational logic than physically available on the TRAP chip to be nonetheless executable. TRAP also features rapid partial or full modification of any one of the stored configurations in a time proportional to the number of modified configuration bits through the use of hierarchically arranged, high throughput, pipelined memory buffers. TRAP supports libraries of cells of the same height and variable width, just as in a typical standard cell circuit. We developed a complete Computer-aided Design (CAD) tool flow for programming TRAP chips. A prototype 3mm X 3mm TRAP chip was fabricated using the Global Foundries 55nm process and all supplied chips were fully functional.

We introduce a transistor-level programmable fabric and we discuss its unique advantages towards design obfuscation, as well as a customized CAD framework for seamlessly integrating this fabric in an ASIC design flow.
