 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to study a poorly known environment below the snowpack known as the subnivium. To escape the harsh winter weather, many plants and animals persist within a warmer and more stable environment underneath the snowpack. The climate of the subnivium is dependent on snowpack depth, density and duration; deep, soft snow provides excellent insulation that results in mild subnivium temperatures. Within the Great Lakes Region, the subnivium is historically important, but winter conditions are changing rapidly. By 2050, mean winter temperature is predicted to be 3-4 degrees Centigrade warmer resulting in a shorter snowcover season and shallower and denser snowpack.  These changes will produce a colder and more thermally variable subnivium. For species that are specially adapted to survive winter in the subnivium, such changes could effect their survival and distribution. To determine how climate change will affect the conditions and distribution of this sensitive habitat, this award will experimentally mimic climate change predicted by 2050 across the Great Lakes Region using micro-greenhouses. Finally, laboratory experiments and distribution modeling will reveal how future subnivium conditions will affect the physiology, survival and distribution of a sensitive subnivium hibernating amphibian species native to the Great Lakes Region. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide new information on the mechanisms and extent to which climate change will affect various attributes of the subnivium a biologically important and climatically sensitive seasonal refugium. It will assess how changing snow conditions will alter the survival and physiological function of a hibernating amphibian and predict their future distribution in warming winters. This project will also provide professional development opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through interactions with partners at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Michigan Tech University, and The Wildlife Society's Climate Change Working Group. Micro-greenhouses will be constructed by participants at Operation Fresh Start, a local youth development program, and will provide opportunities for underrepresented, at-risk and minority youth to interact with university faculty, researchers and students. Finally, the placement of micro-greenhouses at state parks, and recreational areas will serve as an important tool for climate change education and provide potentially long-term research opportunities.",

Given these changes, there is increasing attention on the winter season, especially in seasonally snow-covered ecosystems, where reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover have disrupted a host of ecological processes. A critical, yet understudied, habitat is the subnivium?the hidden, but expansive microhabitat underneath the snow where the majority of biodiversity in northern temperate areas spends the winter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To determine how current and future climate impacts the subnivium, we quantified the mechanisms that create the subnivium, assessed the phenology (establishment, duration and stability) of the subnivium, and simulated future climate change using fully automated micro-greenhouses distributed across the Great Lakes Region of the United States. We developed a mechanistic niche model to model how future subnivium conditions will affect the physiology and distribution of an overwintering amphibian, the wood frog. Finally, we synthesized our results to guide land managers seeking to conserve the subnivium and species that depend upon it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We discovered that the warmer and more stable conditions within the subnivium are constrained by snow duration, density, and depth. Patterns in both subnivium establishment and disintegration were affected more by latitude than land cover, but the timing of early season snowfall events overrode the effects of both factors in subnivium establishment. In contrast, disintegration of the subnivium was predictably later in more northerly sites, regardless of variation in snowfall. To predict how the extent and duration of subnivium in the Great Lakes Region will shift under warming winters, we created a spatial model of the extent and duration of the subnivium under different warming scenarios. Under a +3C warming scenario, we found little change in extent or duration of the subnivium, but a +5C warming scenario produced widespread and drastic reductions in both subnivium extent (loss of 200,000 km2, a 45% decline) and duration (&gt;1 month decline). The modest reductions in extent and minimal reductions in duration found under the +3C warming scenario demonstrate that this level of warming can serve as a benchmark for resiliency, while the +5C warming scenario provides an important tipping point of widespread subnivium loss.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We developed a novel mechanistic model of subnivium microclimate conditions coupled with an energetic model of the wood frog, a freeze-tolerant amphibian. During winter, we found that wood frogs experienced a trade-off between risk of lethal ice content and extensive use of body reserves. We simulated the effects of climate change on wood frog energetics into the future. We found that warming temperatures and decreasing winter length had opposing effects on winter energy requirements. While energy expenditures and body ice content were predicted to decline in wood frogs across most of our study region, we identified an area of heightened energetic risk in the northwestern part of the Great Lakes region where energy requirements were predicted to increase. Because wood frogs rely on body stores acquired in fall to fuel winter survival and spring breeding, increased winter energy requirements have the potential to impact their long-term local survival and reproduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based our findings, we developed guidance for land managers to help slow the loss of the subnivium in the face of rapidly changing winter conditions. In particular, we suggest the adoption of regional conservation plans for identifying threatened snow&#8208;covered environments; measure and predict the effects land cover and habitat management has on local subnivium conditions; and control the timing and distribution of activities that disturb and compact snow cover (e.g., silvicultural practices, snow recreation, and road and trail maintenance). As a case study, we developed a spatially explicit model of subnivium presence in a working landscape of the Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin and identified areas where winter recreation and management practices could threaten potentially important areas for subnivium persistence. Similar modeling approaches could inform management decisions related to subnivium conservation. Current climate projections predict that snow seasons will change rapidly in many regions, and as result, we advocate for the immediate recognition, conservation, and management of the subnivium and its dependent species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broadly, our work has introduced the subnivium as an ecological concept critical to northerly ecosystem and led to the publication of nine peer-reviewed and high-impact articles, with two more currently in production, one invention, one popular article, multiple conference and seminar presentations, the development of two websites, the training of one PhD and one post-doctoral scholar and an important partnership with a non-profit and underrepresented and at risk youth in the Dane County Wisconsin.
