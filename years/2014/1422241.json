 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve the understanding of delay-sensitive communications over modern wireless systems and networks where the physical layer transmission is based on transport blocks. Information theory, communication theory, and queuing theory will be integrated to provide a framework to analyze wireless system performance by jointly considering decoding error probability and delay-violation probability. To be specific, a transport block-based channel dispersion will be developed to understand the interplay among channel coding over finite transport blocks, channel knowledge feedback, modulation, and probability of decoding error for modern wireless systems. Performance of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) systems will also be analyzed under this framework.\r\n \r\nThe outcome of this project is expected to provide design guidance for modern and future wireless systems and networks that supports delay-sensitive traffic. Wireless devices are an integral part of society and are currently used by over 95% of the global population. Research that leads to improving their performance under delay-sensitive traffic offers the potential to improve how these devices serve the needs of their users. In addition to global technological impact, this project has an educational plan that will immerse students from various backgrounds in the exciting field of mobile wireless communications.",
