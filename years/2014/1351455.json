 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on developing new methodologies for ultrafast imaging. In particular, it will contribute to a new development of ultrafast optical and X-ray cameras capable of providing molecular movies with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This will greatly advance ultrafast optical science in single-molecule imaging, light-matter interaction, and inertial confinement fusion. The project also includes educational activities such as developing a summer/winter short course in optical science for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as training one graduate and two undergraduate and/or local high school students per year in the PI's laboratory. The research also includes extensive educational activities for students in individual and collaborative research settings.\r\n\r\nConventional pump-probe methods can routinely provide ultrafast time-resolved imaging, but they mostly work for highly repeatable events. However, if event-to-event reproducibility is irregular or involves material damage, irreversible chemical reactions, and/or structural phase transition, single-shot detection is a necessity. The project here is to develop a single-shot camera capable of capturing ultrafast dynamic images, simultaneously recording spatial (2-dimensional) and temporal evolutions in a single-shot. Such a camera can capture images at a frame rate of ~50 trillion frames per second, recording 3 ~ 60 frames in a single-shot. Here, the enabling technologies include ultra-broadband spectrum generation, ultrafast optical pulse shaping, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging. This kind of camera can be potentially used in material characterization, biomedical imaging, bio-sensors, and optical and plasma diagnostics. In particular, its application in X-ray free electron lasers will lead to ultrashort electron beam imaging and characterization.",
