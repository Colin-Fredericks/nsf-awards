 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Georgia to create a next generation optical microscope. This microscope will take advantage of advances in chemistry, astronomy and photonics to achieve unprecedented resolution throughout large biological samples. By combining a new microscopy approach, light sheet microscopy, with technology used to look at distant galaxies and extrasolar planets, our instrument will minimize scattering and aberrations when imaging into thick samples. Combining recent advances in photochemistry with the advanced display inside a flat screen television, the instrument will control the fluorescence to achieve resolutions below the diffraction limit. This will allow subcellular details to be studied throughout zebrafish, fruit flies, roundworms and other organisms essential to modern biology research. Examples of research that will benefit from this instrument include the study of seizures in zebrafish, neuron firing in fruit flies, eye development in mouse embryos, and cell division and differentiation in developing C. elegans roundworms. Once developed, the instrument design will be made available to researchers through an open-source model to speed its adoption. The design, software and instructions will be made available on the internet. Ultimately, we plan to offer a commercial product.\r\n\r\nBy advancing biological science and improving the study of organisms that are important models for human disease, this project has the potential to improve human health. The ability of this instrument to create high-resolution fluorescence images of entire multicellular organisms will be transformative in developmental biology and other areas of biological research in which the behavior of cells throughout organisms is studied. This project will train the next generation of scientists in interdisciplinary research through the development of this novel instrument, as well as through a course in bioimaging taught by biologists, chemists and engineers. Students from different disciplines will be introduced to all aspects of bioimaging from preparation and staining of samples to construction of a microscope.\r\n\r\nThis award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Biophotonics, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate).",

Fluorescence microscopy, in which proteins of interest are labeled with fluorescent molecules that allow the proteins to be identified against a dark background, has been optimized for imaging in samples only a few microns thick with up to a resolution of 250 nanometers. We have used two technologies, adaptive optics and light sheet microscopy to improve the performance of fluorescence microscopy in samples up to 100 microns thick. We have built a Light Sheet Microscope for imaging neural events in the central nervous system of zebrafish larvae which are an important model for the nervous systems of vertebrates. In collaboration with the lab of Jim Lauderdale at UGA, we have used the LSM to study the neural behavior of both wildtype and mutants with a suppressed inhibitory response (Fig. 1). This will allow us to understand how the inhibitory response is generated and could have implications for the study of seizures. To improve the resolution of the LSM when imaging deep into the zebrafish CNS, we have added an adaptive optics module to the LSM. AO is a technology developed to correct for aberrations caused by the atmosphere when imaging deep space with ground-based telescopes. Here we use this technology to correct for the aberrations caused when light travels through complex tissue. We have designed a scene-based wavefront sensor which can calculate the aberrations from extended images and does not require an expensive additional laser to function. We are currently developing a novel LSM design that will allow imaging throughout the zebrafish CNS (and other samples of similar size) with resolutions down to 150 nanometers - better than the best widefield fluorescence microscopes - using structured illumination technology.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have combined Structured Illumination Microscopy with Adaptive Optics and demonstrated imaging with 120nm lateral resolution and 550nm axial resolution deep inside both <em>C. elegans</em> - an important model of multicellular organisms - and the rice blast fungus. Rice blast is one of the world's most devastating diseases and destroys a large amount of the annual rice crop. Without AO, SIM produces distorted images with very poor axial resolution or is unable to produce a clear image at all in such aberrating samples. Figure 2 shows images of RIC interneurons in <em>C. elegans</em> with and without Adaptive Optics. These projects have resulted in 7 peer-reviewed journal articles and 12 conference presentations and one invention disclosure.</p>\n<p>This award has also supported teaching and training in significant ways. Seven graduate students and five undergraduates have contributed to this project over the lifetime of the award. Four of the graduate students have graduated. Two work in industry, and two have gone on to postdoctoral positions. The other three graduate students are all expected to graduate soon. One of these students received a prestigious Ruth Kirschstein training award from the National Institutes of Health. Of the undergraduate students who have contributed to this project, one has gone on to graduate school in aeronautics, and one is in medical school.</p>\n<p>The award has also supported the development of my graduate teaching program at the University of Georgia. I have developed two courses for graduate students related to optical microscopy over the time that I have been supported by this award. One course, ELEE 8580 Biological Microscopy, is intended to provide a broad range of graduate students with an introduction to the fundamentals of optical microscopy for biological applications as well as an introduction to state-of-the art optical microscopes - both in the Kner lab and in the Biomedical Microscopy Core at UGA. The other course, ENGR 8570 Advanced Topics in Optical Microscopy, is designed for graduate students who are interested in the theory of optical microscopy and working on optical microscopy development. This course introduces important topics in microscopy theory by discussing important research papers in depth. An important part of this is making sure all the mathematical steps and results in these papers are understood, and we go over the math in detail.
