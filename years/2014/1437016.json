Solar cells for conversion of light to electricity based on organic polymers integrated into a photovoltaic (PV) device offer a potentially low-cost route for renewable electricity production if the solar energy conversion efficiency can be improved. The key to improving the efficiency of organic polymer based solar cells is to better understand the molecular arrangement of the materials within the polymer film. This project will apply novel electron microscopy tools to understand how materials processing affects the three-dimensional arrangement of materials in polymer/nanoparticle films designed for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Mixtures of low-cost lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles with electrically conducting polymers will be studied because these mixtures have shown recent high photovoltaic efficiency, and because these materials have high imaging contrast by electron microscopy. The electron tomography will generate three dimensional concentration maps of materials within the mixture. These maps will be used to correlate processing conditions to material arrangement within the polymer/nanoparticle film. This information will then be correlated to device performance in order to identify strategies for making better solar cells based on organic polymers. The work will be carried out by a collaborative team that will simultaneously advance the science of polymer/nanoparticle film fabrication, three dimensional electron microscope imaging, and computational analysis of the images to reveal nanoscale structure. This collaborative approach has the potential uncover the structural origin of optical and electronic properties that cannot be measured by any other technique. With respect to education and activities for broadening participation, the project will provide a diverse set of outreach and educational opportunities that include interaction with children through the Boys and Girls Scouts and 4H, public education at well attended local festivals, inclusion of research material in classes, and retention of female engineering students. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\n\r\nThis project will develop and use new electron tomography tools to understand how materials processing affects the three-dimensional arrangement of materials in hybrid polymer/nanoparticle films designed for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Mixtures of low-cost lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles with electrically conducting polymers will be studied because these mixtures have shown recent high photovoltaic efficiency, and because these materials have high imaging contrast by electron microscopy. The electron microscopy tool is based on high-angle annular dark-field scanning electron tomography (HAADF-ET) combined with the discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) to generate three-dimensional (3D) material concentration maps with resolution of less than three cubic nanometers for the hybrid organic/inorganic photovoltaic materials. Development of morphology descriptors of the 3D data, including features like the number of phases, concentration ratio in each phase, domain size, domain connectivity, tortuosity of pathways, anisotropy and domain surface area will be measured using graph-based analysis. This information will be used to correlate morphology, structural heterogeneity, and physical distribution of recombination sites in mixed organic/inorganic electronic films to optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. With respect to education and activities for broadening participation, the project will provide a diverse set of outreach and educational opportunities that include interaction with children through the Boys and Girls Scouts and 4H, public education at well attended local festivals, inclusion of research material in classes, and retention of female engineering students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nProject Outcomes for NSF DMR-1437016:\n\n \n\"Collaborative Research: Chemical Control of Polymer/PbS Blends for PV Applications\"\n \n\nColloidal quantum dots are chemically synthesized semiconductor particles that exhibit size-dependent optical and electronic properties.  Such quantum dots are currently finding their way into commercial technologies including both cell-phone and television displays.  They also have potential for use in both visible-light and infrared-sensitive image sensors and solar energy harvesting applications.  Colloidal quantum dots are typically synthesized with a surface chemical coating &ndash; a surfactant layer &ndash; and are often embedded in a matrix to provide electronic communication with the external environment.  This project focused on understanding how the quantum dot size, surfactant layer, and the embedding material affected the optical and electrical properties of the dots. This project made several new discoveries about the properties of these interesting materials. \n\n \nOne important result from the project was an understanding of how the surface coating on the quantum dots affected their performance in light harvesting applications. The project determined that the different surface coatings studied affected hybrid polymer/quantum dot solar cell performance primarily in terms of the voltage &ndash; the electrical potential &ndash; delivered by a quantum dot solar cell.   Transient electrical and optical experiments showed that the surface coatings with the best performance were also those that had the most light-induced generation of electrical charge, and the slowest loss of that charge to competing surface recombination events.\n\n \nAnother important result from this project was the measurement of the transfer of \"hot\", light-generated electrical charges, or hot carriers, from the quantum dots to a semiconducting polymer host.  Hot charge carriers are those that still retain excess energy from above-band gap incident light, and which have not had time to cool to equilibrium with their surroundings.  The project found that hotter carriers excited with shorter wavelength (higher energy) light were able to leave the quantum dots more quickly, and more efficiently, to generate current more readily than cooler carriers excited with longer wavelength (lower energy) light.\n\n \nIn addition, this project supported structure characterizations of the polymer/quantum dot composites in collaboration with the Moule group at UC Davis, and advanced the state of the art in transmission electron microscopy by comparing image reconstruction methods against other analytical tools to determine the structure and clustering of the quantum dots within the polymer matrix.\n\n \nMultiple PhD students and undergraduates received training in skills at the interface between chemistry, physics, and materials science.
