 "awd_abstract_narration": "A \"Monte Carlo\" algorithm is a computational method that makes random decisions as it runs. Monte Carlo algorithms (dating back to the Manhattan Project) have been an invaluable tool in physics, computer science, statistics, and many other fields, and have become an indispensable part of the modern computing toolkit. Monte Carlo methods enable approximations of integrals that would otherwise remain out of reach. This project will develop and analyze new types of Monte Carlo algorithms, with the ultimate goal of better approximation for high-dimensional integrals and sums. These methods will assist in finding statistical objects such as the maximum likelihood estimator and exact p values, in performing model section using Bayesian statistics, and in building approximation algorithms for provably hard problems that arise in computer science. Many existing Monte Carlo algorithms deliver point estimates, but fail to give provably good error bounds on these estimates. Recent work of the principal investigator shows that in some instances, it is possible to build algorithms where the error only depends on the algorithm, and not on the particular problem under consideration. For example, a new method called the Paired Product Estimator gives a fast method for estimating integrals in high dimension where the error of the estimate is precisely bounded. These bounds are independent of the distribution being sampled from. The project purpose is to further develop and analyze these algorithms to improve both their theoretical and practical efficiency. These will be foundational methods, and should find use as a general tool for researchers in many different fields. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop several new methodologies in Monte Carlo simulation. The first algorithm is for estimating the mean of a Bernoulli random variable. This is an essential step in Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating exact p values in statistics and for estimating integrals using acceptance rejection. By employing a method of Huber, it is possible to create an estimate such that the relative error in the estimate is independent of the value of the mean. Computer experiments indicate the method is fast; in this part of the project, Huber will try to show that this method is provably close to the optimal in the number of samples needed to obtain such an estimate. A new protocol for sampling from Markov random fields such as the Ising model will also be developed, partially recursive acceptance rejection. By creating a tree of possible labels for a graph and then carefully pruning this (exponentially large) tree, it is possible to sample from the Ising model (at temperatures above the critical temperature) using only a polynomial (even linear) number of steps. Such models can usually be written as Gibbs distributions, and often finding the normalizing constant (called the partition function) for these distributions is computationally very difficult. One part of the project will be refining an idea called the Paired Product Estimator, that approximates the partition function in a provably fast way: now the goal is to make the method practically efficient as well.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nConsider a computer simulation intended to determine if a particular policy results in greater GDP growth or not.  Estimating probabilities of this type from data generated by random simulations was the purpose of this project.\n\nSuppose the true probability was 20% and the estimate of the probability was 22%.  Then we would say that the relative error was 10%.  However, in order to calculate the relative error we needed to know the true answer.\n\nThe purpose of this project was to build an estimate such that the probability that the relative error was of a certain size could be found exactly without the need to know the true answer.  For instance, with such an estimate we could say that the probability that the relative error was greater than 10% would itself be at most 1%.  This would hold true no matter what the true answer was.\n\nThe main result of the project was the development of such an estimate that is faster than all other previous methods.  Such an estimate should find widespread use in the analysis of computer simulation results.\n\nAnther important result from the project is a better method for estimating the average value of the results of computer simulations called the light-tailed sample average.  This method gives an automated way to detect outliers, values of the computer simulation that are very unlikely, but which can throw off the sample average by a large amount.  These outliers could then be given less weight in the average, resulting in a more accurate estimate.\n\nThis also lead to a better algorithm for the mean of random variables which are positive with a known upper bound.  The new method is about four times faster than the previous best known method for the problem.\n\nThis project involved several undergraduates, and trained them to write and present mathematics at a professional level.  Some of these undergraduates conducted research with the Principal Investigator during the summer, while others worked during the school year on activities related to the project as part of their senior thesis.  Several of these undergraduates have gone on to graduate school in STEM fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark L Huber"
