This conference is focused on potential innovative technology solutions to challenges associated with care delivery. It includes panel discussions, scientific and clinical presentations, and breakout sessions. The conference will also offer students the opportunity to participate in an IDEO design innovation workshop in which students will work with clinicians and engineers to develop and conceptualize innovative ideas for healthcare applications. The goal of this project is to involve students in all facets of the conference, from meeting planning to presentations, the IDEO workshop and session leadership to post-conference evaluation.",
