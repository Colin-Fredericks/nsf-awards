 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most animals, the female reproductive tract can store sperm for longer times than semen extenders. For example, poultry semen in extenders is usually only stored for up to 48 hours before insemination compared to the 2-3 week storage in the hen. Clearly, the female reproductive tract has capabilities unmatched by artificial extenders. Based on supportive preliminary results, the investigators hypothesize that adding specific oviduct glycans to bovine sperm will prolong sperm lifespan ex vivo.  The studies supported by this award are designed to address the NSF BREAD Challenge topic of developing a cold-chain-free artificial insemination process. Sperm storage by cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen has revolutionized transportation of bovine semen in developed countries. But cryopreservation techniques are impractical for small herdowners in developing countries due to technical and infrastructure constraints. A more practical alternative would allow semen from valuable males to be transported at ambient temperature, maximizing the genetic impact of valuable animals. \r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the mammalian oviduct that enable sperm to live an extended lifespan are unclear but there is a developing paradigm that oviductal glycans are involved in sperm retention and that the glycans extend sperm cell viability. These hypotheses will be addressed in 3 specific aims: 1) identification of glycan motifs that bind bovine sperm and determine their location in the oviduct; 2) determination of whether oviduct glycans that bind sperm prolong sperm lifespan and function in standard culture medium (dmTALP); and 3) determination of whether oviduct glycans can prolong sperm lifespan and function in an optimized semen diluent at normal room temperatures.  In addition to the research findings, this project will train a postdoctoral fellow and several undergraduates, including underrepresented minority students recruited through the many diversity-oriented programs at the University of Illinois. An interactive web site that teaches the importance of semen analysis that will be developed and used in laboratories for a class of 175 students each year. Results from the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through scientific conferences.",

So we coupled this sugar to the small spheres and found that 60% of the sperm remained alive after being held in an incubator for 96 hr.  In contrast, only 10% of the sperm that were free were still alive after 96 hr.  We hope to take advantage of these observations to complete the design of a storage system that could keep sperm alive for longer periods of time without the need for freezing and maintaining semen in liquid nitrogen.  This is important for owners of small cattle herds in regions of the world that do not have access to liquid nitrogen and the infrastructure needed for storing cattle semen.  This would allow farmers to use semen from bulls with high genetic merit and improve the productivity of their cattle herds.  During the completion of this research, one postdoctoral fellow received training in a field that was new to her, an African-American undergraduate received research training and gave a poster summarizing her results.  She has now enrolled in graduate school to earn her PhD.  Three additional undergraduates performed research and one gave an oral presentation and poster summarizing her results.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Miller"
