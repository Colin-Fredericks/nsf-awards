 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this NUE program, Nanotechnology Education for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing, at Oklahoma State University (OSU) under the direction of Dr. Matthew J. Klopfstein, is to educate undergraduate students in core nanotechnology topics for high precision Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing by developing educational modules for key undergraduate courses in engineering, measurements, manufacturing, mechatronics, automatic control, and vibrations. R2R manufacturing of flexible materials offers significant advantages over batch processing including better yields, high speed automation, and the potential to mass produce finished materials at substantially lower costs. The project team plans to systematically develop curriculum material in nanotechnology and high precision R2R manufacturing in the following six undergraduate courses: Introduction to Engineering, Measurements, Manufacturing Processes, Mechatronics, Automatic Control, and Vibrations.  \r\n\r\nA large number of OSU students, approximately 800 undergraduate students per year, will be potentially impacted by this curriculum, including up to 400 first-year engineering students. In addition to significantly impacting the undergraduate curriculum and student learning in high precision R2R manufacturing, the proposed project will broadly impact a number of other education and outreach activities.  These activities include involvement of underrepresented students, interaction with middle/high school students and teachers, and opportunities for undergraduate students to interact with practicing engineers.  The project team will work with three programs at OSU: Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), the Multicultural Engineering program (MEP) and the Women in Engineering, Architecture and Technology (WEAT) program to actively recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NUE program, \"Nanotechnology Education for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing\" has been completed.  The goal of this project was to educate undergraduate students in core nanotechnology topics by developing educational modules for key undergraduate courses in engineering.  Educational modules which include lectures, laboratory experiments and laboratory demonstrations were developed for five different courses.  The educational modules impacted approximately 300 undergraduate students.  The effectiveness of the modules was confirmed by surveys completed by the students before and after the educational modules.  The results of the surveys showed that approximately 81% of students increased their awareness of nanotechnology, approximately 43% of students increased their motivation to engage with nanotechnology, and approximately 68% of students increased their exposure to nanotechnology.  These gains are noteworthy considering the duration of the educational module was typically 1 to 2 hours. \n\nA significant outcome of the project was the exposure of roll-to-roll manufacturing to undergraduate students and training of students related to roll-to-roll manufacturing machines in the context of developing technologies that are at the nanometer scale using this type of manufacturing. One summary conclusion is that although modules related to nanoscience and nanotechnology aid in the students' understanding of these topics, it could be beneficial to develop a required course at the undergraduate level that explicitly covers the fundamentals of nanoscale science and nanotechnologies in the context of manufacturing and materials. Although senior technical electives in nanotechnology are currently available, these technical electives are not taken by all students. \n\nThis project had broader impacts as well.  Every year of the project, laboratory tours were given to high school students and their teachers.  The size of the individual groups of students was limited so as to promote more questions from the students, and to provide an environment conducive to learning.  Results from the project were presented to engineering educators at an NSF-sponsored forum and a national conference. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Don A Lucca"
