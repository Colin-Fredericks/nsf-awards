 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CHMPR/NCSU site will conduct transdisciplinary translational research by working across academic, industry, and user boundaries, to work on problems relevant to industry needs. In particular, CHMPR/NCSU will leverage its relatively-high-risk fundamental developments to help those industry organizations that have longer-term, more complex analytic needs. The CHMPR/NCSU research will develop basic techniques that can be applied across multiple industry sectors, including national security, health care, manufacturing, energy, and business intelligence. This vision for the planned site complements the vision of existing center by providing the core Big-Data expertise domains and addressing the productivity, performance and scalability issues in meeting the insatiable computational demands of its sponsors applications through the continuous evolution of multicore architectures and open source tools.\r\n\r\nThe CHMPR/NCSU site will address the future Big-Data needs of the industry. It will contribute to the creation and dissemination of new knowledge in this important field. In particular, the fundamental research conducted at CHMPR/NCSU will be translated into technology developments, delivering practical solutions to hard problems. This translation will apply to federal agencies, government organizations, and industry sectors facing the hard Big-Data problems. NCSU is incorporating multidisciplinary approaches to Big-Data problems into their core-course curricula. The CHMPR/NCSU site will significantly expand the number of industry or government organizations sponsoring student research projects addressing the real-problem applications, and will expose the students to disciplines relevant to the industry-application problems. CHMPR/NCSU will produce a cadre of graduate students with hands-on data-enablement expertise to meet the growing critical shortage of qualified data scientists in the country. The site will leverage extensive resources available at NCSU to address the broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.",
