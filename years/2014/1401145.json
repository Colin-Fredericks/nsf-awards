The goals of the conference are to foster collaboration among young researchers in commutative algebra from Midwestern institutions, and to expose commutative algebra students and postdocs from Midwestern institutions to the current work being done in their fields at neighboring institutions. NSF funding for KUMUNUjr 2014 will support participants' travel and lodging expenses.\r\n\r\nThe primary impacts of the conference will be its enrichment of the research careers of the participants and the dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra research at the graduate and postdoctoral level. In addition, participants will take ideas and collaborations initiated at the conference to the institutions where they eventually find careers.",
