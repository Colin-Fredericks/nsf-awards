 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dietrich\r\n1424234\r\n\r\nThis project will generate fundamental and applied research in these key areas.\r\n\r\n1.  The chemical-physical properties of 4-methyl-cyclohexane methanol (MCHM) have not all been evaluated and they are necessary to determine the fate and transport within the drinking water treatment, distribution system (for example, consumers homes), and natural waters. The first stage of this research will be to quantify the chemical properties of MCHM. Specifically: the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) will be generated using C18 HPLC retention time; the aqueous solubility (S) will be measured by saturating water with MCHM and measuring the aqueous concentration; and the Henry's Law constant (H) will be measured using static headspace equilibrium and SPME-GC/MS.\r\n2.  Previous work by the researchers has developed a predictive model of diffusion coefficients and solubility for a wide range of organics in plastic pipe. Using Kow and S values, diffusion and pipe solubility's will be estimated. This will help validate laboratory results from other research also investigating the MCHM spill.\r\n3.  MCHM has a low aqueous odor threshold of approximately 0.00001 mg/L. Thus consumers can potentially become important monitoring sentinels for exposure to low levels of MCHM. The main location in the house to detect off-odors is the shower because of high water temperatures and water flows in a confined area. Using previous modeling work by the researchers and the measured Henry's Law constants from stage 1 above, dynamic models of MCHM air concentrations for typical showering conditions will be developed. This will confirm if consumer sensory detection can aid in detecting locations of residual MCHM. It will also aid in the utility's understanding of consumer complaints, and in the longer term will aid in exposure assessment through inhalation.\r\n4. While polyethylene pipe materials have been shown to interact with organic chemicals, less is known about the interaction of organics with epoxy materials used to line water pipes and storage tanks. Drinking-water-grade epoxy-liner will be used to evaluate sorption/uptake performance for MCHM. Diffusion coefficients and solubility in epoxy will be determined using weight gain/immersion, time lag, and diffusion/ permeation methods. Similar experiments will be conducted on polyethylene pipe materials.\r\n\r\nOn January 10, 2014, residents of nine West Virginia counties were told by their governor \"Do Not Drink the Water\" because it was contaminated with odorous 4-methyl-cyclohexane methanol (MCHM) which is used to clean coal. Even though the water restrictions began to be lifted on January 13, 2014 and all residents are eventually expected to be able to drink tap water, there are still many scientific knowledge gaps in the short and long term fate and transport of this chemical in water systems. This RAPID Grant will address many of those gaps.  This research seeks to provide fundamental scientific data that can be used to avoid potential health and environmental problems caused by the MCHM spill in West Virginia and the subsequent contamination of the drinking water treatment and distribution system. The knowledge gained will be shared with the scientific and engineering communities through journal publications and presentations at professional conferences. The knowledge on pipe material contamination and decontamination will be shared with the general public through a short, citizen-oriented publication to be posted on the Water Resources Research Center web page. Student researchers will disseminate the knowledge gain through blogs on our \"Water INTERFACE Interdisciplinary Research\" website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith funding from the NSF, our research improved the well-being of  society by greatly expanding the understanding of the human and  environmental impacts of the crude MCHM spill that contaminated drinking  water and disrupted human lives.  Our research explained people\u00c6s interactions with the MCHM  spill through odor investigations, MCHM removal mechanisms by  volatilization and sorption, and contamination of water pipes and plumbing materials.  In  addition to the valuable scientific findings, this research profesionally trained  eight students and was featured on television, radio, and news reports,  plus shared with consumers, industry, government, and other researchers.   This research was highlighted at an interagency governmental workshop  that demonstrated the value of academic research for supporting  emergency responders and protecting the public health and environment.\n\nIn January 2014, approximately 10,000 gallons of the industrial chemical, crude MCHM, leaked from an above ground storage tank into the Elk River.  Subsequently, the drinking water for about 300,000 residents in Charleston, West Virginia and surrounding counties was contaminated and people complained of sweet, licorice odors in their drinking water.  The spill made international news.  At the time of the spill, little was known about the chemical and biological properties of crude MCHM.  The lack of chemical and biological data about the chemical components in the spill resulted in \"do not use\" orders issued by the WV government and drinking water utility.  These orders lasted for several days.\n\nThis research project successfully assessed the odors associated with crude MCHM, measured fate and transport properties of the major component which was (4-methylcyclohexyl)methanol (4-MCHM), investigated crude MCHM interactions with polymers in water pipes and tanks, and determined the effectiveness of drinking water treatment technologies in removing MCHM.\n\nOur research revealed that the crude MCHM mixture was composed of at least ten cyclohexanes, many in isomer pairs.  The predominant compound was (4-methylcyclohexyl)methanol (4-MCHM), which was present as trans- and cis- isomers.  The designations of trans- and cis- isomers refer to different geometric shapes of molecules with the same chemical formula, much like left- and right-handed gloves, which have slightly different shapes with four fingers and one thumb attached to a palm.\n\nBecause the spill was primarily detected through consumer complaints of the \"licorice\" and \"sweet\" odors, an odor analysis was conducted to determine the human odor thresholds of the 4-MCHM isomers.  Surprisingly, the trans- and cis- isomers have very different odor thresholds, with only the trans-4-MCHM being described as having a \"licorice\" odor and also being 2000 times more odorous than the cis-4-MCHM.  Another minor compound in the crude MCHM, methyl-4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate (MMCHC), contributed substantially to the \"sweet\" odor.  People could readily detect the trans-4-MCHM in the air even when its concentration in the drinking water was too low to be measured by monitoring methods used for drinking water.  This low odor threshold accounts for the continued complaints from people affected by the spill even after the water utility reported they could no longer detect MCHM in drinking water.  The volatility of the 4-MCHM and MMCHC contaminants also increase with temperature, explaining why many of the complaints were associated with use of hot water in dishwashers and during showering.\n\nFurther research determined critical environmental fate and transport properties, which are necessary to understand how chemicals are transported in water, air, and soil.  These included octanol-water partition coefficient (important for predicting whether the compound will be found in the water or sorbed to sediments) and solubility (important in determining if the compound will dissolve in water or exist as pure chemical).
