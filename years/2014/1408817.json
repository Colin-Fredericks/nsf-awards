 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical: \r\nThis award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Michigan Ann Arbor is cofunded by the Mechanics of Materials program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (ENG). This research is to understand the fundamental water-borne properties of polymers, and will impact the development of natural and sustainable materials that use water as a solvent. The new knowledge about aqueous polymer stability and flow will be useful in areas in which these polymers are found or consumed. For example, aqueous polymers generally, and bacterial polysaccharides in particular, are relevant to the proliferation and control of bacterial biofilms in hospitals, in wastewater treatment plants, and in industrial facilities. The stability, structure, and mechanics of bacterial polysaccharides are also important for producing foods in which they are present or added. The accompanying educational plan will advance the national interest in STEM training by modeling the use of mentoring plans as a mechanism to increase the probability of doctoral completion of all students. The project researcher's engagement in a summer research experience program for undergraduates will increase the participation of students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering. The project's development of a new module about polysaccharide food additives will engage middle school girls in science and engineering, and thereby foster their interest in STEM areas.\r\n\r\nTechnical: \r\nBacterial polysaccharides are an important class of aqueous soluble polymer found in a range of natural environments and industrial contexts. The chemical structure and properties of bacterial polysaccharides are extremely diverse. Yet, the functional rheological properties of these materials are broadly mediated by the interplay between the bacterial polysaccharide's properties as a polymer and as an associating species. At the same time, genetic engineering and chemical substitution make bacterial polysaccharides useful polymers for fundamental study because of their controllable charge, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobicity. Thus, the connection between the associative structure and rheology of all aqueous soluble polymers can be better understood by fundamental study of bacterial polysaccharides. This project will generate this new understanding through three research aims that involve light scattering, microrheology, and constitutive modeling. This research will be accompanied by an educational plan that involves graduate student training and mentoring. The participation of the PI in a summer research opportunities program and in outreach activities that engage middle school girls in science and engineering is part of this award.",

This project generated new understanding through the use of light scattering, rheology, microrheology, flow velocimetry and constitutive modeling.  This research work was accompanied by the design and execution of outreach activities that engaged middle school girls in science and engineering.  Specific projects outcomes were: (i) a report of the viscosity of semidilute solutions of a bacterially synthesized polysaccharide &ndash; a partially deacetylated poly-N-acetylglucosamine &ndash; as measured by microrheology.  This polymer, commonly called polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), is synthesized by Staphylococcal strains; it is a principal component of the biofilms of these bacteria.  We showed that the concentration-dependent viscosity of PIA at a pH in which it is associated can be predicted using a well known semi-quantitative theory for entangled polymers; (ii) we furthermore reported that aqueous solutions of chitosan display a regime of shear thinning at low shear rates that is consistent with the existence of a plateau or yield stress.

The plateau stress was found to depend on the dimension of the gap in rotational flow between parallel plates; direct measurement of the velocity profile in these flows identified a correlation between the plateau stress and the observation of shear banded flow; (iii) we reported a study of psyllium rheology.  Psyllium is a polysaccharide extracted from plant seeds and is commonly used as a dietary fiber supplement.  Upon mixing with water, psyllium powders swell to form a gel phase; by using a fluorescent dye that binds with the psyllium grains, we visualized the hydration-induced expansion of psyllium powder and husk grains. We found that gel stability is higher in psyllium materials that exhibit faster gelation kinetics.
