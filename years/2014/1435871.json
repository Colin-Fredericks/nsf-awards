 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, a group of investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic Ocean expedition will study the distribution of a variety of trace elements in seawater, sea ice, and marine air. It is important to understand where they are and how they move in the Arctic because some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. This multi-institutional team of ocean trace element experts will focus its attention on the importance of aerosol, precipitation, and sea ice melt water in trace element cycling. Results from this work will be disseminated through public educational initiatives, such as web communications and outreach to members of the public, including indigenous populations in Alaska. The project will also provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in biology and chemistry. \r\n\r\nAtmospheric deposition is an important pathway and transport mechanism of both natural aerosols and contaminants to the ocean. Relative to other regions, atmospheric deposition rates in the Arctic are low and aerosols and dissolved chemicals in precipitation may be deposited directly to the sea surface or, unique to polar regions, onto sea ice. Given the unique biogeochemical processes of the region and its rapid changes in response to global climate change, quantifying the current atmospheric deposition of trace elements and isotopes to differing catchments (ocean, sea ice, and melt ponds) in the Arctic is critical to our ability to predict how their distribution may evolve over time. In this study, aerosol, precipitation, and melt water samples will be collected and analyzed for trace elements and isotopes in order to evaluate the impacts on the surface ocean and sea ice chemistry from natural and anthropogenic aerosols. Through this project, collected atmospheric samples from the Arctic will also be made available for distribution to the broader scientific community.",

Significant reductions in sea ice extent and thickness and enhanced runoff from the surrounding continents have occurred in response to climate warming. Atmospheric transport and deposition of aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the air) is an important mechanism for trace elements from natural and anthropogenic sources from the surrounding continents to enter the Arctic Ocean, affecting the region's changes. While many studies on aerosols over the Arctic have focused on the winter and springtime Arctic haze, fewer studies on aerosols have been conducted over the central Arctic Ocean in summer and fall. During these times, the polar front retreats northwards, reducing the transport of polluted air from mid-latitude sources. Therefore, this period provides a unique window to explore the background composition of the marine atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean. This study aims to characterize trace elements (TEs) in aerosols, particularly iron (Fe), a limiting micronutrient for phytoplankton growth in the ocean, in the marine atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean. Atmospheric sampling was carried out during the US GEOTRACES Western Arctic Cruise (GN01) along a transect of 56&ordm;N-90&ordm;N during August - October 2015 (Figure 1) on the US icebreaker,&nbsp;<span>US Coast Guard Cutter&nbsp;Healy</span>. Among air samples collected on this cruise were size-segregated aerosol particles by a MOUDI sampler, and each MOUDI sample contained ten size-fractions from 0.056 &mu;m to 18 &mu;m in diameter. A total of eight sets of MOUDI samples were collected (M1-M8). The data derived from these size-segregated aerosol samples are crucial for exploring the processes affecting aerosol TEs properties and for estimating atmospheric fluxes of TEs by the dry deposition process. Results from this study show that aerosol Fe concentrations varied with aerosol particle size with a single-mode size pattern, peaking at 4.4 &mu;m in diameter (Figure 2), suggesting that aerosol Fe was from the continental sources around the Arctic Ocean. The input of aerosol Fe through the dry deposition process decreased from 6.1 &mu;mol m<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;yr<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;in the areas of ~56&ordm;N-80&ordm;N to 0.73 &mu;mol m<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;yr<sup>-1&nbsp;</sup>in the regions north of 80&ordm;N. Aerosol Fe solubility was higher in fine particles (&lt;1 &mu;m), which were observed mainly north of 80&ordm;N. This study also shows a significant enrichment of calcium (Ca) in sea spray aerosol (SSA) particles relative to seawater. The extent of this calcium enrichment generally increased with decreasing aerosol particle size in fine particles (defined as particle size &lt; 1.8 &mu;m in diameter). Calcium bound to certain organic compounds and possibly calcareous debris from marine organisms may have contributed to the calcium enrichment in aerosols (Figure 3), reflecting the atmosphere-marine ecosystem interactions in the Arctic Ocean. This project has filled the critical data gap in this region. New measurement data from this study can be used in atmospheric and ocean models to understand better the Arctic Ocean's biogeochemical cycles. This project has provided excellent opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in research. The students have gained new experiences and skills that are valuable for their professional development.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yuan&nbsp;Gao</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1435871/1435871_10321796_1608747985294_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1435871/1435871_10321796_1608747985294_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1435871/1435871_10321796_1608747985294_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Study region and cruise track.
