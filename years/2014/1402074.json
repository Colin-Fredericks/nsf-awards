 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics and physical sciences.  The Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future. This fellowship to Colin T. Kremer involves mathematical modeling of the evolutionary responses of marine organisms to changing global oceans. The host institutions for this fellowship are Yale and Princeton Universities, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. David Vasseur and Jorge Sarmiento. \r\n\r\nMarine phytoplankton (tiny plant-like organisms)contribute roughly half of all annual primary productivity on earth and form the basis of marine food webs.  Rising ocean temperatures affect the growth of marine phytoplankton and thus are having effects on global nutrient cycles.  To survive changing environmental conditions, organisms must adapt or migrate.  This research investigates interactions between ecology and evolution, that is, competition and migration versus mutation and selection, that govern the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton communities. It uses existing numerical ocean circulation models describing physical, chemical, and even ecological processes in the ocean but adds the role of evolutionary processes.  The research synthesizes evolutionary theory, marine ecology, and physical oceanography to study the response of phytoplankton to environmental change using and modifying existing models and exposes the Fellow to interdisciplinary research and training, including career development activities.  \r\n\r\nResults are of interest and are being shared with both scientific and general audiences.  Knowledge gained from research on effects on nutrient cycling and food webs in changing ocean environments can inform policy making. Other outcomes include interactive educational materials and outreach efforts focusing on explaining how scientists use mathematical and computational tools to study the natural world.",
