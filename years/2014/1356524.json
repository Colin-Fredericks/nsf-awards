 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to develop novel computational methods and tools to study microRNA binding interactions and microRNAs' role in gene regulation. Small (~22 nucleotide), non-coding RNAs called microRNAs have been known to regulate genes involved in key aspects of animal development and physiology through binding-interactions with their mRNA targets. Since the first discovery of microRNAs in C. elegans in 1993, a large number of microRNAs have been discovered in metazoan, plants and viruses. Today, microRNAs are known to express ubiquitously in almost all cell types, evolutionarily conserved in most of metazoan and plant species, and potentially regulate more than 30% of mammalian gene products. Understanding of microRNAs' regulatory functions in the fundamental biological processes is thus essential towards gaining a global view of gene regulation, but still at its early stages despite the rapid advances in microRNA biology. The project to study microRNA gene regulation and phenotype development seeks to generate many computational algorithms, which will be converted into software tools. These tools will be subsequently released as open-source and freely available software packages to the scientific community. The research is expected to have great impact on education at all levels. \r\n\r\nThe research will be incorporated into graduate, undergraduate and K-12 education. The research will also be disseminated to the research community, informal science education, and the public to enhance scientific understanding through freely distributed computational tools and web dissemination. In addition, mentoring and outreach for women and girls is planned to help attract more women into interdisciplinary science.\r\n\r\nRNA is emerging as an important part of gene regulatory mechanisms under various phenotypic conditions. With the current unprecedented availability of genome-scale RNA genomics and transcriptomics data, the project seeks to create a set of computational algorithms and statistical methods to model microRNA binding interactions and discover microRNA interaction patterns that will help elucidate many functional roles of microRNAs in gene regulation. The advanced probabilistic model of microRNA binding activities promises to greatly benefit mRNA target recognition under specific phenotypic conditions, lay the foundation for further study of inter-microRNA interactions, and provide insight into microRNAs' functional mechanisms in gene regulation and phenotype formulation. The research is expected to not only advance scientific understanding of microRNAs' role in global gene regulation and phenotype development, but also stimulate interest in developing and advancing efficient computational modeling and data integration methods in the informatics research field. The research information and products will be made available through the project website (http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/miRNA/).",

However, the importance of non-seed regions for miRNA target binding has not been thoroughly studied, neither did the dependency among positions and regions of miRNA-mRNA interactions. Towards miRNA binding site characterization, we have studied CLASH data, which provides the binding data between specific miRNAs and mRNAs. Based on our study, we discovered new features for miRNA binding that were previously unknown. We also developed the computational algorithm and tool TarPmiR to predict miRNA target sites. We subsequently developed a Markov model to characterize position-wise pairing patterns of miRNA-mRNA interactions provided by the CLASH experimental data. We also developed the MDPS algorithm that can take into account both the dependency of neighboring pairing positions and the global pairing information. Based on the trained Markov models for both miRNA specific and general datasets involving all miRNAs, we extracted position-wise binding information specific to a given miRNA that would benefit its target prediction.

Further studying the predicted module shows the principle of miRNA cooperation, which is important for understanding miRNA gene regulation. In the past decade, dozens of computational methods have been developed to predict miRNA target sites.

We therefore also developed the computational algorithm and tool CCmiR to predict miRNA targets that take into account the competition and cooperation between miRNAs.

Our study suggested the existence of common regulatory mechanisms shared by GSs from individual cancer types and across cancer types, which shed light on the discovery of new prognostic GSs in cancers and the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of cancers.</p>\n<p>Broader Impact:</p>\n<p>The obtained research results have been incorporated into graduate, undergraduate education.
