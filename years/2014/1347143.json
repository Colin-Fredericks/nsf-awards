 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy is a fully international endeavor; we all share the same sky. To participate in the international scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with researchers from around the world.  Every three years, the International Astronomical Union has a General Assembly accompanied by topical symposia, joint discussions, working groups, and business meetings.  The next such meeting, in August 2015, will be held in Hawaii and hosted by the US (the last US-hosted meeting was in 1988).  In order to ensure a vigorous participation by the US astronomical community, this award will fund small travel grants to approximately 200 US astronomers.  Preference will be given to early-career astronomers, astronomers from less-endowed institutions, and astronomers playing an active role in the governance of the IAU and the conduct of the associated symposia.  Scientists supported by this program will come from a wide range of educational institutions, museums, planetariums, etc.  The experiences they gain from this meeting will be shared with a broad segment of the US population, exposing them to the global nature of astronomy and the importance of international collaboration to the advancement of science and technology.\r\n\r\nThe small travel grant program will be administered by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the principal professional organization for US astronomers.  They have very successfully and economically administered similar programs in the past, and the proposed procedures ensure that these funds will provide the maximum benefit to the astronomical community at minimal cost.  The AAS will solicit proposals, select awardees, issue funds to be used for airfare only, collect receipts and meeting reports from the grantees, and prepare a final assessment and report on the entire program.",
