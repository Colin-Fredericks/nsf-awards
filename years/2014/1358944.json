 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor provides fifteen undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in high energy physics at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures to learn to understand the nature of international scientific collaborations and the questions and methods of modern physics research. By the end of the program, every student will have given a formal presentation, which will be recorded on video and posted on the CERN website.\r\n\r\nThis project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer five high school teachers from across the U.S. are exposed to the world of research at CERN.  The teachers will use their experience to motivate their students to better understand the physical world and prepare them to become the future generation of scientists. Teachers also share teaching methods with teachers from other countries.\r\n\r\nThis REU and RET site will have a number of broader impacts. The U.S. has a significant stake and financial investment in the CERN research program. Therefore, it is very appropriate that U.S. undergraduate students and high school teachers are involved in research and learning opportunities at CERN. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students and teachers from groups underrepresented in physics to ensure that this valuable international research experience is accessible to a diverse group of future physicists and high school teachers who train future physicists.",

This program has been organized by the University of Michigan since 2001. Special efforts are made to encourage applications from institutions with a significant minority representation. For this grant period (2014-2016), 47 outstanding students were selected from more than 600 applicants.&nbsp; At CERN, our students become part of the large CERN research community.&nbsp; They are linked to research projects associated with active groups working at CERN. The projects cover subject areas ranging from computer science to high energy physics and involve both theoretical and experimental activities. They received individual mentoring in their research groups and developed a unique set of skills based on their research projects. They help with designing and building detectors, analyzing the data collected, and working on new theoretical models to interpret the data. Some of the projects have a direct impact on society. For example, one of our students developed an augmented reality mobile application for the ALICE detector. This app provides a virtual reality interface to the general public for the ALICE detector and allows people to have a virtual tour of the detector and understand its detection principles. It supports multiple languages and can also be modified for other detectors.</p>\n<p>In addition, students were required to attend the CERN summer student lecture series. The lectures were given by experts with topics ranging from accelerator physics, detector, theory, nuclear physics, neutrino physics, cosmology, physics analysis techniques, to medical physics.&nbsp; Students also had the opportunity to tour a few major research facilities such as the LHC accelerator, ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb detectors.
