Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Tarek M. Elgindi is \"Local and Nonlocal Effects in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Princeton University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Peter Constantin.",
