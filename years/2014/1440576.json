 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic organisms not only swim in water, they use the flow patterns generated by other organisms and objects to orient themselves, to catch prey, to find mates, and to save energy. To understand how animals use and sense flow scientists must integrate fluid dynamical, sensory, and locomotory research. In recent years, fluid dynamic analysis and neuromechanics of aquatic locomotion have made large methodological progress. This symposium will facilitate and enhance the exchange of expertise at an exciting frontier of cross-disciplinary research. This symposiums will bring researchers together to integrate research across multiple systems (copepods, jellyfish, fish), organizational levels (from flow dynamics to sensory systems to muscle mechanics) and approaches (computational modeling, flow analysis, robotics). By bringing together experts in all these areas and disciplines, the symposiums will enable participants to better understand the mechanics behind complex behaviors that rely on flow sensing and flow use.  The symposium is designed to offer a synthesis of ideas while highlighting the work of emerging investigators. Each of four symposium sessions comprises two talks by senior speakers and three talks by junior colleagues. Senior speakers will provide a broad context and build a shared foundational understanding for all the participants across disciplines. The speakers have been selected to offer a mix of disciplines and expertise that has not yet been brought together and that is unlikely to be assembled at the usual annual meetings. The symposium will bring together scientists who share an interest in fluid-structure interaction and flow sensing, yet come at this problem from many different angles, ranging from oceanography to robotics. Additional engagement opportunities at the symposium will be provided during breakout discussions, networking sessions, and coordinated discussions of research opportunities and limitations.  Conference proceedings and publications will be used to disseminate the workshop outcomes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe award was used to support the symposium \"Swimming in Nature\" at the World Congress of Biomechanics in Boston in July 2014.  Although the conference organizers encourage scientists to organize symposia and invite famous speakers, they provide no funds for these symposia.  We used the funds provided through this award to enable eight early-career and international scientists to attend the meeting and to present their work as invited speakers.  The conference is the largest meeting of scientists on the topic of biomechanics in the world, attended by roughly 1800 engineers and life scientists working in comparative and medical biomechanics.  By being hosted at a large conference with a broad scope, our symposium was able to attract speakers across a broad research area, from sensory and neural control of swimming to robotics applications and swimming in swarms.  The symposium brought together 20 researchers, ranging from experimentalist to theorists, biologists to mathematicians and engineers, presenting research on a wide range of swimmers, from organisms, such as copepods, jellyfish, and seahorses, to robots.  The symposium was well attended with more than 100 people in the audience; in fact the symposium had to be moved to a larger room to accommodate the large audience.  The symposium was particularly effective because it allowed early- and mid-career researchers to exchange ideas, many of whom had not met in person before this conference.  The goal of the symposium was to identify areas in which stronger cross-disciplinary collaboration is most likely to advance our understanding of the mechanics of swimming, and to exchange ideas and approaches that allow us to advance our understanding.  Areas of particular interest were \u00e6control of swimming\u00c6 and \u00e6fluid-structure interactions\u00c6.  The symposium led to several collaborative projects being intensified or initiated.  It has so far resulted in one publication and two submitted manuscripts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ulrike Muller"
