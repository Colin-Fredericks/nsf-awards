 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves a significant enhancement in the properties of wood polymer composites (WPCs) by the commercialization of a highly effective bio-based coupling agent made from renewable sources such as plant oils instead of petroleum. By significantly enhancing the properties of WPCs, substantial benefit to society will result by providing new application opportunities for these relatively low cost, light weight biocomposites.  Globally millions of metric tons of WPCs are produced each year.  Currently, WPCs are used for applications that do not require high load bearing characteristics due to limitations in modulus, strength, and creep.  The technical concepts proposed for the Phase I effort are expected to enable higher modulus and strength, by facilitating the use of higher wood flour (WF) loadings, as well as lower deformation by introducing crosslinks into the matrix phase.  Although this proposal is focused on the utility of these novel bio-based copolymers as high performance coupling agents, these copolymers have also been demonstrated to be excellent binders for coatings.  Thus, commercialization of these copolymers is expected to have a broader impact on society beyond use as coupling agents.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will determine the feasibility of novel bio-based polymers to serve as highly effective coupling agents for WPCs.  The most common WPCs are based on WF as the dispersed-phase and high density polyethylene (HDPE) as the matrix.  WF is a very desirable reinforcement for composites because it is inexpensive, abundant, biodegradable, high modulus, high strength, light weight, and non-abrasive toward processing equipment. The major technical challenge for HDPE/WF composites is obtaining adequate compatibility between the WF fibers and the HDPE matrix.  Although the modulus and tensile strength of WF fibers is approximately 40 and 20 times higher than that of the HDPE matrix, respectively, the mechanical property enhancements provided by the WF cannot be fully realized without effective compatibilization.  It is the team?s belief that the bio-based polymers proposed for the project possess the ideal chemical composition for effectively coupling the HDPE matrix to the WF fibers to maximize mechanical properties.  In addition, the polymers are capable of introducing crosslinks into the matrix phase, which are expected to reduce polymer creep.  For the Phase I project, the effect of the chemical composition of the bio-based coupling agent will be a primary factor investigated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original objective of the project was to investigate the utility of novel plant oil-based polymers for use as highly effective coupling agents for wood plastic composites.  Early on in the project, it was discovered that the polymers underwent oxidative crosslinking when stored at ambient conditions as the pure material.  This feature was found to be problematic for use as a coupling agent for wood plastic composites.  While this feature was undesirable for use as a coupling agent, it was hypothesized that it would be desirable for paints and coatings.  Thus, with approval from NSF, the scope of the project was changed and the novel plant oil-based polymers were investigated as binders for one-component, ambient-cure paints and coatings.\n\n \n\nTo determine the utility of the plant oil-based polymers as binders for one-component, ambient-cure coatings, a series of polymers were synthesized in which polymer molecular weight and the type of plant oil starting material was varied.  Coating solutions were produced from these polymers, films cast on steel panels, and the curing characteristics and cured film properties determined.  For comparison purposes, coatings derived from three different commercially available alkyd resins were also produced and characterized.  Alkyd resins were chosen as the benchmark for the study because these they represent the only class of commercially available coating resins/binders that can be used to produce one-component, ambient-cure coatings.  One-component, ambient-cure coatings are highly desired because they do not require the applicator to combine two or more components at specified ratios prior to coating application nor do they require heat or radiation to induce curing.  The ability to produce one-component, ambient-cure coatings with the novel plant oil-based polymers and alkyd resins is the result of their curing mechanism.  Both alkyd resins and the novel plant oil-based polymers cure/crosslink by autoxidation.   \n\n \n\nThe results of the investigation showed that the novel plant oil-based polymers provided coatings the exhibited dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness compared to analogous coatings derived from commercial alkyd resins.  In addition, cured films of the plant oil-based polymers possessed dramatically higher Young\u00c6s moduli and tensile strength compared to cured films of the alkyd resins.  In general, the properties of the cured plant oil-based polymers appeared to be more akin to the properties of two-component epoxy-amine coating binder systems than alkyd resins.  As a result, a series of epoxy-amine-based coatings were produced and characterized and the results compared to the coatings based on the plant oil-based polymers.  It was found that the plant oil-based polymers provided essentially equivalent chemical resistance and hardness to the epoxy coatings, but with enhanced flexibility and impact resistance.       \n\n \n\nSince the volatile organic compound (VOC) content of paints and coatings is very important with regard to regulatory compliance, the feasibility of producing low VOC coatings using the plant oil-based polymers was investigated.  The method for reducing VOCs involved the use of a reactive diluent.  The results showed that relatively low VOC coatings could be produced that possessed very desirable properties. \n\n \n\nBased on the results obtained from the Phase I project, it appears that the novel plant oil-based polymer technology has a high potential for providing the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive binder systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, the one-component, ambient-cure features of these binder systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and curing. The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, whil..."
