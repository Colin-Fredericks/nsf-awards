 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize an online video-sharing platform that scales math teacher education and training.  The platform embeds a novel pedagogical method that combines gamification, algorithm-based peer review processes, and social learning technologies.  The platform allows aspiring and new math teachers to develop and hone their teaching skills through frequent practice, observation of self, observation of others, and peer and expert feedback loops. The goal for the project is to beta test a prototype of the platform, collect survey responses, and iterate the prototype in response to the users' experience.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project is to provide a platform for math teachers dispersed across the U.S. to learn from each other and strengthen their teaching skills by providing multiple opportunities for the teachers to practice skills, observe themselves, observe and collaborate with other teachers, and learn from mentors. Each of these steps has been identified as critical to effective teacher training.  Recent meta-analyses of research show that teacher professional development has a significant positive effect on student achievement.  Compared to 60 world education systems, the U.S. ranked ninth in fourth grade math and twelfth in eighth grade math.  The proposed training platform is an innovative response to the need for low-cost, high-scale math teacher training.  Investing in innovative math teacher education and training will foster higher student achievement in math and consequently, fill existing high skill jobs, spur innovation, and play a role in the growth of the U.S. economy.",
