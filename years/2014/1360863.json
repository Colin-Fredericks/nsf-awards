 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\nWith support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the primary focus of this proposal is to grow single crystals of lanthanide intermetallics with unusual magnetic and electrical properties for energy applications. The growth of single crystals is necessary to determine properties of novel magnetic materials. This is motivated by understanding unusual magnetism thereby decreasing our dependence on critical elements. The single crystal growth aspects of this proposal will enable students involved in the project to determine and characterize the structures of new materials and elucidate intrinsic properties of the new compounds. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe goal of this project is to discover and grow high quality single crystals of intermetallics for magnetic, electrical, and transport applications, in particular compounds with unusual ground states and competing magnetic interactions.  Several classes of materials containing lanthanide, mid-transition metals, and Group 13-14 elements are proposed. The research team will synthesize compounds adopting the CaCo2Al8 structure type and determine the structural stability of LnMxGa3, Ln4MGa12 (Ln = Lanthanide, M = Cr, Mn, Fe), and ScFeGa5 allowing for the creation of a delicate balance between dissimilar ground states, especially in materials supporting strongly correlated or quantum-mechanical interactions among the electrons.  Furthermore, the growth of complex stannides will enable the study of compounds exhibiting low lattice thermal conductivities. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will have the opportunity to synthesize and characterize new compounds and measure magnetic and electrical properties of the compounds they discovered in the lab.",
