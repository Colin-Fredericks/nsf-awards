 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combinatorics is a growing and important area of mathematics. The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to continuous) sets of objects. Combinatorics is critical to many areas of mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering applications. In part due to the legacy of Paul Erdos, combinatorics is a research field driven by collaboration. In order to provide graduate students in combinatorics a collaborative research opportunity and nurture long-lasting research collaborations, we will organize the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Workshop Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics. \r\n\r\nThis award will support the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Workshop Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC), which will be held in Denver, CO from July 28th-August 8th, 2014, will involve approximately 30 graduate students, 4 postdoctoral researchers and 10 faculty in an intense two-week collaborative research experience.  Participants will work to solve important, relevant problems from graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory, finite geometry and other modern sub-disciplines of combinatorics.  Students will prepare open problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of a faculty mentor from the organizing committee, which consists of faculty from the University of Colorado Denver, University of Denver, Iowa State University, the University of Wyoming and the University of Nebraska Lincoln. These problems will then either be presented at the workshop by their proposers or hosted on the workshop's secure problem wiki, and will be worked on by small groups of participating students, postdocs and faculty.  For more information about the GRWC, including a detailed description of the workshop format please see the workshop website at http://sites.google.com/site/rmgpgrwc .",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     The first Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (henceforth GRWC) was held from July 27-August 9th 2014 in Denver, CO.  Co-hosted by the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Denver and co-organized with Iowa State University, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Wyoming, the GRWC brought together 32 doctoral students, 4 postdoctoral researchers and 10 faculty from 13 different institutions for an intensive collaborative research experience in mathematics.  In addition to conducting research on open problems from numerous subdisciplines of combinatorics, a branch of mathematics concerned with networks, set systems, and other discrete structures, participants took part in professional development sessions and a number of planned activities that allowed them to bond and network with both their peers and participating faculty.   In its entirety, all of the GRWC activities aimed to meet the central workshop goals of (a) providing a high quality research experience for participants and (b) helping participating students and postdocs build durable social-professional networks that will support and positively impact their future careers.\n\n            All graduate students applying to participate in the GRWC were required to submit an open problem in combinatorics.  These problems formed the basis of the collaborative research undertaken at the workshop.  Students were then provided a faculty or postdoctoral mentor to provide input into their problems and help refine them to meet the workshop standards of quality and accessibility.  The process of developing, proposing and refining a research problem for an audience of peers is a critical skill, necessary for future research quality and independence.  In addition to the opportunity to work on serious research problems in collaborative groups, a number of other formal and informal training and PD activities were central to the GRWC design or held as workshop activities.  These included leadership and mentoring opportunities for participating postdocs, and professional development workshops on grant writing and the academic job search.\n\n                The faculty leadership selected 22 students to present their proposed problems, which were then worked on by small groups of participants.  Currently 6 papers have been submitted, with 3 others nearing submission and several other projects still in progress.  The 9 papers that are submitted or will be shortly include 25 of the 36 participating graduate students and postdocs as co-authors (several multiple times).  Preprints of all submitted papers, along with a list of participants and more information about the workshop format, are available on the GRWC website, https://sites.google.com/site/rmgpgrwc/home.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Ferrara"
