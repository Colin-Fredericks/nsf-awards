 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large bodies of research examine why states construct and ratify international legal agreements. Yet relatively little research assesses the conditions under which states are likely to go further and incorporate international legal rules into their domestic laws. This study contributes to our understanding of why and when states incorporate international accords into their legal systems through examination of criminal prohibitions against genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and torture. These norms are designed to work primarily through domestic courts, so in order to fulfill their function, states must pass criminal laws that define and allow their courts to prosecute these offenses. This research will produce a new, publicly available dataset on the worldwide spread of anti-atrocity laws since World War II. Through analysis of the patterns by which these laws have been adopted, this research will shed new light on more general mechanisms that facilitate the implementation of international law.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this study hypothesizes that states are likely to implement anti-atrocity laws during large-scale processes of criminal code reform, because such reforms empower legal experts to identify and codify laws - like anti-atrocity laws - that they believe embody how a modern criminal code should look. To test this argument against a variety of alternatives drawn from the literatures on human rights and norm diffusion, this study uses time-series statistical analyses of an original and comprehensive dataset on the spread of national criminal laws against genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and torture since 1945. To verify and further probe the causal mechanisms underlying the statistical results, this study investigates a single case that is particularly puzzling for existing theories, that is Guatemala's adoption of these laws in 1973.",

When countries adopt these &ldquo;atrocity laws,\" it allows their domestic courts to prosecute their own &ndash; and in some cases, other countries&rsquo; &ndash; government and military officials for these offenses. It is thus puzzling why national governments would adopt these laws at all given the risks they pose to government interests in terms of potentially subjecting officials to criminal accountability or disrupting diplomatic relations.</p>\n<p>To shed light on this puzzle, this study combined the collection of various types of original data and the application of multiple analytic methods. First, this study involved the collection of a new dataset on the adoption of national criminal laws against war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in every country in the world that has adopted them between 1945 and 2014. This dataset is the first of its kind and will be publically available. This study used various statistical methods to analyze these data and, for the first time, to identify broad patterns in the adoption of these laws over time. Second, original historical research was conducted into the origins of international efforts by criminal law professionals to promote the adoption of national atrocity laws. Third, fieldwork was conducted in Guatemala, including interviews with legal experts and the collection of archival sources, to investigate that country&rsquo;s 1973 adoption of atrocity laws. Guatemala is a particularly puzzling case of adoption of atrocity laws, given that at the time, civil society there was weak and the government was implicated in widespread atrocities. Therefore, the findings from the Guatemala case may be particularly helpful for understanding other cases of atrocity law adoption.</p>\n<p>This study produced the following main findings. First, adoption of atrocity laws is widespread, though geographically uneven. About two-thirds of countries have adopted national criminal laws against genocide and war crimes each, and about one-third of states have adopted national criminal laws against crimes against humanity. However, rates of adoption are much higher in some regions than others. Specifically, countries in Europe the Americas have high rates of adoption, while adoption among African countries, though lower than Europe and Latin America, has nonetheless been steadily increasing since the 1990s. However, adoption in Middle Eastern, South Asian, and East Asian countries remains low. Second, technocratic criminal law experts have played a crucial role in the global spread of these laws. Of those states that have adopted domestic atrocity laws, just under half have done so not through targeted legislation, but as part of broader processes of large-scale reform of their national criminal codes. When countries decide to reform their criminal laws, they typically rely on criminal law experts who are not policymakers themselves but who possess the necessary expertise to redesign legal codes. The work these experts undertake naturally promotes an impulse to copy legal norms from foreign and international sources, and in the post-World War II era, the dynamics of this type of copying have been particularly conducive to the adoption of national atrocity laws. Ultimately, the technocratic context around processes of large-scale reform helps depoliticize provisions, like atrocity laws, that otherwise would have faced greater scrutiny had they been considered as standalone legislation. In-depth research into the case of Guatemala confirmed that this explanation can account for that country&rsquo;s otherwise puzzling adoption of atrocity laws. That is, professional dynamics among the drafters of the 1973 code led them to include atrocity laws in their draft, and the technocratic context around reform helped deflect scrutiny of these laws.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond these specific findings, this study advances our general knowledge of the conditions under which international legal norms spread around the world. Scholars agree that international legal norms are more likely to be effective when they are institutionalized directly into formal domestic laws and institutions. Yet there has been relatively little research into the conditions under which states legislate international law into domestic law. Existing research on the spread of international human rights norms in particular has so far focused heavily either on pressure from domestic and international civil society organizations or the strategic use of these norms by government leaders. This study highlights the importance of another class of actors &ndash; technocratic legal experts &ndash; and suggests that further research on the spread of international legal norms in general and human rights norms in particular should seek to better understand the political and professional dynamics around the influence of these actors. Finally, this study&rsquo;s findings also contribute to the work of organizations and governments advocating for the domestic institutionalization of global human rights norms by providing these actors with knowledge of how these norms come to be adopted, which can help them more effectively target their advocacy efforts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Berlin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
