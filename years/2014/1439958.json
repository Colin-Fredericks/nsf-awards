Funds will be used primarily to support participants (early career faculty, students and postdocs) from the USA, with any residual funds used to support attendees from underdeveloped countries.  The EM workshop will allow for focused presentations and discussion on the methodological advances, including instrumentation, data processing, inversion, and interpretation practice for electromagnetic Earth imaging.  EM measurements provide a unique view of the Earth because of the sensitivity of electrical conductivity to temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and lithologic variations. This sensitivity makes EM methods useful in a wide range of investigations, addressing both applied and basic science questions, from the very near surface to the deep mantle. EM methods are increasingly used for off-shore petroleum exploration and find application to, waste site assessment, aquifer mapping and vulnerability studies, exploration for construction materials, building and utility investigation, and unexploded ordinance (UXO) detection and discrimination. \r\n\r\n***",

Participation of students in this meeting (significantly enhanced by this grant) is a critical component in developing a new generation of first-rate researchers and applied practitioners.   With an aggressive strategy of advertising availability of funds for US students we have significantly increased participation of US students.   This is likely to pay important dividends down the road with regard to human resources in this important but esoteric geophysical specialty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary D Egbert"
