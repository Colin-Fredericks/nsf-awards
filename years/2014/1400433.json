 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in medical devices, medical instrumentation and information technology, coupled with reforms in patient care and record-keeping, have created a demand for electronics technicians with specializations in the installation, maintenance and repair of biomedical equipment and devices and the computer networks that connect them.  Working with an advisory board made up of representatives from hospitals, clinics, health systems and educational institutions in the greater Philadelphia area, the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP) will establish a program in Biomedical Equipment Technology (BMET).   The BMET program will provide students with multiple entry and exit points by offering a curriculum composed of two stackable (sequential) proficiency certificates that can lead to attainment of an associate's degree.  Students will be prepared for direct entry into the workforce by completing either of the proficiency certificates or the associate's degree.  Graduates of the associate's degree program will also be qualified for transfer into a baccalaureate program.  One particularly key transfer pathway option is the bachelor's program in Biomedical Engineering Technology at Drexel University, also located in Philadelphia and one of the academic institutions participating on the BMET program advisory board.   As CCP is a Predominantly Black Institution, the BMET program will enhance STEM workforce diversity.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance knowledge and understanding in the emerging field of BMET education through the development and evaluation of the program, with its two stackable proficiency certificates and associate's degree options.  Establishing the BMET program will include modernizing an existing curriculum for an Electronics Engineering Technology program by infusing learning experiences that emulate the highly networked environment of medical equipment, medical devices and computers in hospitals and other healthcare environments.  Program development will include creating the four new courses of Digital Electronics, Semiconductor Devices, Medical Devices and Medical Devices in a Networked Environment. Through formal coursework, laboratory exercises and internships, students in the BMET program will gain hands-on experiences with state-of-the-art medical equipment and devices.  Project outcomes will be evaluated by utilizing a variety of methods.  Institutional data gathered from course level student learning outcomes and the annual Quality and Viability Indicators review that all CCP program undergo will be combined with appraisal by the advisory board to evaluate the impact of the program on students and the institution.  Surveys of employers and tracking of program graduates will provide information regarding the impact of the program to provide students pathways into technical career and in meeting the needs of the workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn response to growing industry need in the Greater Philadelphia region and with ongoing input from an Advisory Board consisting of regional hospitals, health systems, and educational partners, Community College of Philadelphia has established a Biomedical Equipment Technology (BMET) program. Biomedical Equipment Technicians are responsible for the testing and repair of medical equipment used in hospitals and must have an understanding not only of the operating principles of a wide range of medical devices, but also the knowledge to utilize specialized test equipment.  BMETs must be able to work with both medical personnel and Information Technology specialists in order to resolve equipment-related problems, and so must have a basic knowledge of each area as well.\n\n \n\nThe program we developed consists of two stackable proficiency certificates leading to an associate?s degree, fully preparing students for employment as biomedical equipment technicians in the broader field of Healthcare Technology Management (HTM).  By applying a stackable credentials model, with multiple entry and exit points, we have demonstrated that the traditional requirement of the Associate?s Degree for entry level employment in the field can be modified in order to address the high level of demand for entry level BMETs, both regionally and nationally.\n\n \n\nEach certificate level includes a 200-hour internship.  Upon completion of the level 1 certificate over 90% of the students were considered qualified to be hired as entry level BMETs by their industry internship supervisors.  About half of students have found employment in the field within 4 months of completing their level 1 certificate. \n\n \n\nOffering a short-term certificate appears to also be a good strategy for retention.  Of our first two cohorts, 85.2% of those who completed the level 1 certificate have either completed, or are actively working toward completion, of the level 2 certificate, and 77.8% have either completed or are actively working toward completion, of the Associate?s Degree.  Out of the cohort 3 students who competed the level 1 certificate, 76.5% are actively pursuing the Level 2 certificate and/or the Associate?s Degree, and only 3 months after completion, at least 50% are working in the field. \n\n \n\nEmployment as a BMET offers a sustainable career, with opportunities for advancement both in terms of specialization and increase in general knowledge and skill level.  There are also opportunities to take on greater leadership roles in the wider HTM field.  The program has created opportunities for underrepresented groups to enter a STEM field.  Of students enrolled in the first 3 cohorts, 63.6% were minority and 21.5% women (informal survey indicate that approximately 10% of those working in the field are women). \n\n \n\nIn addition, we have developed recruitment approaches that have enabled us to exceed our initial enrollment goals in a field that most people are unaware of.  (Money Magazine called BMET one \"of the 5 best jobs you?ve never heard of\" in their January 13, 2015 issue.)  We have successfully mentored students, resulting in a high level of retention in the program.  We have also successfully recruited and mentored instructors who are actively working in the HTM field. \n\n \n\nOur results will be of interest to other BMET educators, educators in other engineering technology fields, as well as to faculty at our own institution who are developing new programs.  We have disseminated our findings among BMET educators at conferences of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, as well as other engineering technology educations at conferences of the American Association for Engineering Education and the High Impact Technology Exchange Conference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randy Libros"
