 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multi-functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) I/UCRC is motivated by three major research/industry trends: 1.) Stepping beyond the current challenge of continued conventional scaling of integrated circuits (Moore?s Law); 2.) Exploring new functionalities at intersections of materials, processes, devices, and circuits for multi-functional systems; and 3.) Integrating nanoscale materials into micro/nanosystem manufacturing.  Through industry-driven collaborative research initiatives, interdisciplinary mixing will be promoted at the MIST Center in order to catalyze innovation opportunities such as combinations of computing, sensing, actuation, and energy storage/generation on the same system on a chip (SoC) or system in package (SiP). The MIST Center intends to contribute to the definition of the roadmap to next-generation integrated electronic systems.\r\n\r\nResearch at the MIST Center aims to link industry and academia and connect research advances in materials science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics, microfluidic devices, MEMS, and circuits to societally relevant technologies. The proposed MIST I/UCRC plans to integrate a strong team of complementary investigators, train the next generation of graduate students who are versed in the center?s precompetitive research, actively recruit and mentor participants from underrepresented groups in science and engineering drawing on programs at each center site, and team with industrial member companies, governmental agencies, and associations.",

Approximately 94% of the membership fees are used to directly support research of interest to the member organizations. Fig. 3 illustrates key milestones achieved by the MIST Center: 17 member organizations (+2 alumni), $3M in direct research expenditures (71 projects over five years), 79 pre-publication submissions to the industry advisory board, 12 invention disclosures (6 patents licensed), 88 graduate students, 61 undergraduates, and three participating universities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impact of this research focuses on building collaborative multi-organization research networks, pre-collegiate and undergraduate educational/training activities, and broadening the diversity of research participants.
