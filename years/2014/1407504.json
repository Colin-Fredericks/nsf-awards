 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many phenomena that arise in statistical physics, engineering and biology are modeled by stochastic processes that are constrained to live within a domain.  This proposal aims to further develop the theory of such processes, with three concrete application areas in mind.   The first area concerns random networks that arise in biology, manufacturing, and other service systems when they operate near capacity.  The performance of these networks can often be described by diffusions that are constrained to have nonnegative components.  A second area is in mathematical finance, where the advent of electronic exchanges driven purely by the flow of orders has revolutionized the method by which prices are formed.  The price process in a model of strategic agents who place buy and sell limit orders can be better understood by studying a class of constrained processes.  The third area involves the study of scaling limits of random matrices, which arise in many areas, including physics and engineering.  The gaps between the eigenvalues of some classes of high-dimensional random matrices, when properly scaled, can be shown to be approximated by constrained multi-dimensional diffusions with singular drift.  The proposal seeks to develop a unified theory for the construction and study of these processes, and to examine their implications for the described applications.   Another theme of the proposal involves the study of planar obliquely reflected diffusions.  Planar stochastic processes have been the focus of active research over the last two decades.  Finally, the proposal also has a substantial educational component that includes training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students, as well as new course development.  It also entails a broader effort that coordinates several graduate students in outreach activities aimed at communicating mathematics to a broader audience.\r\n\r\nThis is an interdisciplinary proposal that focuses on several problems in probability that require substantial use of analytical techniques.   The first theme concerns various aspects of obliquely reflected diffusions, including the construction and properties of obliquely reflected Brownian motions in bounded planar domains, and also excursion reflected Brownian motion which arises in the boundary theory of Markov processes.  It also involves the development of a common framework for the analysis of diffusions with both reflection and singular drift, large deviations of semimartingale reflected Brownian motions and a free boundary problem related to a two-dimensional reflected Brownian motion.  These are motivated by applications in queuing networks, biology, and mathematical finance.   The tools that will be used intersect with several areas of mathematics including analysis (in particular, complex analysis, conformal mappings, harmonic analysis, functional analysis,  partial differential equations and free-boundary problems).  There are also implications of this work for mathematical physics, specifically the study of repulsive particle models associated with random matrices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: \n\nIn this project we shed light on several problems at the interface of stochastics and analysis, including properties of reflected diffusions, stability of interacting particle systems and mixing times of Markov chains with a continuous state space.  Below we elaborate on some of the key results.\n\nReflected or constrained diffusions are stochastic processes that behave like diffusions in the interior of a domain, but are restricted to live inside the domain by a constraining force that is restricted to act along (a possibly multi-valued) vector field specified on the boundary of the domain.  They are useful for describing the dynamics of stochastic processes arising in many applications, including fluctuations in stochastic networks and biochemical reaction networks, eigenvalues of random matrix processes, and in mathematical finance.  Furthermore, in many of these applications, the boundary of the domain fails to be smooth, which complicates the analysis.   We established several fundamental properties of these processes, including a characterization of reflected diffusions and their invariant distributions in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries, and also developed a novel construction of obliquely reflected Brownian motions in planar domains using complex analysis and conformal mappings and complex analysis.  As a by-product we also produced a new characterization of reflected Brownian motions in the unit disc.  The latter provides a probabilistic construction of solutions to certain elliptic partial differential equations in domains with rough boundaries, for which no analytical approach was previously available. In another direction, we also initiated a study of sensitivities of reflected diffusions to the parameters that define them.  In applications, performance measures of interest can often be represented as the expectation of a  functional of the path of a corresponding reflected diffusion.   When there is uncertainty in the parameters of the reflected diffusion (possibly due to uncertainty in the modeling or due to error in measurement), it is important to be able to estimate the sensitivities of the relevant performance measure to changes in the parameters.  Such sensitivies are also useful for stochastic optimization.  In our work, we developed a new approach to estimating these sensitivities, which is based on characterizing directional derivatives of a certain map, called the Skorokhod map, that is used to construct reflected diffusions.\n\nMany systems arising in science and engineering can be modeled as a large collection of stochastically evolving agents or particles that are weakly coupled by an interaction that depends only the current distribution (or empirical measure) of the particles.   It is of interest to understand stability properties of these systems. \n\nWe consider two kinds of systems.  First, for finite-state particle systems, we study the question of when the process can be made to stay near a desirable operating point, and to be able to estimate the probability of deviation from a neighborhood of this operating point.  In this context, we derived sufficient conditions for stability and also obtained estimates of the probability of making large deviations from a neighborhood of the desired operating state.  Secondly, we introduced a class of  infinite-dimensional processes that describes fluctuations in many-server networks,  which arise in a variety of applications ranging from call centers to communication nnetworks.  We introduced a novel coupling construction to establish ergodicity and existence of a unique invariant measure for the system.    The general approach developed is more broadly applicable to a larger class of models.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  The project is interdisciplinary, with the techniques developed being of relevance for understanding models in many applications, including service engineering and operations research, telecommunications and biochemical reaction networks, and statistical physics.    In addition, the project on obliquely reflected Brownian motions has interesting connections with complex analysis and harmonic analysis. In particular, it provides a probabilistic approach to an analytical problem for which no purely analytical solution was previously known.\n\nThe project also involved the training of three graduate students, and one post-doctoral fellow, who were all enabled to travel and present their works at conferences, with two of them garnering Best Poster awards.   The PI also disemminated the work widely.  The PI was also active in outreach, by spearheading the Math CoOp, a group dedicated to developing and giving presentations to local elementary, middle and high schools.  And the PI also organized the first WINRS (Women?s Intellectual Networks Research Symposium)  conference in New England, which brought together over 100 researchers in the area (spanning undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows), to exchange their research and develop support networks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kavita Ramanan"
