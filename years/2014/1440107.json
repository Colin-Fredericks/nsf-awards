 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IUCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) proposes renewal as a two-site I/UCRC, comprising personnel and facilities at the Missouri University of Science and Technology and the University of Houston. CEMC's industry sector requires understanding of noise physics, development of innovative measurement and modeling techniques, and formulation of design methodologies. This includes immunity and electromagnetic interference (EMI), which ensures an electronic system: (1) can function in the presence of external electromagnetic noise; and, (2) its EMI does not impact the functionality of other devices. Signal and power integrity design ensures proper circuit operation at high speeds. Phase II efforts will target development of methods for higher frequencies and smaller geometry scales. \r\n\r\nDesign for electromagnetic compatibility is critical in electronics. Good electromagnetic compatibility design is essential to successful product development, customer satisfaction and industry competitiveness. Research outcomes from CEMC in Phase I include 31 students graduated from the center and numerous hires of students by industry members. There were over 50 publications and one spin-off company during Phase I with research results incorporated into university courses, and on-site and on-line company short courses. Research outcomes in Phase II will be disseminated through the center website, publications, technical conferences, short courses, IEEE EMC Society committee activities, spin-off companies, and industry application notes. Demonstrations suitable for motivating interest in K-12 students in technical careers are planned.",
