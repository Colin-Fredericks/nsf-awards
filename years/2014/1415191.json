Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation for local support for graduate students and postdocs attending Strings 2014, and also for partial support of speakers.\r\n\r\nSince the 1980's, meetings in the Strings series have been focal points of the field, with experts from around the world presenting new work and reviewing recent developments. These meetings have a very broad focus, including string theory, its relations to quantum field theory and other areas of physics, the associated mathematics and mathematical physics, and potential applications to particle physics and cosmology. Strings 2014 will follow in this tradition, aiming for a unified presentation of the many strands of modern string theory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to plenary talks, this year the program will include parallel sessions, a poster session, a gong show, and vision talks. The Strings 2014 meeting will also be tied in to a summer school, Prospects in Theoretical Physics (PiTP) that will be held the previous week at the Institute for Advanced Study. The PiTP meeting will help prepare graduate students for the Strings 2014 meeting and it is expected that many students will come for both events.\r\n\r\nThe conference website: http://physics.princeton.edu/strings2014/Home.shtml",
