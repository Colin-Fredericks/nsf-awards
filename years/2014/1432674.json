 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at Washington State University (WSU) will improve learning in undergraduate engineering education by helping to graduate engineers that are capable of applying their knowledge in synthesis of new designs, evaluating design alternatives, and integrating information.  The project will create ultra-low-cost desktop experiments with which engineering students can conduct investigations to learn fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and heat transfer.  Fluid mechanics and heat transfer are areas of engineering science that are studied in many engineering disciplines including aerospace, biomedical, chemical, civil, environmental, and mechanical engineering. The ultra-low-cost of the experiments will make it possible for engaging investigations to be integrated widely throughout fluid mechanics and heat transfer courses.  With a target cost comparable to a textbook, these experiments will make it possible for teams of students to pursue their own investigations of fluids and heat transfer phenomenon.  This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) project will result in an array of simple, inexpensive, easy to use experiments and companion materials that cover fundamental aspects of fluid flow and heat transfer.\r\n\r\nThis project will build on earlier NSF-supported work at Washington State University which established the effectiveness of the use of desktop experiments compared to traditional lectures and laboratories.  Four experiments are planned for manufacture: a venturi nozzle, a pipe flow experiment, a concentric tube heat exchanger, and a shell and tube heat exchanger. The experiments chosen model actual industrial equipment that students can analyze at multiple levels from simple correlations accessible to first year students, to the use of sophisticated engineering principles and tools in advanced course work. The small desk-top experiments will be able to be used in standard classrooms or comparable work areas. To achieve cost and portability targets, the project will utilize design for manufacture techniques and take advantage of new manufacturing modalities such as rapid prototyping through 3-D printing and vacuum forming. Evaluation will assess the direct benefits of the research on student learning outcomes, integrating both qualitative and quantitative data. Data concerning the efficacy of the ultra-low-cost fluid mechanics and heat transfer experiments will be collected and analyzed as part of the project. Conceptual understanding will be measured at several levels of Bloom's taxonomy.  Also measured will be improvements in critical thinking, significant learning based on Fink's taxonomy, and transfer of knowledge to novel situations.  These ultra-low-cost experiments will create opportunities to measure gaps in understanding and student misconceptions.",

We have employed LC-DLM modules as hands-on learning tools in small group classroom settings in mechanical and chemical engineering courses at five different universities including branch campuses and multiple programs across the country. Through several design iterations, reproducible LC-DLMs including pipe flow, head loss, venturi meter, shell and tube and double pipe heat exchangers, and boundary layer visualization modules were created using low-cost 3D printing, vacuum-forming, and injection molding techniques, and, in the case of the boundary layer system, computer aided milling. Construction costs were less than $100 per module, including all necessary ancillary equipment for student experimentation. We evaluated LC-DLM effectiveness by comparing scores on pre- and post-intervention assessments for control groups taught concepts via traditional lecture and intervention groups who used the LC-DLM modules. Results spanning multiple years across several universities show significant improvements in performance for groups exposed to the LC-DLM modules. For example, in an implementation with 90 Mechanical Engineering students, 83% of students exposed to the head loss LC-DLM correctly answered a posttest question regarding the non-linearity of pressure loss in a pipe, compared to only 47% in the lecture-only group. In an implementation of the boundary-layer module in a fluid mechanics and heat transfer course statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) occurred for three out of five test questions after implementation and a majority of student feedback was extremely positive. Finally, in an implementation of the shell and tube heat exchanger, a significant improvement between control and LC-DLM groups occurred for two out of five posttest questions related to choosing an appropriate system boundary and energy conservation. For a majority of assessments questions without a statistically significant improvement between control and DLM groups, students exposed to LC-DLMs performed equally well or marginally better than control groups and student motivation was shown to improve through the use of LC-DLMs. Based on these results, we are confident that LC-DLM modules are useful for teaching fundamental engineering concepts in an interactive manner and improving student understanding.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader impact</span></em> outcomes are numerous. LC-DLMs were successfully implemented at four-year universities and community colleges in eight different degree programs. Over 200 LC-DLM modules have been distributed to participating universities, and many faculty are currently using the modules in their classrooms. LC-DLMs were also demonstrated during the 2017 Chemical Engineering Summer School at held at North Carolina State University and interest was expressed by 15 faculty members who desired to obtain LC-DLMs for their own classrooms. As a result, we are now engaged in an even larger, nationwide dissemination effort via an NSF IUSE follow-on grant. A second related NSF ATE grant allowed expansion of LC-DLM dissemination to Kenai Peninsula College for use in a Process Technology technical program where 60% of the students use LC-DLMs in a distance education mode. Dissemination has occurred through 11 published peer-refereed papers that acknowledge support from this grant, and 16 papers published and/or presented papers for the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) or American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) annual meetings, and several presentations at local on-campus symposia or regional AIChE student chapter meetings. One female PhD student won the ASEE Future Faculty Travel Award and was one of two outstanding graduate research assistants highlighted for her achievements at Washington State University in 2018. One female minority undergraduate, now a PhD student on a follow-on NSF engineering education project, won the 2017 outstanding student AIChE poster award and the 2018 regional student chapter paper award, competed in the 2018 AIChE student paper competition and received an honorable mention as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program applicant. Additional manuscripts are currently in preparation for publication detailing results from LC-DLM implementations in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 academic years. At Washington State University, six Ph.D. students, one postdoctoral associate, five undergraduates, and 17 professors, of which several are females and/or minorities, were involved in the work and received training and professional development in areas related to LC-DLM manufacture, implementation and conceptual rubric and survey development and/or use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bernard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Van Wie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1432674/1432674_10333002_1543529580532_StudentswithDPHtX--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1432674/1432674_10333002_1543529580532_StudentswithDPHtX--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DLM Students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1432674/1432674_10333002_1543529580532_StudentswithDPHtX--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DLM Students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students completing an in-class activity with a double pipe heat exchanger LC-DLM and an associated worksheet.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bernard Van Wie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bernard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Van Wie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DLM Students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1432674/1432674_10333002_1543530246628_HtXSet-up--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1432674/1432674_10333002_1543530246628_HtXSet-up--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shell &amp; tube heat exchanger set-up\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1432674/1432674_10333002_1543530246628_HtXSet-up--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shell &amp; tube heat exchanger set-up\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental set-up with shell and tube heat exchanger module.
