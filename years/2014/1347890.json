 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will test the hypothesis that changes in sulfide and metal alloy mineralogy during peridotite alteration will mobilize and fractionate the PGE, Re and Pb relative to their primary magmatic concentrations. Hydrothermal experiments will constrain the solubility of PGE, Re, Pb in mantle Ni-Fe-Ru-Re bearing sulfides and metal alloys as function of temperature and redox conditions, and evaluate PGE alloy exsolution and PGE-Re fractionation under low sulfur fugacity. The natural sample part of the study will constrain the distribution and fractionation of PGE, Re, Pb in sulfides, alloys and bulk rocks from well characterized abyssal peridotites, as function of redox, alteration, sulfide mineralization and primary composition (fertile versus depleted). Through integration of the experimental and natural sample data this work will constrain the fate of PGE, Re, Pb upon recycling of altered oceanic lithosphere and whether altered peridotites can develop, over time, highly heterogeneous 187Os/188Os and 186Os/188Os ratios between refractory (metal alloys) or mobile (sulfide) reservoirs. This project is a collaborative effort between 2 US institutions, and will promote transfer of technology and expertise on novel analytical techniques to a newly established geochemical facility at USC. Researchers will share a suite of state-of-the art instrumentation including FIB-SEM, FE-EMPA, FE-SEM, LA-ICPMS and synchrotron radiation micro-X-Ray fluorescence. All the data collected will be submitted to the PetDB and IEDA, and will be available to the public through a CIW-hosted data repository. A graduate student from USC will participate towards completion of his PhD studies.\r\n\r\nAltered mantle rocks exposed at the seafloor (called \"serpentinized abyssal peridotites\") contain Ni-bearing metal phases associated with secondary plantinum-group element (PGE) sulfur-bearing minerals (sulfides) and PGE metal nuggets. PGEs have unique physical and chemical properties that are critical to many technological applications. Thus, they are often regarded as strategic metals in a wide range of industries including aerospace and fuel cell technology. The proposed research will significantly advance the currently limited understanding of the effects of high-temperature seawater alteration on the distribution of plantinum-group element sulfides hosted in abyssal peridotites. Moreover, abyssal peridotites provide an important record for understanding the composition and evolution of Earth?s mantle now and in the past. The proposed work is a collaborative experimental and natural sample investigation. Experimental data will define the thermodynamic properties of PGE minerals at conditions relevant to modern deep-sea volcanoes and assess critical details of PGE solubility mechanisms in Fe-Ni-Ru-Re sulfides/alloys at elevated temperature/-pressure conditions. The combined experimental results and natural sample data will lead to a fundamental new understanding on the effects of seawater alteration on the siderophile and chalcophile composition of altered peridotite and its effect on the Os and Pb isotope heterogeneity in the Earth?s mantle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe distribution and concentrations of Platinum Group Elements (PGE: Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd) and Re, and the Re-Os, Pt-Os isotope systems provide important clues on the evolution and processes that take place in the Earth\u00c6s mantle.  Serpentinization happens when mantle peridotite reacts with seawater and has been shown to generate abiogenic reduced carbon species (e.g. methane, ethane, etc.), which may be relevant to the emergence of life.  Fe-Ni metal alloys have been known to catalyze these reactions and are produced from sulfides under reduced serpentinization conditions.  Therefore, there may be links between serpentinization, abiogenic carbon species production and PGE systematics in peridotites as the later are dominantly hosted in sulfides and likely metal alloys. \n\nThis project was designed to test whether PGE, Re as well as Pb are mobilized and fractionated during serpentinization of mantle peridotite, with in situ detailed analyses of sulfides (the main host of PGE) and bulk rock analyses of mantle peridotites and pyroxenites.  We targeted peridotites both with and without Fe-Ni alloys coexisting with sulfides that allowed constraining the range of oxygen and sulfur concentrations during serpentinization.  In the process, we refined a method for in situ analyses of PGE in sulfides by Laser Ablation with a beam size of 10 microns.  We found that Pt is heavily depleted relative to the other PGE in sulfides from serpentinized peridotites, both with and without reduced metal alloys.  Yet the bulk analyses did not reveal any Pt depletion in these rocks.  These data imply that Pt is still present in the peridotite but has mobilized out of the sulfides, and that this is a common feature in serpentinized peridotites.  Detailed analyses of the peridotites with Fe-Ni alloys revealed the presence of \"Pt-nuggets\", micron sized Pt &ndash; rich metal alloys, which confirm Pt mobilization out of the sulfides.  Therefore Pt was mobilized and sequestered in metal alloy phases only a small distance (in the range of few millimeters at best) from the initial sulfide host.  Our observations are best explained by exsolution of Pt out of mantle sulfides during cooling.  Subsequent serpentinization likely aided mobilization of Pt away from the sulfides and segregation in alloy nuggets. The absence of Pt-nuggets in peridotites without metal alloys suggests that the Pt - nuggests likely only survive during the low sulfur fugacity conditions that also preserve the Fe-Ni metal alloys.

Therefore our data does not support the hypothesis that sulfides in the mantle are a major reservoir for Pb. \n\nThis project supported research opportunities for a PhD, a MSc and an undergraduate student, all of whom graduated; also provided partial support for a laboratory technician.  The project resulted in 4 publications thus far, multiple conference presentations, and technology transfer from our collaborators at Carnegie Institute of Washington to the U. of South Carolina for PGE analyses. Most of the data has already been made available to the IEDA database for public access.   These results will inform parallel experimental studies on designing experiments that quantify our observations of Pt mobility and preservation of Pt alloys.   Finally, understanding the mechanisms of PGE mobilization is relevant to the exploration industry as PGE have unique chemical and physical properties and used widely in the industry, from catalytic converters in cars, to catalysts in petroleum industry, electronics and cancer drugs.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t..."
