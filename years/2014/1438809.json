 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Information Sciences and Telecommunications (IST) programs at the School of Information Sciences (SIS) and the Health Information Management (HIM) program at the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) in the University of Pittsburgh are working collaboratively to develop an integrated curriculum on Security Assured Healthcare Informatics (SAHI).  The result is a novel curriculum that comprehensively integrates Health Informatics with Information Assurance (IA) and provide BS, MS and PhD level curriculum enhancements, and a development of integrated facility to foster educational and research activities in SAHI areas.The SAHI curriculum contributes to preparing high caliber professionals with comprehensive HIM and Information Assurance expertise that will help to address the critical and immediate need for a workforce trained to secure America's cyberspace.  The project produces professionals to fill research and employment needs in the Western Pennsylvania region.\r\n\r\nThe SAHI curriculum consists of multiple graduate level SAHI tracks with components focused on Healthcare IT (HIT) within the IST programs, and a track focused on Healthcare Security and Privacy (HS&P) within the HIM program.  BS curriculum is being modified to provide HIT S&P curriculum through course enhancements. A new SAHI track is being implemented by modifying the existing Networks and Security (N&S) track. Finally, the existing BSIS track is being extended to create a SAHI 4+1 FastTrack program that allows a student to earn BS and MS degrees in 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe work is being rigorously evaluated using both formative and summative effectiveness evaluations through extensive reviews and feedback collection.  The Center for Instructional Development and Distance Education will create appropriate evaluation methods according to Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model.",
