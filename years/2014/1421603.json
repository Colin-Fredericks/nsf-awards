 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released in increasing amounts to Arctic surface waters through such disturbances as fire, thermokarst failure, and thawing of permafrost. The investigators hypothesize that newly available soil carbon will be labile to photochemical and microbial attack, and will enhance the degradation of resident DOM in the system resulting in poorer quality DOM exported to the ocean. They plan to develop a mechanistic understanding of these processes by: (A) Determining how fast photochemical reactions and microbial processing will alter resident DOM and the newly-released DOM in surface waters, and (B) Measuring the fate of DOM in surface waters, either as CO2 released to the atmosphere or as organic carbon altered and transported to coastal oceans. This would be accomplished with a series of laboratory experiments to determine rates of photodegradation and microbial processing of DOM from different sources, and a series of landscape comparisons and sampling transects to characterize DOM degradation in small basins and large rivers extending 250-300 km from the headwaters to the Arctic Ocean. By integrating this process-based research with ongoing projects studying the formation of thermokarst failures and the impacts of burning on plant and soil carbon allocation, the investigators will address questions such as whether carbon export from tundra to oceans will rise or fall, how reactive is that exported carbon, and what will be the ultimate impact of impending disturbances, including climate change, on the net carbon balance of the Arctic and its interaction with the global carbon cycle. The investigators will work with several established programs at UNC and UM to (1) recruit women and minority student participation and research in this project specifically from Historically Black Colleges, (2) participate in a workshop on mentoring strategies for minorities, and (3) develop additional outreach activities, including talks to middle and high schools by the PIs, graduate, and undergraduate students. Presentation of data will coordinate with NSIDC and Arctic LTER data management.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientific Merit.  This research project investigated how organic carbon in permafrost soils is converted to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2).  The conversion begins by making organic carbon soluble in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is then oxidized by microbes or sunlight to CO2 and released to the atmosphere.  Overall this conversion accounts for as much CO2 released from lakes and streams (inland waters) to the atmosphere as the net amount of CO2 absorbed by the ocean from the atmosphere.  Thus, the release of DOC from soils to inland waters is an important nexus in the global carbon (C) cycle because the conversion and fate of DOC is to be fully oxidized to CO2 and returned to the atmosphere, or to be partially oxidized as it moves from land through freshwaters to the ocean.  This research found that both complete and partial oxidation pathways of DOC degradation are important for C budgets in the Arctic, where surface water C fluxes from lakes and streams to the atmosphere, and from land to ocean, may be up to 40% of the net land-atmosphere C exchange.  Given that climate warming is accelerating the thaw of permafrost soils, which currently store twice the C found in the atmosphere, understanding controls on the fate of DOC is critical for the debate on whether newly-thawed and exposed arctic soil C will be oxidized to greenhouse gases and create a positive feedback on global warming.  Controls on the oxidation of DOC have been previously attributed to bacterial degradation, but we showed that sunlight oxidized DOC 2 to 15-fold faster than did bacteria in the water column of arctic streams and lakes.  Thus, in contrast to previous assumptions, sunlight-driven processes (i.e., photo-degradation) dominated DOC degradation in arctic inland waters.  For example, photo-degradation of DOC is currently about one third of the total CO2 released from surface waters, and is thus an important, newly measured component of the arctic C budget.   Sunlight will continue to be important for DOC fate in a warming Arctic because permafrost carbon brought to the surface in thermokarst failures (landslides) was more readily converted to CO2 by bacteria when exposed to sunlight (by ~ 40%) compared to permafrost carbon held in the dark.  Finally, we showed that one of the main pathways by which DOC is converted to CO2 by sunlight can also occur in the dark (i.e., in the absence of sunlight in soils and sediments in the Alaskan Arctic).  These findings strongly suggest that both dark chemical (abiotic) degradation mechanisms and photochemical mechanisms are important for C degradation across landscapes. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts.  The Arctic faces increasing disturbance from thawing permafrost and thermokarst failures, and these disturbances will transform the Arctic as previously frozen C participates in the modern C cycle.  However, the tremendous stores of organic C that reside in permafrost layers of arctic and boreal soils must be unfrozen, dissolved, and oxidized before they can feedback to the atmosphere as CO2, a greenhouse gas that can further reinforce global warming on Earth.  This project studied the controls on the degradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from thawing permafrost soils and interacting with resident DOC in surface waters, to understand how newly thawed C will participate in the modern C cycle.  Incorporating photochemical degradation pathways of DOC (e.g., those initiated by sunlight) into models is critical for predictions of how the Arctic C cycle will respond to and perhaps amplify climate change.  Finally, because we tested a large range of DOC concentrations and character across freshwaters, it is likely that sunlight-driven degradation of DOC is substantial in any shallow and unshaded inland surface water, and plays an important role in freshwater carbon cycling outside the Arctic, i.e., in boreal, temperate, or tropical waters.  In addition, this project contributed to teach..."
