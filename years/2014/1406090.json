 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main research goal of this project is to develop a new minimally-invasive technology for thermal treatment of cancerous tumors using high-frequency microwave ablation. According to American Cancer Society estimates, over 1.6 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2013. The top ten cancers with the highest mortality rates are all candidates for microwave ablation. This technology avoids the high costs, invasiveness, prolonged use of general anesthesia and other risks, and long recovery times associated with surgery, which is currently the most common method of treatment of cancer.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of destroying cancerous cells using high-frequency microwaves as well as to develop miniature antennas suitable for minimally invasive delivery of microwave energy to the tumor. The use of nanoparticles to enhance heating efficiency will also be explored. Collectively, these technologies will enable minimally invasive, targeted treatment of tumors that are located nearly anywhere in the body. \r\n\r\nThis project is a prime example of integrating research and education, and fostering diversity in engineering. An 'Expanding Your Horizons' workshop focused on minimally invasive treatment of cancer will be developed for middle-school girls. Each year, a summer research opportunity will be offered to a high school student from the Madison Metropolitan School District Science Research Internship Program. Institutional programs will be leveraged to involve minorities and undergraduates in the research activities. The project will be particularly effective in recruiting and retaining female students in electrical engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate levels due to its emphasis on a health care issue of worldwide significance. All students involved in the project will receive invaluable interdisciplinary training at the interface of electromagnetics and medicine.\r\n\r\nMicrowave ablation employs an interstitial antenna to deliver microwave energy directly into the tumor and heat it to cytotoxic temperatures. The vast majority of prior studies have made use of frequencies below 2.5 GHz, in part due to concerns that smaller penetration depths of electromagnetic waves at higher frequencies would preclude the creation of sufficiently large ablation zones. However, experimental evidence to the contrary has been recently obtained. High-frequency microwave ablation offers a number of advantages that have not yet been explored. First, high-frequency microwave antennas, particularly the novel antenna types and feeding techniques proposed in this project, are radically smaller than their low-frequency counterparts. Second, the desired ablation zone can be achieved much faster in vivo using higher frequencies. Third, the use of high-frequency microwaves enables the development of compact and miniature antenna arrays with customizable heating patterns that are not available from conventional single-element low-frequency antennas. Collectively, these attributes are expected to overcome the shortcomings of existing thermoablative technologies and expand the realm of capabilities of microwave ablation systems to enable minimally invasive, targeted treatment of tumors located nearly anywhere in the body. \r\n\r\nComputational test beds involving hybrid electromagnetic/thermal simulations and physical test beds involving experiments with ex vivo tissue will be employed to accomplish the following research objectives: 1) elucidate fundamental mechanisms of HF MWA and investigate novel interstitial antenna design concepts; 2) investigate nanoparticle-mediated MWA for improving heating selectivity and reducing power requirements; 3) establish the feasibility of using flexible HF MWA antennas for gaining access to the ablation site via a catheter or endoscope; and 4) investigate arrays of HF microwave interstitial antennas for customizing the size and shape of the ablation zone.",

This thermoablative approach to cancer treatment is a promising alternative to surgical resection. MWA avoids the high costs, invasiveness, prolonged use of general anesthesia and other risks, and long recovery times associated with surgery. In comparison to other thermal ablation technologies, MWA achieves higher temperatures, larger ablation volumes, and shorter ablation times. The vast majority of prior MWA studies and all commercially-available MWA systems use frequencies below 2.5 GHz to perform MWA. This is in part due to concerns that smaller penetration depths of electromagnetic waves at higher frequencies would preclude the creation of sufficiently large ablation zones. However, we demonstrated that this argument is not valid and that performing MWA using high-frequency (HF) microwaves (e.g. 10 GHz) results in comparable ablation zone dimensions to those generated using low-frequency (LF) microwaves (e.g. 2.45 GHz). The specific outcomes of this project are categorized into three categories as outlined below:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Proving the efficacy of high-frequency microwave ablation. </strong>We thoroughly investigated the role of frequency in MWA using numerical simulations and <em>ex vivo </em>MWA experiments in perfused and non-perfused tissues. These studies were performed for frequencies ranging from 2 to 18 GHz. As frequency increases, the volume of tissue through which microwave power is absorbed shrinks drastically. For example at 18 GHz, this volume is two orders of magnitude smaller than it is at 2 GHz. However, we demonstrated that higher-frequency microwave ablation produces lesions with volumes comparable to those achieved at lower frequencies, even in strongly perfused environments. These results are significant because higher-frequency microwave ablation enables more flexibility in antenna design, smaller minimum lesion sizes, and more spherical lesions. Our work in this area shows that higher frequency microwave ablation performs as well as microwave ablation performed at conventional frequencies in both non- and strongly-perfused environments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Development of new MWA antennas with reduced invasiveness and omnidirectional heating. </strong>Another major accomplishment of this research project was the development of new minimally-invasive interstitial MWA antennas. These antenna designs offer the potential to significantly reduce the diameters of MWA probes compared to current state-of-the-art thereby reducing their invasiveness. This reduction, however, does not come at the expense of sacrificing performance. In fact, these antennas are capable of producing well defined, nearly-spherical localized ablation zones with lesion sizes that are comparable to what can be achieved using the existing state-of-the-art. Here, we developed four such MWA antenna designs each with its own unique characteristics and attributes. Currently, three U.S. patents are pending on these technologies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Development of new minimally-invasive MWA antennas with directional heating patterns. </strong>Our third major technical accomplishment in this project was the development of new, minimally-invasive interstitial MWA antennas capable of producing directional heating patterns. The vast majority of MWA antennas in use today produce axisymmetric ablation zones. However, there are situations in which an axisymmetric lesion may not be desirable. Clinical examples of these scenarios include hepatic tumors close to the bowel or diaphragm, tumors on the periphery of lungs, renal tumors in the vicinity of the bowel, or breast tumors close to the chest wall. In situations like these, having an antenna that can be placed on the periphery of the tumor generating directional ablation zones may be useful. We developed two different techniques for designing minimally-invasive, MWA antennas capable of producing directional heating patterns. Furthermore, these antenna designs allow for reduction of the MWA probe diameters compared to the state-of-the-art. One U.S. patent is currently pending on this technology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impact:</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the educational activities conducted in this project include the training of graduate students and K-12 students. This work supported the education of three Ph.D. students, one of whom completed his Ph.D. in the last year of this project and two others are well on their way to complete their degrees. Two high-school students (one female) were also involved in research activities during the summers of 2014 and 2016 through the Madison Metropolitan School District High School Science Research Internship Program. The first of the two, Suzanne O'Meara, is now a sophomore at MIT; the second, Brian Yin, is a freshman at UC-Berkeley. The technologies developed in this project resulted in the filing of three U.S. patent applications with a fourth patent application in preparation. The findings of this project were also broadly disseminated. In particular, this work resulted in nine journal papers (five published, two under review, and two in preparation for submission) and 10 conference papers. Moreover, the PIs have also given seven invited talks and seminars related to this project at U.S. and international institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nader&nbsp;Behdad</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406090/1406090_10303544_1511840994813_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406090/1406090_10303544_1511840994813_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ablation zone photographs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406090/1406090_10303544_1511840994813_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ablation zone photographs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Representative images of ablated porcine liver tissue. 25 W of power was applied to the antenna input for five minutes.
