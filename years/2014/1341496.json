 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current oceanographic interest in the interaction of relatively  warm water of the Southern Ocean Circumpolar Deep Water ( CDW) as it moves southward to the frigid waters of the Antarctic continental shelves is based on the potential importance of heat transport from the global ocean to the base of continental ice shelves. This is needed to understand the longer term mass balance of the continent, the stability of the vast Antarctic ice sheets and the rate at which sea-level will rise in a warming world. Improved observational knowledge of the mechanisms of how warming CDW moves across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is needed. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding this dynamical transport, believed to take place by the eddy flux of time-varying mesoscale circulation features, will improve coupled ocean-atmospheric climate models. The development of the next generation of coupled ocean-ice- climate models help us understand future changes in atmospheric heat fluxes, glacial and sea-ice balance, and changes in the Antarctic ecosystems. \r\nA recurring obstacle to our understanding is the lack of data in this distant region. In this project, a number of subsurface profiling EM-APEX floats adapted to operate under sea ice will be launched on up to 4 cruises of opportunity to the Pacific sector during Austral summer. The floats will be launched south of the Polar Front and measure shear, turbulence, temperature, and salinity to 2000m depth for up to 2 year missions while following the CDW layer.",
