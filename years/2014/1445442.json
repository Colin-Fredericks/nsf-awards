The conference is scheduled to be held June 6-9, 2014 in Shanghai, China. The main objective of this proposal is to support participation at the Conference Support for the Second International Workshop on Nano-Micro Thermal Radiation. The workshop will bring together experts in thermal radiative transfer worldwide along with young researchers and students for close interactions and discussions. A short course will be offered in conjunction with the workshop. Young scholars and graduate students attending this course will gain a better understanding of the fundamentals as well as deep appreciation of the current research trends in this field.\r\n\r\nNano-microscale thermal radiation has important applications in energy harvesting such as solar cells and thermophotovoltaics, nanomanufacturing, biomedical sensing, and thermal imaging and locating heating below the diffraction limit.  Radiative heat transfer can be greatly enhanced at nanometer distances due to photon tunneling and the excitation of surface plasmon (or phonon) polaritons.  Furthermore, the performance of various devices can be greatly enhanced by the modification of the reflection, transmission, absorption and emission spectra using one-, two-, or three-dimensional micro/nanostructures. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together experts, researchers, and students from around the world for an open exchange of research ideas, recent findings and discoveries, and future outlooks in Nano and Micro Thermal Radiation. This event will provide a forum to facilitate international collaboration and promote joint efforts in this multidisciplinary area. Abstracts and PowerPoint slides from the workshop will available to the participants.   The most recent progress and development results will be published in a special issue of JQSRT following the workshop.",
