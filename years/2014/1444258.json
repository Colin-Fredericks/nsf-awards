While the field is progressing forward, both in research findings and industrial markets, the percentage of female roboticists continues to lag far behind their male counterparts.  This award supports travel for ten women robotics researchers to the workshop \"Women in Robotics\" being held at the Robot Science and Systems (RSS) 2014 conference.  This opportunity is expected to have a significant effect towards helping them start their career and establish themselves as young robotics researchers. The workshop plan includes: (1) a full-day of invited talks by women leaders in the field from both academia and industry, demonstrating that women can and do play an important role in the field, (2) a poster session featuring works by junior researchers, giving them exposure in the community, (3) a panel discussion on the topic of \"steps towards building a successful career in robotics,\" featuring women at various stages of their careers, and (4)  a networking dinner to provide time for junior and senior participants have a chance to make real one-on-one connections. Bringing together women from various disciplines in robotics is expected to strengthen the community and provides an important opportunity for networking.",
