 "awd_abstract_narration": "As digital evidence becomes increasingly important in criminal and civil litigation, and as concerns about personal privacy and the sharing of digital information by both public and private sector entities increase, a clear need is emerging to create a code of professional ethics that would govern the activities of digital forensics practitioners.  To this end, the PI will organize a conference that will provide an opportunity for attendees to familiarize themselves with ethical issues relating to the practice of digital forensics and to begin the process of developing an overarching, consensus-based, code of professional ethics for digital forensics practitioners similar to what the legal, research and medical organizations have created. Subjects to be addressed include Digital Forensic Investigations, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Jurisprudence, and Education and Awareness. \r\n\r\nIn addition to resulting in a plan for designing, implementing, and enforcing a code of ethics, the proceedings of the conference would be published and thus made available to scholars and practitioners in the field, while media coverage of the event will provide information to informed citizens concerned about ethical issues in digital forensics and its practice.",
