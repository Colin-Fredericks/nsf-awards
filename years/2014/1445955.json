Deep subsurface biofilms can be used for enhanced oil recovery and carbon sequestration in addition to bioremediation of contaminants in groundwater. Despite widespread implications of biofilms, the underlying hydrodynamics of bacterial aggregation that eventually leads to formation of biofilm streamers are currently unknown. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Properties of bacteria-produced extracellular polymeric substances consisting of a filamentous network of macromolecules surrounded in a fluid play an important role in biofilm formation. In order to understand biofilm formation and growth, the dynamics of bacterial aggregation at ecologically relevant spatiotemporal scales in the presence of flow while interacting with extracellular polymeric substances must be studied. This is a challenge largely unanswered to date. The proposed research will employ state-of-the-art three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics and experimental techniques to transform our understanding of bacterial aggregation due to flow field, bacteria shape, bacteria motility and rheological properties of extracellular polymer. The literature shows that rigid particles ranging in sizes from microns to centimeters robustly aggregate in different flows of viscoelastic fluids. The proposed research investigates a hypothesis that motile microorganisms in viscoelastic fluids undergo strong hydrodynamic forces that result in their aggregation to the surfaces and/or each other. The fundamental knowledge about the aggregation of bacteria in the presence of flow in such complex fluids can transform our understanding of these microbial processes and advance the ability to control biofilm formation. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The implications of this research extend to important biological, environmental, and oceanographic applications. Understanding of bacterial aggregation and formation of biofilms is crucial for human health and environmental control. Additionally, the ability to systematically investigate the interaction of bacteria using computational fluid dynamics, while capturing its detailed 3D response in complex fluids, is essential for correctly predicting the future state of the pathogen colonization in mucosal tissues and tracts. The proposed activity will significantly contribute to interdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists and engineers. This grant will provide support for training of two graduate students fostering the development of state-of-the-art tools in the PI's laboratory. A new graduate course will be developed to integrate the research into graduate education. This interdisciplinary research will be used as a platform to attract diverse groups such as women and underrepresented minorities. The PI will lead an engineering education partnership with the Engineering and Technology Magnet Program for the South Bend (Indiana) Community School Corporation at Riley High School that focuses on restoring an aquatic ecosystem of a local creek by controlling Escherichia coli levels. The work will include hands-on experiments and projects for the students with the purpose of reinforcing basic principles of engineering analysis and design. By taking advantage of established articulation relationships, female and underrepresented minority undergraduate students from the all women's Saint Mary's and two Historically Black Colleges will be trained in experimental and mathematical aspects of the proposed research.",

This interdisciplinary problem involves many research area, such as microbiology, molecular chemistry, fluid mechanics, etc. Hydrodynamics is one of the important aspects of microorganism swimming, nutrient uptake, fertilization, collective motions and formation of colonies. Microorganisms swim in a low Reynolds number regime, interact with each other, surfaces and interfaces, chemical components and external flow fields. They also swim in complex fluids, exhibiting non-Newtonian behavior, including viscoelasticity and shear-thinning viscosity. These biological materials contain network of glycoprotein fibers and gel-like polymers and provide heterogeneous fluid environments for the microorganisms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ardekani&rsquo;s laboratory has used combined numerical and theoretical techniques to investigate many aspects of bacteria interacting with non-Newtonian fluids. The results of the multiple, diverse studies conducted under the auspices of this grant demonstrated many interesting physics of microorganisms interacting with surfaces, bacterial suspensions, and passive particles in shear flows, in the presence of fluid elasticity and other non-Newtonian effects. These results help us better understand the bacteria aggregation and biofilm formation. Ardekani&rsquo;s group has shown that both modeled ciliates as well as undulatory flagella have three types of swimming modes near a surface in a Newtonian fluid, escaping, oscillating or entrapment. Fluid elasticity of the fluid significantly affects the near-wall motion of a microorganism as well as its wall contact time. Particularly, a pusher ciliate can be trapped near a surface in a viscoelastic fluid while it escapes in a Newtonian fluid. The results of the study, published in PRL, JFM, PRE, Rheologica acta, Journal of Nonlinear Science, and EJCM, for the first time, demonstrate the effects of non-Newtonian fluid rheology on the motion of microorganisms and their interaction with surfaces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we found that the shear-thinning viscosity of the fluid has a strong effect on the swimming behavior of an undulatory swimmer. Our results, published in Journal of Fluid Mechanics, demonstrate that the flagellum effectively swims inside a corridor of low viscosity fluid and thus achieves a higher swimming speed and lower power consumption compared to a Newtonian fluid. Two competing effects determine the speed enhancement: the viscosity and width of the inner low viscosity layer. Depending on the oscillation amplitude as well as the fluid rheological properties, there exists a maximum swimming speed. We also derived a universal scaling law for the power consumption which is later confirmed by experiments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The collective motion of a suspension of rod-like microswimmers in a viscoelastic fluid was also investigated. We found that the fluid elasticity has a small effect on a suspension of pullers, while it significantly affects the pushers. The attraction and orientational ordering of the pushers are enhanced in viscoelastic fluids. The induced polymer stresses break down the large-scale flow structures and suppress velocity fluctuations. In addition, the energy spectra and induced mixing in the suspension of pushers are greatly modified by fluid elasticity. This work is the first work considering a suspension of discrete swimmers in a continuum viscoelastic fluid and has been published in PRL. We also investigated the particle migration in a channel flow of shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids and the results have been published in JFM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"clearing\">We have developed microfluidic devices to mimic some of the important microbial conditions at ecologically relevant spatiotemporal scales. A microfluidic device is developed to generate a fast and tunable vortical flow, utilizing oscillations of a microbubble. A capillary-based microfluidic platform was developed for the fabrication of shape controllable alginate/pNIPAAm Janus microgels. Ability to control the shape of particles enables researchers to create a variety of drug-delivery vehicles, while Janus particles hold promise for applications such as tissue engineering and self-propelled particles.</p>\n<p>This project has had a strong educational and outreach component. PI Ardekani initiated an interdisciplinary engineering education partnership with the Engineering and Technology Magnet Program for the South Bend Community School Corporation that focuses on restoring an aquatic ecosystem of a local creek. As a part of this outreach activity, water quality tours have been conducted for Riley high school students in order to facilitate their understanding about environmental fluids and encourage them toward careers in science and technology. Six Ph.D., two master and six undergraduate students, and three postdoctoral researchers have been trained and been partially supported by this grant.
