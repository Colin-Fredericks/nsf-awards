 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new computer-based methods to model and predict electricity distribution systems,\r\nso as to do a better job of handling uncertainty, multiple time intervals, and the possibility of greater \r\npenetration of plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and electric cars. PHEV are not expect to cause major problems for the \r\nmajor transmission grids, but they add major uncertainties and need for more flexibility at the level of \r\ndistribution companies. To address that challenge, the PI will combine new work at the distribution level \r\ntogether with new mathematical methods for coping with uncertainty and random disturbances. She will also \r\nexpand her ongoing efforts on behalf of West Virginia's \"Vision 2020\" strategic plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe technical objective here is to identify stochastic models and develop controls for improving short \r\nterm and long term performance of smart distribution systems. One often hears system stress, congestion \r\nand curtailment with volatility in renewable generation and demand. Transitioning to a sustainable energy \r\nfuture often results in complex and fast aggregated generator and load dynamics, which may lead to \r\nsevere impact on distribution systems. This transition has forced power system researchers to pay serious \r\nattention to their time varying characteristics in a stochastic sense. This research has been facilitated by \r\nthe advances in stochastic control theory and recent boost in data mining applications. The goal of the \r\nproject is to develop a unified framework of stochastic and data driven approaches by which these \r\nvariabilities can be identified, not by traditional approaches of modeling and control but by generating \r\nscenarios available from historical data and optimal predictive control design. The main question is \r\nwhether massive amount of time series data can be handled by the data driven approaches to capture \r\nvolatility and variability of generation and demand. The PI will use knowledge and concepts from \r\nstochastic theory, control theory, data mining, computational intelligence for a non-conservative approach \r\nfor smart distribution system optimization and control.",
