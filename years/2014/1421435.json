 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a Micro-GPS system that provides centimeter-level accuracy and is reliable both indoors and out, based on specific landmarks in the \"random\" textures present in the world.  The key idea is that all floors, such as the carpet in a building, the grain of a wood floor, the concrete on a sidewalk, and the asphalt on a road, have small imperfections, bumps, or variations in color from location to location.  A downward-pointing camera mounted underneath a vehicle can observe specific, unique arrangements of these seemingly random variations, looking them up in an index to find out their precise position in the world. The developed technology can provide capabilities for better in-car navigations, such as accurate parking in a particular spot, pothole avoidance, and lane departure warning. Other applications might include smart wheelchairs that can stay on a sidewalk and avoid rough patches, scooters for the elderly and disabled, assistive technologies for the visually impaired, marker-free smart highways, smart robots in warehouses that can precisely position themselves next to shelves, and even domestic assistants that can handle day-to-day chores inside a home.\r\n\r\nThis research is based on a key idea that localization is possible based on specific features in the \"random\" textures present in the world: seemingly-heterogeneous textures that have unique variations everywhere but globally consistent image statistics.  The key challenges of this project include developing methods for (1) detecting uncommon locations or \"features\" in a close-up image of the ground surface; (2) computing a feature descriptor for each detected landmark, in a way that is invariant to changes in orientation and lighting; (3) matching the features against a map:  a pre-built database of features, their arrangements, and their locations in the world; and (4) being able to create and update the database to increase coverage and to account for changes. All of these are common components in contemporary systems for tracking, image alignment, and recognition.  However, the individual algorithms have been tuned to work best for \"natural\" images.  Instead, the project focuses on developing detectors, descriptors, matching algorithms, and update strategies that are tuned to the statistics of common ground textures.  The research team investigates whether accuracy can be improved by combining descriptors based on color with ones based on surface normals or height fields; and   the systems issues involved in scaling the system to widespread coverage.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLocation-aware applications play an increasingly critical role in everyday life. However, the most common global localization technology -- GPS -- has limited accuracy and can be unusable in dense urban areas and indoors. \n\nThe key idea behind our proposed system is that localization is possible based on specific features in the \"random\" textures present in the world.  By random, we mean seemingly-heterogeneous textures that have unique variations everywhere but globally consistent image statistics.\n\nConsider the carpet in a building, the grain of a wood floor, the concrete on a sidewalk, or the asphalt on a road.  All of these have small imperfections, bumps, or variations in color from location to location.  We typically use the overall pattern or statistics of this variation to recognize a particular material, and in fact research on computer-based modeling of textures has traditionally proceeded along statistical lines.  However, if we shift our focus to the particular arrangement of bumps and variations present at any location, we see that it is unlikely to be repeated anywhere else.  With a couple of dozen features, we achieve extremely high likelihood of identifying exactly where we are, with essentially no possibility of ambiguity.\n\nOur localization system, therefore, consists of a downward-facing camera that observes the fine texture on the ground, together with an internet-connected image processing system that locates the observed texture patch in a large database.  The key challenges include developing methods for: (1) Detecting uncommon locations or \"features\" in a close-up image of the ground surface.  (2) Computing a \"signature\" for each detected landmark, in a way that is invariant to changes in orientation and lighting.  (3) Matching the features against a map: a pre-built database of features, their arrangements, and their locations in the world.\n\nWe have shown that the combination of these elements allows us to localize a motorized vehicle with sub-centimeter precision across a large variety of ground textures including asphalt, concrete, floor tiles, carpet, and wood.  Although these may look random and homogeneous, all contain cracks, scratches, or unique arrangements of carpet fibers.  These imperfections are persistent, and can serve as local signposts.\n\nImpacts:\n\nThe ability to know precisely where you are has far reaching consequences.  The availability of a Micro-GPS system, together with a database of texture features covering a nontrivial area, will enable a wide range of consumer and commercial applications such as hazard detection for in-car navigation, marker-free smart highways, and inexpensive smart warehouses.  It ill also pave the way towards systems that need more precise localization than is currently possible, such as automatic navigation for electric wheelchairs, scooters for the elderly and disabled, and even assistive technologies for the visually impaired.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Szymon M Rusinkiewicz"
