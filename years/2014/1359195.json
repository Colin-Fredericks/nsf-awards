 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Lehigh University provides fourteen undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in astrophysics, atomic and molecular physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, nanotechnology, plasma physics, and statistical physics.  In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have prepared a written report or a poster about the summer research and presented the results of the work in a 15 minute talk.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.",

The program offers a deep exposure to research for the students by immersing them in research groups that perform state-of-the-art research on a diverse set of fields of physics ranging from very fundamental areas (such as String Theory, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics) to classical areas (such as Atomic and Molecular Physics, Statistical Physics) to areas that find applications in technology, energy and health (Condensed Matter Physics, Optics, Biophysics, Fluids, and Plasma Physics).&nbsp;More than 20 Lehigh faculty members have been involved as advisors for the program. In addition to working with their specific research advisor and group, students are also given exposure to other research programs in the Lehigh Physics department through faculty seminars, lab tours, and visits to campus facilities;&nbsp;some students&nbsp;were&nbsp;given the opportunity to work in research labs abroad at the Universities of Bordeaux, France, and Kyoto, Japan.&nbsp; This&nbsp;sought after&nbsp;program receives&nbsp;an&nbsp;average of 550 excellent applicants every year<em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The quality of the students is very high as indicated by a high average GRE (&gt;3.6) and the productivity of the students during the program&nbsp;resulted&nbsp;in contributions to fourteen journal publications and sixty presentations&nbsp;at professional conferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong>: Special attention was given to the participation of ethnic minorities that are underrepresented in Physics.

The program offered a group housing arrangement which has&nbsp;been&nbsp;one of the most successful aspects of the program. The students occupied an entire residential building&nbsp;on campus&nbsp;with a Computer Science REU group&nbsp;and&nbsp;were&nbsp;given great independence in organizing and running their living group.
