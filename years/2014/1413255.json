 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics with profound implications for our view of the Universe. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nThe identification of Dark Matter (DM) poses a challenge that is being addressed with a variety of complementary approaches and technologies. The direct search for DM with the XENON project at the Gran Sasso laboratory promises an extremely cost-efficient approach to cover vast regions of expected DM parameter space. This award will enable the US groups in XENON to participate in the operations and data analysis of XENON100 well into 2015 when the start of the scientific program with XENON1T is expected. With a strong presence at Gran Sasso, the US groups will maintain a leading role in the commissioning and operation of XENON1T. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nA number of students as well as post-doctoral researchers are involved in the XENON project at universities across the US. They are exposed to a variety of subjects in fundamental physics and cosmology, and trained in the development and application of state-of-the-art technologies, preparing them to become future leaders in the field. The instrumentation and techniques used in XENON are relevant to a wide range of applications, from areas in homeland security and medical imaging, to the analysis and statistical treatment of large data sets.",

This experiment succeeds and surpasses by far the previously very successful XENON100 apparatus. The XENON Dark Matter Search project has developed a so-called dual phase liquid/gas xenon time projection chamber (TPC), a position- and energy-sensitive detector that can distinguish between the nuclear recoils expected from Dark Matter interactions and the background interactions from energetic gamma-rays with the electrons of the atomic shell. This detector is cooled down to -95&deg; C, where inert xenon gas liquefies at a pressure of about 2 bar. This clear liquid is not only a dense medium, about three times heavier than water, but also an excellent scintillator and a medium for ionization. The primary scintillation photons are detected immediately by arrays of photomultiplier tube, which are photodetectors that are sensitive to individual light photons. The electrons released in a Dark Matter interaction are drifted across up to 100 cm before they are extracted into the gas phase by a strong electric field. Here they excite the atoms in the gas to scintillate abundantly, which allows measurement of the amount of charge and the location of the interaction.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\">Within the period of this grant, the XENON1T detector has been constructed, and after commissioning it is world leading experiment for Dark Matter direct searches.
