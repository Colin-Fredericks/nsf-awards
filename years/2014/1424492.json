 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will further understanding of a statistical technique for measuring and reducing the potential for biases from non-response in sample surveys.  Sample surveys are a principal tool for providing accurate information crucial for good economic and social decision making.  Nonresponse in sample surveys conducted both privately and by government agencies is increasing.  With that increase, the potential for serious biases in estimates derived from surveys and used in critical decision making grows.  This research will address that problem, particularly in cases where non-response may be a function of variables having missing values.  Extensions of this research will have broad application to multi-phase surveys, non-probability surveys, and other statistical applications plagued by potential selection bias whether due to nonresponse, coverage errors, or both.  The project will develop powerful, publically available tools for implementing this approach.\r\n\r\nCalibration weighting can be used to remove potential selection biases due to unit non-response or coverage errors.  This research project will demonstrate the advantages in terms of reductions in non-response bias and increases in accuracy of having more calibration than model variables when non-respondents are determined not to be missing at random.  In so doing, it will introduce a better method of calibration weighting in this context than currently exists in the literature.  The research also will investigate new tests for determining whether a set of calibration variables can by itself serve as the model variables or whether a survey variable truly needs to be added to the response model to avoid selection bias.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCalibration weighting is an easy-to-implement yet powerful tool for reducing the standard errors of many population estimates derived from a sample survey by forcing the weighted sum of \"calibration\" variables to equal their known (or better-estimated) population totals. Although originally developed to reduce standard errors, calibration weighting has also been effectively used to remove selection biases resulting from unit nonresponse. To this end, nonrespondents are usually assumed to be \"missing at random.\" that is, the response mechanism is assumed to be a function of variables having known totals for either the entire population or the survey-weighted sample before nonresponse.\n\nA calibration-weighted method has been developed that can compensate for unit nonresponse when response is wholly or in part a function of variables with values known only for survey respondents by allowing the variables in the assumed response model to differ from the calibration variables. This method hods considerable promise when survey nonrespondents are potentially not missing at random.  For its practical application, techniques were needed for determining appropriate calibration and model variables.  This research proposed and investigated some of those techniques.\n\nThe research has broadened our understanding of the performance of calibration-weighting when unit nonrespondents are potentially not missing at random. Variables in the calibration equation that are not in the response model were called \"shadow\" variables, while variables in the response model that were not calibration variables were called \"model-only\" variables. The research showed the advantages of having more shadow variables than model-only variables when nonresponse was more reasonably assumed not to be missing at random.  Moreover, it proposed a better and more intuitive method of calibration weighting than originally proposed in the literature in this context. \n\nThe theory and simulations supporting this method were presented at the 2015 Joint Statistical Meetings, are in the SURVEY RESEARCH METHODS SECTION (SRMS) PROCEEDINGS of those meetings, and in an article to appear in the JOURNAL OF SURVEY STATISTICS AND METHODOLOGY.  A practical application of the method including model selection was presented as an SRMS- award-winning poster as the 2016 Joint Statistical Meetings, are in its PROCEEDINGS, and in a paper currently under review by the JOURNAL OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS.    \n\nWith nonresponse in sample survey increasing, the potential for serious biases in estimates derived from surveys grows.  Thus the need for  powerful, publicly available tools for measuring and reducing that potential, especially when nonresponse may be a function of variables with missing values is great. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Phillip Kott"
