 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor nanoparticles are attractive for enhancing the color quality and efficiency of display and lighting applications. Synthetic techniques are currently unable to produce particles that are bright, that emit color pure, and that are stable without using materials that contain toxic heavy metals. This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) research project is designed to produce application ready and heavy metal free nanoparticles suitable for applications in lighting and display technologies. Experimental methods and theoretical studies will be combined to improve our general understanding of the chemical and physical forces that control nanoparticle growth. Special chemical reactors that allow the researchers to study the molecular mechanisms of nanoparticle growth will be designed. Theoretical work using computer models of the nanoparticle surface and the molecules involved in growth will be used to complement these studies and gain a deeper understanding into the processes involved. By combining the experimental and theoretical results from these experiments, the researchers intend to develop a predictive model of nanoparticle growth that will insight into possible paths for the production of heavy metal free application ready nanoparticles. This understanding will allow the researchers to design synthetic methods to produce nanoparticles that meet the requirements for implementation in lighting and display applications and provide consumers with energy efficient displays with vibrant, rich colors. This research will impact national nanotechnology challenges through publishing, patenting, and industrial collaborations. Graduate students will be educated in synthesis and scalable manufacturing of quantum dots.  Undergraduate research will be an integral part of the labs through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at MIT. The impact of this fundamental research on science and technology will be disseminated to the K-12 educational audience through a series of video productions.\r\n\r\nTo be attractive for use in lighting and display technologies, fluorescent nanoparticles must be efficient and bright with narrow photoluminescence spectra. Currently, the only nanoparticles that are able to meet the specifications required for high impact applications in display technologies contain the heavy metal cadmium and are based on cadmium selenide. The most promising heavy metal free substitute for quantum dots for color downshifting applications is indium phosphide. However, it is not currently possible to make indium phosphide based materials with the narrow spectral linewidths required to meet the specifications of display applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that there are substantial challenges both in understanding the dynamics and mechanistics of nanoparticle growth at the earliest stages. This work will explore the earliest stages of nanoparticle growth by using stopped flow nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study the evolution of the reagents just after mixing. Furthermore, continuous flow systems will be integrated with mass spectrometers in order to measure and quantify the evolution of species that form early in the reaction that are not well suited to NMR characterization. These experimental measurements will be complemented and informed by theoretical techniques that model the inorganic-organic interface at the nanoparticle surface, identify potential sources of surface poisoning and explore possible methods to mitigate this problem through techniques such as etching. A comprehensive model of the factors that control the dynamics of nanoparticle growth will be developed that includes the dynamics of never-before-characterized intermediate molecular species and their interaction with the nanoparticle surface. This model will be tested using a microfluidic reactor that allows rapid, reproducible scanning of growth conditions. As it is verified, the model will be used to predict the optimal conditions for control of nanoparticle size and size distribution. The continuous flow synthesis is both well suited for the fundamental study required to improve indium phosphide synthesis as well as inherently scalable for applications in lighting and consumer electronics.",

We developed new large-scale electronic structure based (i.e., fully ab initio) models of how III-V quantum dots grow. These developments bridged work on ab initio molecular dynamics of early stage clusters to magic sized clusters that have been observed experimentally to larger 3 nm quantum dots characterized with MALDI-TOF in our laboratories. By modeling the surface morphology and energetic properties of InP clusters across this wide size range, we developed a new understanding of what controls size distribution and growth of InP QDs (Figures 1 and 2). Our studies revealed a wide range of surface site kinetic and thermodynamic properties that depended strongly on nearest neighbor In<sup>-</sup>In distances on the In-rich surface. A newfound relationship between structure and energetics in QDs permitted us to interpret and rationalize experimental observations on the growth of InP QDs from early stage and magic size cluster structures to 3 nm QDs. Despite prior emphasis on phosphorus precursor chemistry, our work also revealed why the chemistry of the In precursor and the surface In content is so essential to InP QD growth. Moreover, it also guided what considerations should be made in choosing new precursor chemistries in the future to control growth.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Our studies provided new kinetic insights into the growth of InAs QDs. Figure 3a shows the influence of the injection rate on the extent of size-focusing. At early stages of QD growth, size-focusing appears invariant to injection speed. However, at later stages, QD growth slows down and fast injection speeds lead to a secondary nucleation event, resulting in a bimodal size distribution, as identified by TEM and two distinct PL peaks (the feature at 1200 nm in the emission spectrum of the 1 mL/h injection rate originates from solvent reabsorption). Slow injection speeds, however, are able to maintain the system in a size-focused regime, providing access to large particles with narrow size distributions. Variation of injection speed during growth within a single synthesis shows the capabilities of our approach (Figure 3b). At the beginning of the reaction fast injection speeds bring the system into a size-focusing regime. As soon as growth slows down, as can be seen from the PL peak values slowly converging over time, size-broadening sets in. A drastic decrease in injection rate, however, can be used to push the system back into a size-focusing growth regime, yielding a second onset of QD growth and a partial reversion of the occurred size-broadening. Based on these InAs QD cores, we develop improved core-shell-shell (CSS) QDs that span the entire sensitivity range of modern SWIR cameras (900?1,600&thinsp;nm, exhibit QYs up to 82%, and show drastically improved probe stability both under laser irradiance and during long-term storage (Figure 4)</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">We have designed systems to perform continuous flow synthesis of nanocrystals and to study the nanocrystal reaction mechanism and kinetics. We first developed an oscillatory flow reactor to provide a surface energy-driven approach for automatically screening reaction conditions and studying reaction mechanisms of bi-phasic nanocrystal ligand exchange reactions (Figure 5). &nbsp;A second automated droplet-based reaction platform yield new data sets on QDs formation, which led to a new population balances growth models, accounting for the size distribution of the QDs and the ligand distribution on the QDs surface. Comparisons of the model with experimental data demonstrated its descriptive and predictive abilities and enabled the identi&#64257;cation of temperature dependent kinetic parameters.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">We implemented multistage high-temperature and high-pressure silicon-Pyrex chip reactors (up to 6 stages) to synthesize various III-V based core/shell QDs in flow (Figure 6). The customized chip reactors with different heating profiles and flow distributions were assembled with ease to precisely control the reaction conditions over different syntheses. Utilizing this multistage microfluidic platform, we successfully prepared a series of InP/ZnS, InP/ZnSe, InP/CdS and InAs/InP QDs with control over their core size and shell thickness. Importantly, the intensified consecutive synthetic platform significantly shortened the total processing time. To further facilitate QD production we developed a fully-continuous novel liquid-liquid-extraction (LLE) platform for the purification of nanoparticles. The use of multistage operation enhanced the purity of the final stream without the expense of high solvent consumption. Morever new synthetic protocols were developed based on tris(dimethylamino)pnictide precursors, which can replace their toxic and expensive counterparts including tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine and tris(trimethylsilyl)arsine. Such protocols were both applied in flask and flow reactors further optimizing the formation of InAs and InP/ZnS quantum dots. These advances promise to improve quality, safety and scalability of indium-based III-V QDs and facilitate their adoption in the broader nanoscience community.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/22/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Klavs&nbsp;F&nbsp;Jensen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449291/1449291_10332196_1558463022843_Figure5_v7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449291/1449291_10332196_1558463022843_Figure5_v7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449291/1449291_10332196_1558463022843_Figure5_v7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(top) Reaction energy computed from DFT for phosphine addition on the surface of magic sized and early stage InP clusters with more reactive spots shown in green and less reactive spots shown in orange as indicated in inset colorbar.
