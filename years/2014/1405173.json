 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together a top control engineer with a cognitive neuroscientist, in order to design a new family of control designs which would replicate and explain key capabilities of living brains which have never yet been achieved in engineering (or in the models used in computational neuroscience). This new work builds on previous work by Frank Lewis, in developing adaptive controllers (RLADP) which can maximize performance over time, in the face of nonlinearity and challenges which require foresight, such as the management of power grids. Here, the group will try to explain and replicate how brains can also handle challenges which require them to learn how to structure time, with multiple levels of decision with multiple time horizons, and how to handle complex structure in space, as we need to in managing complex infrastructure networks. These two challenges essentially address two of the three gaps between today's best RLADP and the highest capabilities of the mammal brain.  The new fundamental design work will feed into ongoing laboratory work in the control of electric power microgrids, which are important as building blocks for future electric power distribution networks capable of coping with large penetrations of plug-in hybrid cars or rooftop solar and the like. \r\n\r\nThe previous work is reviewed in the Handbook of RLADP, from IEEE/Wiley, edited by Lewis and Liu. Spatial complexity will be addressed by considering optimal control of systems defined over graphs, such as power and communication networks. Game theoretic extensions, related to issues of distributed or collective intelligence, will also be considered. The work will also build on work by co-PI Levine on models of mechanisms in the brain involving the emotional gates in the amygdala and deliberative decisions in the anterior cingulate cortex.",

We found surprising new relations between Communication limitations and Control systems that must be considered to design effective local controllers for correct operation in internetworked teams.

Our research brought together results from two disciplines - computer science machine learning and automatic feedback control.  We trained and graduated 10 PhD students under this grant, including 3 women.  All now have top jobs.  We trained 8 Master?s Thesis and Undergraduate students in STEM fields, including 2 women and 3 minorities.  Trained a further 15 students in the UTA Research Institute Autonomous Systems Lab, which provides hand on experience in robotics and multi-agent systems. \n\nWe worked with numerous international institutions and universities in China, Italy, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mongolia, and Mexico.  Research results were disseminated to the international community through 36 invited talks in China, Mongolia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Zagreb, Rome, and Bari Italy.  PI Lewis gave 13 short courses in Asia and Singapore about reinforcement learning, multi-agent coordinated control, and power systems control.  Overall 92 papers were published in top international scientific journals.  Numerous conference papers and presentations resulted.  Two books were written and 1 US patent received. \n\nWe started an International Research Center at UTA that hosted 18 international visitors from China, Holland, Zagreb, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.  Working with them, we developed new research ideas that helped many of them obtain PhD degrees from their home institutions.  In 2017 we started a new conference titled International Symposium on Autonomous Systems (ISAS) that was held in Guangzhou, and run again in 2018 in Chongqing.  We worked with the State Key Lab on Process Control at Northeastern University, China, to design new process controllers using Reinforcement Learning that significantly decreased pollution and increased productivity in a large Mineral Grinding Plant.  For this work, PI Lewis received two top awards from Liaoning Province- the Foreign Friendship Award and the Science and Technology Award. \n\nWe developed a new course under this research, \"Distributed Decision and Control?.  Developed new course material for other courses, including Nonlinear Control and Intelligent Control.  All course notes were put online at http://www.uta.edu/utari/acs/.  Software from all the research is also online linked to that webpage. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank L Lewis"
