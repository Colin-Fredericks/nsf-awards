 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid biodiversity change in North America has significant effects on essential ecosystem services, from impact on soil health and nutrient cycling, to agriculture, forestry and water quality. Exploding populations of invasive species threaten fresh water and terrestrial habitats and potentially impact the natural resources of the nation. Easy access to robust, expertly vetted baseline data for species occurrences, abundances, and distribution ranges, and monitoring how these parameters have changed through time, will facilitate the protection of the nation's natural resources, and vastly improve the capacity for effective restoration, land management planning, and conservation management.  Numerous undergraduate students will receive training in digitization technologies and a modular exhibit will be developed to engage public interest in biodiversity changes.\r\n\r\nEffective monitoring requires easy electronic access to historical specimen baseline information for temporal and regional species diversity comparisons that can facilitate informed land management decisions. Vast amounts of specimen data are housed within the nation's natural history collections, but most of these data are not readily accessible from digital resources. Size and complexity of scientific specimen collections require major technological advances in capturing specimen data. The goal of this four-year collaborative project is the rapid digitization of  >2 million specimens and their locality data from ten arthropod and mollusk collections housed at six major US museums in six states (Il, OH, AL,MI, DE, PA). This project will significantly automate specimen data capture by utilizing optical character and voice-recognition technologies. The digitized data from this project will be immediately deployed for habitat-based distribution modeling and analyses.This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

In the course of the project the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH) has digitized 138,000 specimens, which until now have never been accessible beyond physical access. This new data resource was generated through the help of two graduate students, three staff members, 14 work-study students from Case Western Reserve University, and 31 volunteers donating hundreds of hours over the course of seven years. Three students that participated in the CMNH's Kirtlandia Research Internship Program participated in not only the digitization of specimens, but implemented original projects that addressed research-based questions stemming from&nbsp;the digitized specimen database and collection specimens. These students demonstrated how collections can be used in historical and current assessments of biodiversity. All three of these students have continued on research pathways after their experience with the internship and involvement with the digitization project. Thousands of specimen images were generated, including high resolution images using vertical stacking equipment, which are also being made available online. The project was incorporated into numerous public programs and events at the CMNH including summer camps, online camps, discovery day (free admission days), adult education programming, docent training, naturalist training, and others. Project personnel produced numerous communications about the project using social media channels, blog posts, and institutional communication pieces that include Explorer Magazine, Museum Insider, and other digital and print periodicals. The research use of this newly digitized insect dataset has been linked via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to 94 publications. Prior to this project, use of the insect collection was limited to physical loans and research visits to the collection. Available specimen data has also led to the discovery of overlooked specimens critical to understanding threatened species that were long preserved in the CMNH.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this project had immense impact on the CMNH and its ability to modernize collection digitization. Although the project was restricted to a single department in the CMNH, the experience and training of staff, students, and volunteers was disseminated across all collection departments. At the inception of this project, only one other CMNH department was digitizing specimen data using a platform that was accessible to users online. The methodologies, workflows, and technologies shared between collaborating institutions, at iDigBio summit meetings, and other conferences all contributed to the advancement of digitization at the CMNH. The existence of this project enabled broad communication of the importance of collection digitization to the CMNH staff, Board, and community. The CMNH has advanced collections digitization with the development and implementation of a centralized databased server and platform. Two thirds of the CMNH&rsquo;s 13 collection areas are now at some stage of integrating into this central database platform. Further, digitization of collections is included on the CMNH&rsquo;s strategic plan. Without the resources brought to the CMNH by this project we would have not seen the accelerated pace of modernization of collections digitization over the past few years.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/24/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gavin&nbsp;J&nbsp;Svenson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1402785/1402785_10335067_1614215918780_CMNHENT0120000_Morpho_catenarius_M_DH_50mm_1,4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1402785/1402785_10335067_1614215918780_CMNHENT0120000_Morpho_catenarius_M_DH_50mm_1,4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Digitized Specimen 120,000\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1402785/1402785_10335067_1614215918780_CMNHENT0120000_Morpho_catenarius_M_DH_50mm_1,4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Digitized Specimen 120,000\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The 120,000 insect specimen to be digitized by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.
