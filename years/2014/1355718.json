 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joint repair continues to be a significant challenge that demands the use of innovative materials that can provide both mechanical and biological function. The I-Corps team is developing an electroactive scaffold that mimics both structural and electrical properties of the native extracellular matrix present during early cartilage development to repair articular cartilage defects. This biomaterial represents a different, cost-effective and simple approach to tapping into a biological mechanism for repairing damaged articular cartilage. The joint environment appears to be rich in mesenchymal progenitor cells, which have been isolated from the bone marrow, periosteum, synovial membrane and fluid, and from the articular cartilage itself. A regenerative approach for joint tissue repair could be the recruitment of resident endogenous stem cells to the site of damage and activation of the repair process. The electroactive scaffold is a synthetic material, piezoelectric polyvinylidine fluoride copolymer (FDA-approved material for suture applications), that is processed into a fibrous form. Fibrous scaffolds have a beneficial structural feature for cell adhesion and growth due to their large surface-to-volume and high aspect ratios resulting from the smallness of the diameter. The piezoelectric scaffold will actively restore function by recruiting endogenous stem cells to the site of damage, and provide the appropriate electromechanical cues to promote their growth and transformation into cartilage cells. \r\n\r\nA significant number of Americans suffer from cartilage damage resulting from injury, or wear and tear. These lesions can significantly affect a person's quality of life and can progress to osteoarthritis (OA) that is disabling. Cartilage damage and related OA conditions are extremely costly. Surgical procedures to restore articular cartilage have not been able to restore a normal cartilaginous surface and have suffered from poor integration with the surrounding normal articular cartilage. Consequently, a growing unmet need exists for early reconstruction of cartilage damage with a reliable treatment method that facilitates the preservation of function as well as reduces the need for future reconstruction or total joint replacements. The piezeoelectric material will be developed into a medical device for use in large cartilage defects. The commercialization potential is strong as it does not require the sale and delivery of cells as part of the device and cost effective relative to other devices in development by industry.",
