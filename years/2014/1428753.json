 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model has succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date has been recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe.  \r\n\r\nOne of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless.   Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such \"hints\" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: The work proposed here is to develop a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the LAr1-ND Experiment.  This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations.  At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized \"sterile\" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact: This research program will serve as an invaluable proving ground for LAr TPC technology and in the reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments a success.  The construction effort at the three collaborating institutions Yale, Syracuse and Chicago will enable students and postdocs at each institution to participate and acquire invaluable hands-on experience with advanced detector technology that is a vital component of training scientists in the field of high-energy physics.",
