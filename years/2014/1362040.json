 "awd_abstract_narration": "The I/UCRC for Novel High-Voltage/Temperature Materials and Structures plans to work jointly with electric utility, aerospace, nuclear, military, environmental, automotive, health, and other industries with needs of novel HV/T materials and structures. The objectives of the Center are: (1) Design of novel and evaluation of existing HV/T energy transmission/transfer multifunctional materials for next generation composite conductors, insulators, underground cables, towers, and other electric power transmission structures; (2) Design and development of novel advanced high energy transfer materials for aerospace, oil/gas, automotive, and other industrial applications; (3) Failure prediction and prevention of HV/T materials and structures under in-service conditions through state-of-the-art multi-scale modeling and material performance evaluations; (4) Development of new failure monitoring techniques and material repair methods in HV/T materials under laboratory conditions and their subsequent transfer to in-service inspection and repair.\r\n\r\nThe proposed I/UCRC will seek to create a diverse and interdisciplinary educational, research and business environment for (1) undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, funded by the research projects of the Center; (2) faculty members from a variety of disciplines, including junior faculty starting their academic careers; (3) utility, aerospace and national lab engineers and designers developing various types of HV/T materials and structures; and (4) utility managers supervising HV transmission lines across the country. The Center intends to enhance the reputation of the U.S. HV/T manufacturing around the world and, in particular, improve the level of confidence among the potential users of novel HV/T structures. The center targets long-term benefit to infrastructure, manufacturing, energy transport and efficiency of the electric grid, and the durability of other HV/T and high energy transfer structures.\r\n",
