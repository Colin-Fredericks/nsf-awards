 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long sought to understand how competitive interactions within and between species shape patterns of species diversity in natural communities. Plant-pollinator competition differs from competition among animal species in a significant way: pollinators may compete for plants as much as plants compete for pollinators. This project examines the mechanisms by which competing pollinators partition flowering plants and whether such partitioning leads to floral diversification. The researchers will identify mechanisms using a combination of experiments in a large, enclosed garden mimicking a natural system, and field measurements of natural selection in wild populations of plants. The research adds a significant conceptual component to studies of ecological dynamics by directly linking ecological interactions between consuming pollinators to natural selection of their mutualist plant resources.\r\n\r\nThe project is a collaboration between an undergraduate college and a research institution. A minimum of ten undergraduates will be involved in every aspect of the work, from experiments with hummingbirds in the enclosed garden, to measurements of selection and reproductive success of plants in wild populations, to statistical analyses of data. Individuals from the host country of Dominica, West Indies, will participate in the field and laboratory studies to strengthen an international collaboration and to provide lasting knowledge in the host country once the project is completed. Findings will be disseminated to the public through popular articles in magazines in the USA and Dominica, podcasts in the USA, radio interviews and public lectures on Dominica and in the USA, on departmental websites, and public exhibits at the Smithsonian Institution.",

One hypothesized mechanism for the generation of differences in flower shape and size is pollinator competition, where competition between two types of pollinators leads to partitioning of floral resources and their subsequent reproductive isolation and divergence in floral shape. The research funded under this award presented the first experimental test of this hypothesized mechanism using sexes of purple-throated carib hummingbirds and their <em>Heliconia</em> food plants in an enclosed garden the size of a basketball court and 10 meters tall on the island of Dominica, West Indies. Experiments supported the hypothesis and demonstrated that hummingbirds partition plants on the basis of floral color and that such partitioning leads to reproductive isolation and divergence in flower size and shape as inferred from powdered dyes used as pollen analogs. Additional experiments established that these birds also partition artificial feeders by color, and that competition between males and females results in reproductive isolation of their natural food sources. This research also capitalized on a natural disturbance, Hurricane Maria, which dramatically reduced hummingbird population sizes to 25% of their pre-hurricane levels and provided novel insights on the evolutionary impacts of a hurricane on floral traits and their bird pollinators. Patterns of natural selection on floral traits were altered from those observed prior to the hurricane. Hummingbirds of both sexes that survived the hurricane were smaller in size, presumably because small size was favored as a result of reduced food supplies. Surviving males had significantly longer bills, presumably because longer bills were an advantage for feeding from long-flowered plants that were the only available resource following the hurricane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research resulted in the training of five undergraduates in ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary analytical methods, including experimental design, statistical analyses, and techniques of pollination biology.
