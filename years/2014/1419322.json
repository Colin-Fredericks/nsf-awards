A Gordon Research Conference is not only an arena dedicated to presentations and discussions of cutting edge research but also traditionally an outstanding opportunity for junior scientists (e.g., senior graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and assistant professors) to interact with senior and world-leading scientists in diverse fields. This workshop, \"Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere: Interactions in a Changing World\" will take place in Spain from 29 June-4 July 2014. \r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together leaders and scholars from several different scientific communities, including biologists, ecosystem ecologists, and atmospheric scientists to report and discuss the latest research findings on hydrocarbon emissions and biosynthesis, ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, and transport and chemical processing of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. Discussions will take place to identify and address current gaps in present knowledge about biogenic hydrocarbons and the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nConference support is focused on promoting the attendance of U.S. participants who are postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and early career scientists. Other federal agencies and private companies are providing additional support. This meeting will be the 7th Gordon Research Conference to address the topic of \"Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere,\" the first of which was in the year 2000.",
