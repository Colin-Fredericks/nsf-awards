The neuroscience research\r\nwill impact education, rehabilitation, and mental-health. The project involves people at many career stages, offering a rich multidisciplinary environment that integrates science and engineering. Detailed system designs and research results will be widely disseminated, accelerating the pace of neuroscience discovery. Exposure to this platform will allow scientists to extend their research into new physiological and pathological contexts. Moreover, the proposed imaging platform has significant clinical translation potential, as it enables minimally invasive visualization of cellular characteristics in vivo, in situ and in real time, without the need for tissue removal, which can be readily adapted for diagnostic analysis of other organ systems.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThis Major Research Instrument (MRI) project aims to develop an ultracompact, portable and head-mountable imaging platform, which will enable imaging of brain activity with subcellular resolution in freely behaving animals. The core of the platform is a novel fiber-optic, scanning two-photon fluorescence endomicroscope which is not commercially available. This ultra-microscope is capable of visualizing cellular activity with an imaging quality approaching that of large bench-top microscopy systems. In addition, a small footprint, tunable femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser will also be developed and integrated to provide a portable platform for two-photon excitation. To facilitate identification of specific brain regions for high resolution imaging, a 2-mm fiber-optic confocal probe with a large field of view (FOV) will be developed and integrated into the platform; this confocal probe will be exchangeable with the two-photon ultra-microscope through the same head-mount base. The confocal probe also enables high-speed imaging of cellular dynamics, complementing the two-photon endomicroscope. The end result of this development effort will be a unique, highly adaptable imaging platform for shared-use, which can be transported to specific facilities/labs across JHU to address specific research questions. The imaging platform will be developed in close collaboration with four research labs at JHU that are engaged in studies of cellular and subcellular dynamics in the intact brain and whose studies have been limited by existing microscope-based imaging platforms.",
