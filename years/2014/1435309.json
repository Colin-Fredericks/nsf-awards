 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metamaterials are artificial media composed of engineered sub-wavelength structures, which cause them to have fascinating new electromagnetic properties that are not usually found in nature. They could be used as high performance antennae, perfect absorbers, super-lenses, cloaking devices, etc. The response wavelengths associated with the underlying structures are a function of size, shape, composition and lattice arrangement. Although there has been great progress in shifting the response of metamaterials from the microwave frequency regime to the optical frequency regime over the past 10 years, there are still many challenges to overcome before \"metamaterials\" become practical materials for optical applications. This award will focus on studying an inexpensive, accessible, and large-scale fabrication process to construct three-dimensional optical metamaterials. Discoveries from this project will be disseminated to technical as well as general audiences through publications, and incorporated into classroom teaching. The project will include strong and sustained education programs involving both undergraduate students with diverse ethnicity and regional K-12 students. \r\n \r\nA metamaterial structure will be fabricated through the combination of glancing angle deposition and two-dimensional self-assembly methods. Novel design and fabrication of three-dimensional metamaterials, especially chiral metamaterials, will be explored both numerically and experimentally. The research team will take advantage of both high-performance electromagnetic modeling and advanced nanofabrication and characterization methods to create and optimize novel nano-architectures for optical metamaterials. Unique optical metamaterials, such as vertically aligned split ring arrays, Swiss roll arrays, and single helical/double helical arrays, etc., will be designed and their fabrication conditions will be determined. It is expected that these structures will demonstrate negative index properties in the near infrared and visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and that helical structures will exhibit strong electromagnetic chirality in the near infrared-visible region. The use of these structures in electromagnetic cloaking, anti-cloaking, and super-lenses will be explored both theoretically and experimentally.",

We have achieved these goals and extend our research on designing composite plasmonic nanostructures, specifically to use dual-source deposition method to create tunable and multifunctional composite plasmonic nanostructures to improve the sensor performance and gain optical tunibility. We have made achievements in the following areas: (1) To design two-dimensional, quazi-3D, and 3D &nbsp;chiral metamaterials <em>via</em> the dynamic change of the deposition configuration as well as multi-step deposition. We have designed chiral nanohole arrays, chiral fan structures, oligomer structures, helical stacked plasmonic structures, and Swiss-roll structures (Fig. 2), which has demonstrated that we can tune the chiral optical response from visible to infrared wavelength range. By combining these techniques with numerical calculations, we have understood how the various chiral responses have raised. (2) By combining dual-source deposition and nanosphere lithography (Fig. 3), we have achieved the fabrication of composite plasmonic structures with arbitrary compositions and various shapes. With tunable composition of composite plasmonic materials at fixed nanostructure size and shape, we have explored the underlying physics on how to improve the sensitivity of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors.&nbsp;When the plasmonic material is composited with other functional materials, for example, the composite of Ag and Co (magnetic material), multifunctional composite nanostructures have been realized. The Ag-Co composite nanostructures demonstrate both good plasmonic property and magneto-optical properties, which can be applied to design active plasmonic devices. (3) We have realized that using multilayered composite plasmonic materials or even graded composition materials, one can also tune the plasmonic response and improve performance of the LSPR sensors. The new strategies we developed in this project, design of 3D nanostructures, or development of new composite nanostructures, or construction of multilayered/graded nano-stacks, can also be adapted by other disciplines for different applications.</p>\n<p>This project has resulted in a total of 20 peer reviewed journal publications, 12 seminars, and 5 PhD theses. The use of shadowing sphere lithography to design 3D chiral metamaterials has also been reported in different News Media. These results will have a profound impact on the nanofabrication and plasmonics, as well as in the structural and composition design of nanomaterials for many other applications.</p>\n<p>In the project period, we have trained a total of 6 graduate students, 4 undergraduate students, and 1 postdoctoral associate.
