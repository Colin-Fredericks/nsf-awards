 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Gretchen Hofmeister from Carleton College and colleagues David Alberg and Matthew Whited will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with field gradient capabilities for two-dimensional and dynamic NMR experiments.  This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at Carleton College and St. Olaf College. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of trypanothione reductase inhibitors; (b) synthesis and applications of extended linear chain (ELC) materials; (c) studies of titanium(IV) trisphenolate catalysts; (d) organocatalysis; (e) studies of metal/ligand cooperative reactivity; and (f) synthesis and structure of Mo(II) acetyl complexes.",
