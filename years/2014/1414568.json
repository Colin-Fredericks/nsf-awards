The quantity and complexity of public data make it impractical for manual browsing and tracking by investigative forces seeking to identify illegal activities. For example, there is a need to automate the process of detection of informative patterns in human trafficking, and especially sex trafficking. Ubiquity of the Internet provides the perpetrators, who take advantage of trafficking victims, with the ability to solicit services on advertisement web sites. This data is publicly available and contains information potentially useful to law enforcement investigators to understand crime patterns and to track the perpetrators. This team proposes to study the commercialization opportunity of a prototype analytic tool which they developed for the task.

This project seeks to remedy this for general benefit of society. It would improve efficiency of law enforcement practice at all levels (local, state, federal), facilitate cross-agency collaboration, as well as enhance public policy studies. The proposed innovation will also have a broader application in leveraging public sources of data for detection and mapping of patterns of other illicit behaviors (e.g. sale of stolen and counterfeit goods) and non-illicit behaviors (e.g. economic activity, job seeking, lifestyle, and public health).",
