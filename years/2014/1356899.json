 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA analysis is widely believed to offer objective and accurate evidence in legal cases.  But, like other forensic methods, DNA analysis requires human judgment.  Such judgment may be influenced by non-forensic contextual information.  An important and as yet unstudied issue is whether a DNA examiner's decision about how to test an object for DNA depends on contextual cues such as comments made by police investigators.  If so, this raises questions about (a) whether such cues can affect whether an examiner finds DNA on an object, (b) how examiners respond to challenges pertaining to the testing choices they make, and (c) how jurors weigh DNA evidence following such challenges.  This research includes two controlled experimental studies.  In Study 1, one hundred experienced DNA examiners will receive materials from a simulated criminal case in which their expectations about where DNA evidence likely exists on an object is manipulated via contextual cues.  The examiners will then perform a DNA analysis and provide conclusions.  Next, the examiners' will respond to cross-exam-like questions that challenge their testing decisions and conclusions.  Study 2 examines how mock jurors' judgments and decisions about a case are affected by (a) the complexity of arguments raised on the DNA examiner's cross-exam, and (b) the examiner's response to those arguments.\r\n\r\nThis research has significant implications for the criminal justice system, for the practice of forensic science, and for the advancement of psychological theory.  The criminal justice system benefits from identifying, and then correcting for, factors that can interfere with forensic decision-making.  These improvements, which may find their way into forensic science training programs and protocols, can help convict the guilty and free the innocent.  This research also advances psychological theory by providing insight into how and when cognitive and motivational biases operate in a complex, multi-stage, multi-person decision task.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDNA analysis is widely viewed as one of the best types of evidence that can be offered in a criminal case.  A report by the National Academy of Sciences states that DNA analysis, \"has set the bar higher for other forensic science methodologies because it has provided a tool with a higher degree of reliability and relevance than any other forensic technique\" (National Academy of Sciences, 2009, p. 41).  But, like other forensic science methods, DNA analysis requires the experts who conduct these analyses to make judgments about (a) how they will go about testing the evidence, and (b) how they will describe the results of those tests in court in response to questions asked by attorneys.  A question arises, then, as to whether and how DNA examiners' judgments are influenced by other people or other evidence.\n\n \n\nIn three studies, we provided several hundred experienced, practicing DNA examiners with realistic materials from a simulated criminal case.  The case involved a violent assault in which a baseball bat was used as a weapon.  DNA examiners were tasked with finding case-relevant DNA on the bat.  Each examiner had to decide how and where to test the bat.  If the examiner tests too little of the bat, he or she risks failing to find critical DNA evidence.  If the examiner tests too much of the bat (by swabbing the entire bat), he or she risks losing critical DNA evidence from, say, the hard-to-detect skin cells of the assailant that may be masked by a larger concentration of DNA from the blood or saliva of the victim.  We attempted to influence the testing decisions of the DNA examiners in various ways such as by telling them who owned the bat, how the investigators wanted the bat tested, or how strong the non-forensic evidence in the case was.\n\n \n\nOur general finding was that these outside influences did not affect most DNA examiners' testing decisions.  The examiners generally chose to test the bat in a similar way regardless of what the other evidence indicated or what the investigator wanted them to do.  However, we did see evidence of individual differences among examiners in response to attorney questions. Whereas most examiners readily conceded reasonable limits on their findings, some sparred with attorneys on cross-exam or made concessions that were arguably too great. \n\n \n\nTo test whether the observed variability in DNA examiners' answers to attorney questions might make a difference to triers of fact, we conducted a fourth study with several hundred jury-eligible mock jurors.  We found that some of the variability in examiners' answers did affect the way laypeople viewed the strength of the DNA evidence in the assault case.\n\n \n\nAt a broad level, this research provides insight about how DNA examiners think.  It also provides some assurance to the criminal justice system that the tests that DNA examiners conduct are not easily affected by extraneous considerations.  Finally, this research has implications for the training of forensic scientists, the way in which DNA examiners should interact with law enforcement and investigators, the standards courts may wish to use for introducing expert opinion testimony, and the faith that triers of fact should place on testimony by DNA examiners. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan J Koehler"
