 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban areas are expanding rapidly around the globe, resulting in drastic changes to the environment compared to natural landscapes: buildings and parking lots replace natural vegetation in cities. The urban environment, which encompasses a major portion of the US, directly affects the ecology and evolution of species, but little research has been conducted to understand the intensity and scope of these effects. Another critical dimension of global change is biological invasions, which threaten biodiversity worldwide. This project connects two important dimensions of global change to test a novel hypothesis that urban adaptation may increase the success of biological invasions, which often have dramatic ecological and economic effects on the invaded habitats. This award will also support the STEM training of a postdoctoral researcher and numerous graduate and undergraduate students. Curriculum materials will be developed for K-12 education and outreach efforts will target the urban areas where this research will be conducted and where the research team members live. \r\n\r\nThe way organisms interact with their environment is expected to drive intense natural selection on their morphology and behavior. This work will study the crested anole lizard, which is native to Puerto Rico but established via human-mediated introductions in several places outside its natural range. This research will use field and laboratory studies to first test the hypothesis that a widespread lizard species is adapted behaviorally, morphologically, and physiologically to urbanization. Second, the study will test if adaptation occurs at multiple life history stages, including embryos and juveniles. Lastly, the study will investigate a novel idea in invasion biology that adaptation to urban environments may predispose populations to become successful invaders of other urban areas, using molecular data to identify source populations. Detailed portions of the research will estimate thermal tolerance and examine behavioral thermoregulation in different habitats, use SNPs to identify the source population of the invaders, and examine habitat influence on development in the field. This research will help to establish whether or not adaptation to urban areas can facilitate the process of biological invasion, and will likely lead to conclusions that can be generalized across other urban tolerant species and biological invasions.",

The research of this collaborative project has been centered on two main hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that urban lizard populations may be evolutionarily adapting to the unique challenges of city life. Urban environments differ from natural habitats in an extraordinary range of different ways. &nbsp;For instance, urban areas tend to be warmer than forests, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. From an arboreal lizard&rsquo;s perspective, locomotion in urban habitats is also very different from running and jumping in forest. Urban surfaces tend to be broader, flatter, and smoother, and the distances between perches and refuges can be very large. Second, we hypothesized that adaptation to urban environments, if it is has occurred in this species, may have contributed to its success as a biological invader. The logic underlying this hypothesis is merely that urban areas in different places on the globe tend to be more similar than do natural habitats nearby.

Specifically, the broad, flat surfaces of urban environments should favor lizards with long limbs as this trait facilitates rapid locomotion on flat substrates. In addition, the artificial materials than typify urban areas are much smoother than the rough substrates, such as tree bark, of forests. This should favor lizards with more adhesive scales as these should help prevent falls while climbing. Performance trials conducted under laboratory conditions strongly reinforced this interpretation. We also found that the differences in morphology between urban and natural sites persisted when lizards from each environment were bred and reared in captivity, suggesting that trait changes may be genetically-based and are thus the result of divergent evolution between habitats. We next compared thermal tolerances between lizards from urban and forest environments. Here too we found that urban and forest lizards differed in the predicted direction, with urban lizards capable of withstanding much higher temperatures than their forest counterparts. In contrast to our findings for morphology, however, this difference disappeared when lizards were acclimated to constant conditions.
