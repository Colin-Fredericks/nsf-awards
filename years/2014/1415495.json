 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a cost-effective and scalable manufacturing process for producing high performance silicon carbide (SiC) fiber for use in protective polymer coatings to increase wear resistance and extend service lifetime.   The outcomes of this project will include reduced environmental disruption and potential savings of billions of dollars associated with protecting valuable assets such as underground and offshore piping infrastructure. Successful completion of the proposed Phase I project will result in a commercially feasible process to manufacture SiC fiber which can increase coating wear resistance and service lifetime by at least 30 percent compared to existing additives, at a price point that enables high-volume applications.  SiC fiber is expected to enable more rapid substitution away from solvent-based coatings which currently dominate the market and towards sustainable, environmentally friendly water-based solutions. Widespread adoption of SiC fiber in the $100 billion global protective coatings market will drive the creation of high-skill, high-paying jobs as companies build research and development teams tasked with developing new categories of products using the results of this research.\r\n\r\nCoatings are used to protect equipment in increasingly demanding environments; the need is for extended service lifetime to reduce total cost of ownership in critical applications. SiC fiber is not used commercially today by the global protective coatings industry in spite of observed performance benefits, because of the high cost of current manufacturing processes. The project will develop a process for manufacture of SiC fiber from renewable, inexpensive organic precursor material, converted to finished product in a single, step-wise reactor at high throughput and low cost.  The SiC fiber will be discontinuous with a diameter of 5-10 microns and a length of over 30 microns, with a high purity and density, and it will be easily dispersed in water or solvent for effortless incorporation into a wide range of protective coatings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project was to find a synthesis pathway to make cost effective silicon carbide fibers.  Silicon carbide fibers can be purchased commercially today at prices exceeding $600 per pound.  At these prices, the material is relegated as a research item, or is suitable for use in only very selective applications where cost is not an issue.   \n\nIn this project, we attempted to make silicon carbide fibers using cellulosic materials and the precursor fiber.   The fibers were carbonized in an inert atmosphere.  Then a silicon sources was added to the material (silicon dioxide).  Proprietary catalyst technology was also used.   Carbon and silicon dioxide are known to convert into silicon carbide at temperatures of 1500 oC to 2000 oC.  The mixture was heated to these temperatures with the goal of converting the material into silicon carbide. \n\nThe objective of converting cellulosic fibers into silicon carbide was not achieved.  Under no conditions could fiber morphology be maintained.  The carbonized fibers were converted into silicon carbide.  However, the final result was silicon carbide particulate, not fiber.  As the fibers were converted into SiC, they lost their fiber structure and disintegrated into particulate. \n\nEven though the goal of converting cellulosic fiber into silicon carbide was not achieved, a positive and unexpected outcome was achieved.   Through an investigation into the crystallinity and graphitic nature of the carbonized fibers, we discovered that certain crystal structures were more suitable than others in maintaining the fiber shape through the conversion process.  It was discovered that the less graphitic the fiber, the more suitable for conversion into SiC fibers.  It was established that all carbonized cellulosic fibers (rayon, tencel, wood pulp) were too graphitic and never able to maintain fiber shape through the conversion process.   However, in this project, it was discovered that high yield SiC can be achieved through carbon fibers with low graphite content.    \n\nBased on this low-graphite discovery, a range of carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and petroleum pitch were then investigated.  It was found that high yield could be achieved through lower graphite, more amorphous carbon fibers.    In conclusion, even though no route was found to convert cellulosic fibers into silicon carbide fiber, it was discovered how to dramatically improve yield and reduce cost through the proper selection of PAN or pitch based carbon fiber.   This accomplishment will be implemented commercially.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas E Quantrille"
