 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the continuation of the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program as an integral part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). The active-layer network of more than 200 sites represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The 'Intellectual Merit' of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer thickness, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models. The data will also contribute to detailed process studies, and validating and developing climate change, ecology, hydrology and geocryology models. Education and outreach are essential components of the 'Broader Impacts' of CALM. The project will provide opportunities for field experience and educational participation at levels ranging from elementary school through postdoctoral. Local, predominantly indigenous people, will assist with the observations at remote sites. CALM will continue to incorporate data into its Web-based database.",

Within the permafrost system, \"active layer\" refers to the surficial horizons that seasonally thaw. Monitoring active layer thickness and trends of change over time yields important information for understanding periglacial environments and implications for infrastructure built on permafrost. The CALM program, established in the early-1990s, coordinated efforts to salvage data records and monitoring sites from past NSF-funded projects and former Soviet-funded programs, and to establish new sites using standardized methods for measuring active layer dynamics, ground temperature, and thaw settlement. This online database serves as a public resource for identifying trends at different spatial scales and the validation and development of regional to global ecological, hydrological, geocryological, and climate change models. In concert with its intellectual merits, the CALM IV project has had broader educational and societal impacts by engaging students and indigenous and other local peoples in data collection.</p>\n<p>The fourth iteration of the CALM project (CALM IV) continued the maintenance of the global active layer database (Figure 2). Sites in Alaska and Russia employing direct active layer measurements using mechanical probing were supported by the CALM IV project while the remaining sites using direct (mechanical probing and thaw tubes) and indirect (interpolation from boreholes) in the global network volunteered data annually. All data for individual sites are publically accessible and annually updated on the CALM project website (https://www2.gwu.edu/~calm/) and archived with the NSF Arctic Data Center (arcticdata.io).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analysis of the database focused on long-term records, defined as those from sites with a minimum of 10 consecutive years of reported active layer thickness data (Figure 3). The majority of long-term sites exhibit increasing or thickening active layer thickness trends associated with permafrost thaw. The mean rate of change exhibited by long-term sites is +13.94 cm/decade and the median is 3.66 cm/decade.</p>\n<p>Long-term global assessments of the CALM database facilitated regional analyses of annual anomalies in active layer thickness. Anomalies are defined as the departure from the 10-year mean. The mean value is based on the reference period from 2008 to 2017 period when there are the greatest number of contributions from the long-term sites. Figure 4 highlights both geographic differences in active layer anomaly trends for sites in different permafrost continuity zones. By far the greatest rates of increasing active layer thickness were observed in the Swiss Alps (sites in thermally conductive bedrock) and the lowest rates (some even displaying thinning trends) in Antarctica.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The long-term data generated by CALM IV project is the prime source of active-layer data for assessing the state of permafrost conditions, for parameterization and validation of permafrost, ecosystem, and hydrological models and for ground-truthing remotely sensed products.</p>\n<p>CALM developed formal partnerships with international organizations during the project period, including the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS), the Circumarctic Environmental Observation Network (CEON), and the Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) programs.
