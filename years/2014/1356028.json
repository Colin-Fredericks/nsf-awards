 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this S-STEM project is to guide high-achieving STEM students in becoming academically and civically-engaged scientists (ACES).  The underlying premise of this proposal is that as the US increases the number of STEM professionals in order to excel in innovation, it is equally important that those STEM professionals see their chosen vocations as giving them a responsibility to serve their community, nation, and world as citizens.  The ACES program will support a diverse cohort of 10-11 STEM students who will be awarded scholarships each year.  As freshmen, scholars live in a residential cluster, enroll in common courses together, and explore what it means to be civically-minded scholars. As seniors, scholars complete an individualized honors research project with a faculty member. Each ACES cohort completes community engagement projects every year that allow them to apply their STEM knowledge and their leadership skills. They will also participate in mentoring programs and career development opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe specific measurable objectives of this project are to: (1) recruit diverse students to STEM fields, (2) retain 85% of scholarship recipients in a STEM field, (3) increase civic mindedness and engagement among participants, and (4) achieve a STEM placement for 90% of the program graduates. The ACES program will enable scholars to develop professional relationships with their peers and community partners, and articulate what it means to be a civically-engaged scientist to a variety of audiences. As a result of this program, ACES students will be able to actively engage with community issues by applying their scientific body of knowledge and skills. Assessment and evaluation of the ACES program will contain both formative and summative components using both direct and indirect evidence-based measures.",

The objectives of this program were to (1) recruit diverse students to STEM fields, (2) Retain 85% of scholarship recipients in a STEM field, (3) Increase the civic mindedness and engagement among participants, and (4) Achieve a STEM placement for 90% of the program graduates. In order to meet these objectives, the PI team implemented a series of well-established methods. Scholarships were awarded to make college more accessible and allow more time for educational opportunities through reduced need for outside employment. The group of ACES students were formed into a cohort to provide a support structure in a community of like-minded scholars with diverse backgrounds. That support structure was enhanced through mentoring relationships with peers, faculty, and alumni who were able to share experiences and direct students to resources. Finally, students worked in teams to complete impactful projects that show them the relevance of the STEM disciplines to the important problems of the world. Throughout all these activities, students were given ownership of their experiences through choices in the classes, projects, and activities that lead to the learning objectives of the program. Additionally, the students were encouraged to reflect regularly on their experiences, becoming more self-aware and better able to contribute to their society.</p>\n<p>The underlying premise of this project is that as the US increases the number of STEM professionals in order to excel in innovation, it is equally important that those STEM professionals see their chosen vocations as giving them a responsibility to serve their community, nation, and world as citizens. This diverse group of students reported gains in their civic-mindedness, self-confidence, and professional development as a direct result of ACES programming. They noted these gains were specifically due to developing and implementing STEM service projects, participating in weekly meeting activities, peer-mentoring among the ACES students (both as mentor and mentee), mentoring from ACES faculty, and completing the leadership minor coursework (an academic requirement of the program that focuses on a servant-leader approach). Students reported that the scholarship funds gave them the financial capacity to attend college at this liberal-arts 4-year institution. The scholarship funds also reduced the need for outside employment, allowing the students to spend more time on their studies as well as on the STEM service projects and professional development initiatives of the ACES program.</p>\n<p><span>The three to four STEM-related service projects that our ACES scholars completed each year allowed this project to have an impact on our local community both on and off campus. Off-campus service recipients included local (rural) elementary school students, a locally based international non-governmental organization (Self-Help International), a nursing home/retirement community (Bartels), the local food bank users, and a small business owner. The broader public was the intended audience for a science podcast, vermicomposting, and a science-centered escape room. The college community benefited from on-campus drinking water testing and the analysis of student academic services (Supplemental Instruction) data. The college community also benefited indirectly from the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of high-achieving STEM students in the Scholars program and Leadership Minor. The participation of ACES scholars in these college programs brought STEM knowledge depth and breadth as well as civic-mindedness and a servant-leadership approach to all their endeavors, which brought joy and meaningfulness to their peers and instructors. The S-STEM grant provided the financial resources to support our best STEM students in their development as civic-minded professionals. We expect to continue to yield benefits to the broader American society throughout the professional lives of the 22 ACES scholars and three PIs</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"a36bb854c610d44-autofill-overlay-host\" class=\"a36bb854c610d44-autofill-overlay-host\" style=\"position: absolute;
