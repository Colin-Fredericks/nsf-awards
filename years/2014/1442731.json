Biodiversity data that document the degree of variation of life through species diversity, phenology, and geographic occurrence will be generated by science classrooms and delivered to scientists who need this data for sustainability research, enriching ongoing studies of invasive species, biodiversity, and climate science. Interviews and surveys will help identify and address scientific, social, and technological challenges associated with citizen science data sharing.\r\n\r\nThe research will result in: 1) new hands-on STEM learning opportunities in classrooms across the nation; 2) ecological research on sustainability in both professional research settings and in participating classrooms; and 3) insights into opportunities, challenges, and strategies for improving the distribution and use of citizen science data.",

We also index biodiversity occurrences from larger data providers such as GBIF, iDigBio and natural history museums. Users of Fresh Data can query these resources across taxonomic group, geographic location, time and traits.

Fresh Data is being used by the EDDMaps Project to monitor in real time invasive species across North America.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also partnered with data generators to produce exemplar data sets and to better understand motivation for citizen science engagement through training and outreach activities.
