 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens are symbiotic associations between a fungus and one or more algae or cyanobacteria. They perform critical ecological functions such as soil stability and water purification in many ecosystems. The lichen genus Sticta performs an important function in forest and woodland ecosystems in temperate and tropical regions. Due to their large size and capacity to store and release large amounts of water, these lichens contribute to the water cycle, including in regions that are water reservoirs for urban areas. Most species contain cyanobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen and thus function as biological fertilizers. Sticta species are particularly sensitive indicators of ecological disturbance, air pollution and global climate change, and have therefore disappeared from many habitats over vast geographical regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Although Sticta includes 120 species, genetic data suggest that perhaps as many as 400 species await discovery throughout the world, particularly in tropical mountains. An international team of researchers seeks to fully elucidate Sticta diversity using modern genomic approaches, and reconstruct its evolutionary history to further our understanding of the role of global climatic shifts and geological events on the diversification of these symbiotic fungi.  This knowledge is critical in understanding and conserving their important ecological roles they play for our society.  The project also contains components of citizen science and outreach materials aimed at public education and ecotourism.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together a broad array of tools to elucidate the evolution and diversification of Sticta within a framework of historical biogeography, including a combination of traditional and next-generation DNA sequencing methods to test the viability of DNA barcoding for a large lichen fungal genus. The research will begin with targeted collection of Sticta specimens which will be used for DNA sequence and morphological analyses. Using phylogenetic methods the project will infer species delimitations, divergence dates among lineages, biogeography, ecological niche and morphological character state reconstructions. Novel approaches that effectively integrate molecular and morphological data are implemented. This includes morphology-based phylogenetic binning to place historical type specimens within the molecular phylogeny.  These tools will resolve the biodiversity questions within Sticta and generate tools essential to their identification.  The evolution of phenotypes and photosymbiodemes (lichens that include two different types of photobionts) and their importance for the understanding of morphogenesis and interactions of fungal and algal or cyanobacterial partners in lichens will be studied. The project trains two postdocs and includes two international workshops.",

One such association is the lichen. At least 15,000 species of fungi develop a lichen following contact with green algae or cyanobacteria, hence lichenization is considered a highly successful trophic strategy for fungi, with lichens occurring in virtually all habitats around the world. Most fungi are invisible to the naked eye for much of their life, as their body consists of microscopic filaments, hidden in the soil, the living or dead bodies they consume, and their presence is revealed by the development of exposed fruiting body. Not surprisingly, much of fungal biodiversity remains thus to be discovered. By contrast, lichens typically occur on their substrate (e.g., rock, soil or trees) and hence their diversity was for the most part thought to be well estimated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Intellectual merit: Our biodiversity surveys, based on integrated inferences from genetic and morphological traits, tackled several lineages within the Peltigerales, with a focus on the Lobariaceae. Within the focal genus&nbsp;<em>Sticta</em>, we have described a new species from the imperiled Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain of eastern North America and a new species from the hypermaritime regions of northwestern North America, two rare and endangered species strengthening the uniqueness of the North American lichen flora. The East Africa islands of Madagascar, Mauritius and Reunion, harbor 26 new species, with some species restricted to individual mountains of Madagascar. Much of this diversity had remained unnoticed because only five distinct lichen thalli could be recognized (Figs. 1?4). Thus, multiple fungi form morphologically virtually identical lichen associations. Similarly, the survey of the American populations assigned to the species&nbsp;<em>Pseudocyphellaria crocata</em>, a conspicuous lichen widely collected for its bright yellow pigment, revealed that this species, originally described from Asia, and thought to be virtually cosmopolitan, was in fact absent from the New World, but represented instead by 13 distinct species. While for the most part this reflected that the broad morphological variation attributed to a single species could instead be broken down into discrete combinations that each defined a species, some lichens that differed conspicuously in their reproductive structures, and were on this basis considered formed by distinct species, appear to be established by one fungus. Consequently, high morphological variation of lichen thalli is typically revelatory of the heterogeneity of the species, and individual lichen-forming fungi can switch their mode of reproduction, and develop lichen association that look different! Thus, the diversity of lichen forming fungi remains poorly understood, and the richness of our natural heritage, even in well-explored regions such as the United States, remains largely underestimated, which leads to the risk of accepting local or regional extinction with the assumption that the species is widespread, when in fact it may be geographically highly restricted. Such dramatic change in estimates of species diversity, has critical implications for our understanding of the ecology of lichens and their conservation needs.</p>\n<p>These studies unraveling a hidden diversity throughout the world, questioned the notion that lichens are old and evolutionarily static lineages. Instead the evolutionary history of lichens, at least in the Peltigerales is marked by migration, rapid diversifications, shifts, expansions (generalism) and contractions (specificity) in selection of photosynthetic partners, as well as associated bacteria and other fungal partners inhabiting the lichen, and perhaps transfer of genetic tools from other organisms through, for example, hybridization. Some of these processes are well documented in flowering plants, birds and other animals but remained ignored for less charismatic, less conspicuous organisms, for they were assumed to be more primitive and thus evolutionarily more stagnant! Thus, the processes underlying the extant diversity of lichen-forming fungi reflect a highly dynamic nature of these lineages, and complex evolutionary processes, common perhaps to all branches of the tree of life.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts. The collaborative project focused on enhancing our understanding of the diversity and the evolution of the genus&nbsp;<em>Sticta</em>and its relatives within the Peltigerales, provided significant training and learning opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in evolutionary biology, in particular of lichen forming fungi and their partners. Furthermore, lichen blindness, that is the lack of awareness of lichen diversity even in areas where they are abundant and diverse, was addressed through nature walks in New England and eco-tourism activities in Southern South America. Here, the visitors to the southernmost forests dominated by only four species of trees but hosting many species of lichens, including many Lobariaceae, were engaged in discovering the nature of the colorful mats draping trees and rocks, or lining the forest floor, through guided tours and various printed guides to the miniature forests of the region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/11/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bernard&nbsp;Goffinet</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354631/1354631_10321544_1575240224356_Goffinet_Fig2_Sticta_Mascarene--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354631/1354631_10321544_1575240224356_Goffinet_Fig2_Sticta_Mascarene--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sticta in the Mascarenes.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354631/1354631_10321544_1575240224356_Goffinet_Fig2_Sticta_Mascarene--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sticta in the Mascarenes.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2.
