 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whirligig beetles are a family of aquatic beetles containing approximately 1,000 species. All whirligig beetles live in very similar ways, yet exhibit a great morphological diversity. What can explain the diversity of species in this family of beetles, who all behave and live in similar ways? This research attempts to establish if selection on reproductive traits has been a major factor in the evolution of this group leading to its diversity of species.  The investigation will look at numerous reproductively selected features in these beetles, then using a phylogenetic tree, compare related groups to see if branches of the tree with more species, also show a larger number of selected traits. One of the traits to be studied is sperm shape. Whirligig beetle sperm show a diversity of forms and the reconstructed evolution of sperm in this group will be compared to the rate of speciation.\r\n\tSelection on reproductive traits has long been promoted as a powerful force for creating new species. However, few studies supporting this idea have looked at large evolutionary scales. The study of sperm within this group can be used to test previously established hypotheses about sperm and female reproductive tract co-evolution, as well as make known the diversity of whirligig beetle sperm, including several types of conjugation and a variety of sizes.  This project will train graduate student in evolutionary biology and this student will mentor several undergraduate students in systematics and arthropod curation. Identified specimens will be accessioned at UNM and included in a publicly accessible database enhancing infrastructure for research and education.",
