 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Mississippi (UM) will be conducting the planning grant meeting for becoming a site of the Broadband Wireless Access and Applications (BWAC) I/UCRC. The UM site will conduct cooperative research in the area of broadband wireless technology involving faculty from electrical engineering and computer science. The planning workshop will be held at conference facility on the UM campus in Oxford, MS. From this workshop the UM site will identify the specific research areas that are of relevance to potential industry members and align the research projects according to industry member needs. UM site has research capabilities in the areas of cognitive radios, sensor localization, file transfer protocols for big data, wireless transmission of medical-images, wireless security, wireless monitoring of elderly in assisted-living facility, and smart grids. Four participating UM electrical engineering researchers have expertise in wireless communications, and specialization in one or more areas related to networks, coding theory, performance analysis in fading channels, emerging wireless standards and technology, decision fusion, statistical signal processing, and wireless security. Additional faculty expertise at UM exists in the areas of electromagnetic (EM) theory and antenna measurement. Faculty with relevant expertise from the Department of Computer Science and UM's industry-aligned Haley Barbour Center for Manufacturing Excellence (CME) will augment the research efforts of the UM BWAC I/UCRC site. The focus of the center is targeted to reach out to the technology and equipment manufacturers of wireless communications industries, defense electronics industries dealing with radars and communications systems, power companies and utilities, manufacturing and health-care industries within the geographical region of the University, and certain Mississippi state agencies. The collaboration with industry members in the Southeastern U.S. will provide co-op and internship opportunities for students opening networking opportunities and exposure to industrial-experts lectures. \r\n\r\nThe UM site is expected to provide graduate education and research opportunities for 10 students annually. Annually, 6 to 8 qualified undergraduate students will be encouraged to participate in the research projects pursued by the center and will be paid undergraduate stipends. The center will be marketed as an avenue for technology development thereby recruiting 20 to 30 additional undergraduate and 10 to 15 additional graduate students to the educational programs offered by the Electrical Engineering department at UM. By leveraging the minority graduate fellowships offered by NSF and the support of the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Departments at Jackson State University, which is primarily a baccalaureate level HBCU, the UM site expects to attract and graduate three to four underrepresented minority Ph.D. students over a five-year period. Summer workshops for middle school children will be conducted in collaboration with the UM Center for Science and Math Education to kindle their interest in STEM and wireless applications. Specialized courses and workshops for industries on big data transfer, wireless telemedicine, and cognitive radios will be developed and offered. These courses will be elective courses for the advanced undergraduates and graduate students.",
