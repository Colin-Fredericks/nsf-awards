 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support a conference on Combinatorial Stochastic Processes, to be held at U.C. San Diego on June 20-21, 2014. The conference covers topics such as exchangeable random partitions, models of coalescence and fragmentation, and tree-valued processes. The conference organizers are committed to trying to help advance the careers of young mathematicians, women, and minorities.   The conference will include sessions in which participants will have an opportunity to give ten-minute presentations or discuss open problems. These sessions should facilitate interactions between young researchers and more senior researchers. Priority for financial support to attend the conference will be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to faculty at smaller institutions who do not have other sources of financial support.",
