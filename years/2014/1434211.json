 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the largest annual conference of the information theory society, and has been held continuously since 1954. It covers a variety of topics related to the studies on information theory, including coding, communications and communications networks, complexity and cryptography, detection and estimation, learning, Shannon Theory, stochastic processes, and emerging applications of information theory. It is considered one of the premier IEEE conferences. \r\n\r\nISIT is the primary meeting venue of the leading researchers in the field, many of whom are supported by grants from the National Science Foundation. It is the ideal venue for researchers to share their latest ideas and results, and to discuss the impact of these results on practical applications. It is also where the more application oriented researchers gain an appreciation for the key theoretical results in the field. The information theory field provides an excellent example of theoretical research working in close synergy with system design and applications. ISIT has also traditionally attracted a large number of students, comprising around 40 per cent of the participant population. ISIT is an excellent learning opportunity for students as well as a means to establish useful research collaborations for the future. Support for student in the US to travel to ISIT is crucial to ensuring a vibrant student participation.\r\n",
