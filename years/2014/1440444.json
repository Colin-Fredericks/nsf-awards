 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (and associated events) will be held in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, during the week of October 21-24, 2014. This grant from the National Science Foundation funds approximately 20 US-based graduate students to attend ICNP. The goal of this funding is to broaden the audience attending the premier network protocol conference, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP), and as a result, raise the level of interaction and the potential for new collaborations, new investigations, and higher quality research.\r\n\r\nBy supporting graduate students to attend ICNP 2014, this award increases the dissemination of the conference research results to a larger and a more diverse audience, which otherwise would not have been able to attend. This in turn will contribute to the strength and inclusiveness of the research community, and will lead to the long term health and vitalization of ICNP. In addition, giving preference in grant awards to women and underrepresented students hopefully will increase the participation among these groups. By advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the conference. A broad, as well as diverse population is key to the health of the research community and the discipline.\r\n\r\nConference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students - especially those from underrepresented groups - to attend a high quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from seeing research presented that may be related to what they are working on, or may inspire them to try a new direction. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everyone benefits from increased diversity of participants attending the conference.",
