 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transfers of carbon, nutrients and pollutants from the land to streams and their changes as they move through river networks are issues that motivate environmental scientists and water resource managers.  Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a central chemical in streams and rivers that affects the forms and movements of contaminants, light penetration through the water, metabolism of life in the streams, pH, and the efficiency of water treatments by municipalities.  This study aims to improve predictions of DOM formation and movement from small headwater streams and our understanding of the factors that change the amount and forms of DOM during as it moves downstream.  One goal of this research is to greatly improve a computer model of DOM transport and transformation as it moves through a watershed and into the headwater streams.  This model links rainfall and runoff that generate streamflow to the biological and chemical processes that lead to changes in the amount and forms of DOM.   The model will be tested against actual measurements of DOM made in several headwater streams of the Connecticut River along its length.  Measurements will then also be made in larger parts of the Connecticut River downriver that will help explain how DOM changes along the entire drainage network.  This project challenges a long standing picture of how streams and rivers work, called the River Continuum Concept, proposing that a newer view may be required, referred to as the Pulse-Shunt Concept.  \r\n\r\nThis project will involve graduate students and a post-doctoral associate in the laboratory, field, and modeling ends of the research.  It will also build on a partnership with the Connecticut Science Museum to construct educational activities and displays related to watershed ecology and management for the general public.",

Due to the increase in concentration and decrease in residence time with hydrological events, both the ?pulse? of fresh DOM and the ?shunt? downstream are accentuated compounding the importance of big rivers for the removal of terrestrial DOM at annual time scales.

Advances in remote sampling and remote sensing products will greatly accelerate and strengthen our ability to integrate landscape scaling into drainage network biogeochemistry.  The PSC formalizes the need for a better understanding of decomposition rates, hydrologic residence times, and photolysis.  These parameters are highly dynamic yet poorly resolved, thus highlighting critical frontier research areas in the hydrological and biogeochemical sciences.
