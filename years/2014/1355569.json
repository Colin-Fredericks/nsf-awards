 "awd_abstract_narration": "The S-STEM Program at Gaston College is using high-impact strategies to improve persistence and graduation rates for STEM students.  Gaston College (GC) is a state-supported, open-door, comprehensive community college serving Gaston and Lincoln counties in North Carolina, and is a member of the 58 institution North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS). This program is intended for students preparing to transfer to a four-year institution for further study in any STEM discipline. This project enables the recruitment of larger numbers of STEM students and helps scholars address major barriers to completion through strong peer-support networks, and focused advising and mentoring.  Success of the scholars is fostered by financial support, academic cohorts, mentoring, and supplemental group activities. While this project targets all STEM students, based on the demographics of the college and surrounding community, the project has a positive impact on the numbers of underrepresented students enrolling in and completing STEM programs. \r\n\r\nThe Gaston College program uses high-impact strategies including cohort formation mentoring and meta-cognitive exercises to improve persistence and graduation rates for STEM students. The goals include (1) transformation of curricula through integration of inquiry-based instruction and development of a research methods course with an undergraduate research component as a capstone experience; (2) centralization of STEM student support services within a center environment to include advising, mentoring, cooperative work experiences and undergraduate research experiences, and tutoring; and (3) reduction of the unmet financial need of cohort students by providing scholarships.  As part of the evaluation process, quantitative assessment is collected for both for scholarship recipients and the general population seeking Associate of Science degrees. Data include GPA, course grades, retention rates, enrollment and rates of progress towards degree, percentage of underrepresented groups, graduation rates, and transfer and/or job placement rate.",

Using NSF SSTEM funding, the SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;initiative provided scholarships and holistic student support services to scholars in order to&nbsp;allow these students to reduce the number of hours they were working for pay and focus more energy on their studies, thereby increasing student academic performance. The literature supports the use of holistic student services along with scholarships to increase student performance.&nbsp;SPARC<sup>3</sup>scholars successfully received these elements, via the formation of learning communities, interaction with a mentor, and enrollment in a specific set of courses, to promote retention and graduation rates.</p>\n<p><strong>BROADER IMPACT:</strong>&nbsp;When examining the overall performance of SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;scholars as compared to the overall Associate in Science (AS) population at Gaston College, SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;students outperformed their peers in course grades, year-to-year retention, grade point average, and graduation and transfer rates. These students were also more likely to attend full-time and, thus, completed their degree faster. Additionally, students and faculty cited many program strengths including cohort structure, mentoring, undergraduate research participation, and financial support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While this project targeted all STEM students,&nbsp;based on the demographics of the college and surrounding community,&nbsp;the project expected to have a positive impact on the numbers of underrepresented students enrolling in and completing STEM programs, which it did. The percentage of female SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;students exceeded the number of female students in the general AS population; and in years one and two, the SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;program enrolled a higher number of African American students than was found in the general population of AS students. In years two and four, the program enrolled a higher number of Hispanic students and American Indian/Alaskan Native students than the general AS population. Overall, 62 students participated in the program and&nbsp;<strong>over 80% of these students transferred into a STEM program at a university where they have since either graduated or are continuing their education.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>OUTCOMES:&nbsp;</strong>The SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;program identified&nbsp;<strong>three primary objectives</strong>&nbsp;at the onset of the grant related to recruitment, retention, and progression of students.&nbsp; This project successfully met these objectives by the time of the project conclusion.</p>\n<p><em>Objective 1:</em>&nbsp;<em>Recruitment-</em>&nbsp;During year one of implementation, the percentage of full-time AS students was 48.05%. By the conclusion of the grant, this percentage had increased to 50.6%, while the overall percentage of full-time student enrollment at the College has plummeted to 30% due to changes in the local economic environment. These changes also impacted the SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;program and held increases in full-time enrollment status to more modest gains during the grant period. However, the overall stated goal for recruitment was to recruit 45 students for SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;participation.<strong>The actual number of students recruited and directly served was 62,</strong>&nbsp;with 48 students funded by National Science Foundation funds and the remaining students served with privately donated funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As a result, the overall goal to recruit 45 students into the program was met.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><em>Objective 2: Retention-</em>&nbsp;During the term of the grant, the year-to-year persistence rate of SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;scholars in the Associate of Science program varied from a low of 82.35% to a high of 100% with an overall persistence rate of 94.23% for all cohort years combined.&nbsp;<strong>As a result, the overall goal for 90% retention was met.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Objective 3: Progression-</em>&nbsp;During the term of the grant, the transfer or employment rate for SPARC<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;students varied from a low of 70.60% to a high of 100% with an overall rate of 80.60% for all cohort years combined.&nbsp;<strong>As a result, the overall goal for 80% transfer or employment was met.</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the term of the grant,&nbsp;<strong>the cohort structure was noted as being the greatest strength of the program</strong>&nbsp;by both student and faculty participants. The cohort structure allowed for community building between students as well as increased interaction between students and faculty. Students cited the cohort model with increasing their study skills and boosting their confidence in their abilities.&nbsp;<strong>Students also noted that the financial support was a key strength of the program.</strong>&nbsp;Additionally, faculty mentors were highly valued by students as these mentors were able to guide their research interests or help them with academic and career decisions. While many strengths were noted, faculty and students also reported some weaknesses. Students felt limited by the mandatory cohort course schedule which allowed them little flexibility in choosing courses of interest. For faculty, the cohort structure at times led to students exhibiting ?cliquey? behaviors in and out of the classroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;When faculty and students were asked if they would participate again, all responded affirmatively.&nbsp;<strong>All felt that participation was very valuable despite any weaknesses experienced.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ashley&nbsp;Hagler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854293026_IMG_3733--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854293026_IMG_3733--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SPARC3 Cohort B Graduation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854293026_IMG_3733--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SPARC3 Cohort B Graduation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduation picture of members of SPARC3 Scholars Cohort B</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashley Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SPARC3 Cohort B Graduation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854643977_IMG_43232--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854643977_IMG_43232--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SPARC3 Scholars at NC State University\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854643977_IMG_43232--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SPARC3 Scholars at NC State University\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SPARC3 Scholars at NC State University learning about the College of Natural Resources</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashley Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SPARC3 Scholars at NC State University</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854823173_IMG_2740--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854823173_IMG_2740--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduation of First Cohort of SPARC3 Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571854823173_IMG_2740--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduation of First Cohort of SPARC3 Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduation of First Cohort of SPARC3 Scholars</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashley Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graduation of First Cohort of SPARC3 Scholars</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571855108714_IMG_2181--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571855108714_IMG_2181--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SPARC3 Scholar Field Research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355569/1355569_10322438_1571855108714_IMG_2181--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SPARC3 Scholar Field Research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SPARC3 Scholar participating in salamander collection in Highlands, NC.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashley Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Hagler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SPARC3 Scholar Field Research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
