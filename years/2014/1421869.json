 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio spectrum has become an increasingly expensive and scarce resource due to the exponential growth of the wireless industry and the rapid proliferation of wireless devices over the past couple of decades.  Ironically, studies of spectrum usage have shown that much of the available spectrum is highly underutilized, due to the current policy of static allocation, which partitions the spectrum into various licensed bands.  The main goal of this project is to develop a cost-effective solution to the spectrum scarcity issue based on emerging cognitive radio technology, which has the potential to allow unlicensed users to reclaim unused spectrum in the licensed bands.  A cognitive radio is capable of detecting unused or idle spectrum and dynamically tuning its transmission and reception activities to the so-called spectrum holes.  A group of unlicensed users equipped with cognitive radios can form a network and communicate with each other via such spectrum holes.  This research focuses on developing efficient and accurate methods for cognitive radios to identify spectrum holes and allocate this spectrum to enable communications among unlicensed users without causing harmful interference to the licensed users of a spectrum band.  A major challenge of this work lies in how to perform spectrum sensing and resource allocation in a cognitive radio network to maximize its capacity while managing the additional interference and overhead incurred by the cognitive radios.  If the project is successful, the research results should have a significant impact on increasing the capacity and performance of future wireless networks.  The research is expected to advance the field of cognitive radio and contribute towards its adoption in commercial applications.  The results of this research will be applicable to future infrastructured wireless networks, as well as wireless communications in emergency scenarios such as disaster relief.  An experimental platform will be developed to prototype and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic spectrum access approach in practical wireless environments.  Students, including some from underrepresented groups, will gain practical experience from working with the cognitive radio testbed.  New course materials will be developed to teach the basics of cognitive radio technology to students at the graduate level.  \r\n\r\nThe technical approach of this research centers on a joint consideration of spectrum sensing and resource allocation, taking into account the three main dimensions of spectrum holes, i.e., time, space, and frequency.  A multidimensional characterization of spectrum holes will be developed, which incorporates a bivariate Markov chain to model temporal dynamics, power control in the context of spatial spectrum sensing, and frequency-domain search for spectrum holes in the wideband regime.   A model of a cognitive radio network based on simplicial homology will be developed to allocate spectrum resources among cognitive radio nodes, as well as the communication and computational resources required for spectrum sensing, to optimize performance from a networking perspective.  Interference modeling and management for the cognitive radio network will be addressed in conjunction with resource allocation.  The project will study tradeoffs among communications and computational resources within the proposed framework for dynamic spectrum access.  An important component of the project is the development of a cognitive radio network testbed based on an open software radio platform, which will be used to prototype and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms and protocols in realistic wireless scenarios.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Radio spectrum is fast becoming a scarce resource due to the growing proliferation of wireless devices and users.  The conventional paradigm for allocating spectrum divides it into bands that are licensed to government and commercial entities.  Unfortunately, such partitioning of the spectrum leads to a significant amount of wasted spectrum.  Cognitive radio is an emerging technology that has the potential to reclaim unused spectrum without causing harm to legacy devices via a new paradigm that allows spectrum to be accessed and shared dynamically according to actual spectrum usage patterns.\nIn this research project, methodologies were developed that enable cognitive radios to efficiently and accurately detect and predict the presence of spectrum holes existing jointly in time and frequency across a wide spectrum band.  The basic approach involves identifying primary user channels within the spectrum band and monitoring these channels to determine the best spectrum hole opportunities for the secondary, unlicensed users.  An important feature of the approach is the application of a method called ?optimal computing budget allocation,? borrowed from the field of simulation optimization, to monitoring the set of channels as efficiently as possible.  Our approach essentially learns the characteristics of the identified primary user channels to enable accurate detection of spectrum holes.  Accurate spectrum sensing is critical to avoid causing harmful interference to the primary or licensed users of the spectrum.  Another aspect of the research involved the application of novel techniques for processing radio signals to improve the fidelity of spectrum sensing, particularly for weak signals in the presence of noise.\nAnother outcome of the project is a framework for dynamically allocating the unused spectrum ?harvested? via spectrum sensing among a group of cognitive radios to allow them to form a communication network.  The proposed spectrum sensing methodologies and spectrum allocation schemes were validated through computer simulations, as well as proof-of-concept implementations on software radio platforms.  The research project advanced the field of knowledge in spectrum sensing and spectrum allocation to enable dynamic spectrum access allowing secondary users to share the radio spectrum with primary users.  The results of the research will contribute to alleviating the issue of spectrum scarcity and help to usher in a new era of more dynamic sharing and usage of the radio spectrum.\nAs part of the educational component of the project a new graduate-level course on software-defined radio was developed, which includes a laboratory component to provide hands-on experience in programming software radios.  Software-defined radios have been steadily gaining traction in the telecommunications industry in recent years.   In contrast to legacy wireless devices, software radio platforms can be easily modified through software programming, making them attractive for rapid prototyping and technology transfer.  A drawback of software radios is slower processing speeds, but this can be offset by offloading some of the computationally intensive processing to a hardware-programmable part of the software radio platform known as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).  As their capstone senior design project, a team of undergraduate students designed and programmed algorithms on the FPGA of a software-defined radio to accelerate its performance.   Software-defined radio platforms were found to be a very useful educational tool to teach wireless systems concepts to a new generation of communications engineers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian L Mark"
