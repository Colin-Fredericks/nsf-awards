 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project: Our perception of the world seems a coherent whole, yet it is built out of the activities of many thousands or even millions of neurons, and similarly for our memories, thoughts, and actions. It seems difficult to understand the emergence of behavioral and phenomenal coherence unless the underlying neural activity also is coherent. But if the neurons are not independent, how do we describe their collective activity? In this work, The PI takes several approaches to this problem. In each case the PI is reaching for a theoretical framework with a generality that transcends the details of particular systems, but in each case the work is grounded by intimate collaboration with several experimental groups. It is now conventional to assert that the emergence of new, larger data sets in the study of biological systems creates a need for new and more efficient methods of data management and analysis. Thus, it is widely expected that the BRAIN initiative, which will provide substantial resources to advance our ability to record simultaneously from many neurons, will also have a significant \"computational\" component related to the storage, handling, and analysis of the huge bodies of data that will be generated. It is much less widely appreciated that making sense of the collective behavior in systems with many interacting degrees of freedom requires theory, not just analysis. The goal of this work is to develop such a theoretical framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI's collaborators are using multi-electrode arrays to monitor activity in populations of ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina, as well as optical methods to monitor activity in mammalian cortical and hippocampal circuits, and in the whole brain of the nematode C elegans. The PI will  use maximum entropy ideas, which have had some success in such problems, to build models of the joint distribution of activity across the hundreds of neurons in each of these experiments. The entropy of this distribution determines the capacity of the network to carry information, and the geometry of the distribution captures intuition about network function. Beyond exploring the distribution of activity, the PI will construct a \"thermodynamics\" for these networks that will allow to place real networks in a phase diagram of possible networks. Finally, the PI will turn to dynamical aspects of network behavior, focusing on the encoding of predictive information. The PI's research is well integrated with teaching at the graduate and undergraduate level, and there will be a special effort to create a \"current topics\" course that brings issues at the interface of physics and biology to the attention of a broader group of students. In addition, the PI is engaged is a series of public outreach efforts, which will culminate in a book for a general audience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLife is more than the sum of its parts.  An important example is that our thoughts, actions, memories, and percepts arise not from single cells in our brain, but from the coordinated activity of many hundreds or thousands of cells.  How should we understand this emergence of brain function from its many tiny ingredients?\n\nIn fact, suhc emergent phenomena are all around us.  The same molecules of water can arrange themselves to be a drop of liquid or a solid cube of ice.  The familiar ideas of liquid and solid are not properties of the molecules, but rather emerge from interactions among many molecules.  Unlike the brain, we really understand how this works.\n\nFor many years it has been hoped that the same language that we use to describe emergent phenomena in the \"physical\" world could also be used to describe what happens in living systems, on many different scales.  It has not been clear whether this should be understood as a metaphor - the coordination of nerve cells in our brain is like the organization of water molecules in a block of ice - or whether we should take these ideas seriously as a theory.  In particular, can we use these ideas to predict the results of new experiments on the brain?\n\nThe revolutionary development of new experimental methods allows us to listen in, simultaneously, on many nerve cells at once, as the brain of a small animal goes about its business.  These experiments make old theoretical questions much more urgent:  can we understand what these experiments are showing us?\n\nIn this project, we have pushed the physics-based ideas about emergence of activity patterns in the brain to a new level.  Bringing theory and experiment together, we show that these ideas generate detailed predictions for the behavior of nerve cells in the hippocampus, where we find the famous \"place cells\" which provide a mouse with its sense of location in physical space.  At the same time, we are seeing the similar tools can decsribe the patterns of activity in the very different brain of a small worm as it crawls around.  Finally, we are seeing hints of why such simple ideas can succeed in describing such obviously complex systems.\n\nIn the spirit of the EAGER program, we believe that this work will shape the agenda for much deeper understanding of the brain.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Bialek"
