 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract: \r\n\r\nHighly useful and sometimes exotic functional materials often emerge from solids where electrons interact strongly with each other. The properties of these so-called \"strongly correlated materials\" cannot be directly inferred from the detailed knowledge of individual electrons, and therefore often give us pleasant surprises: high temperature superconductors for MRI diagnosis, giant magneto-resistance materials inside iPods, just to name a few. This project aims at exploring and understanding novel quantum states in the surface of a class of correlated materials called \"Kondo insulators\". One such material SmB6 has already been found, in part by our research team, to host an exotic metallic surface that surrounds the truly insulating bulk and is protected by time-reversal symmetry. This CAREER grant allows crystal growth, measurements and device fabrications on several Kondo insulators in order to unveil the nature of the surface state. By extension their unusual electronic and thermal properties can be exploited for technological applications such as fault-tolerant quantum computing, bio-inspired information processing and quantum metrology. Several educational components are integrated into this project, consisting of course developments, middle school outreach and scientific trainings for students. In particular, the scientific involvements by high school volunteers from disadvantaged regions in Santa Ana, as well as undergraduate researcher from UC Irvine's California Alliance for Minority Participation program are expected to generate interest and prepare them for careers in science and technology.  \r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: \r\n\r\nThis CAREER grant funds the fabrication and experimental investigation of surface states in strongly correlated Kondo insulators. A current focus of condensed matter physics is to understand what electron correlation will bring to topologically ordered materials. Kondo insulators, in particular SmB6 are prototypical strongly correlated materials featuring f-electron physics and some quite unusual electronic properties. Recently the theory of topological Kondo insulator has predicted in some of these materials the existence of a topological nontrivial surface state. Subsequent experiments including our own have demonstrated in SmB6 the metallic surface state and its consistency with the topological picture. Questions remain about the exact nature of the surface state, and its unusual properties due to interactions within the surface state and between the surface and bulk. This project aims at answering some of these questions as well as using Kondo insulators as a platform for exploring unusual quantum phases with electron correlation, heavy Fermion physics and topological order. A systematic approach incorporating crystal growth, transport, optical, thermal and force measurements is used to unveil the kinetics and energetics of surface electrons, to understand the thermal properties of the surface, and to investigate the possible quantum phase transitions by chemical doping, magnetic field, strain and pressure. Integrated into this project are several important educational components. The grant allows the development of a graduate physics course, in-lab middle school outreach activities, and the training of students at various stages of their career. The crystal growth can be learnt and performed in part by high school volunteers from disadvantaged regions in Santa Ana even without advanced knowledge of physics. Some of the device fabrication is performed by undergraduate researches from California Alliance for Minority Participation program at UC Irvine, after receiving nano-fabrication trainings in our Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility. Through this project, a gradate student receives broad but integrated trainings on low temperature physics, crystal growth and high precision optical instrumentation, which will prepare him/her for sophisticated academic or industry jobs in the future.",

An intriguing surface state in Kondo insulator SmB6 has been reported previously, in part by our group. In this project, we have explored further the unique science as a strongly correlated topological material and the intriguing physics of mixed valence. First, we measured metallic surface conduction down to mK temperatures and observed the expected weak-antilocalization effect at small perpendicular magnetic fields due to surface Kondo scattering, as well as an unusual linear magnetoresistance similar to those found in Bi-based topological insulators at larger fields (Fig1, Phys. Rev. B 94, 205114 (2016)). By applying a tensile strain, which is equivalent to negative pressure, we found surface-dominated conduction at up to a temperature of 240 K, which can be explained in the framework of strain-tuned temporal and spatial fluctuations of mixed-valence electron configurations (Fig2, Nature Materials, 16, 708-711 (2017)). This increase in operating temperature is essential for potential device applications. To fully establish the working principle of a radio frequency oscillator device developed by us utilizing the SmB6 surface, we have performed high-speed surface thermal measurements to prove the existence of a surface temperature oscillation under a constant bias current (Phys. Rev. B 97, 035121 (2018)). The results match perfectly with a theoretical model describing the thermal and electronic dynamics of coupled surface and bulk states and pave the way for further increase the operating frequency of this oscillator device.</p>\n<p>Beyond the 2D surface state of SmB6, the realization of long-range magnetic order in 2D van der Waals crystals is another thrust of this project. Since the publication of the Mermin Wagner paper, however, it has been realized that long-range magnetic order in a 2D is strongly hampered by thermal fluctuations of the spin. In this project, we have successfully overcome this challenge with magnetic anisotropy. We have made the first experimental discovery of intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine 2D material (Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers) using our special scanning magneto-optic Sagnac Kerr microscope (Fig3, Nature, 546, 265-269 (2017)), which was developed in a prior NSF project. In such a 2D vdW soft ferromagnet, we have demonstrated an unprecedented control of transition temperature with tiny magnetic fields, which was confirmed by the renormalized spin-wave theory. Our discovery has motivated research on magnetic vdW layers in many groups that would open up new possibilities for new physics and novel applications.</p>\n<p>The third thrust of this project is on the unconventional chiral superconductivity in the 2D interface. Such a 2D chiral superconductivity that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) could potentially be used towards protected quantum bits. And we found evidence for this in the epitaxial bilayer films of bismuth and nickel, as indicated from the onset of the polar Kerr effect at the superconducting transition in the absence of an external magnetic field, detected by our Sagnac microscope (Fig4, Science Advances, 3, 3, e1602579 (2017)). Because of strong spin-orbit interaction and lack of inversion symmetry in a Bi/Ni bilayer, superconducting pairing cannot be classified as singlet or triplet. We propose a theoretical model where magnetic fluctuations in Ni induce the superconducting pairing between the electrons in Bi. In this model, the order parameter spontaneously breaks the TRS and has a nonzero phase winding number around the Fermi surface, thus making it a rare example of a 2D topological superconductor.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/14/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jing&nbsp;Xia</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350122/1350122_10312495_1620968706630_Fig2SmB6strain--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350122/1350122_10312495_1620968706630_Fig2SmB6strain--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig2 SmB6 under strain\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350122/1350122_10312495_1620968706630_Fig2SmB6strain--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig2 SmB6 under strain\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The extracted bandgap in SmB6 under strain increases with tensile strain and decreases with compressive strain.
