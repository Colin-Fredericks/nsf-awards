 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project targets a practical dynamic spectrum management (DSM) architecture and a corresponding suite of innovative multi-layer algorithms, development of a DSM enabled multi-radio router  and pilot trials for public safety communications.  Dynamic spectrum management and access are two important areas of interest to wireless communications researchers, spectrum regulators, and international standardization bodies. DSM plays several important roles, including: (a) improving spectrum efficiency to alleviate the wireless spectrum crunch; (b) providing prioritized, inter-operable communications for first responders during emergencies; and (c) reducing cost for wireless access, and (d) improving the reliability and security of wireless communications. In this project, statistical estimation and decision algorithms are proposed for measurement driven real-time spectrum management at the physical/medium access control (PHY/MAC), network and application layers. Using agile software stack implementation and hardware integration a completely working DSM system will be demonstrated based on these ideas. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a better understanding of DSM related applications, regulatory policies and technical challenges in real-life mobile wireless networks. Impact on state-of-the-art technologies for resilient and interoperable public safety communications, especially during emergencies, is also expected. Findings from the pilot trials will contribute to the body of knowledge in interference mitigation, spectrum sharing, mobile data offloading and supporting reliable mobile multimedia applications. Taken together, these markets constitute a multi-billion dollar opportunity for DSM technologies.",
