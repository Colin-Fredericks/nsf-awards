 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large data sets arise in a wide range of settings across scientific and engineering disciplines. Organizing such large data sets into forms where they can be effectively searched or understood can be very difficult. A common method is based upon the \"divide and conquer\" approach, in which successive division of large data sets leads, after some steps, to the amount of data in each piece being much more tractable. For example, after successively halving a data set with a trillion entries 20 times, there would be about a thousand entries in each remaining piece. Such successive division processes can be represented naturally by a branching structure known as a binary tree. It is important for efficiency that each step divides the pieces roughly in half; otherwise not all of the pieces will shrink to more manageable sizes. Trees also are a fundamental structure showing hierarchical relationships in a broad range of settings, from the data storage and searching technique just described to modeling evolutionary processes in biology. Tree distances measure how different two trees are and are important in assessing the degree to which two possible trees agree or disagree. There a number of different tree distances, which vary in what aspects of tree commonality they measure, their importance in different applications, and in their difficulty of calculation. This project seeks to better understand the distribution of multiple measures of distance on trees.\r\n\r\nThis project studies both ordered trees, used in computational settings such as data and disk storage techniques, and unordered trees, arising in biological and other scientific studies. The statistical properties of the distribution, including averages, variance and asymptotic properties, present difficult challenges and will be approached both experimentally and via exact and asymptotic combinatorial methods. The project also works on new approaches to compute tree distances that are both important for phylogenetic applications and computationally feasible. Greater understanding of rotation operations used in tree balancing may lead to improved algorithms for trees used in broad classes of computation, underlying the efficiency of many large database structures. The project develops understanding of how to scale tree distances by understanding the distribution of distances, giving scientists studying biological questions better understanding for interpreting results of tree reconstruction efforts. The project involves undergraduate researchers in cutting-edge research projects, both in the development of large-scale computational experiments and in developing the theoretical foundations of the answers to these questions.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Trees are a fundamental data structure used in a wide range of settings.  These include organizing ordered data efficiently in binary search trees\n and showing evolutionary relationships between species.\n \n Despite the fact that binary search trees are ubiquitous in efficient organization of data on computer systems, there are a number of\n fundamental properties of the underlying trees which are not understood.  Measuring how far apart two trees are by counting the number\n of steps needed to transform one to the other is not computationally tractable at this time, so there are a number of ways to approximate\n this and this project has developed tools and understanding for not only these distances, but also given some insight into how these\n distances are distributed.  That is, there is now better understanding of how far apart do we expect two trees to be, on average.\n \n Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships between extant species.  It is generally computationally difficult to\n reconstruct phylogenetic trees, so often there are a number of partially successful efforts to find candiate trees to\n show relationships.  Unlike points on a map of a city or physical measurements, it can be difficult to estimate how far\n apart two trees are, or how spread out a collection of trees are, as trees naturally lie in very high-dimensional non-Euclidean spaces.\n \n This project has developed tools and better understanding of measurements of agreement and separation between trees.  There is\n a natural tension between some measures, which are conceptually straightforward but difficult to compute, and other measures which\n may be computationally feasible but not as readily understood.  This project found relationships between different notions of distances,\n improved understanding of typical behavior of these distances, and discovered new behavior and algorithms for these distances.\n \n The project supported a range of research students at the City College of New York, part of the City University of New York system.\n These students were essential to the success of the project, being trained on cutting-edge software for computational experiments,\n developing code, and learning the underlying mathematical theory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean Cleary"
