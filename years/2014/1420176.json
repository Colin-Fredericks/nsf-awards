 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Title:  \r\nNovel Approaches for Generating and Controlling Light in the Optical No-Man's Land of the Far-IR\r\n\r\nAbstract Content:\r\nNontechnical: The Reststrahlen Band is the portion of the optical spectrum where materials have strong absorption of light resulting from collective vibrations of the crystal lattice.  Though this band varies between materials, it generally falls between the wavelengths of 20-60 microns, and has effectively precluded the development of any significant optical infrastructure in this far-IR portion of the optical spectrum.  In some sense, the Reststrahlen Band is one of the last optical frontiers.  This EAGER program's innovative approach lies not only in our efforts to build a tool-set for the development of optical and optoelectronic materials and devices in the Reststrahlen band, but also in its goal of laying the foundation for further Reststrahlen band exploration by delineating a set of potential R-Optics applications and technologies.   In doing so, our desire is to build the framework of an optical infrastructure for this unexplored wavelength range, demonstrating techniques for generating, manipulating, and controlling light at these long wavelengths, but also developing an understanding of the potential applications of such long-wavelength optical and optoelectronic devices for a variety of biological, chemical, medical and defense applications.    \r\n\r\nTechnical: The primary thrust of the EAGER will be an integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental effort to (a) demonstrate phonon-enhanced thermal emission from a range of material systems, and improve phonon-assisted light collection using self-focusing and steering surfaces, (b) expand coverage of the Reststrahlen band by i) control of free-carriers to tailor the permittivity of phononic materials and ii) isotope engineering in GaN, and (c) generate and detect optical emission from non-equilibrium phonon populations in semiconductor quantum-cascade-like devices, for the potential development of electrically-pumped Reststrahlen band sources.  We will develop spatially and spectrally selective thermal sources in the Reststrahlen band, as well as mechanisms for controlling materials' Reststrahlen band optical properties.  At the same time, we will look to demonstrate sources based on quasiparticle generation using quantum cascade-like devices.  We will also investigate a range of material systems in order to build a library of materials (and material properties) for the development of composite optical materials for Reststrahlen band applications.  Many, though not all, of our devices and materials will be grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy, and all materials and composites will be characterized by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as a function of temperature, material composition and/or geometry, and electrical (or optical) pumping power.  The end result of the 18-month EAGER is ambitious: the development of an optical and optoelectronic foundation and framework for a heretofore underserved and mostly avoided wavelength range.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTechnologies that generate, detect, and control light have enabled countless advances across diverse fields such as medicine, communications, basic research, and homeland security.  Recently, emphasis on filling spectral gaps&mdash;developing sources, detectors, and materials for portions of the spectrum devoid of optical devices&mdash;has been a focus of research, and significant progress has been realized in the so-called terahertz gap.  The far-infrared, a spectral neighbor to the terahertz, has remained mostly undeveloped and is arguably the final optical frontier.  Developing this portion of the spectrum is challenging because semiconductor technologies that have enabled the rapid development of all other portions of the optical spectrum strongly absorb far-infrared light, severely limiting optical devices and materials and mandating a new paradigm for device development.  This research has developed the beginnings of a toolkit for working in the far-infrared, the so-called Reststrahlen region, that uses crystal vibrations to control light.  Additionally, the program has established a basis for developing fundamentally new optical sources that create and use these crystal vibrations to generate far-infrared photons.  The work in this program could one day lead to a new generation of optical sources, detectors, and materials that operate in a portion of the spectrum with applications in biology, astrochemistry, and petrochemistry that is mostly inaccessible today.  Importantly, developing technologies for this portion of the spectrum will enable applications that have not even been conceived yet.\n\nThis collaborative research also trained three graduate and two undergraduate students in multidisciplinary research.  The students were engaged in research across the fields of materials growth, optics, and nanofabrication, and developed skills in numerical modeling and experimental measurement and analysis.  The project resulted in 6 journal publications and 6 conference presentations.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Hoffman"
