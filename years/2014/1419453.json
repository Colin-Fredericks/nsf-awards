 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both nationally and internationally, women are greatly underrepresented in physics and related fields such as engineering. These fields have to be able to draw upon the full spectrum of the world's talent in order to meet the demands in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in addressing global needs. To this end, this award to the American Association of Physics Teachers supports the United States delegation to the Fifth International Conference of Women in Physics in Waterloo, Canada. The overarching goals of the conference are to provide an international opportunity for analysis of the current status of and progress in promoting women in physics internationally; to provide an arena for international women in physics to share their scientific accomplishments and nucleate international research collaborations; and to build capacity in each participating country to design and implement changes that improve the numbers of and the advancement of women in physics. The International Science and Engineering Section at the National Science Foundation co-funded this activity because of the international activities and their expected broader impacts for women in physics.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. delegation will broaden participation through its diversity with regard to gender, race/ethnicity, disability status, research specialty, career phase and path, employment sector and institution type, and geographic location. The strategies and insights gained through this activity are expected to be useful in other fields where women are severely underrepresented. Outreach and dissemination will maximize the benefit of the conference in the U.S. The project will be informed by an evaluation conducted by the Statistical Research Center of the American Institute of Physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA diverse 11-member delegation attended the 5thInternational Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) International Conference on Women in Physics (ICWIP) in Waterloo, Canada, in July 2017.  This NSF funded project provided support for (i) travel for participants from the United States and a plenary speaker from the U.S.; (ii) support for the conference proceedings; (iii) recording interviews of participants in a 14 minute video \"HERStories\" and creation of four lesson plans both of which can be used to encourage girls and young women to consider careers in physics and physics related fields; (iv) dissemination and follow up in the U.S.; (v) creation of the website \"Gender Bias in Physics Forum\" for women and people who are sexual minorities can share experiences of gender and sexual bias in physics; and (vi) assessment of the impact of the conference on U.S. participants and the U.S. physics enterprise.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit. The series of international conferences on women in physics is proving to be an effective mechanism for sharing best practices internationally, empowering action in numerous countries and regions including the U.S., nucleating networking in research, and increasing the numbers and advancement of women in the field.  At the 5thIUPAP ICWIP, the U.S. Delegation was able to learn about and take advantage of successful initiatives piloted in ~70 other countries.  The body of knowledge shared during the conference was published in proceedings which is freely available online at https://aip.scitation.org/toc/apc/1697/1?expanded=1697.  In addition, the \"Gender Bias in Physics Forum\" (https://genderbias.compadre.org) was created prior to the 6thIUPAP ICWIP by the U.S. Delegation.  This website is a space where women and people who are gender and sexual minorities can share experiences of gender and sexuality bias in physics, find resources, and report responses to bias.  Gender bias in physics has caused many talented physicists to leave the field. To maintain the integrity and strength of the physics discipline, all physicists need to feel welcome.  The Gender Bias website is one mechanism to do this.  Women and people who are gender and sexual minorities can register to join the Forum. Once the registration is approved, registrants can submit experiences to the database, engage in conversations, and explore resources to reduce bias.  Resources on reducing gender bias are publicly accessible.  Finally, the 14-minute \"HERStories\" video and four related lesson plans (http://aapt.org/resources/Herstories.cfm) provide resources for K-12 teachers and faculty in higher education to promote careers in physics to female students. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts. The U.S. delegation was able to broaden participation in the 5thIUPAP ICWUIP through its diversity: in gender, race/ethnicity, research specialty (in physics and beyond), career phase and path, employment sector and institution type, and geographic location.  The strategies and insights obtained at the conference can be used in other fields where women are severely under-represented.  The benefit of the 5thICWIP for U.S. scientists has been maximized through aggressive dissemination, through the proceedings, follow-up sessions at numerous U.S. conferences, and via papers, talks, and networking by the delegates, and through the production of \"HERstories\" which provides examples of women physicists to students and early career professionals.  Members of the U.S. Delegation have noted that the conference provided a sense of personal empowerment.  Participants were able to discuss gender inequality in a space dominated by women, a very rare experience in physics.  Face-to-face interactions with physicists across the globe helped to foster a broad, international community that US delegates can access as needed.  Deepened connection with US delegates proved to be one of the most beneficial outcomes. The conference allowed space for networking within the US delegation, leading to continued shared resources, informal mentoring, and new projects.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Beth Cunningham"
