This is a topic relevant for the prediction of rainfall and of hazards such as tornados and flash flooding. Warm cumulus clouds exert significant influence on the climate system of the earth by processing atmospheric aerosols, interacting with electromagnetic radiation from the sun and earth, and redistributing earth's water and energy through the hydrologic cycle. This study addresses two central outstanding questions in the current understanding of warm rain production, namely, the mechanisms leading to the formation of fast-growing 'statistically fortunate' drops, and the growth of the cloud droplets, both of which hasten the 'colloidal instability' of the cloud, resulting in precipitation. To understand the effects of turbulence, it is essential to gain insights into the interactions between large-scale processes such as turbulent entrainment, mixing and intermittency, and microscale processes such as particle clustering, droplet relative velocities and collision efficiency. In terms of outreach and education, it is proposed to involve graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at the confluence of turbulence, cloud and particle physics. The PIs plan to reach out to students at Alabama A&M University and Huntsville High School to encourage the students to pursue undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in STEM-related fields.\r\n\r\nThe collaborating PIs will conduct a multiscale investigation, in which a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) will be used to model the whole cloud and to feed energy to a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) model, in order to explain how very small droplets appear and grow in size within a cloud. The hypothesis is that intermittency in turbulent shear and flow acceleration are driving the formation and the coalescence of the droplets. The proposed work is for high Reynolds number cloud turbulence at practical scales. Using the proposed energy transfer method, inertial-range LES turbulence intermittency information will be included in the DNS. The theoretical research will focus on developing stochastic models for both microscale and macroscale cloud physics including: 1) Detailed microscale models for the local flow field in the vicinity of bidisperse interacting drops with statistical properties characteristic of cloud Reynolds numbers; 2) Effects of particle inertia and differential sedimentation on the stochastic flow field ?seen? by the drops; 3) Effects of non-continuum, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between drops on their collision efficiency; and 4) Macroscale model that accounts for the effects of turbulence intermittency and eddy mixing on the stochastic kinetics of droplet growth. The proposed research is expected to shed light on aerosol-cloud interactions that are important in generating precipitation and in affecting climate patterns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n An important source of uncertainty in projections of how rapidly the Earth will warm due to greenhouse gas emissions is the mitigating effects of increasing cloud cover.  The degree to which a warming Earth will be a cloudier Earth depends on the rate at which water droplets grow in clouds leading to precipitation.  This project provides cloud modelers with three important results indicating the way in which cloud turbulence and microscale fluid dynamic interactions between colliding drops contribute to the rate of droplet growth.\n\n Cloud drops grow by two mechanisms: the condensation of water vapor onto drop surfaces and the collision and coalescence of pairs of drops to form larger drops.  Most models of cloud droplet growth have considered coalescence driven solely by differences in the gravitational settling velocity of two drops.  However, the turbulent air flow in a cloud also contributes to drop collisions.  This project provides the first predictions of the rate of coalescence of drops due to the coupled effects of settling and turbulent flow.  Before drops can coalesce, the forces driving their collision (gravity and turbulence) must overcome the viscous resistance of the air between the colliding drops.  For colloidal particles or emulsion drops in a liquid, the mechanism that allows the particle or liquid surfaces to merge is a molecular attraction called the van der Waals force.  It was shown in the project, however, that the non-continuum nature of the gas when drop separations are approximately 100 nanometers is the factor that limits the resistance of the gas and allows drop coalescence in air.  Based upon this insight, the collision rates of drops due to turbulence and gravity in a non-continuum gas was computed for drop radii ranging from 2 to 100 microns with a range of turbulence intensities and drop size ratios. \n\n One of the most striking aspects of turbulent two-phase flow is the tendency of inertial particles to preferentially concentrate in low vorticity parts of a flow, leading to clustering of particles.  A widely cited motivation for the study of this phenomenon has been the possibility that turbulent clustering might enhance the rate of cloud droplet growth and reduce the time to form precipitation.  By developing a comprehensive model for clustering of drops of different size in the presence of gravitational settling and incorporating this model into a calculation of drop growth by coalescence in a cloud parcel, this project provides the first realistic assessment of the possible role of turbulent clustering on cloud droplet growth.  Clustering is found to increase the rate of coalescence to a significant degree, but the enhancement is much less than one would predict by considering (as is often done) drops of uniform size.\n\n  The environment in a turbulent cloud is far from uniform.  Turbulent flows are intermittent, meaning there are events in which the intensity of the turbulence driving drop coalescence is much higher than the average.  The resulting drop sizes and water vapor concentration within the cloud is also intermittent.  A model consisting of a set of interacting cloud parcels rising, cooling, condensing and growing drops was developed to assess the role of intermittency as well as the effect of drop clustering and coalescence rate on the growth of drops in a cloud.  A na&iuml;ve estimate based on typical conditions would lead one to believe that drops grow primarily by condensation and settling driven coalescence.  However, this view misses events where intense turbulence rapidly drives growth of large drops in one region of the cloud that can then sweep up other drops when they mix with other cloud parcels.  In addition, condensation and sedimentation coalescence in isolation lead to a drop growth bottleneck.  The growth by condensation is fastest for small drops sizes while sedimentation is important for large drop sizes.  Thus, drops at an intermediate size range of 10-20 microns grow slowly.  Condensation tends to lead to uniform drop sizes, while coalescence by differential sedimentation requires differences in drop size.  For these reasons intermittency and turbulent driven collisions play an essential role in overcoming the drop coalescence bottleneck and facilitating the formation of drops large enough to precipitate.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald L Koch"
