 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whether walking down a busy sidewalk or a crowded mall, we effortlessly coordinate our movements with other pedestrians.  Sometimes we weave through the crowd, dodging our neighbors; at other times we merge into a coherent \"swarm,\" much like a flock of birds or a school of fish, and may spontaneously form lanes in opposite directions, similar to columns of ants.  Where do these basic traffic patterns come from?  It is generally believed that collective behavior in humans and animals emerges from local interactions between neighbors, rather than from a central plan or leader, but the actual mechanisms are unclear.  By studying the perceptual-motor \"rules\" that govern interactions between neighbors, the investigator aims to determine whether crowd behavior can be explained by local interactions.  The resulting model will enable realistic simulation of pedestrian traffic flow. Its potential broader impacts are  to architectural design, evacuation planning, computer animation, and the development of assistive technology for blind and low-vision users. \r\n\r\nThere are many models of collective swarm behavior in fields ranging from physics and computer science to animal behavior and urban planning, yet they are based on little experimental data.  The key weakness of existing theories is a dearth of knowledge about the visual coupling between neighbors -- the perceptual-motor rules, forces, or control laws that govern pedestrian interactions. The goal of this project is to develop a cognitively grounded pedestrian model and test the hypothesis that global crowd behavior emerges from these local interactions.  An innovative research program combines (a) a local-to-global approach, in which the visual coupling is mapped out in experiments with virtual crowds, and used to predict crowd behavior in multi-agent simulations, and (b) a global-to-local approach, in which experiments on real crowds are analyzed and used to test the model. The aim is to account for pedestrian and crowd dynamics and elucidate the relation between \"micro\" and \"macro\" levels of collective behavior.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nIt is often said that the collective behavior of human crowds emerges from local interactions between pedestrians, but the nature of these interactions has been unknown. This project developed the first models of collective crowd motion based on human experiments, which account for both individual trajectories and crowd dynamics.\n\nWe began by building a ?behavioral model? that predicts the walking direction and speed of a pedestrian based on the movement of surrounding neighbors.  Using Virtual Reality (VR) experiments in which a real human participant walked in crowd of virtual avatars, we identified two rules of interaction:  a pedestrian tends to match the direction and speed of their neighbors.  We then mapped the zone over which these rules operate, the neighborhood of interaction, and discovered that a pedestrian is influenced by:\n\nNeighbors within a 180&#730; field of view\nAll neighbors within a fixed distance (a ?metric? neighborhood), not by a fixed number of neighbors (a ?topological? neighborhood)\nBut this influence decreases with neighbor distance\nWith a gradual decay to the nearest neighbor in the crowd, and a faster decay within the crowd (a ?donut? neighborhood)\n\n\nBased on these findings, we modeled the neighborhood using a weighted average of neighbors, where the weight decays exponentially with distance.  The model successfully simulated data from our VR experiments, and predicted individual trajectories in data on real crowds.  Importantly, the model implies a mechanism of self-organization: a pedestrian more strongly aligns with neighbors who are more closely aligned with each other, providing a positive feedback that generates collective motion.  Simulations of the model generate coherent motion over a wide range of conditions.\n\nAnd yet pedestrians interact by means of vision, so a better model would be based on the visual information available to a pedestrian embedded in a crowd.  Further VR experiments identified the optical variables used by a pedestrian to control their walking speed and direction:\n\nThe visual expansion/contraction of each neighbor in the field of view \nThe angular velocity of each neighbor in the field of view\nThe influence of each variable on walking speed and walking direction trades off, depending on the neighbor?s position in the field of view (eccentricity)\n\n\nBased on these results, we created a ?visual model? that simply averages these variables for all neighbors, as a function of neighbor eccentricity.  The visual model not only fits the human data as well or better than the behavioral model, it also explains the decrease of neighbor influence with distance (the ?donut?) for free:\n\nThe gradual decay to the nearest neighbor is a consequence of the law of perspective\nThe faster decay within a crowd is due to an added effect of visual occlusion of far neighbors by near neighbors\n\n\nOur experiment-driven approach thus generated the first realistic behavioral model of self-organized collective motion, and the first visual model of crowd motion grounded in human perceptual-motor control. \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nA better understanding of crowd behavior has many practical benefits to society.  A particularly important area of impact is emergency evacuations.  To study evacuation behavior experimentally, we developed a VR paradigm that puts the participant in a virtual emergency without compromising their safety.  This research yielded the first experimental tests of anecdotal observations about social and familiarity effects:\n\nIn a fire evacuation, people tend to follow their neighbors to an exit ? more strongly as the number of neighbors increases (social influence)\nPeople tend to egress through the door by which they entered (familiarity)\nThese two tendencies are additive, suggesting that exit jams could be reduced by making use of multiple entrances\nWhen two exits are visible, people tend to follow the majority of the crowd to one exit, unless 100% of the crowd forms a visible jam at that exit\nPeople prefer to egress to green exit signs, compared to other colors ? even though they believe exit signs should be red and signs in their state are red\n\n\nA realistic model of crowd behavior would significantly improve evacuation planning by simulating pedestrian traffic flow in potential emergency situations.  Such a model could also be used in architecture and urban planning to test alternative designs by simulating pedestrian traffic in buildings and public spaces.  We presented our model at the NSF Workshop on Human-Building Interaction (USC, June 2019), where computer scientists and architects discussed the use of pedestrian models in architecture and planning.\n\nAnother area of impact is the design of new assistive technology.  People who are blind or have low vision report mobility as one of the most difficult challenges of daily life, particularly walking in crowds and using public transportation.  We recently received funding from the National Eye Institute to develop a navigation system that would apply our pedestrian model to guide the user through complex environments and crowds by means of a vibrotactile belt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William H Warren"
