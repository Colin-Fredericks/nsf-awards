This forum will be a platform that brings together students, academic researchers and industry professionals to discuss research and innovative industry practices aimed at increasing product, process and system innovation for sustainable manufacturing as well as a forum to discuss and examine challenges in these areas. Through the incorporation of a round table discussion in this year's Forum, attendees will have the opportunity to directly interact with some of the leaders in the ever broadening field of sustainable manufacturing. The Forum will provide a unique opportunity to foster close interactions and communication between students, academic researchers and industry professionals involved in sustainable manufacturing. It will contribute to scholarship in sustainable products, processes, manufacturing systems and supply chains through identification of the challenges to promoting economic, environmental and societal sustainability in these domains across different industry sectors. The intellectual exchange posited through this forum will inspire innovation in research to develop viable and reliable solutions to sustainable manufacturing issues. This forum will feature six invited speakers, eight technical talks and a panel discussion. In addition, a poster session will be held to highlight research achievements in sustainable manufacturing by students and young faculty.",
