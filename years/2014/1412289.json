 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David V. Dearden of Brigham Young University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering Program to develop a technique to detect and characterize the shape of large molecules, commonly found in living systems and molecular-size devices.  Such information is currently only available using highly specialized and expensive instruments. The new approach will require only minimal, inexpensive modifications of commercially-available instruments, thus making such measurements accessible to a wide array of scientists.  The availability of this technique on affordable mass spectrometers is allowing the characterization of supramolecular assemblies and the study of peptide folding and protein conformational changes in fields such as supramolecular chemistry and biomolecular science. The results are expected to facilitate biomedical research and the design and manufacture of molecular-size devices, such as molecular switches and memory storage architectures.\r\n\r\nThe method Dearden is developing is known by the acronym CRAFTI, cross sectional areas by Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance.  It is used to characterize the shapes of supramolecular systems and large biomolecules through measurement of their collision cross sections in the gas phase. These measurements are accomplished by monitoring the signal due to the collisions of the ions with the molecules of a neutral background gas in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR/MS). User-friendly software for CRAFTI data analysis is also being developed as part of this project, facilitating the transfer of the CRAFTI technology to the broader user community of FTICR and, potentially, to Orbitrap mass spectrometers. \r\n\r\nIn the course of this research, graduate students are being trained in state-of-the-art mass spectrometric and analytical techniques. Dearden is recruiting talented undergraduate students and involving them in the research in preparation for future graduate studies. Results from this work are included in annual presentations to the general public as part of National Chemistry Week.",

These measurements are important because chemical reactivity and selectivity is often critically dependent on the way molecules are folded, which can be deduced from their measured sizes. Misfolded proteins, for example, can lead to disease or be very early signs that something is wrong. Pharmaceuticals must have the proper shape to function safely and effectively. Twenty-first century efforts to build tiny &ldquo;nanomachines&rdquo; out of the smallest possible parts rely on being able to tell whether the parts have been assembled correctly. The accompanying figure shows two possible structures for a simple machine we are trying to distinguish: one is a &ldquo;wheel-and-axle&rdquo; structure, while the other has the &ldquo;axle&rdquo; outside the &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; and would not function correctly. While some very good techniques for measuring molecular size and shape are already available, they generally require specialized, dedicated instrumentation. Our work has shown that the same kind of measurements can be made for small molecules simply by taking advantage of information already available in an existing type of instrument, a Fourier transform mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules with very high accuracy and precision. Until this project, the molecular size information that is also available from this instrument was not amenable to analysis. We have determined what factors are important to the measurement, and have discovered some of the limitations of the technique. The molecular size measurements depend critically on the pressure inside the instrument, which is difficult to measure accurately, but in cases where the sizes are known by other methods, we have found that the method can be used to accurately measure pressure. So as a side benefit, we have invented a new way to determine this important property.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.&nbsp;</strong>While this project developed a new technique we hope will become broadly useful for a wide range of applications ranging from disease diagnosis to quality control for molecular machines, it also focused on student involvement and training; all of the work was ultimately carried out by people being trained in STEM disciplines.

Eleven undergraduate students worked on this project, and five of them have already moved into U.S. doctoral programs in chemistry or biochemistry. Six Ph.D. students worked on the project.
