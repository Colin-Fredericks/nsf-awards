 "awd_abstract_narration": "Financial products and the markets in which they are traded have long been among the most highly innovative of all economic interactions. However, the worldwide financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing new laws regulating financial markets, including in particular the 2010 Dodd Frank Act, have quite justifiably stimulated immense attention among economists, both to identify the causes of fragility in financial institutions, and to better articulate ways to alter the architecture of financial markets so as to improve stability without unduly limiting the benefits of the products and services offered in these markets or restricting innovation.  An inherent problem associated with designing new regulations is an absence of evidence regarding the effectiveness of policies that have never been observed. In exactly these circumstances laboratory methods can be extremely useful. This project consists of a series of three experiments with applications to emerging issues in financial market regulation. Each experiment represents a way to gain some insight into potential consequences of alternative policies. Experimental results will usefully allow some insight into potential consequences of alternative policy options. \r\n\r\nThe first experiment evaluates triggering mechanisms for converting contingent capital bonds into equity. Contingent capital bonds (\"CoCo's\") have been identified as an important new instrument for promoting the stability of systemically important banks. Critical to the successful implementation of CoCo's is an efficient conversion triggering mechanism.  Our experiment focuses on the relative performance of the two leading candidate mechanisms, a fixed price trigger in which conversion occurs automatically after crossing a preannounced price threshold and a discretionary regulator, who also sees price information, but who makes decisions in light of imprecise non-price signals, and also face biased incentives to intervene or not.  The second experiment pertains to bank runs.  In many instances liquidity suspension rather than deposit insurance is the best (or only) policy tool available for discouraging runs on distressed banks.  In such instances, bank regulators are rarely able to simply suspend payments until asset maturation, as would be ideal. Rather, they temporarily suspend liquidity, and then re-set contract terms for remaining depositors.   In re-setting contract terms, a banking authority must choose whether to skew the terms of payment toward the interests of ?patient? depositors who maintain their deposits in the bank, or toward ?impatient? depositors with unanticipated liquidity needs.  Intimately related to re-contracting conditions are the (de)stabilizing effects of publicizing information about depositor withdrawal behavior.  Our experiment interacts re-contracting conditions and information regimes to identify the sort of ex post re-contracting and information scheme most likely to promote stability. The third experiment evaluates a simple model of the interbank loan market. In the 2008 financial crisis interbank markets ?locked up,? despite active central bank intervention, raising questions as to why the market failed and what a central bank can do to improve the functioning of this market in times of stress.  We propose a simple experimental implementation of a model by Allen, Carletti and Gale (2009) to both better understand the coordination problem faced by banks in this market and to gain some insight as to when and how persistent central bank intervention may be desirable. This experiment will also serve as a baseline environment for evaluating alternative motivations for liquidity hoarding proposed in recent, more complex models.",

We summarize results by the topic areas enumerated above.\n\n1) Triggering mechanisms for contingent capital bonds. Experimental results suggest that the desirability of using a fixed trigger rule rather than relying on a price-informed regulator who makes discretionary decisions varies importantly with the way a conversion affects the value of equity.  When the conversion increases incumbent equity value, there are fewer conversion errors under a fixed trigger rule than with a regulator. This result holds even when we alter the regulator's environment to include inaction bias, non-market information, or the opportunity to delay action.  In contrast, when conversion decreases value, the regulator usually makes fewer conversion errors than occur with a fixed trigger. \n\n2) Bank runs and financial fragility.  Here we have two results.  First, when using liquidity suspension (e.g., temporarily halting withdrawals) as a tool to promote bank stability, 'tough' re-contracting terms that favor patient over impatient depositors post-suspenson promote stability far more effectively than more lenient policies that accommodate the interests of impatient depositors.  Providing sequential information about previous withdrawal weakens the effects of tough re-contracting terms, but mitigates to some extent the cost of more lenient re-contracting policies.\n\nSecond, in examining the stabilizing effects of liquidity requirements like those recently imposed on banks under BASEL IIII, we find that high liquidity requirements substantially improve bank stability despite reducing the profitability to depositors of maintaining deposits in the bank to maturity. Further, although a history of stability does reduce the propensity of depositors to withdraw in the case of financial stress, the incidence of bank runs still falls significantly with higher required reserve levels.\n\n3) Interbank market experiments. Here we have two results. First, from an initial experiment conducted in a baseline environment we find that interbank markets are frequently characterized by considerable price variability and a stochastic distribution of investment outcomes, consistent with the predictions of Allen and Gale (2004).  These results are observed despite the marked increase in  investment activity that interbank exchange promotes relative to an autarkic 'narrow banking' outcome.\n\nSecond, by enrichening the baseline interbank market environment to allow examination of the effects of liquidity requirements on interbank marketstability, we find that in a simple regime where banks are subject only to an idiosyncratic shock (e.g., one that affects individual banks, but not the banking system), liquidity requirements reduce the incidence of bankruptcies, but a large cost in terms of investment efficiency.  However, in a more complex 'compound shock' regime where banks are subject to a stochastically occurring shock in addition to an idiosyncratic shock, liquidity requirements not only starkly reduce investment efficiency, but also fail to mitigate the incidence of bankruptcies. \n\n4) Finite horizon monetary models. Finally, from our investigation of finite horizon monetary models, we find that neither of the finite horizon models we considered induced participants to converge on an efficient monetary equilibrium.  In fact, we find that the presence of a fiat currency did no more to promote efficiency in either of these games than was the case in the finitely repeated overlapping generations game where the adoption of a fiat currency was not an equilibrium.   Thus, results indicate that players tend to adopt a fiat money, even when it is not an equilibrium strategy, suggesting that features of the game other than the existence of an equilibrium drive the use of a fiat money in these laboratory games.\n\nBroader Impacts: The bulk of the research funded by this grant was conducted with the intention of informing policies regarding banking and bank regulation. In each case our experiments are constructed and evaluated in terms of underlying theoretical models that serve as a basis for policy decisions.  By evaluating the behavioral relevance of these models, this resarch provides valuable insights into the analyses that drive policy recommendations. The use of experiments to analyze issues in banking and bank regulation is relatively new.   It is our hope that this research will stimulate further use of behavioral tools to assess the very theory-intensive models of banking and bank regulation.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas D.
