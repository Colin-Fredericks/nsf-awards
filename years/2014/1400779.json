Many of these articles have been published (or have been accepted to be published) in top mathematics journals.  Further, several of these papers solved some of the projects put forward in my project description, and the results contained therein serve to sharpen our understanding of the Langlands program and how different branches of math are interconnected.\n    \nDuring my time under the fellowship I gave numerous talks about my research, both at conferences and departmental seminars.  The support of the NSF allowed me to travel (to Europe and California, among others) to visit collaborators and colleagues and discuss mathematical projects.  As part of the number theory group at the University of Toronto, I was responsible for co-organizing the weekly seminar, which promoted interaction among mathematicians from all over the world.
