 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic and political agencies use information to manage their relationships with oversight committees, other agencies, and the general public.  Information releases are timed and crafted to manage expectations about current and future developments within the agency.  This proposal studies how information management policies can be and are used to shape incentives of counterparties to further the interests of the agency.  The key consideration is in how the timing and content of releases trades off good and bad news.  As a general theme it is in the interest of the agency to release minimally good news whenever possible and maximally bad news as infrequently as possible.  \r\n\r\nThis is modeled formally as a principal agent relationship in which a principal is continuously monitoring a stochastic process and strategically releasing information about the process to an agent who takes actions that affect the principal.  The agent knows the law of the process but relies on the principal for specific information.  Absent any information the agent will eventually evolve beliefs inducing actions against the interest of the principal.  The proposal studies how information is managed over time in order to minimize the frequency of these events and maximize the duration of cooperative behavior by the agent.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied theoretically the use of information as a dynamic incentive device.  A typical application would be how an organization should provide feedback to a junior employee who is working toward a promotion.  When the incentive effects of material incentives such as bonuses are exhausted, such performance feedback comes to the forefront as a key day-to-day motivator.  \n\nA key outcome of the project was a general set of theoretical tools for analyzing the incentive properties of dynamic feedback.  The main tradeoff is between maintaining optimisim in the payoff to continued effort versus the commitment to provide valuable information about when the goal is complete.  A central finding was that this tradeoff is optimally balanced by providing news about success with an appropriately calibrated delay. \n\nA second outcome of the project was the application of the same tools to behavioral phenomena, specifically the management of information purely as a form of entertainment.  For example, the dramatic effect of suspense can be understood as the witholding of information and the calculated release of hints about a potentially significant event that lies ahead.  Surprise on the other hand is the optimal timing of the release of information with the purpose of maximizing unexpected news.\n\nAn outcome of the project was the optimal design of information release from the point of view of entertainment value.  Suspense is optimally managed by random releases of increasingly informative disclosures that eventually reveal the truth. Surprise is optimize by more frequent disclosures that lead to rapidly fluctuating beliefs.  Interestingly, optimal surprise may not eventually reveal the truth as the witholding of information increases the surprise value of information that is actually released.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey C Ely"
