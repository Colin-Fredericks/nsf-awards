 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two pervasive aspects of the brain motivate this project: brain rhythms and feedback connectivity. Rhythms indicating partial synchronization, neurons acting in unison, are ubiquitously observed in the brain by EEG and other techniques. But their function is still not well understood; certain rhythms tend to be enhanced when an animal pays attention to specific aspects of its environment. A second characteristic aspect of brain networks is their extensive feedback connectivity, which allows the processing of information in a brain area to be modulated by the very brain area that receives that information. This project will study rhythms in neuronal networks with feedback connectivity, investigating whether such targeted feedback allows selective synchronization of specific neurons and what functionalities emerge from it. It is expected that selective synchronization contributes to solving tasks similar to the cocktail-party problem of following the voice of a specific speaker among many people talking simultaneously. The research will focus on the olfactory system. There, a corresponding challenging task is, e.g., for a dog to track the faint smell of a drug or landmine amidst many other smells. The project will inform efforts to enhance the processing of the outputs of biologically motivated, event-driven technological sensors for complex stimulus scenes. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in applied mathematics, neuroscience, and interdisciplinary communication skills is an integral part of this project. \r\n\r\nThe research will develop a combined neuronal network model for the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex. Incorporating aspects of the extensive structural plasticity of the olfactory system, the network will be adaptive, allowing the feedback connections to reflect previous experience. Biophysically detailed neuron models as well as highly simplified neuronal networks will be employed. Mathematically, the research will use and further various analytical and computational dynamical systems methods: weak coupling of mixed-mode oscillators and of delay-induced oscillators; weakly nonlinear analysis of neuronal populations interacting with multiple delays; bifurcation analysis of resonant, delay-induced Hopf bifurcations; numerical branch continuation. These approaches will be complemented by direct simulations.",

These collective oscillations indicate the coordinated, near-synchronous activity of large ensembles of neurons. Their role in neuronal information processing is the object of substantial neuroscience research. In this project we discovered and elucidated fascinating aspects of the formation of brain rhythms and of the interaction of multiple such rhythms.

Motivated by the complex oscillations observed in principal neurons of the olfactory system the first component of this project addressed the synchronization of neurons that exhibit complex, `mixed-mode' oscillations (MMOs), which consist of large-amplitude spikes separated by multiple `subthreshold' oscillations of small amplitude (STOs) (see Figure 1). Using theoretical and computational approaches we showed that the interaction between neurons exhibiting MMOs is quite complex and often does not lead to the synchronous spiking of all neurons but to the formation of multiple clusters. The neurons within each of these clusters spike in near-synchrony, but neurons in different clusters are out of sync with respect to each other (Figure 2).</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-10423\" class=\"standard\">Ever present noise counteracts the synchronization of individual neurons. In the case of MMOs we found that even quite weak noise can lead to the insertion or removal of STOs via `phase slips' (Figure 1). As a result, basic theory, which ignores such events, predicts a synchronization threshold that is by a factor of 100 too low. We showed, however, that by including the enhanced variability of spike times that results from phase slips the theory can be extended and then correctly predicts not only the onset of synchronization (Figure 3A) but also the complex dynamics that can arise from the interaction of different types of clusters.</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-10424\" class=\"standard\">While the variability in the spike times increases drastically with increasing noise strength for moderate noise strengths, it counter-intuitively saturates and <em>decreases</em> for large noise strengths (Figure 3B).

In the second component of this project we have addressed the interaction of such rhythms. Strikingly, we have found that noise and neuronal heterogeneity, which both desynchronize interacting individual oscillators, can on the contrary synchronize interacting rhythms (Figure 4). We have shown that this synchronization arises from the paradoxical response that rhythms can exhibit to external perturbations: perturbations that delay each individual neuron can nevertheless advance the overall rhythm (Figure 5). Key for the drastic difference in the response of the individual neurons and their collective rhythm is that the number of neurons that participate in the rhythm can vary from one period to the next.</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-10427\" class=\"standard\">Functionally, we have shown that the noise-induced synchronization of rhythms can improve certain types of learning in networks.</div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-10428\" class=\"standard\"><strong>Chimeras in Spatially Continuous Systems</strong></div>\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-10429\" class=\"standard\">In large networks of discrete oscillators chimera states can arise, which are characterized by a subset of oscillators being near-synchronous while the remaining oscillators evolve incoherently, although all oscillators have the same properties.
