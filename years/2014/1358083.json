 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will use a comparative macro-structural framework, a geographic mapping\r\napproach, and country level data to examine gender inequity in STEM opportunities in a global\r\ncontext. The proposal will request support for an international collaboration with Luis Berneth Pena, a Columbian geographer at the Georg Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies at Humboldt University\r\nin Berlin, Germany. The intellectual merit of the proposed research derives from an interdisciplinary, international collaboration between an American sociologist and a Columbian geographer. The collaboration\r\nwill allow the integration of a comparative macro-structural framework of gender inequity\r\nin STEM and a geographic mapping approach. The influence of geographically distributed economic\r\nand socio-political structures on STEM equity outcomes has not been carefully examined and\r\nhas the potential for revealing critical gender patterns in STEM opportunity systems. The\r\nmerit of the research is based in part on an integration of sociological and geographic perspectives\r\nin understanding gender inequity in STEM inequity that is spatially distributed and correlates\r\nwith larger macro structures.\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research is substantial given growing international focus\r\non gender inequality. As a result of this focus, organizations such as the United Nations\r\nhave promoted measurement of gender inequalities across countries. Measurement is often limited\r\nto general health, education, and labor market issues. Gender inequity in STEM is a major\r\ncomponent in creating and maintaining gender inequity worldwide. An examination of gender equity in STEM education and occupations across countries with diverse economic and socio-political characteristics will lend insights and solutions for resolving inequities in STEM.",
