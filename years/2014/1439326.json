 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to subsidize student-related expenses (e.g., travel, registration,\r\nand accommodation) incurred by US students attending the 46th annual North American Power\r\nSymposium (NAPS). NAPS 2014 will be hosted by Washington State University in Pullman, WA,\r\nfrom September 7 to September 9, 2014. NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship\r\nfrom IEEE and is aimed primarily at a student audience. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority\r\nof papers in NAPS are presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the National Science\r\nFoundation in the past, which has positively influenced student participation. Based on the\r\nattendance trend from previous years, it is anticipated that the subsidy provided through\r\nthis grant can significantly increase the number of students participating in NAPS in this\r\nyear as well. In addition to providing subsidized accommodation for students, our efforts\r\nto foster and encourage student participation include a comprehensive student program, tours\r\nof nearby attractions, and a student paper competition. Moreover, measures will be taken to\r\nencourage participation of women and underrepresented minorities in NAPS.",
