 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advancing what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that showed the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and project teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and answer questions about how people learn with technology.  An important issue in education is helping youth make sense of the scientific, technological, socio-scientific, and health data that is available. Technology exists for creating infographics to help others understand what data has to say, and this team's Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Project showed that engaging high schoolers in infographic-based data journalism has potential to pique their interest in science and data analysis and to improve their scientific and mathematical literacy. In this follow-on project, the project team, which includes experts in educational technology, mathematics education, and learning, is extending, refining, and evaluating different ways of using technologies for infographic design to foster STEM engagement and learning. The end result will be a set of social practices and technology tools to support learning through data journalism, increased understanding of how to foster STEM literacy, a set of professional development materials and infrastructure for helping teachers and after-school facilitators learn to implement data journalism, and a set of guidelines for data providers about how to make their scientific data usable by teachers and youth and how to structure it to support youth's developing data and science literacy skills. This work contributes to the emerging field of data science education -- fostering learners' ability to analyze and make sense of scientific, technological, and socio-scientific data and use it to solve problems of scientific, individual, and community importance.\r\n\r\nIn their Cyberlearning EXP project, this project team showed the viability and promise of using infographic-based data journalism as a way to support engagement of young adults (high-school students) in STEM and improve their scientific and mathematical literacy. In this follow-on project, they are refining their approach and implementing the proposed socio-technical system in a variety of different educational venues, some formal and some informal, and including, over the set of venues, learners with a wide variety of different capabilities and interests and from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures, teachers and facilitators with a wide variety of skills, allowing exploration of issues across a variety of populations. The innovation is the socio-technical system and tools for learning STEM content through infographic design. Tools and practices are being designed to provide a meaningful and supportive context in which youth can contextualize STEM in their own lives and the lives of others, navigate the deluge of scientific data that is available, and learn through authentic communication of their understandings. Research and development are highly connected, and research focuses on how to arrange social processes and tools to enable youth to move from personal interests to topics they can research and make sense of, the barriers that m ay be encountered in moving from personal interests to scientific pursuits and how to overcome those barriers, and how to support youth so that they come to recognize connections between their own lives and the world around them and the world of science. The effort also contributes to the emerging field of data science education and will extract insights about how to foster such learning, provide guidelines to data providers about how to design data portals for the public, and suggest design guidelines for data science tools.",

Unfortunately, many youth do not appreciate or deeply understand STEM as it is typically taught in school. The <em>STEM Literacy through Infographics</em> (SLI) project sought to change this. In the SLI project, high school students researched and reported on science news, collected and analyzed data on STEM-related topics &nbsp;and created infographics--visual representations telling a story--to communicate their understanding. If their work passed a rigorous review process, they were able to publish it in an online science news magazine, <em>SciJourner</em> (<a title=\"SciJourner\" href=\"http://www.scijourner.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.scijourner.org</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The SLI project engaged youth in every aspect of STEM: they explored and represented <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S</span>cientific research and concepts; using <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">T</span>echnologies for visualization and digital collaboration; within cycles of design informed by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">E</span>ngineering practices; while reasoning <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">M</span>athematically about data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The research and development goal of the SLI project was to refine, implement and assess a sociotechnical system that involved young adults in infographic-based data journalism in order to support their engagement with STEM and improve their scientific and mathematical literacy. It sought to answer the following major research questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6673fbe9-7fff-0020-b268-6afaf765f53b\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>What are the critical aspects of a sociotechnical system for engaging teens in data journalism using infographics that lead to appropriation of science and mathematical literacy? What technical capabilities must be in place, and what social structures must exist for effective use of tools to take place?</span></p>\n</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6673fbe9-7fff-0020-b268-6afaf765f53b\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>What contextual features impact the implementation of data journalism with infographics in different settings?</span></p>\n</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In addition to research results, outcomes of the project included open educational resources for teachers and students, as well as direct impacts on participating educators and high school students.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across the 2015-16 and 2016-17 school years, the SLI project involved 11 diverse school sites and 2 out-of-school programs across three states (Colorado, Massachusetts, and Missouri). Twenty-one teachers received professional development and support while implementing co-designed variations of the program in their schools. The courses in which teachers integrated SLI included a wide range of general and specialized science courses, data analysis/statistics courses, and a few social studies and literature courses. A total of 1,210 high school aged students participated in the courses that were part of the program.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Research on the project found that in spite of contemporary excitement about public access to \"open data,\" there are many barriers to youth using these datasets in a meaningful way. &nbsp;&nbsp;By participating in a community producing authentic data journalism, teachers and high school students developed greater facility at critically examining sources of data, and developed skills at processing, analyzing, and representing data for authentic communication. Structured feedback from peers, teachers, and an outside editor proved to be key to supporting learning, as did strong guidance in how to make sense of and visualize data. Resources to support these processes were developed and are available, as described below. In addition, authoring infographics in which youth connected their personal interests and concerns with scientific concerns helped drive effective learning and changes in \"STEM identities\"--after their experiences, youth tended to see STEM as more relevant to their lives. A pre- post-assessment of a subset of participating students also showed statistically significant gains on two aspects of STEM literacy: mathematical reasoning and social contextualization of STEM information.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results of this project have been disseminated through traditional academic channels, as well as made available to educators and the general public. Over the course of the project, the collaborators published a total of 18 print publications related directly to the project. A total of 19 presentations were made at refereed academic conferences. Eight short-term teacher professional development sessions were offered, introducing 170 additional teachers to the curriculum resources. The project created a video for the 2016 NSF Video Showcase, at <a href=\"https://stemforall2016.videohall.com/presentations/773\">https://stemforall2016.videohall.com/presentations/773</a>, which received facilitators' and presenters' choice recognitions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project website (<a title=\"SLI Project Website\" href=\"http://science-infographics.org/\" target=\"_blank\">science-infographics.org</a>: see attached images) was built to serve the needs of participating teachers and students. In the final year of the project, the website became a legacy open educational resource (OER) for students, teachers, and the general public. The site supports the multi-step process of creating an infographic: What to Expect, Getting Started, Data: Finding, Using and Visualizing; Images: Finding, Using, and Making; Telling a Visual Story; Revising and Critiquing. Each of these sections is a gateway to resources on that aspect of infographic creation. The website also provides professional development (PD) materials for educators who want to support their students in creating infographics. Sample lesson plans, classroom activities and rubrics are included (many of which were provided by teachers from the SLI project), as well as a self-guided 5-session PD outline that can be done by individuals or groups of teachers. As a whole, the website aims to support all learners in the process of creating good data infographics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/25/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Polman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1441561/1441561_10335673_1554118891186_SLIwebsitemainpage-landscape--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1441561/1441561_10335673_1554118891186_SLIwebsitemainpage-landscape--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLI Website Main Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1441561/1441561_10335673_1554118891186_SLIwebsitemainpage-landscape--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLI Website Main Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An image of the main (welcoming) page of the STEM Literacy through Infographics website, at http://www.science-infographics.org</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ada Ren for the SLI Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Polman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SLI Website Main Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1441561/1441561_10335673_1554118988044_SLIPDmainpage-landscape--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1441561/1441561_10335673_1554118988044_SLIPDmainpage-landscape--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLI PD Main Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1441561/1441561_10335673_1554118988044_SLIPDmainpage-landscape--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLI PD Main Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An image of the main professional development page of the STEM Literacy through Infographics website, at http://science-infographics.org/free-professional-development-workshop/</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ada Ren for the SLI Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Polman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SLI PD Main Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
