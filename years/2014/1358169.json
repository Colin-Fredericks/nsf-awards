 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide renewed funding of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU program will be offered annually to fifteen qualified applicants in three locations: Socorro, NM; Green Bank, WV; and Charlottesville, VA. These sites are the headquarters for the operations of the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), respectively. Students will perform cutting-edge research in several areas, including all fields of astronomy (cosmology, extragalactic, galactic, stellar, solar system, astrochemistry, pulsars, etc.), as well as astronomical engineering and computing. In addition to their assigned research project, all students participate in a hands-on observing experience using the NRAO GBT, VLA, and/or VLBA.\r\n\r\nThe award will enable a pipeline of skilled scientists and engineers to be developed in the field of radio astronomy, which is critical for the infrastructure of NSF-funded facilities. The program has also demonstrated its effectiveness in retaining students in STEM fields: indeed, over 300 past participants remain in the field of astronomy. Finally, participants also receive instruction and experience with communicating their scientific research through oral and written presentation of their research project results, including the opportunity to present their research at a professional meeting following their appointment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe National Radio Astonomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory (NRAO/GBO) summer student program is celebrating its 60th anniversary in 2019.   The program represents a significant component of the NRAO/GBO tradition of supporting our community through the education of students in key science and engineering disciplines.  The REU award funds students at three sites: NRAO in Socorro, NM; NRAO in Charlottesville, VA; and GBO in Green Bank, WV.  The REU program is the cornerstone to a rich and diverse NRAO/GBO summer cohort that includes both undergraduate and graduate students working together and collaborating on research with scientists at all levels, from postdocs to senior advisors.  Over the six year period 2013-2018, the program supported 75 REU students and the broader NRAO/GBO summer programs hosted 170 summer students, overall.\n\nEach student participates in a research project mentored by an NRAO scientist or engineer.  Our mentors provide projects that emphasize the student's  educational experience and provide an introduction to the research process  through all stages, including data acquisition, reduction, analysis, and  presentation.  The program provides hands-on experience with radio  astronomical observations from cutting-edge facilities and science and an  introduction to a wide range of astrophysical research topics.  In addition to  their assigned research projects, students participate in a week-long undergraduate-focused workshop in Green Bank, WV, where they tour the telescopes and facilities, hear lectures on radio astronomy and engineering, and participate in hands-on observing projects.  Over the summer, students also get to participate in panel discussions on career guidance and graduate school preparation and hear presentations on the many career pathways for STEM students, and they get opportunities to participate in public outreach, for example by giving VLA tours.\n\nThe NRAO/GBO summer program fosters a diverse student base, and we include programs, opportunities, and training specifically to foster broadening  participation from groups under-represented in STEM fields, including women and minorities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Braatz"
