 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Todd Hudnall of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Texas State University will explore the development of methods for stabilizing low-oxidation state and low-valent main group compounds.   In addition to their fundamental value in improving our understanding of main group chemistry, these targeted low-oxidation state main group compounds may be further utilized in applications such as energy storage at the molecular level or in the preparation of novel nanostructured main group alloys.  The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels. Texas State University is classified as a Hispanic Serving Institution, and is well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the funded project. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this work will explore the potential for a unique class of electrophilic carbenes to support main group elements in unusual coordination environments and oxidation states.  By utilizing carbonyl-decorated carbenes as stabilizing ligands, this project seeks to synthesize: (a) stable radicals centered on heavy group 15 elements; (b) carbene-supported terminal borylenes and gallylenes; and (c) formally zero oxidation state main group allotropes and alloys.",

Specifically, Hudnall prepared radicals centered at boron, arsenic, phosphorus, and antimony nuclei, and has shown that these electrophilic carbenes can also support B(I), B(II), Sb(0), Sb(I), P(0), P(I), and As(0) oxidation states. Near the end of the project period, Hudnall found that one of the electrophilic carbenes, namely a diamidocarbene (DAC), is photochemically active, and can undergo photoswitching from the singlet ground state to a triplet excited state, enabling new photochemical reactivities. &nbsp;As an extension of the last part of this work, Hudnall is now pursuing novel electrophilic carbene architectures inspired by the DAC which may be similarly photochemically active. The results obtained throughout the course of this project mark an important contribution to science, technology, and the public at large because they provide new fundamental structure-reactivity relationships in carbene chemistry which has far-reaching applications in areas such as renewable energy and materials science. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prof. Hudnall&rsquo;s lead of this project had much broader impacts beyond the work completed in his lab which resulted in the publication of 7 peer-reviewed manuscripts, with another 5 currently in preparation for submission later in 2018, and 1 book chapter which featured data obtained from research funded by this project. This project also supported the education and professional development of 3 graduate students (M.S.), 15 undergraduate students, and 2 postdoctoral researchers. Indeed, 10 of these students have now gone on to pursue doctoral studies at prestigious institutions such as Texas A&amp;M University, UT Austin, UC Davis, Colorado, and Michigan. Beyond the professional development of students and postdocs, this project allowed Prof. Hudnall to provide outreach programs to local K-12 students. McKenna Children&rsquo;s Museum in New Braunfels, Texas hosted Hudnall and his students as well as local high school students from Mr. Larry Anderson&rsquo;s chemistry course at Canyon High School, as part of their &ldquo;Science Matters&rdquo; days.
