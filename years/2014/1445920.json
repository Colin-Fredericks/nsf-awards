 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this workshop is to develop course descriptors (C-IDs) for lower-division engineering courses based on Transfer Model Curricula for Engineering and promote their wide adoption across the three main segments of the California engineering education system: California Community Colleges (CCC), California State University (CSU), and University of California (UC).  Results of efforts from this workshop will improve the articulation of lower-division engineering courses and aid engineering students in California in transferring to four-year institutions.  The workshop will convene approximately 100 participants (52 from the community colleges, 30 from the CSUs, and 18 from the UCs), including engineering faculty, administrators, and transfer staff to focus on the curriculum and development of the C-IDs.  This workshop builds upon previous workshops with administrators and articulation officers on the articulation process using C-IDs.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop activities aim to 1) develop a set of lower-division engineering course descriptors (C-IDs) that are widely accepted and implemented in the California engineering education system (CCC, CSU, and UC); 2) identify significant barriers to the successful transfer of thousands of engineering students in the state's community colleges; 3) create a community of engineering educators who work collaboratively to address challenges and opportunities facing the future of engineering education in the state; and 4) identify opportunities to further understand and contribute to the growing body of research on the importance of community colleges in building a strong and diverse STEM workforce.  Pre- and post-workshop surveys will be used to collect data  in order to fine tune the workshop and follow-up activities.  A two-hour follow-up workshop in Spring 2015 is planned to share the results of the surveys and to further the activities fostering awareness and acceptance of the C-IDs.",
