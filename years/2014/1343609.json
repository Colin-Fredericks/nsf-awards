 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, \"Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations,\" involves the delivery of three or more weekend workshops per academic year devoted to current research topics in Lie theory and applications, the first of which will occur October 12-13, 2013 at the University of California at Berkeley.  The remaining workshops for 2013-14 will take place at Stanford University during the winter of 2014, with an emphasis on quantum groups, and at USC in Spring 2014, with an emphasis on Hopf algebras.  The URL for the Workshop series is https://sites.google.com/site/lietheory/home.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the workshop series is to give advanced graduate students, post-docs, and other junior researchers the opportunity to attend state-of-the-art lectures by, and interact with, leading researchers in the field of Lie groups and Lie algebras, and to encourage collaborative initiatives.  Lie theory is an active area of mathematical research with connections to algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.",
