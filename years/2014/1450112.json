The seminar has been held every four years since 1979 with the location alternating between Japan and the US.  The seminar will bring together leading researchers to discuss their research in multiphase fluid dynamics.  The seminar will consist of a series of plenary and keynote lectures and technical sessions. Participation by junior researchers, postdoctoral students, and graduate students will be encouraged and supported.\r\n \r\nMultiphase systems consisting of gas and liquid phases or immiscible liquids pose special challenges to scientists and engineers who analyze them and design equipment to process them.  Theory and simulation worked out for single phase fluids do not apply to multiphase fluid systems owing to the presence of moving, deformable interfaces between fluid phases in multiphase systems.  Nevertheless, multiphase flows are important in many technological, biological, and environmental applications, including processes in the energy, chemical, and nuclear, petroleum and aerospace industries.  The seminar will provide a forum for researchers to discuss theory, simulation, and experimental results that pertain specifically to two-phase systems.",

The Seminar has been held approximately every four years, since the first seminar in Kansai, Japan &ndash; 1979,alternating between Japan and the U.S. \n\nThe objective of the Japan-U.S. Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics is to bring together senior and junior researchers from these two countries to have in-depth discussions on multiphase flow research.  The timing of the Seminar was very important, because we are finally approaching the development of truly mechanistic two-phase flow models that are comparable to those available for single phase flow.  This is made possible by the development of fine local measurement methods, detailed dynamic modeling of interfacial structures and interfacial transfers and the advancement of CFD.\n\nThe US participants were:\n\n \n\nUSA Organizers: Prof. Mamoru Ishhi, Associate Prof. Martin Bertodano, Purdue University. \n\n \n\nUSA Program Committee:\n\nGretar Trygvasson (Notre Dame)\n\nMasahiro Kawaji (City College of New York)\n\nQiao Wu (Oregon State University)\n\nXiadong Sun (Ohio State University)\n\n \n\nUS Delegates, representing a mix of senior and junior researchers other than the seminar organizers already mentioned were:\n\nArden Bement (Emeritus Professor and Former NSF Director, Purdue University)\nSuresh Garimella (Distinguished Professor and VP for Research, Purdue University)\nVictor Ransom (Emeritus Professor, Purdue University)\nMichael Corradini (Distinguished Professor, University of Wisconsin)\nSeungjin Kim (Professor, Penn State  University)\nYassin Hassan (Professor, Nuclear Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University)\n Karen Vierow (Associate Professor, Nuclear Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University)\nEmilio Baglietto (Associate Professor, MIT)\nAnnalisa Manera (Associate Professor, University of Michigan)\n\n\n\n10.

Key people from Japan and the US nuclear reactor licensing agencies attended so the Seminar participants were able to become acquainted with important technical issues of the Fukushima accident.\n\nForty two papers were distributed to the participants in a Seminar DVD that is available upon request.
