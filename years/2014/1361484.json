 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roger Loring of Cornell University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop detailed models and perform calculations that interpret and motivate new measurements of molecular motions. The motions of molecules determine chemical and biological processes, as well as mechanical and electronic properties of materials.  Recent experimental techniques obtain information regarding these motions on ever smaller length scales and shorter time scales.  Loring and graduate student coworkers model mechanical vibrations and energy flow in biomolecules such as proteins, individual events in chemical reactions catalyzed by the surface of small gold particles, and charge carrier transport in molecular semiconductors with the potential for use in plastic electronics.  Graduate students contribute to K-12 education through teacher training and enrichment programs coordinated by Cornell University.\r\n\r\nMultidimensional vibrational spectroscopy probes structure and relaxation in biomolecules, but full interpretation requires modeling the measurement with an atomic level of detail.  New methods for computing nonlinear vibrational response functions based on the semiclassical mean-trajectory approach approximate quantum dynamics using input from classical simulations. Electric force microscopy has the capacity to measure charge carrier dynamics in a disordered organic semiconductor.  Calculations from classical statistical mechanics and classical electrodynamics of the observables of electric force microscopy, noncontact friction and probe frequency noise, reveal the connections between these quantities and charge transport in an organic electronic device. Single-turnover studies of nanoparticle catalysis measure fluctuations from the mean kinetics observed in a bulk measurement. Loring and coworkers develop statistical measures of correlations in time and space among chemical events at different active sites on metal nanostructures, elucidating the analogs in inorganic catalysts of allosteric effects in enzymes.",

The development of every new measurement method raises basic issues of interpretation whose analysis requires techniques of theoretical and computational chemistry. What is the precise information content of the measurement?  How can a maximally detailed picture of molecular properties and motions be extracted from experimental data?\n\n \n\nA central tool of physical chemists in the study of matter is spectroscopy, the measurement of the interaction of light with matter. In the set of experiments known as multidimensional optical spectroscopy, a designed sequence of laser pulses, with frequencies ranging from the infrared to the ultraviolet are applied to material samples to probe a variety of properties and processes.  Such techniques are uniquely suited for applications from mapping the short-time motions of biological molecules to probing the dynamics of charge carriers and excitations in new materials.  Modeling these measurements requires describing molecular motions with quantum mechanics, which presents mathematical and computational challenges.  Treating molecules with the same laws of classical mechanics describing massive objects like baseballs or planets requires much less computational effort, but is only valid in limited circumstances.  This grant has been used to develop new theories and associated computational implementations for describing the quantum mechanical motions of atoms and molecules in a spectroscopic measurement with input from classical mechanical calculations.  The outcome is a protocol for computing multidimensional optical spectra that combines the practicality of a purely classical mechanical calculation with the approximate incorporation of the quantum effects displayed by real molecules.\n\n \n\nThis grant has supported the training of four Ph.
