 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient infrastructure systems such as highways, bridges, buildings, pipelines, flood control systems and utilities are all necessary for a healthy economy and comfortable standard of living. Concrete, steel and timber are the backbones of physical infrastructure. High strength polymer composites have been used for aerospace structures for about five decades and their use in civil infrastructure spans about 20 years. To accelerate the adoption of polymer composites into infrastructure, the NSF I/UCRC Center of the Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI) was established as a joint effort of West Virginia University (WVU), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the University of Miami. Recently, NSF has awarded a travel grant to establish an additional CICI site at Nanjing University of Technology in China. The NSF I/UCRC program brings together universities, private companies and government agencies together to leverage the research dollars for all parties by engaging in highly cooperative research. CICI's work with civil infrastructure has a tremendous effect on daily life, thus the Nation as a whole benefits as composite and hybrid materials lead to infrastructure systems of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost and improved labor productivity with the creation of new and higher skilled job opportunities. Member companies and end users benefit from the interaction with others in their field including highly trained students, with over 100 students expected to pass through CICI in the next 5 years. CICI is prolific technology transfer machine, exceeding the output for most I/UCRCs through the publishing of journal articles and conference presentations to promote the scientific research and knowledge dissemination. \r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the technical focus of CICI can be broken into four different areas. Initially, fundamental research projects are undertaken to broaden the knowledge base on infrastructure composites. This includes lifecycle performance, aging studies, evaluation of bond strength within a composite and as a substrate, and many others. From this on-going research, products are being developed that can be mass-implemented in infrastructure markets, including innovative hollow core or basalt fiber FRP rebar, waterway products that are noncorrosive or fabric reinforced cementitious composites for masonry wall strengthening and many others. The implementation of these products is the next focus area and is primarily accomplished through the development of codes and specifications. CICI has worked on the ASCE LRFD pultruded GFRP composites code, ASTM specifications, ACI building design and construction codes, the International Code Council and IIFC. Finally, CICI has an evaluation component based on IAB member feedback to ensure the composites that are implemented in the field are performing as designed as a part of our long-term performance program. Thus, through research, development, implementation and evaluation, CICI is involved in all facets of composite product evolution.",

High strength polymer composites have been used for aerospace structures for over five decades and their use in civil infrastructure started in early 1990s. To accelerate the adoption of polymer composites into infrastructure, the NSF I/UCRC CICI was established in 2008 as a planning grant. &nbsp;CICI is a joint effort of West Virginia University (WVU), North Carolina State University, the University of Miami and formerly University of Texas at Arlington (moved to Texas A&amp;M University in Dec 2019). During Phase II operation, CICI has grown from 17 members to 31 members including manufacturers, engineering firms, trade associations and government agencies. Together the industry members represent a broad spectrum of the composites industry, leading to research funding of about $1.5 million per year via membership fees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WVU-CICI team has worked closely with more than a dozen industry members and end users to research, develop, and field implement advanced composite structures or hybrids (composites + conventional materials like concrete and steel) in addition to the development of specifications and training engineers to implement FRPs. We developed several design procedures, specifications and products to implement FRP wraps on bridge structures made of timber and concrete. Four deteriorated bridges were repaired as demonstration projects in collaboration with WVDOT using FRP wraps in years 2016-2018. FRP composite design specifications/standards were developed for timber pile strengthening (LTRC), water control structures (USACE), and testing methodologies (ACMA-PIC and ASTM). The broader impact includes not only enhancing service life of infrastructure and composites industry&rsquo;s competitiveness, leading to structures of higher safety, shorter construction time and longer life at reduced costs, but also creating new industrial sector.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We published more than 30 papers, 50 presentations, 3 patents in addition to 4 patent applications and 3 disclosures under review. WVU has graduated 20 MS students, 5 PhD students and trained a dozen of undergraduate students. CICI team has received a number of national awards of significance including USACE National Innovation of the Year Award (2014, 2015), USPTO National Invention Competition Award (2017), CAMX Combined Strength Award (2017), ACMA Excellence Award in the Most Innovative Application category (2018) and best technical paper awards (2015, 2019).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More specifically, impact of the Center&rsquo;s research can be partly reflected thru the following: 1) &nbsp;Extending the service life of bridges with composite wraps. Repairs and upgrades of in-service bridges have become common. CICI retrofit process (wraps) allows highway departments to use composite wraps, consisting of fiberglass or carbon fabrics saturated with a resin and bonded to concrete members, rather than replace deteriorating bridges. Composite wraps can also increase strength of an otherwise good member increasing its life expectancy and load-carrying capacity; thus leading to significant dollar savings to taxpayers. 2) Design guide for reinforcing bridge decks with FRP rebars. CICI researchers have worked with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials committee to develop new standards that will enable the use of FRP reinforcing bars in bridge decks in the USA. This development means that previously funded NSF research in the field of fiber-reinforced polymers can now be used to make the nation&rsquo;s infrastructure more durable and longer lasting; thus saving taxpayers money, reducing delays related to bridge reconstruction and creating new business opportunities. 3) Design and development of high performance piles. CICI researchers conducted research and testing on FRP products such as pipes, utility poles and hydraulic gates for infrastructure applications. Participating in CICI has allowed industries to accelerate commercialization process and get new products to market at a faster rate. One example is the pile product, SUPERPILE (Creative Pultrusions), which is an extremely tough, high energy absorbing and corrosion resistant round pile that can be used on bridges, docks and other structures as a fender. With the help of research conducted at CICI, this product went from inception to market in three years. CICI research and testing was instrumental in winning approvals for this product by the Florida Department of Transportation (DoT), the Virginia DoT and, more recently, the USDOT-FHWA. Its projected life expectancy is at least 3 times conventional materials. A noteworthy recent installation of SUPERPILE, involved the construction of service and visitor docks destroyed around the Statue of Liberty in NY City. This product now makes up roughly 10% of the company&rsquo;s revenues. &nbsp;Company credits the CICI for the ability to move quickly to take on new projects and their willingness to contribute their time and research to the development of standards, codes and manuals for the composites industry.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hota&nbsp;V&nbsp;Gangarao</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662414825576_FRPwrapp2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662414825576_FRPwrapp2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rehab of Madison Avenue Bridge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662414825576_FRPwrapp2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rehab of Madison Avenue Bridge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rehab of Madison Avenue Bridge, Huntington, WV (WVDOT \ufffdDOH RP 268)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">WVU-CFC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hota&nbsp;V&nbsp;Gangarao</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rehab of Madison Avenue Bridge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662414933045_FRPwrapp3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662414933045_FRPwrapp3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FRP Wrap Strengthening of Denzell Mills Bridge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662414933045_FRPwrapp3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FRP Wrap Strengthening of Denzell Mills Bridge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FRP Wrap Strengthening of Denzell Mills Bridge</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">WVU-CFC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hota&nbsp;V&nbsp;Gangarao</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FRP Wrap Strengthening of Denzell Mills Bridge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415002746_FRPwrapp4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415002746_FRPwrapp4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Turnpike Bridge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415002746_FRPwrapp4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Turnpike Bridge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Turnpike Bridge</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">WVU-CFC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hota&nbsp;V&nbsp;Gangarao</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Turnpike Bridge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415567046_FRPPilep1c--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415567046_FRPPilep1c--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FRP Sheet Piles and Pipe Piles\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415567046_FRPPilep1c--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FRP Sheet Piles and Pipe Piles\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FRP Sheet Piles and Pipe Piles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">WVU-CFC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hota&nbsp;V&nbsp;Gangarao</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FRP Sheet Piles and Pipe Piles</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415671479_FRPPilep2c--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415671479_FRPPilep2c--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rehabilitation of Railway Timber Bridges and Piles\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1439688/1439688_10340563_1662415671479_FRPPilep2c--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rehabilitation of Railway Timber Bridges and Piles\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rehabilitation of Railway Timber Bridges and Piles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">WVU-CFC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hota&nbsp;V&nbsp;Gangarao</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rehabilitation of Railway Timber Bridges and Piles</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Its projected life expectancy is at least 3 times conventional materials. A noteworthy recent installation of SUPERPILE, involved the construction of service and visitor docks destroyed around the Statue of Liberty in NY City. This product now makes up roughly 10% of the company\u2019s revenues.  Company credits the CICI for the ability to move quickly to take on new projects and their willingness to contribute their time and research to the development of standards, codes and manuals for the composites industry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hota V Gangarao"
