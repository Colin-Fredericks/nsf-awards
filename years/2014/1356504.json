 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need to increase the number and quality of STEM graduates in the workforce both nationally and in New York State is well-documented. A 2010 state-level analysis study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (http://cew.georgetown.edu/jobs2018/states) projects that by 2018 there will be a need to fill 359,000 STEM jobs in New York State. The Alliance for Science and Technology Research (ASTRA) projects that 68% of these STEM positions will require a bachelor's degree or higher.   \r\nThe Discovery Within Community (DWC) Program is St. Bonaventure University (SBU)'s proposal to enhance the quality of STEM education and increase the number of STEM graduates either entering the workforce or STEM graduate programs.  The DWC Steering Committee conducts a thorough applicant-review process to select 25 talented students (Fellows) with financial need in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Mathematics and Physics programs.  Effective recruitment processes and outreach are used to increase public awareness about STEM and encourage high school students to further their STEM education by applying to the university.\r\n\r\nBuilt on SBU's already strong community structure, the elements of the DWC Program improve student learning in STEM by reinforcing classroom education via symposia involving interaction with STEM faculty and STEM business professionals and tutoring sessions (both receiving and giving) that foster retention of knowledge and research opportunities. STEM student support services are enhanced through the formation of an interdisciplinary cohort sharing a common residency and taking core courses together to improve academic performance and increase retention rates.  To ensure that 90% of S-STEM fellows graduate in four years DWC promotes collaboration among STEM faculty and students.  Interdisciplinary exploration which is fully supported by faculty mentors allows S-STEM fellows to engage in internships and professional conferences throughout all four years and have opportunities to present research results.  Partnerships with STEM businesses are consolidated and extend beyond the grant period to continue to address the need for a highly qualified regional STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nEvaluation metrics include appropriate increases in inquiries, applications, acceptances, and matriculations, with a goal of a 15% overall growth in enrollment in all STEM majors. Program-specific measures are used to gain objective feedback from fellows, their teachers and tutors and from employers on the number and quality of internships and jobs obtained. Feedback from mentors and fellows are used to evaluate and improve these relationships during the grant period. The completion of research projects, the number of conferences attended, presentations given, and articles published, along with feedback from business professionals are used to assess the quality of these components, with a goal that 90% of S-STEM fellows who graduate immediately secure employment with a STEM employer or enter a STEM graduate program.",

While a living-learning community in the residence hall did not materialize, STEM Fellows were housed near other science students for their first year.  The fellows took two general education courses together, the second of which (a lab science course) included an assignment about the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary science.  STEM Symposia featuring 14 outside speakers and 8 SBU STEM faculty and STEM Fellows sought to appraise the scholars of possible STEM careers while also enhancing cohort bonds.  Social gatherings and two retreats also added to the community spirit.  Participation in two general science conferences and the opportunity to attend a conference in their major further promoted their career knowledge.  Fellows were supported in research opportunities with STEM faculty that could lead to presentations at scientific meetings. Fellows could take advantage of tutoring by more advanced STEM majors and eventually provide STEM tutoring themselves.  By participation in the EDGE career skills program of the Career and Professional Readiness Center the fellows were prepared for entry into work and/or graduate programs in STEM fields.\n\nWe enrolled 23 students in the first semester of Discovery Within Community due to late notification of grant approval and inadequate recruiting.  Throughout the first three semesters we lost more STEM Fellows (mostly to non-STEM majors at SBU) than we could replace, so that there were only 13 graduates of the program.  While the number of STEM majors at SBU increased over the course of the grant, it did not increase by 15%.   Despite the enhancement of STEM support services, 75% of the STEM Fellows did not graduate in four years.  72% of the fellows remaining after the fourth semester graduated in four years.   12 of 13 graduates (92%) of the program found employment in STEM industries or entered STEM graduate programs.\n\nResults of the program were disseminated through an article in the \"Bonaventure\" magazine distributed to members of the SBU community and alumni.  An article is being prepared for publication in an appropriate journal.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Schneible"
