The PI and co-PI are on the organizing committee.  The lecturers are leading researchers in this field and have been chosen for their record of mentoring and nurturing young talent. The members of the organizing and scientific committees will participate as mentors to the young participants, and a small number of carefully picked additional senior participants will do the same. The schedule centers around five 3-hour courses and is designed to leave ample time for one-on-one interactions. The environment at CIRM is ideally suited for concentrated activity and maximal interaction.",
