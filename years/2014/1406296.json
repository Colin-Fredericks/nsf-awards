 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at Iowa State University (ISU) entitled, \"RET Site in Engineering and Computer Science: Energy and Sustainability-To Develop the Green Collar Workforce for the 21st Century\", under the direction of Dr. Eric W. Cochran. \r\n\r\nThe technical focus of this Site is sustainable energy and materials. Faculty mentors represent a diverse array of backgrounds supporting this theme and are affiliated with a number of ISU centers and institutes including the NSF Center for BioRenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) Engineering Research Center.  Research opportunities will include a broad spectrum of specialities within the theme of energy and sustainability: from the production of fuels, chemicals, and polymers from renewable feedstocks; to advances in photovoltaics and fuel cells; and to novel water purification systems.  These projects highlight the efforts at ISU to develop technologies that will allow a continuation of current living standards without jeopardizing the environment.  Such topics are especially relevant for an RET Site since they address needs that directly connect with students served by participating teachers.  Project Lead the Way (PLTW)-trained and Career and Technology Education (CTE) high school instructors will receive authentic research experiences in engineering disciplines for 7 weeks during the summer plus additional activities during the academic school year. These experiences will enable participants to prepare and inspire their students to become part of the 21st century \"green-collar\" workforce.  A total of 39 participants (13 per year) will be selected from Iowa's pool of PLTW-trained high school teachers as well as CTE instructors who are not yet part of the PLTW program. The objectives of this Site are to: provide technology and pre-engineering instructors immersion in engineering research and applications; help teachers learn to translate this experience into increased student engagement in the STEM fields; leverage the research experience into enhanced curriculum delivery designed to recruit and prepare students for future careers in engineering and technology fields; and form personal connections between ISU Engineeirng Faculty and Iowa PLTW and CTE teachers, ultimately helping to raise the level of student preparedness for the transition to college.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project include increased professional development for high school PLTW and CTE teachers; increased opportunity for teachers to catalyze their efforts in curriculum development to be able to share with their students the rewarding and exciting opportunities associated with a career in engineering;  benefits to the U.S. economy resulting from a well-trained, globally competitive workforce; and the introduction of RET participants to the ISU Program for Women in Engineering (PWSE), Student Role Models.",

Seven participants came from Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. The training they received supported delivery of Project Lead The Way (PLTW) curricula, Career and Technology Education (CTE) curricula and STEM curricula based on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).</p>\n<p>The RET-Site was offered for four consecutive years (2014-2017) in collaboration with the NSF Engineering Research Center for Bioreneawble Chemicals RET program and the Iowa State University Molecular Biology, Biotechnology and Genomics RET program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each participating teacher was placed in an engineering research laboratory to work collaboratively with laboratory members on a cutting-edge research topic for the duration of seven weeks. The teachers were assigned small projects they could complete independently under the supervision of either a faculty member, post doc, or graduate student. Throughout the experience, teachers learned the principles and concepts relating to their assigned project and mastered complex research and design problems. Teachers were expected to participate in lab meetings and present their findings to their research group. Teachers and their hosts were encouraged to meet regularly to discuss their respective research projects and how to explain them to high school students using basic engineering concepts.</p>\n<p>In addition to working daily in their research laboratory, teachers began the RET-Site program with a two-day professional training in STEM pedagogy, followed by weekly morning pedagogy sessions throughout the program. These included discussions around critical thinking skills with a focus on incorporating inquiry-driven activities. Specifically, the work done helped teachers focus on a topic relevant to both their research experience and the curriculum to be delivered to students during the school year. Teachers' main deliverable was to create a learning activity in collaboration with their faculty mentor to take back to their classrooms. The main value of these learning activities was to (1) provide real world examples to develop analytical, critical thinking and problem solving skills in STEM classrooms and (2) establish a long-lasting partnership with their faculty host/mentor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through active research and participation in pedagogy professional development, teachers were able to strengthen their understanding of the scientific method and the engineering design process. The experience provided participants ideas of how to move from textbook/cookbook based methods of teaching to inquiry/open-ended methods of learning and teaching. Teachers worked collaboratively with their faculty mentor and research group to create lesson plans and learning activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A secondary development opportunity was provided to the graduate students who supervised the teachers. By working closely with their teacher interns, they learned to effectively mentor and communicate complex technical and scientific concepts.</p>\n<p>A third professional development opportunity was provided to faculty mentors, who learned first-hand the current challenges facing K-12, specifically in STEM. This is very useful in better understanding college readiness of incoming freshmen. The faculty were also encouraged to develop partnerships with their teacher that will progress beyond the summer programs.</p>\n<p>Teachers gained laboratory and research skills, a better understanding of scientific inquiry and the nature of science, persistence and patience in the laboratory setting, and confidence working in a research environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Teachers became more confident to teach about science and engineering in their classrooms; they also reported increased comfort with teaching their students to think critically, analytically and problem-solve. Teachers became more confident in their knowledge of STEM career options and discussing potential careers in engineering with their students.</p>\n<p>Teachers engaged in critical thinking about their teaching philosophies and methods and their impact on students' learning, including pedagogical methods directed by different learning styles that recognize learners as unique individuals.</p>\n<p>Teachers planned to incorporate (a) hypothesis-driven lab exercises and discussions, (b) critical thinking activities, (c) long-term experiments to engage students in continuous active learning, and (d) the development of analytical skills in their classroom curricula.</p>\n<p>Teachers gained collaborative relationships with other high school teachers and Iowa State University faculty, students and staff to foster their continued growth in the realm of science education. Partnership development between the teachers and their faculty mentors was strongly encouraged and the creation of Teacher-Scientist Partnership Learning Activities was promoted.</p>\n<p>Teachers created posters and gave oral presentations summarizing their research at the closing research symposium.</p>\n<p>All participating teachers made use of mini-grants to purchase supplies for curricular development and classroom activities related to engineering.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2018 this grant provided funding for a follow-up workshop for RET participant alumni with the main goals of: sharing insight and research to help participants develop a new perspective on the current and future landscape of teacher leadership in STEM education; reconnecting RET alumni with their faculty mentor; and developing an action plan to address a significant STEM education problem/issue/dilemma challenging each
