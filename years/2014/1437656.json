Solar cells for producing electricity require materials that absorb the sun?s energy and convert its photons to electrons, a process called photovoltaics.  The search for the best photovoltaic material is an active area of solar cell research.  Recently, an exciting new class of photovoltaic materials called organo-metal perovskites has emerged. These materials are promising because they have low production cost, use elements and materials abundant in the earth's crust, and currently possess solar energy conversion efficiencies of over 15%.  However, the reasons why these materials work so well is not really known.  The overall goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the origins of photovoltaic performance in perovskite based solar cell materials by using highly sensitive techniques to probe the material surfaces and interfaces without destroying the material itself.  This fundamental understanding can be used to advance the development of perovskite materials for solar cell applications.   The project activities will train graduate and undergraduate students in state of the art techniques for surface characterization of materials.  Existing programs at the University of Rochester will be used to provide lab tours, short lectures, and hand-on experiences for high school girls in organic electronics to stimulate interest in STEM fields.  Robust perovskite solar cell demonstration kits will be developed for use by high school students.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nRecently, organo-metal perovskites have emerged as an exciting new class of earth-abundant photovoltaic materials, with solar energy conversion efficiencies exceeding 15% and potential for low manufacturing cost.  The overall goal of this project is to use an array of surface analysis tools to gain a fundamental understanding of origins of photovoltaic performance of organometal trihalide perovskite materials.  The proposed research will study the electronic structure, interface formation, carrier relaxation dynamics, and factors affecting the stability of these materials in air, through variety of techniques, which include ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy, and time-resolved 2-photon photoemission spectroscopy. The surface structure and morphology will be characterized using low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.  Finally, perovskite thin film device structures will be prepared and characterized in situ under vacuum and then transferred directly to the surface analytical tools to determine how interface structures change.  This integrated approach will provide a comprehensive description of the electronic structure and interface properties of perovskite based solar cell materials and their correlation to photovoltaic performance. The project activities will train graduate and undergraduate students in state of the art techniques for surface characterization of materials.  Existing programs at the University of Rochester will be used to provide lab tours, short lectures, and hand-on experiences for high school girls in organic electronics to stimulate interest in STEM fields.

This is highly desirable for the sustainable development of the human society as current energy sources are mainly from burning fossil fuels that are diminishing and contaminating. Organometal trihalide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, are a new type of materials that have the potential to produce solar cells with very high efficiency at very low cost.  This project is focused at fundamental understanding of critical issues and challenges at the interfaces in perovskite solar cells.  These issues include the electronic structure, interface formation, carrier relaxation dynamics, and factors affecting the stability of those materials.  The primary techniques for the investigations are ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS and XPS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), and other surface analytical techniques.  Single crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 was measured with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that provides the detailed electronic band structure of the material.  The stability of the perovskites was investigated to reveal that nitrogen and oxygen acted as p-type dopants.  On the other hand, water worked as an n-type dopant in the beginning and then decomposed the surface of the materials at later stages.  The investigations on the interface formation of the perovskites with the charge conducting and electrode materials show that the energy level alignment is very important, and the choice of the charge conducting materials is critical as the perovskites can be sensitive to decomposition due to interface reactions.  It is observed that on CH3NH3PbI3 the HOMO level of fullerene shifts to lower binding energy.  The XPS results show a strong initial shift of core levels to lower binding energy in the perovskite, which indicates that electrons transfer from the perovskite film to fullerene molecules.  The interface of CH3NH3PbI3 with Au is inert, but that with MoO3 is highly reactive.

A record-high mobility?lifetime product and an extremely small surface charge recombination velocity are realized by reducing the bulk defects and passivating surface traps.\n\nBroader Impact The project addresses fundamental understanding of perovskite solar cells, a promising candidate important for renewable and environmentally friendly energy source.  The research has led to findings for making solar cells that are not only one of the most clean and sustainable, but also the least expensive energy sources.  An important aspect of the project is educating and training graduate and undergraduate students through interdisciplinary research in advanced organic materials and devices and in materials surface/interface characterization.
