 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit :\r\nIn this project a new fully optical CE-FRS detection scheme is proposed to mitigate needs\r\nfor any chemical treatments of the sample gas that is usually required with currently available\r\ninstrumentation for trace oxygen sensing. The project will leverage unique capabilities of\r\ndevelopment and commercialization of cavity enhanced technologies by Tiger Optics and the\r\nnew sensing technology based on FRS developed and demonstrated by MIRTHE. Initially a proof-of-concept\r\nprototype system will be investigated based on a conventional two mirror high-Finesse cavity\r\nequipped with a custom FRS optics for signal extraction. Most importantly the proposed research\r\nwill also explore the possibility of implementing CE-FRS using the Tiger Optics proprietary\r\nhigh-Finesse optical prism cavity technology. This unique technology would allow CE-FRS to\r\nbe implemented in combination with standard cw-CRDS in the same commercial instrument, permitting\r\nsensitive broadband detection of paramagnetic and diamagnetic molecules simultaneously. The\r\nproposed technology will eliminate routine maintenance issues, chemical conversion uncertainty\r\nand other disadvantages typical for electrochemical systems or indirect sensing technologies.\r\nThe proposed direct laser-based detection provides significant advantage in industrial applications\r\nwhere 24-7 continuous monitoring is required and in environmental applications where analyzers\r\nare often situated in remote locations with basic infrastructure.\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nDevelopment of a CE-FRS method will open up possibilities for sensitive monitoring of many\r\nother paramagnetic species. This method will be suitable for real-time monitoring of trace\r\nconcentrations of radicals involved in combustion and atmospheric chemistry, i.e. NO, NO2,\r\nOH, HO2, and CH. In many cases, while the presence of these radicals is known, the reaction\r\nrates and abundances are not well known due to the lack of in situ monitoring capabilities.\r\nA direct laser-based method can provide a new tool for monitoring trace-radicals in a wide\r\nrange of applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial process control or combustion\r\ndiagnostics. Therefore scientific and engineering advancements in this field integrated with\r\na comprehensive educational program addressing specific career development goals at each academic\r\nlevel from high school students to post-doctoral researchers, will provide an excellent training\r\nfor the new generation",
