 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this I/UCRC Fundamental Research Program project is to develop a mathematical model of the tire-road contact characteristics. The specific goals of the project are (1) develop and implement a theory to describe the contact mechanical processes and the resulting friction properties; (2) expand upon the existing physically motivated rubber friction theories; (3) develop multi-scale representation of the rough surface in terms of a self-affine fractal description; and (4) conduct experimental testing and validation of the proposed model in the laboratory and on the track.\r\n\r\nTires are a critical component in the overall automotive system, enabling safety and fuel economy. The research itself will have impact on the new tire compound development research. The model and the test bed will simplify a host of experiments and make possible many others that are otherwise prohibitively complex. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio while potentially attracting new members. The results of the research will become part of the material in the ongoing Tire Mechanics course and other courses in Mechanical Engineering. The activities will dovetail with the Virginia Tech Center for Engineering Education and Diversity (CEED) to engage women and minorities to continue toward advanced degrees\r\n",
