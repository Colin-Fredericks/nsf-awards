 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participants in the research training group in geometry and topology at the University of Chicago.  The program will be led by six faculty members (Danny Calegari, Alex Eskin, Benson Farb, J. Peter May, Shmuel Weinberger, and Anne M. Wilkinson) who will work in collaboration with other members of the Department of Mathematics to build on the department's successes in the academic year Directed Reading Program and summer Research Experience for Undergraduates program by further enhancing the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.  Graduate students and postdocs will be involved in topics courses taught by postdocs and in the support of research-oriented summer programs for undergraduates. Shorter, immersive summer workshops for graduate students and postdocs will build on the longstanding tradition of the Midwest Topology Seminar and related conferences that regularly bring together researchers throughout the Great Lakes states. Group activities for the academic year include a geometric literacy course that ranges widely in topics, and a topology proseminar.\r\n\r\nThis research training group aims to achieve a greater integration of fields that have grown apart over the decades and to expose participants to a broader range of potential applications than has been traditional.  Research training will be anchored by research topics ranging broadly through dynamical systems and ergodic theory, a variety of topics in and around geometric group theory, the striking failure of rigidity in arithmetic lattices, homological stability phenomena, and various topics in algebraic topology, from equivariant stable homotopy theory through applied algebraic topology and data analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur RTG had two intertwined goals, often thought of as contradictory.   One was focused on research and the training of graduate students and postdocs.  Our research programs in geometry, topology, and dynamical systems were bolstered by financial support for a remarkable group of talented graduate students and postdocs.   The Final Report gives technical details, but the three cited areas are central pillars of modern mathematics, with many  applications to other areas of mathematics and to the real world.  New  PhDs from our group became postdocs at the Institute for Advanced Study, MIT, Berkeley, Michigan, Texas, and other top schools.  Postdocs during the grant period obtained tenure track jobs at Cornell, the University of Colorado,  UC Irvine, and UC Santa Cruz, among others.\n\nThe other goal was focused on undergraduate mathematics.  The University of Chicago Department of Mathematics has run an REU program since 2000.  The RTG grant greatly helped in keeping it in existence and allowing it to expand. It started in 2000 with 20 participants.  It has expanded steadily ever since.   Its popularity among University of Chicago undergraduates is probably the main reason that mathematics majors now account for over 12 per cent of University of Chicago graduates each spring.   In 2021,  102 Chicago undergraduates participated in the REU.  It kept the mathematical spirit alive during the pandemic years 2020 and 2021, when many other REU's threw in the towel.   Starting in 2015, the RTG grant allowed us to open the REU to participants from outside the University of Chicago.  There were 28 such participants in 2021, chosen from over 400 applicants.   Despite operating online, the REU managed to encourage the spirit of collaboration and collegiality essential to attracting people to long term commitments to stem disciplines.  This was done by breaking the program into five smaller subprograms meeting in small online groups.  The online format allowed us to have very many outside speakers, making for a very varied introduction to advanced mathematics.   The program is based on one-on-one mentoring, primarily by graduate\nstudents and faculty at the University of Chicago.  Modern technology allows for such activity to work well despite the lack of in person meetings.\n\nA point we want to emphasize is that running such a large scale REU in no way detracts from our research goals.  In fact, one key facet of the REU program enhances research activity.  Undergraduate participants must write papers.  These can be expository and most often are.  In our fields, being relatively young, much of the early literature is both still essential but relatively inaccessible due to more recent advances.  Expository papers that modernize crucial results are very valuable.  The REU papers are posted and freely available.  It is startling how often they rise to the top of Google searches for the material they cover.  Writing such papers offers a very helpful gateway towards serious research.  That has been the starting point for many outstanding research mathematicians who were attracted into research mathematics through participation in the REU.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
