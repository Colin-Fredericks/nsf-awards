 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I/UCRC Fundamental Research Program project seeks to address some of the critical knowledge gaps by elucidating the mechanisms of mitigation of Environmental Protection Agency's Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) viruses and estrogens using electrocoagulation (EC) as a sustainable alternative for drinking water treatment. This research provides the first fundamental assessment of the treatment efficacy of 3 CCL viruses (adenovirus, calicivirus, and enteroviruses) and 4 CCL estrogens (E1, E2, E3, and EE2) via EC. Understanding of system capabilities will advance through direct comparisons of EC, conventional coagulation, and oxidation using chlorine and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The role of floc adsorption followed by sedimentation or flotation will be quantified, as will the potential for oxidation by electrolytically-generated active chlorine or ROS species. These findings are intended to provide the scientific basis for improved water treatment process design, environmental regulatory framework, and deeper understanding of the potential of related treatment processes, including those that rely on adsorption as well as conventional and advanced oxidation. \r\n\r\nThe proposed effort effort has broader implications for improved water and wastewater infrastructure (with potential for implementation in municipal, household, and emergency potable use scenarios), public health, energy, and the associated economic implications. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center's portfolio while potentially attracting new members. This industry-relevant research leverages participation of three PIs with diverse areas of expertise, two graduate student researchers, and industry mentors. Student interest and involvement in STEM education and careers is encouraged by connecting students with the effort's research as well as industry contacts.",
