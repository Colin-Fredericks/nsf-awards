 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) provides three years of support for three cohorts of ten students each. Students major in the Mathematical Sciences with a Concentration in Computational/Applied Mathematics, or Statistics; or receive a minor in the mathematical sciences, with a big data focus, as they complete their major requirements in one of eight STEM departments. Students enter the program as sophomores. The program starts with a two week summer session in which students are immersed in computational science, both theoretical and applied. In the Fall, and for the next three years, students attend a bi-weekly seminar that alternates between mini-workshops, visiting speakers, career planning, team building, and a variety of other activities. Students are expected to graduate after three years of support. \r\n\r\nThe technical merit of the project lies in its alignment with the interests of students who aspire to work in a computational, high-technology environment. The summer program provides a concentrated Mathematical Modeling and Computational environment that prepares participants for the next three years of study. As such it represents a well-tested method of initiating a long-term training effort when participants enter with diverse educational backgrounds.  The overall three-year effort intends to develop students into mathematical scientists who solve complex data-driven problems. Additionally, the project integrates with other programs at the institution - supported both by NSF and other organizations, to enhance the impact of these particular scholarship initiatives.  Other collaborating programs include NSF-REU, NSF-UBM, NSF-Noyce, TBR-Access and Diversity Initiative, and the ETSU Governor's School. Recruitment of women and minorities is facilitated due to cooperation and communication with other STEM education programs currently in operation at East Tennessee State University. The project's activities, e.g. seminars, speakers, internships, and courses, enable students to benefit from long-term immersion in a culture of predictive modeling; analysis of large and complex or fluid dynamics data sets; and scientific computation, all of which hold promise to increase retention of students through graduation.",
