 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's Internet connects more and more devices. It has been predicted that by 2020, 50 billion \"smart\" embedded devices will be connected to the Internet. As the address space is nearly exhausted, the increasing users, applications, services, and devices pose a great demand on the Internet. At the same time, Internet users expect to have any information/service available at their fingertips. This exacerbates the need for a highly available and scalable Internet.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to meet the scalability and reliability demands of diverse applications, services and trillions of devices. The proposed architecture, referred to as LOcation-based Routing and ID-based Forwarding or LORIF, supports data forwarding based on the ID of a destination host, while maintaining routes based on the topological locations of the end host. Each host may have multiple locations representing its topological identity. Through a novel service for mapping host ID to network location(s), LORIF enables the control plane to scaleably exploit path diversity, while at the same time, facilitating data plane to improvements in end-to-end reliability.\r\n\r\nLORIF brings significant benefits to users and the society by enhancing the scalability and reliability of our communication infrastructure.  This project brings together an international team of researchers from diverse and complimentary backgrounds. Such a collaboration enables the feasibility of deploying the testbed across the continents, and enhances the odds of adoption in the future.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in network architecture design and testbed development.",
