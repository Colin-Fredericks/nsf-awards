 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research award supports fundamental research on vibratory tissue cutting mechanics to improve needle insertion placement accuracy inside the body for cancer treatment and other medical procedures. This research will determine how vibrational tissue cutting force is related to vibrational parameters and needle cutting edge geometry with both fixed geometry and utilizing the novel concept of compliant tool geometry. Vibratory tissue cutting mechanics will be investigated with a precision needle positioning machine that vibrates needles of varying compliant needle tip geometries. This research will also investigate how laser micro machining and multi-axis wire electrical discharge machining can be employed to produce small scale intricate needle tip geometries. \r\n\r\nResults will provide knowledge of vibratory tissue cutting mechanics and novel microfabrication techniques. Knowledge of vibratory tissue cutting will bring about the development of innovative minimally invasive medical instrument designs that improve procedure efficacy, reduce patient trauma, and reduce medical cost. Microfabrication knowledge gained will lead to new laser-based micro manufacturing and multi-axis electrical discharge machining techniques. These fabrication techniques will enable the future development of microstructured medical devices that have a larger range of sizes, shapes and materials than conventional microfabrication techniques can produce. This collaborative research project between Pennsylvania State University and North Carolina State University will also positively impact engineering education at these universities and enhance cross-disciplinary research collaboration.",
