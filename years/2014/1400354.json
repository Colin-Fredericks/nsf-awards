 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturing is a major component of the Ohio economy and is ranked sixth in the nation in manufacturing's percentage of total jobs. From now to 2020, eight manufacturing subsectors are expected to grow in Ohio: food manufacturing, beverage and tobacco products, wood products, plastic and rubber products, nonmetallic mineral products, fabricated metal products, transportation equipment, and furniture and related products. This growth creates an increased demand for multi-craft maintenance support technicians.\r\n\r\nColumbus State Community College will collaborate with Miami University, two Worthington City high schools, Honda North American Services LLC and several manufacturing companies to expand the supply of next-generation multi-craft manufacturing support technicians to address this growing shortage in the Central Ohio Region. The technicians will have skills in electrical (AC and DC), programmable logical controllers, pneumatics, hydraulics, mechanical drive systems, welding, troubleshooting, and safety. The multi-craft manufacturing support technicians will design, install, troubleshoot, and maintain a variety of types of equipment within manufacturing and process control operations. The project will integrate an Advanced Automation Institute summer bridge program, with classroom instruction, and paid work study into a seamless pathway from high school to a baccalaureate degree. Planned laboratory improvements will include upgrading welding facilities, additions to a self-paced Integrated Systems Technology facility, and creating a remote site laboratory to serve students in rural areas. A key feature will involve specific methods to reach out to and serve under-represented populations. There will be a wide dissemination of the program model through publications, conferences, and partnerships.\r\n\r\nProject evaluation activities will address the program impact on students and their employability, the quality of the learning materials developed, and the impact on faculty and the institution of the multi-craft maintenance support technician career pathway.",
