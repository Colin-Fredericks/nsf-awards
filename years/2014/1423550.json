 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by teams at the University of Alaska and the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry will engage the public in the topic of the nature and prevalence of permafrost, its scale on the earth and the important role it plays in the global climate. It builds on 50 years of informal education and outreach at the Alaskan Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, AK, which, since the 1960s, has been the Nation's only underground facility for research related to permafrost and climate.  The project has four components: (1) a nationally distributed 2,000 square-foot traveling exhibition; (2) exhibit and program enhancements to the learning opportunities at the tunnel; (3) programs, table-top exhibits and oral history research in 27 Native Alaskan villages; and (4) an education research study.  Each of these components will be evaluated over the course of the work.  By upgrading the displays at the tunnel, and by taking traveling programs to the villages, the work will extend the tunnel experience across Alaska.  In the villages the team will collect stories about climate change, along with samples of real ancient ice and permafrost.  These stories and materials will be used in the travelling exhibit which is expected to be at three museums per year for eight years.  \r\n\r\nThe research component of the initiative will build on the observation to date that the tunnel has provided thousands of visitors with an underground immersive environment where they learn about the science research being conducted and engage with climate-sensitive materials (e.g., permafrost, wedge ice, frozen silt, Pleistocene bones) using all of their senses.  It has been conjectured that their learning experiences are enhanced by interacting with real vs. replicated objects.   As museums often contain exhibits that are more likely to contain replicated and/or virtual objects and environments, understanding the impact that these different categories of objects have on learning is important. Using both types of materials, the project will investigate differences in their efficacy in informal science learning institutions related to climate change.  Real objects are postulated to have the following attributes that stimulate fuller engagement; they are (1) information-rich by virtue of such features as their texture, odor, and dimensionality; (2) at real-life scale; (3) authentic, i.e., original objects; and (4) often unique, i.e., have inherent value.  Research questions will explore the potential impacts on learning of these and related features.  Methods employed will be observation, video, and interviews of the public with a particular focus on visitor talk with respect to explanations and elaborations about permafrost, tipping points, climate change, and geological time.",

It is a major player in the global climate system, but due to its hidden nature, it is often hard to visualize and understand. Twenty-years of experience guiding people through a real underground permafrost tunnel in Alaska showed us that we could bring the fascinating world of permafrost to people in creative ways. Our project did this in three main efforts: 1) by going to villages across Alaska with displays and hands-on materials related to permafrost including 30,000 year-old mammoth bones found in permafrost and ancient ice, 2) by constructing a 2000 square-foot traveling museum display, including a smaller replica of the real tunnel, complete with permafrost scientists lab and smell beads (permafrost has a distinct odor), and 3) by exploring how real objects like fossil bones and immersive experiences (like going underground in a tunnel) help people learn in informal settings. Over the course of the project we visited 47 Alaskan villages, often traveling by small aircraft or boat, where we held potlucks and community Science Nights and we had fruitful discussions about permafrost and climate with the local people. Those visits led to the development of a table-top permafrost kit complete with 3D models of permafrost landscapes; kits have now been distributed to over 35 learning centers across the country. The museum exhibit was seen and enjoyed by about 400,000 people while on the floor at the OMSI museum in Portland, and is now traveling around the U.S. and Canada, where we estimate it will be seen by several million people. &nbsp;One scholarly paper has been published on learning science and two more are nearing publication that help us understand why the original tunnel was so effective, and how we might harness that effectiveness in learning elsewhere. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/18/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;Sturm</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423550/1423550_10333375_1587256510127_PermafrostArcticAlaska--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423550/1423550_10333375_1587256510127_PermafrostArcticAlaska--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Permafrost Arctic Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423550/1423550_10333375_1587256510127_PermafrostArcticAlaska--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Permafrost Arctic Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Vast areas of the Arctic are covered by permafrost which creates polygonal ground like that shown here.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.
