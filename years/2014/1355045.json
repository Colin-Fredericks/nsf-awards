 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will generate new information on how an important family of proteins, the GAP Junction proteins, partakes in the assembly of a functional brain from its component parts, neurons and glial cells.  These proteins join together to form electrical synapses, a major means of communication between nerve cells.  During brain development, they help to define which cells can join together in functional circuits. Mutations in gap junction proteins can lead to devastating abnormalities in brain function. Experiments will be carried out in a simple animal with a simple brain, the medicinal leech, where interactions between small numbers of well-characterized nerve cells can be explored in greater depth, with diverse experimental approaches and tools. Since critical molecular mechanisms are highly conserved throughout evolution, these studies will advance the general understanding of how nervous systems are built, including those of more complex species, such as mammals. Additionally, leech neurobiology is ideally suited to undergraduate training, offering a strong foundation in molecular and cellular biology and electrophysiology. Student recruitment for this project will focus on Community College transfer students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, during the summer before they enter UCSD, to provide an early exposure to scientific research. Continuing their research experiences during their undergraduate careers, they will contribute to the badly needed increase of well-trained graduates in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe proposed studies will be based on recent findings that indicate that different types and distributions of gap junction proteins can regulate the shape and connectivity of individual leech neurons. Gap junction proteins belong to large gene families that form inter-cellular channels and allow direct exchange of ions and small molecules. Each channel is comprised of six protein subunits, and since many neurons express unique complements of multiple gap junction proteins that can form the channels, a cell's expression profile might function like lock-and-key recognition factors. This project will test how different gap junction proteins can affect the characteristic morphology and connectivity of identified neurons in the leech central nervous system. The expression and function of gap junction proteins will be modulated by gene knockdown and transgene expression in individual developing neurons, and morphological changes will be assayed by digitizing neuronal arbors using confocal microscopy and quantifying branch distribution, number and length. Intracellular dye-tracer injections and electrical recordings will detect changes in their connectivity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis NSF-funded project had two coupled major aims, one in basic research and the second in undergraduate education.  The basic research aspect comprised several explorations of the roles of electrical synapses, one of the major means for communication between nerve cells, in both the formation and function of circuits in the nervous systems of all animals.  In humans, electrical synapses are found in the brain and the eyes and ears, where they have critical roles and a malfunction can lead to neurological disorders, blindness and deafness.  In this project, the laboratory experiments were carried out for the most part by UC San Diego undergraduates, including several participants in the training program described below.  Experiments in which the formation of electrical synapses was modified by modulating the expression of the molecules that make up these synapses were carried out in a very simple model nervous system, that of the medicinal leech, which has been extensively studied in previous projects.  By first characterizing the family of genes that encode these proteins, it was then possible to show that electrical synapses are configured by different combinations of these molecules, and that these combinations are unique and differ for specific nerve cells and determine which cells form each circuit.  A mutation in one of these molecules was shown to disconnect a cell from its normal circuit.  The most significant experimental observations, however, demonstrated that a common signaling molecule, ATP, which is normally found only inside cells, if introduced outside nerve cells, was able to modulate the function of electrical synapses, increasing communication between nerve cells and leading to rhythmic and correlated activity among circuits. Since ATP has been shown to signal outside nerve cells following traumatic physical damage and may play a role in regeneration and repair, these studies were expanded to the identification of genes whose expression changes following nerve trauma  in order to further elucidate repair mechanisms and contribute to a basic understanding of the medical consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nThe parallel educational aspect of this project addressed in part an important deficit in the undergraduate and postgraduate training of a diverse work force in areas of great importance to our society: science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  An increasing proportion (already over 25-30%) of undergraduates are transferring from community colleges to 4-year institutions to complete their undergraduate degrees.  This group contributes in a major way to student body diversity because of its high percentage of individuals from underrepresented groups and first-generation-to-college students. Although many of these transfer students matriculate with the goal of training and continuing in a STEM field, many become discouraged and abandon this goal, and drop out or switch to other areas of study.  An identified key obstacle is a lack of research experience and exposure to the culture of laboratory research, which handicaps transfer students as they navigate the harder and more rigorous courses of a research university like UC San Diego.  The Summer Transfer Ahead Research Training (START) Program was designed and implemented as a key component of this project with the specific aim of initiating the preparation and stewarding of community college students the summer before they transfer.  The START program better equipped students to persevere and succeed in their chosen STEM major, helping them to complete their bachelor degrees and continue to graduate or professional studies.  Of the 32 students who participated in the three summers of the START Program and matriculated at UC San Diego, 31 continued in STEM majors, 24 have completed their undergraduate degrees and are working in Biotech or have entered graduate or professional programs, and 8 are planning to graduate in June 2020.

In recent interviews, 27 of 29 students stated that the START Program had benefitted them, and the other 2 that they had benefitted partially.  Students selected different aspects of the Program as benefitting them academically.  Current efforts to continue this program or one with similar goals of promoting transfer student success in STEM are underway, incorporating improvements suggested by the START participants, and focusing on raising the necessary funds from federal agencies as well as the private sector.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eduardo R Macagno"
