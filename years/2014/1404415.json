The workshop will be held at NSF on December 17th and 18th, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the workshop is to explore the steps to an operational prototype SDN network and to identify the required longer term research. Specific goals also include:\r\n\r\n1. Identifying current capabilities and resources that contribute to development and operation of an SDN prototype network that interoperates seamlessly with the current public Internet\r\n2. Identifying research, resource, and collaboration needs in creating such a system\r\n3. Identifying gaps in operational software tools necessary for running a production, multidomain SDN network\r\n4. Identifying opportunities for SDN virtualized networks to interact with 'clouds' of computation and storage\r\n5. Providing a workshop report to NSF and the other NITRD agencies on needed research and development, resources and collaboration for the prototype system\r\n\r\nSDN is a key emerging technology and is being used to support a number of national priority programs.    Developing a sound basis for inter-carrier SDN will enable the widespread deployment of applications using SDN.",
