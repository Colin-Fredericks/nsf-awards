 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nThe Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis program, working with techniques on the leading edge of measurement technology, supports education and training of physics and electrical engineering undergraduate students in the PI's group, a diverse body including non-traditional and first-generation college students, as well as students from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The PI participates in the CU Denver's Mini-STEM school, the local Caf\u00b4e Scientifique, and a field trip program at a local K-8 magnet school.\r\n\r\nThis award will enable the PI and his students to fulfill specific responsibilities for both SuperCDMS Soudan and SuperCDMS SNOLAB projects, including operations support for SuperCDMS Soudan, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) characterization and testing for SNOLAB, and support during construction and initial commissioning. Planned activities also include a modest R&D effort toward multiplexed SQUID readout, required for the next-generation dark matter direct detection efforts.",
