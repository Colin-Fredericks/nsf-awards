 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the introduction of Expected Utility (EU) the theory of preferences over risk has been an unsettled matter. At the same meeting in 1952 at which Savage presented his proof of EU, introducing the Independence Axiom (IA), Allais was gathering data from the audience on his famous counter-examples to IA.  Since then, countless more rejections of IA have appeared, and many alternative models have gained attention.   Using two contributions from my prior NSF support, Convex Risk Budgets and Uncertainty Equivalents, I show that EU actually performs better than popular alternatives when all outcomes are sufficiently risky, and that the independence axiom is most at peril when some outcomes involve certainty. We are, of course, not the first to notice this, but both of the experiments we have conducted demonstrate this in non-parametric tests, and are not confounded by other model or measurement restrictions. These findings suggest researchers may have \"under-sampled\" certainty, that is, we have spent too little effort exploring how IA breaks down at the edges of the probability space.\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes a series of experiments designed to measure how preferences shift as the environment becomes less risky.  The objective is to collect data necessary to characterize the restrictions on preferences throughout the choice space, and to do so in a completely non-parametric way such that the data are not confounded with framing or modelling assumptions.  I will use these results to fit a new model of preferences which I call a model of Expecting the Unexpected.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded work in four different project areas.\n\n \n\nAltruism: The work on Altruism had three different themes.  First was to broaden the economics thinking on altruism to include the emotional value of the social interaction surrounding giving.  This includes the strength of social pressure to give as a complement to or substitute for the warm-glow of giving.\n\n \n\nI also explored theory and experiments on how people view fairness from both the ex ante and ex post perspectives.  The finding cuts to the foundations of economic theory and moral philosophy by suggesting that people hold both notions of fairness and freely and willfully switch between them.\n\n \n\nFinally, in a reply of sorts to psychological findings of greater altruism of the poor, we show that without taking full account of the full costs and constraints one is unlikely to clearly identify the true preferences of the rich and the poor.\n\n \n\n \n\nCharitable Giving: A series of papers on charitable giving showed that people in communities with more ethnic and religious diversity are less charitable.  We also looked at how time affects willingness to say yes to fundraisers.  We find that even very short delays between saying \"yes\" to a request and then following through with the donation can greatly increase the willingness to give.  \n\n \n\nIn a study of peer effects in the actual provision of a public good, we found that \"economic\" peers were the most influential, that is, people with similar wealth and standing had the greatest influence on each other.\n\n \n\nThe grant also supported the publication of two volumes on charitable giving edited by the PI as well as a policy white paper on tax policy toward charitable giving.\n\n \n\n \n\nRisk and Time Preferences: The PI continued his recent work on risk and time preferences.  The contributions here are largely methodological, finding superior ways to measure both risk and time preferences, and making progress at understanding the connections between the two.\n\n \n\n \n\nInstitutions and Efficiency:  How can institutions naturally arise to take advantage of natural moral and altruistic tendencies of individuals in ways that improve efficiency?  This segment of the PI?s research discussed several natural and simple institutions that can help provide minimal levels of government, or build more simple reputations of merchants in ways that promote efficient levels of cooperation and minimize the problems of moral hazard in markets.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Andreoni"
