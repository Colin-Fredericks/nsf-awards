At the same time, the connection between theoretical models and real world security problems are emphasized to establish the important feedback loop between theory and practice. The conference helps to promote a \"science of security\" with a theoretical foundation that helps us understand security risk in a principled way.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support to allow more students to attend the 2014 conference. Preferences for travel support are based on the credentials of the students, with a focus on attracting women and underrepresented minority students to support their participation in this event.",
