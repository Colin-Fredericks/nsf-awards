 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the diversity and ecological complexity of plants and associated insects in forests across a variable landscape in Brazil. Plants, insects, and their predators make up over half of all known organisms, and their interactions are essential to ecosystem health. This is especially true for tropical forests, where ecologists are only beginning to understand the nature and complexity of these interactions. In particular, little is known about: 1) the diversity of plant chemicals that deter insect herbivory and affect other plants and animals, 2) how diversity of these plant chemicals varies within and between plant species, and 3) how plant chemistry can affect the diversity and productivity of entire forests. Recent advances in chemistry and molecular biology provide the opportunity to understand the diversity of plant-insect interactions at three different levels (chemical, genetic, and taxonomic) with unprecedented scope and depth. These new methods will be integrated and enhanced by a unique team of U.S. and Brazilian scientists to investigate the diversity of insect-plant food webs, how they are shaped by plant chemical defenses and environmental gradients, and how this diversity affects forest stability and productivity. The research will contribute to understanding how large global changes in biodiversity and climate will affect plant-insect-predator interactions, how plant genetic and chemical diversity influences plant-feeding, and how taxonomic and genetic diversity of insect predators can affect control of harmful insects. The comprehensive sampling and methods used in this project will result in the discovery of new species of plants and insects, new biologically active molecules, and are likely to deliver new tools and approaches that have powerful applications in agriculture and medicine. This international and multi-disciplinary research project will have broad impacts by involving K-12 students, science teachers, and citizen scientists. Discoveries will be widely communicated to the public via websites, and scientific and popular publications. \r\n\r\nThis project is focused on a highly diverse system involving plants in the genus Piper (Piperaceae), associated herbivores, and parasitic wasps and flies. The research will utilize cutting edge approaches to studying biodiversity that link measures of interaction diversity to genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and plant chemical diversity involving the following components: 1) Large scale sampling of herbivores and their parasitoids on diverse Piper species across an array of sites to assess effects of abiotic gradients on community structure and ecosystem processes, and to acquire specimens for taxonomic, genomic, and phytochemical analysis. 2) Field experiments where taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversity will be manipulated along with abiotic factors to strengthen inferences from statistical analysis of field surveys, community genetics, and measures of metabolite diversity. 3) Taxonomic and systematic analysis of plants, herbivores, and parasitoids using traditional and novel methods (genomics) to document and describe new taxa, understand their relationships, and reveal cryptic diversity. 4) Population genomic analyses of plants, herbivores, and parasitoids to understand how geography, plant phylogeny and chemistry influence population structure and genetic differentiation across trophic levels. 5) Characterization of metabolite diversity of Piper species; how metabolite diversity varies with phylogeny, ecology, and herbivore pressure; and the effect of phytochemical diversity on higher trophic levels. The combination of quantitative sampling along elevational gradients, newly developed metabolomics methods, population genomics, and a large scale experiment will make possible tests of emerging hypotheses about relationships between plant chemistry, and different dimensions of diversity, and will represent the first large scale, among-site plant-herbivore-parasitoid food-web comparison in the tropics.",

As such, I am responsible for all plant-related parts of the project, including collection and identification of plants, management and storage of vouchers specimens, training other project members in plant identification, selection of plant species for use in experiments, collaboration in establishing experiments, and training of students in plant identification and experiment management.  My report will thus focus on my involvement in these activities.  \n\nThe primary goal of this project was to use sampling at various tropical locations and long-term experiments (1.5-3 years) to better understand how trophic relationships - plants, herbivores, and predators of the herbivores -are structured.  Secondly, we aim to explore the role that genetic variation among plants in a population (and, consequently, the diversity of chemical defenses they produce) has on the generation of species diversity across a latitudinal gradient in the tropics.  Through the course of this project, I organized or participated in trips to a number of sites in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru to collect and identify species of wild black pepper in the genus Piper, with the goal of training students and local project managers on Piper identification, and to help set up our long-term experiments.  During these trips, I trained three graduate students in safe, responsible, and effective field techniques.  Also on these trips, I visited herbaria in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru where I identified and, in the case of one herbarium in Brazil, re-curated their Piper collection.  In all, I have provided, corrected, or updated identifications for over 1000 Piper collections, in addition to the specimens newly collected for this project.  Accurate identifications will increase the accuracy and, consequently, the value of any works that include Piper species.  Working with these collections has been invaluable, and has given me a deeper understanding of several problematic species and species groups within Piper, and I have since updated identifications of many of our project collections.  Piper collections from this project form the basis of two doctoral dissertations, and have contributed to several other dissertations and Master's theses.  \n\nMaterial and data from the long-term experiments mentioned above were collected in 2019, and collaborators at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), and in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru are still processing material.  Thus far, my part of this project has resulted in one publication and two conference presentations.  Two additional articles have been submitted to peer-reviewed journals, but the majority of the output from this grant will come once we have processed and interpreted the data from the experiments.  \n\nAside from training students, collaborators, and volunteers in field techniques and plant identification, the herbarium at the University of Cincinnati (the PI is curator of the herbarium) started a collaboration in 2019 with the office of Advancement and Transition Services (ATS).  ATS works with students and adults with a range of intellectual and developmental disabilities to help them develop skills and realize their potential.  In the herbarium, ATS workers work on imaging specimens for the herbarium database, sort specimens in need of repair or other attention, and mount and file specimens.  The collaboration has, thus far, been extremely positive for all involved.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Tepe"
