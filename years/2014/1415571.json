 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project centers on LiDAR data collection plus water sample analysis following the September 2013 storm in the Colorado Front range.  In areas identified as being most highly impacted, post-storm LiDAR data will be differenced with data collected for the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory three years earlier using the same protocols. The LiDAR will provide a unique data set with which to quantify hillslope and channel change with sufficient spatial resolution to reveal (1) the locations and sizes of hillslope failures and the transport paths of these failures and their depositional zones, and (2) channel changes on all streams including sites of both vertical and lateral scour and deposition. In addition to the LiDAR data analysis, the project will analyze the chemistry of water delivered from the landscape since the first day of the storm. This will enable a quantitative assessment of the sources and transport dynamics of major elements, organic molecules, and isotopes. \r\n\r\nThe long duration, widespread area, and severe magnitude of the storm (70% of mean annual precipitation) is exceptional and provides a rare opportunity to address fundamental questions about the effects of severe storms in a semi-arid mountainous wildland-urban interface. The affected region includes the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Big Thompson River. Since the storm impacted areas burned in recent large wildfires, including the Fourmile Canyon fire of September 2010 in Boulder Creek, the opportunity exists to probe the role of such one-two punches in landscape evolution. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in the project, and the data will be made available to test models of how landscapes respond to rare precipitation events.  In addition, the team plans to infuse storm-related data and insights into its ongoing collaborations with local schools through its K-12 curriculum of the Science Discovery program, and through teaching at the college level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMajor storms like the one that hit the Colorado Front Range in September 2013 can wreak havoc through landslides and flooding.  The impacts of large storms over the long-term are less clear.  Do these cause most of the erosion?  Or do unremarkable mundane processes do this work?  In this project, we used detailed topographic data collected in 2010 and new topographic data collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after the storm to calculate a detailed map of the topographic differences--- the erosion and deposition--- that resulted from the storm.  The resulting map showed the size and locations of 120 landslides and debris flows in a study area of 100 km2.  These data revealed that net erosion of 16-20 mm (0.6-0.8 in) occurred on hillslopes where landslides occurred.  This compares with a long-term background rate of erosion (determined previously) of 0.045 mm/yr (or 0.002 in/yr).  The 2013 storm removed 100s of years worth of sediment from the hillslopes that failed in an instant. \n\nAn outcome of this work is recognition that both the mundane and the rapid processes play important roles in rocky mountainous landscapes.  Landslides were not produced from rock outcrops; rather the landslides initiated in accumulations of sediment (called colluvium) on slopes greater than ~25&deg;.  This simple observation makes it clear that both the mundane and unseen processes of weathering and creep, and the dramatic and rapid processes of landsliding are important in the overall behavior of this landscape.  The weathering and creep processes produce the sediment that is ultimately swept away in major storms.  Understanding the hazards posed by landsliding requires understanding where and how sediment accumulates, as well as the physics of storm-driven landsliding.  There may be interplay between these fast and slow processes if rock-weathering rates are impacted by soil thickness.  Sediment removal by landsliding may speed up weathering, and hence hasten the sediment production needed to initiate the next landslide.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Suzanne P Anderson"
