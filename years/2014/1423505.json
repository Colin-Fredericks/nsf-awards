 "awd_abstract_narration": "Management of today's networks usually requires an army of operators who devote tremendous time and energy. Software-defined networking (SDN) has been shown to be a promising paradigm for simplifying network management. However, management tasks in SDNs require the use of constrained network resources: switch memory and CPU, and the switch-controller network bandwidth. Given these resource constraints, network operators may have to reason about resource usage when initiating network management tasks.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to explore the space of resource management for software-defined network management. Specifically, it will examine the design of virtualized resource pools that provide the abstraction of (nearly) infinite resources (memory, CPU and switch), while dynamically adapting to the resource needs of these network management tasks. This approach has the advantage that network operators do not have to reason about resource usage when instantiating network management tasks. The research will yield resource management algorithms, improved resource usage designs, and systems implementations for virtualized resource pools.\r\n\r\nNetwork operators make billion-dollar investments in network infrastructures, but put little thought into visibility and control of these infrastructures. This project can lead to better-managed, more reliable, and more resource-efficient network infrastructures in ISPs, enterprises and clouds. These efforts eventually will have broader societal impact by enabling commercial, social, and scientific advances. The proposal will give underrepresented groups and undergraduates opportunities to participate in research and will likely result in technology transfer to major cloud providers and ISPs.",
