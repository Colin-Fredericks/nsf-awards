 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Levi M. Stanley of Iowa State University is developing new catalytic methods for the synthesis and functionalization of heterocyclic compounds.  The research involves the development of metal-catalyzed alkene hydroacylation reactions and additions of aldehydes across alkenes, to enable the synthesis and functionalization of nitrogen heterocycles.  This research program encompasses the identification and development of transition-metal catalysts that control regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the alkene hydroacylation reactions.  This award is supporting educational programs led by Professor Stanley to expand the Chemistry Learning Community for upper-level chemistry students to improve retention, achievement, and engagement among chemistry students at Iowa State University and the implementation of an authentic research experience with practical applications through an experimental organic chemistry laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the establishment of alkene hydroacylation reactions as a platform to synthesize, and further functionalize, classes of medicinally important nitrogen heterocycles.  The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of heterocyclic compounds with new and/or improved properties and the identification of catalyst design principles leading to more stable and selective catalyst structures.  The project provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to gain experience in modern synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry research while improving retention, achievement, and engagement through expansion of the Chemistry Learning Community at Iowa State University.",
