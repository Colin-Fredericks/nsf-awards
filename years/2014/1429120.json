 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, building a Cognitive RadiO Multimedia NEtwork Testbed (COMET), investigates research challenges focused on QoE (Quality of Experience) requirements of multimedia applications, supporting new diverse approaches to QoE. The instrument will be used to develop cutting edge protocols and algorithms for the efficient use of limited wireless spectrum in a variety of multidisciplinary multimedia applications to address the challenging multidimensional scientific and engineering problems associated with the field. The protocols and algorithms will be applied to fundamental scientific questions in a wide range of wireless multimedia topics. The COMET platform will help develop methodology and techniques for efficient use of spectral resources and address critical issues related to energy, bandwidth, computing, and reliability for wireless multimedia applications. The work enables the verification and refinement of existing protocols and algorithms, and the development of new ones for different applications. The instrument directly services five projects:\r\n-\tQoE-driven Cross-layer Design for CR Multimedia Networks,\r\n-\tCognitive Radio (CR) Infrastructure-based EV Micro-Grid for Future Power Grid Systems,\r\n-\tPersonalized Health Monitoring for Multimedia eHealth,\r\n-\tSmart Autonomous Fault-Tolerant Environments (SAFE) of Cognitive Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, and\r\n-\tNetworked Distributed Source Coding for Multimedia Sensor Networks.\r\n\r\nThe instrument plays a crucial role in training the next generation of engineers and scientists. Students gain experience in various aspects of multimedia communication and wireless. Undergraduates are integrated into respective research programs, in harmony with the REU site program and college-level undergraduate research incentive program. Training is also offered to a broader body of students at the institution and beyond, and underrepresented students are sought. An undergraduate research program on CR multimedia network is established as well, while disseminating the novel principles and methods of multimedia communication developed.",
