 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world we live in is composed of physical causality. For example, a ball moves towards another ball, the balls collide, and both roll in opposite directions. Children must form models or theories of causation to understand how the world works. Cross-cultural psychologists and social anthropologists have found that causal models are culturally influenced. In particular, individuals from western cultures engage in an analytic style of reasoning, and place a greater emphasis on a focal object, whereas individuals from East Asian cultures engage in a holistic style of reasoning, and take into account the relationship(s) between the object and its context. While cultural differences in physical causal models have been studied in adults, developmental psychologists have not yet explored when in childhood they emerge. In collaboration with Dr. Zhu at the Chinese Academy of Sciences this project will explore the influence of culture on the development of physical causal reasoning in American and Chinese 4- and 6-year-olds.  \r\n\r\nChildren from the two cultures will be shown covariation patterns that contain a focal object that either sticks or does not stick to a contextual object. Covariation information will be manipulated to imply that either the focal or contextual object causes the sticking. Following observation, children will be asked to explain why the objects stuck or did not stick. Explanations will be coded as referencing contextual or focal factors, and compared across cultures and ages.  Researchers hypothesize an age by culture interaction. Specifically they predict that 4-year-olds will be more sensitive to covariation patterns than 6-year-olds, and provide explanations reflecting the information they observed. Six-year-olds, on the other hand, will be more likely to disregard the covariation evidence and instead provide explanation types consistent with their cultures. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.",

Since returning to the U.S., collaborators at the host institution in China have collected 110 additional data points.  Data collection is ongoing, however a subset of that data has been coded and analyzed and is presented below. \n\nFour-and 6-year-old American (current N=161) and Chinese (current N=214) children are included in this analysis.  First we tested the hypothesis that covariation evidence influences children\u00c6s causal attributions.  Across cultures and ages children\u00c6s responses were significantly different in the doll and control conditions, suggesting that all children were sensitive to covariation evidence when it implied that the doll object was the cause of the sticking. Contextual, or toy, covariation evidence did not significantly alter children\u00c6s attributions. Children provided compariable answers in the control and toy conditions. \n\nSecond, we tested the hypothesis that a bias towards dispositional or contextual causal attributions develops differentially across cultures. The data does not support this hypothesis. There were no cultural differences in the overall number of dispositional or contextual explanations provided by children at the different ages.\n\nThird, we tested the hypothesis that attention to covariation evidence shifts differentially across development and cultures.
