The conference is scheduled to be held January 11-16, 2015 in Galveston, Texas. The main objective of this proposal is to support participation at the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Heat Transfer. The proposed conference is the first of its kind for the heat transfer community and will help accelerate ideas and disseminate fundamental knowledge in the scientific frontier pertinent to thermal processes. The community will be able to identify and develop strategies to better focus future research efforts, develop a clear vision about research needs, learn about recent research developments, and identify research shortcomings. This newly established GRC will address emerging challenges in phase-change heat transfer and identify new opportunities by establishing a cohesive multi-disciplinary community consisting of researchers in heat transfer, chemistry, material science, and interfacial science. The organizers are taking special initiatives to recruit speakers and other attendees from under-representative groups. \r\n\r\nThe topics of the GRC will focus on the fundamental modes of liquid vapor phase change in combination with surface structures, and the opportunities provided by a new class of experimental heat transfer and metrology methodology, theoretical and numerical thermal science, surface science and chemistry, materials, and flow manipulation. Although various general conferences in heat transfer exist, the phase change related topics are often interspersed within the large conference program. This set up does not allow for detailed technical discussions and the inclusion of researchers from related fields. The proposed conference will bridge this gap between heat transfer experts with others from important relevant disciplines. In addition, the significant time allotted for discussions will foster collaborations amongst diverse researchers to rapidly accelerate understanding.",
