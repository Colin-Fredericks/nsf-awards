 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes facilitation activities for a Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Engineer at the University of Oklahoma (OU). Building on the success of recent leadership activities at OU in CI and leveraging related activities elsewhere in the country in research and educational facilitation in campus-based computational research support, this project addresses: Data-Intensive Research Facilitation, including utilizing Software Defined Networking across OU's research network;  leading and facilitating adoption of a campus level engineering engagement model and approach across Oklahoma; a national training regime, providing a \"virtual residency\" program for campus CI engineers and facilitators; and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), fostering undergraduate research at OU by integrating REU sites and supplements into STEM research, including by all research teams on this project.\r\n\r\nThis project has been designed to enable transformative research across STEM disciplines, including weather prediction (real time forecasting, warn on-forecast and data mining of forecasts), high energy physics, weather radar, ecological informatics, and research on advanced networking, supporting over 200 researchers (undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, staff and faculty).",
