The emphasis is on protection of radio astronomy frequencies against encroachment by industry and governments throughout the world. \r\n\r\nThe school will provide a comprehensive overview of both technical and regulatory issues related to radio astronomers' use of the spectrum. In the past few decades demands on the spectrum have increased substantially due to increases in the demand and availability of wireless applications.  Spectrum management is an importance task for radio astronomy as well as for other radio services, but it is not part of any academic curriculum. The IUCAF Spectrum Management School provides an introduction to a unique combination of technology, science and international diplomacy by experts in this field.  Radio astronomers interested in pursuing this area will get valuable training via this school; the broader impact of this proposal lies in this training.",
