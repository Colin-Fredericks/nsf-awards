 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) the feasibility of an anticipated enhancement of mechanical properties for piezoelectric polymeric bundles of nanofibers will be explored. Piezoelectric materials are responsive materials that generate mechanical stress in response to an applied electric field (or vice versa). The premise for the concept is that electrostatic interactions can enhance load transfer between piezoelectric fibers in a yarn, thereby potentially increasing the strength and toughness of the yarn. This finding could impact applications in aerospace and automotive industries where fiber-reinforced composites are used for their high strength and light weight features. This research effort will serve as a platform to train the future workforce for STEM fields with focus on nanotechnology and materials engineering.   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to experimentally demonstrate the magnitude of internal long-range electrostatic interactions between deformation-induced piezoelectric charges toward enhancing the mechanical properties of fibrous synthetic yarns. The planned approach is based on the premise that the electrostatic interactions between piezoelectrically-induced charges in hierarchical structures can considerably enhance load-transfer between fibers of the yarn. The piezoelectric enhancement of mechanical properties is potentially significant, and may impact the design of high performance structural materials through systematic engineering of piezoelectric behavior. This research is inspired by toughness mechanisms in bone and potential role of piezoelectric effect of collagen fibrils in bone's remarkable mechanical properties. As such, demonstration of piezoelectric augmentation of mechanical properties in a synthetic material may provide new insight into mechanics of natural materials. Toward the goal, polymeric (polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric membranes and yarns will be fabricated via electrospinning process and poled via electromechanical treatment. The piezoelectric properties of the nanofibers and the mechanical properties of the yarns will be measured as a function of poling conditions.",

In piezoelectric thin films, we realized that favorable dipole interactions takes place when films are oriented in the same direction. While initially the dipoles can be shielded by mobile charges, when films placed together, the mobile charges will likely migrate to the surface (away from the interface of films) leading to attractive electrostatic interactions between the two films.

This capability allowed us to systematically study the role of piezoelectric charges on mechanics of ribbons. We realized that a loss in piezoelectric properties correlates with a loss in storage energy, indicating the contribution of piezoelectric charges and their interaction to energy dissipation in ribbons (Figure attached). Moreover, the yarns with significantly lower porosity than ribbons demonstrated a few times more energy dissipation and strength (compared to ribbons), another indication of the contribution of piezoelectric dipole-dipole interactions to load transfer between nanofibers. This effect was further elucidated via analytical models, in which energy dissipation in yarns in between electrostatic charges was quantified. Moreover, by investigating the evolution of crystallization in PVDF-TrFE nanofibers via techniques such as XRD and piezo-force microscopy and correlating that with mechanical properties of individual nanofibers, we have presented evidence which suggests that the formation of the crystalline phase and orientation of the within the crystalline phase during annealing are driven by the electrostatic interactions between piezoelectric dipoles (Figure attached).</p>\n<p>The broader impact of the project included the followings:</p>\n<p>a.
