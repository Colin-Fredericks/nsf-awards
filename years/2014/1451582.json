For over fifty years, the CDC has been the world?s leading annual forum for scientific and engineering researchers who share an interest in systems and control theory and the foundations of systems and control technology. As in previous years, the 53rd CDC will feature the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, as well as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops. \r\n\r\nThe range of topics covered at the annual CDC is extremely broad, mirroring the varied applications of control and systems theory. The systems theoretic approaches have played a critical role in the development of many contemporary infrastructures and technology affecting everyday life. Systems and control theoretic tools are central in the design, operation, and security of cyber-physical systems, where they can inform engineers about ways to control large networks such as power systems, communications systems and traffic management. \r\n\r\nThe conference will afford a unique opportunity for students to interact with members of the professional community in a stimulating setting, and to exchange ideas with a broad group of colleagues. The large number of workshops before the conference and the interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional opportunity for training and learning. Outreach effort will be devoted to advertising the conference and the student travel award program to under-represented minorities.",
