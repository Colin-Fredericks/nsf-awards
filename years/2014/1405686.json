The Wasatch Topology conference is focused on topology and geometry, including interactions with ergodic theory and dynamical systems. Each conference presents the work of eight speakers to an audience of primarily local research mathematicians and graduate students. Funds from this award also support the participation of non-local mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe Wasatch Topology Conference allows mathematicians from around the United States the opportunity to gather and share their results with a larger audience of experts and junior researchers. Research opportunities will be created through interactions among the conference participants.\r\n\r\nThe current website for the Wasatch Topology Conference is\r\n\r\nhttp://www.math.utah.edu/wtc/",
