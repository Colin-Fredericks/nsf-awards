 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on prior work in motivation, this project is collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data to improve the capability to characterize and explain key characteristics of student motivation in diverse undergraduate courses required for engineering education. This project is engaging instructors in the process of interpreting student motivation data, coupling these research data to motivation theory and course design, and developing course revisions aimed at enhancing STEM students' intrinsic drive.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis research rests on prior research that shows that instructors can directly influence student motivation, particularly intrinsic motivation, through their course design decisions.  To capitalize on the potential of this relationship, instructors need both a more nuanced understanding of the types of student motivations for learning and access to clearer methods for translating theory and empirical data to course-level insights.  This project is measuring individual student responses to diverse STEM environments, pedagogies, and assignments.  The temporal evolution of these responses is a focal point in the development of transferable research and generalizable theories for STEM student motivational drive.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of motivation data in more nuanced ways examines general trends in motivation by course activity, year of study, and gender.  Motivation is dynamic and susceptible to frequent and sometimes rapid change.  The analysis uses group-based clustering techniques to discover the strength, persistence, and distribution of different types of motivational responses.  It employs qualitative analyses to explain the relationships between motivation and the learning environment and elucidate gendered differences in motivation. Using both variable- and cluster-based analyses in multiple course analyses has promise in developing better understanding of the impact of instructional design on effective practice.  \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS\r\nThe National Academy of Engineering exhorts us to prepare STEM graduates with \"the tools needed for the world as it will be, not as it is today.\"  Among these tools are creativity, critical thinking, resiliency, flexibility, and self-regulation. Educational research suggests that improved understanding of learner motivation is important to facilitate a systemic shift toward these high-level outcomes. However, a large gap remains between the research-based understanding of student motivation, and the application of those research insights to day-to-day classroom practice. \r\n\r\nThe output from this project will have an immediate impact on over 20 STEM instructors at the 8 participating institutions, by highlighting activities that prompt different motivational responses and motivational shifts, explaining motivation-environment interactions, and by enabling instructors to use research data to make informed and strategic choices to better encourage self-determined behaviors. The project expands the pool of STEM faculty who can make informed, data-driven decisions by engaging early-career faculty and those with limited prior involvement in STEM educational reform.",

An important research-to-practice goal of this project was to prototype, test, and disseminate new tools that boost STEM instructors&rsquo; understanding of student motivations, and enable educators to create curricula that promote intrinsic drive in learning. We focused our attention on <em>situational </em>motivations, which describe why students engage in specific activities in a given course, as opposed to more general motivations toward learning or college.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To characterize students&rsquo; situational motivations, we deployed surveys in a wide range of undergraduate STEM courses, and used quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze students&rsquo; responses. Our quantitative dataset includes over 5000 unique survey responses from ~1200 students enrolled in 40 STEM courses across 10 institutions. The qualitative dataset includes biweekly responses from over 100 students in 10 different courses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit. </em></strong>Our study produced several significant findings. First, we showed that motivation is complex: students are not simply &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; or &ldquo;not motivated,&rdquo; and they do not engage in learning for purely intrinsic or extrinsic reasons. Rather, students express multiple forms of motivation at the same time, e.g., a student might feel external pressure to perform well on an assignment while also feeling an internal sense of value in the assignment. Our quantitative analyses indicate six common types of situational motivational responses (Figures 1-2), while our qualitative data further characterizes and explains the potential underlying reasons for such responses. Understanding these more complex motivation signals is important for course design, as it enables instructors to more accurately define why students engage in STEM activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, our study revealed that pedagogy plays a critical role in shaping student motivation. Compared to traditional teaching approaches (e.g., lecture), active approaches (e.g., discussion- and project-based learning (PjBL)) support more positive student motivations based on enjoyment, interest, and internalized value (Figure 3). Our observation that students find intrinsic drive in discussion-based courses holds promise for instructors who wish to support positive motivations but find it difficult to fully shift their courses to PjBL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third, we found significantly different motivations between women and men in STEM courses, and these differences are tied to pedagogy as well as students&rsquo; sense of faculty care. Traditional environments (e.g., lectures, problem sets) disadvantage women from a motivational standpoint, while non-traditional pedagogies (e.g., PjBL) support balanced motivations by gender, and generally more positive motivations for all students (Figure 4).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fourth, our longitudinal analyses illustrate that students&rsquo; motivations can be dynamic (Figure 5). In a given course, students might report a wide range of responses, from highly positive to highly negative; and the more students report their motivations, the more variation we see in the signal. The use of qualitative methods enabled us to develop new frameworks to describe the effects of personal and environmental factors on motivational shifts, and to explain and contextualize the dynamic motivational responses (Figure 6).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts.</em></strong>&nbsp; This study attained broader impacts through the generation of both research insights and practical course design tools. Our analyses provide further evidence of the value of student-centered pedagogies to learners. Prior educational research often cites <em>cognitive</em> benefits of non-traditional pedagogies, but our study illustrates clear <em>motivational</em> benefits of active learning through discussions or projects. The knowledge that women, in particular, find more internalized value and interest in non-traditional environments, where they may actively engage and where faculty care may be more visible, is an important insight for the broader community. This gender-specific finding has fueled discussions with educators about implementing more active pedagogies to support engagement of a diverse STEM community.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A particularly powerful concept that emerged from this study is that student motivations are complex and temporally dynamic, and not simply &ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; or &ldquo;extrinsic.&rdquo; Our study provided tools for instructors to <em>characterize</em> the types and variations of students&rsquo; motivations, <em>explain </em>the motivations based on pedagogical or classroom variables, and <em>design </em>new experiences to improve motivational outcomes. Our description of common &ldquo;motivational response types&rdquo; enables instructors to quickly graph students&rsquo; responses from different course activities. Connecting these graphs to motivation theory enables instructors to <em>explain</em> the responses and diagnose problems. Equipping instructors with motivation-related design tools enables more effective course design. Over the funding period, we engaged ~800 educators in hands-on workshops aimed at <em>designing for intrinsic motivations</em>. The workshops included faculty from college STEM, medicine, design, business, arts, social science and humanities programs as well as K-12 educators. The disciplinary background and educational level diversity of our workshop participants provides compelling evidence that our methods and design tools for situational motivation can transcend disciplinary boundaries, and attain far-reaching impacts across multiple domains.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;D&nbsp;Gross</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1445950/1445950_10274041_1511987550887_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1445950/1445950_10274041_1511987550887_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1445950/1445950_10274041_1511987550887_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">J.
