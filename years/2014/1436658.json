 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding customer preferences and needs is critically important in developing successful products. This award supports an interdisciplinary research to develop a data-driven mathematical approach for analyzing and predicting consumer preferences in design of sustainable engineering products, such as alternative fuel vehicles and smart appliances.  The relations among customers and products are conceptualized as a complex network and analyzed using network theory and techniques. This study will help industry produce more competitive products in shorter time to market. The findings will contribute to the development of new techniques for analyzing large complex networks.  Workshop and panel sessions on analyzing customers and products as networks will be organized for dissemination to a broader community.  Research will be integrated with education through interdisciplinary undergraduate Design Certificate and graduate Design Cluster programs.\r\n \r\nAnalytical modeling of customer preferences in product design is inherently difficult as it faces challenges in modeling heterogeneous human behavior and product offerings. The novelty of the research lies in the employment of a Multidimensional Customer-Product Network (MCPN) framework, where separate networks of \"customers\" and \"products\" are simultaneously modeled, and multiple types of relations, such as consideration and purchase, product associations, and customer social networks are considered. The research will extend the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework for analyzing multidimensional customer-product relations and predicting unknown customer preferences (consideration or choice) under new design scenarios. Social influences on adopting \"green\" technology are analyzed in the same framework. Our approach overcomes the limitations of the traditional statistical analysis and utility-based preference modeling by considering the dependency among product choices and the social influence induced \"irrationality\" of customer behavior.  We will also explore the use of text analysis of customer-generated data in social media thereby creating crowdsourced \"virtual labs\" for advancing data analytics and computational social science in product design.",

As a critical link between market research and engineering product development, customer preference models can quantitatively capture the interrelationship amongst market demand, engineering design attributes, and customer demographics. Aggregate choice models simply divide customers into groups with similar demographic profiles and neglect the individual heterogeneities in decision-making. Disaggregate approaches such as Discrete Choice Analysis (DCA) have been widely studied in recent years by the engineering design research community to model individual customer?s preference for choice/demand estimation in product design. Even though DCA is good at modeling individual heterogeneity, it assumes individuals make decision choices in a vacuum. Hence it is limited in dealing with the dependency of product alternatives, the social influence among customers, the correlation of their decisions, and the collinearity of product attributes. To address these limitations, we propose a social network analysis approach to model and predict complex customer-product relations.</p>\n<p>The objective of our research is to develop a multidimensional network analysis (MNA) approach for analyzing and predicting complex customer-product relations in supporting engineering design decisions.

Beyond the traditional network descriptive analysis, we employ the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework for analyzing multiple relations in MCPN to support engineering design decisions. Our approach broadens the traditional utility-based logit approaches by considering the dependency among product choices and the ?irrationality? of customer behavior induced by social influence. We then developed a unidimensional network approach to study the impact of both exogenous effect (e.g., products? attributes and customers? demographics) and endogenous effect (e.g., existing market competition structures) on products? co-consideration relations in supporting engineering design decisions. Customers? choice decisions often involve two stages during which customer considers a subset of available products on the market first, and then makes the final choice from the subset. We proposed a two-stage network-based modeling approach to study customers? consideration and choice behaviors in a separate but integrated manner. Using buyer survey data in the 2013 China auto market for demonstration, our results suggest that the factors that influence customers? consideration of products in the consideration stage differ from those that influence their final purchase decision in the choice stage, validating the need for two-stage modeling.</p>\n<p>The results of our study have a direct impact on understanding complex customer-product relations in engineering design.
