 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic mechanical spectroscopy allows measuring mechanical properties of materials at different speeds. It is a popular technique for studying soft material such as polymers. However, because of several intrinsic problems, this technique has not been extended to study the properties of biological cells as of yet. Besides fundamental interest, the study of cell mechanics makes a practical impact in understanding mechanical changes of cells in various diseases, like cancer, malaria, Alzheimer, and even aging. However, most   cell studies were done for their static properties. While the changes in dynamic mechanical properties of cells are expected to be much richer, the existing attempts to measure cell dynamic properties have been very limited, and the results are controversial. This award supports fundamental research to provide knowledge needed for the development of a new quantitative technique to perform dynamic mechanical measurements of cells.  The new method has the potential to revolutionize the study of cell mechanics. In general, it will also bring a new dimension to the study of the mechanics of biomaterials and nanocomposites at the nanoscale. It will expand the knowledge base to a scale of resolutions previously inaccessible. A translational part will include investigation of biomechanics of cancer cells. This application can build the foundation for nanomechanical applications in healthcare, which can benefit the U.S. society by saving billions of dollars through the early detection of cancer. The research will combine physics, biology, electronics, and nanotechnology. This multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact mechanical and biomedical engineering education.\r\n\r\nDynamic mechanical spectroscopy deals with the storage and loss moduli of materials which are the least model dependent quantities. While this method is standard for soft material, excessive time of measurements and low resolution preclude its use from obtaining reliable moduli on biological cells. In addition, cells are complex composite objects. This research will combine fast Fourier spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to improve the speed and spatial resolution of dynamic mechanical spectroscopy. The improvement is expected to be more than 100x in speed and 100x in the resolution compared to the existing methods.  The research team will apply this method to develop an appropriate viscoelastic cell model, in particular, taking into account pericellular brush, an important cellular organelle which dynamical mechanical properties are yet to be discovered. The obtained knowledge will be applied to study biomechanics of human cervical and breast cancer cells.",

Besides fundamental importance, a large practical interest has recently emerged. Abnormal cell elasticity has been implicated in the development of many diseases, including vascular and kidney diseases, cancer, malaria, cataracts, Alzheimer, complications of diabetes, cardiomyopathies, and even aging. It was also discovered that the spreading of cancer cells may change by the application of external forces. Although dynamical mechanical spectroscopy exists for large-scale measurements, it was not developed for sub-cellular scales and for forces which are gentle enough not to destroy cells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intellectual merit, the new knowledge generated:</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here we have successfully developed a new technique to perform dynamic mechanical measurements of cells. It is which an add-on to existing atomic force microscopes. We call it ?Fourier transform ?nano dynamical mechanical analyzer? (FT-NanoDMA). Compared to the current state-of-the-art,&nbsp; this technique has demonstrated 100x improvement in the speed of the measurements and 100x improvement in the spatial resolution (such an increase is comparable to the transition from optical to electron microscopy of soft materials).</p>\n<p>Working with atomic force microscopy, we unexpectedly discovered a new mode of operation, which we call Ringing mode. This mode provides previously inaccessible information regarding the composition of samples, distribution of their mechanical properties over the sample. It allows simultaneous collection of 8 new physical sample properties (8-dimensional imaging!). In addition, it is almost 20x faster compared to the rival modes. The faster speed is particularly important for future clinical implementation of this technique, which is our strategic goal.</p>\n<p>One of the goals of the grant was the study of mechanical properties of cells during their progression to cancer. Here we have discovered substantial changes of mechanics of the pericellular layer (a brush-like layer surrounding cells) during progression to cancer. Previously, the mechanical contribution of this layer was neglected. This study opens a new direction in the study of cell mechanics in general. For example, for neuronal cells, we found that the previously measured speed dependence of cell elasticity was entirely due to the pericellular layer rather than the cell body. Different pericellular layer means different filtering of anticancer drugs reaching cells. This opens a new direction to attack this cancer.</p>\n<p>Another substantial result achieved within this grant is the discovery of emerging fractal geometry on the surface of cells during their progression to cancer. &nbsp;Fractals are a self-repetition of the same patterns at different scales, which are frequently associated with chaos. It was known that the cancerous tissue is described with fractal geometry while the normal tissue is not. It was believed that a similar behavior should be observed for cells when they become cancerous. However, we found that the cell surface can be reasonably approximated with fractal geometry but only at the stage of transforming cells from precancerous into cancerous. Contrary to the previously hypothesized presence of fractal geometry of cancer cells, cells substantially deviated from fractals when in either normal or cancerous stages. These results may potentially bring a new strategy to detect cancer.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Products of this project</span>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under this grant support, we have already generated:</li>\n<li>21 peer-reviewed publications&nbsp; (including, 1 in Nature Methods, 1 in PNAS, 2 in Scientific Reports, 1 invited title page for Nanomedicine), 1 published in the popular literature, 5 manuscripts are in preparation; </li>\n<li>1 patent awarded and 2 filed; </li>\n<li>2 technologies were transferred and already commercialized (Ringing mode and FTR-NanoDMA),</li>\n<li>43 conference presentations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3 new course curricula were enriched with these research results (?Forces at the Nanoscale? and ?Introduction to Scanning Probe Microscopy?, ?Mechanics at the Micro- and Nano- scale).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader impact: </span></p>\n<p>The developed techniques will bring new dimensions to the study of the mechanics of biomaterials and nanocomposite materials at the nanoscale.
