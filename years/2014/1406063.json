 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aggression is a widespread naturally-occurring behavior serving a range of adaptive functions including access to mates and resources. Testosterone produced by the gonads is frequently associated with high levels of aggression. However, in seasonal breeding animals aggression can be both intense and widespread during the non-breeding season when testosterone levels are undetectable.  This means that aggression is regulated by more than one mechanism and there is little understanding of how non-breeding aggression is regulated. This research seeks to understand the physiological mechanisms that underlie seasonal variation of aggression using female Siberian hamsters as a model. This work is highly integrative and unlike most other studies that examine single factors it will consider many relevant endocrine parameters and their interactions to understand how the brain and hormones function to control seasonal aggression in females. These studies will provide important insights into the physiological mechanisms mediating aggression, and social behavior more broadly. Additionally, this proposal will allow for the continued mentorship of undergraduates and high school students in research directly related to this work. Communication of these research findings will include public lectures and scientific conferences, and journal articles, as well as specialized regional symposia and organizations focused on the advancement of underrepresented minorities in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe researchers' data so far show that melatonin, the hormonal signal encoding photoperiod, drives seasonal changes in aggression, and further that adrenal hormones, such as DHEA, rather than gonadal hormones, may indirectly regulate aggression via conversion to active androgens or estrogens during periods when animals are non-reproductive. To examine seasonal switching from a gonadal to adrenal source of hormone, the proposed research tests the hypotheses that DHEA mediates non-breeding season aggression and that melatonin regulates DHEA release and its conversion to active hormones, which can then act on neural receptors. Specific Aim 1 will link seasonal changes in aggression and seasonal melatonin cues to neural receptor profiles (androgen and estrogen receptors) as well as a converting enzyme (aromatase, the enzyme that converts T to estradiol), via immunocytochemistry. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether changes in DHEA levels predict aggression among individuals across seasons by challenging animals in different photoperiods with ACTH, and assessing DHEA release. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that short-day increases in melatonin mediate seasonal changes in DHEA by isolating the adrenal gland from other organs responsible for DHEA release and by using an in vitro bioassay to address localized action of melatonin on this organ and its subsequent production of DHEA. Collectively, the proposed work takes a whole organism approach and examines direct hormonal action on multiple tissues to determine the mechanisms underlying seasonal aggression in female hamsters using multiple levels of analysis. To facilitate proper storage and access of data, manuscripts will be published in open-access format, when possible, and on the lab website. Presentations will be made at international and national conferences, as well as in local venues to lay audiences, including high schools.  Following processing of samples for the primary project, samples will be archived, and made accessible for collaborations from interested parties. Lastly, the PI will work with Indiana University Information Technology Services to archive data on the Research Data Complex (RDC), a dedicated server for hosting databases.",

Within a seasonal context, I manipulated ambient day length (photoperiod) and melatonin, the biochemical signal that &ldquo;codes&rdquo; day length, to induce variation in aggressive phenotypes across multiple stages of the seasonal reproductive cycle of female Siberian hamsters (<em>Phodopus sungorus</em>). I quantified aspects of seasonal reproductive phenotypes including target tissue histology and distribution of receptors, hormonal profiles and steroid metabolism. Subsequently, I quantified adrenal hormone responsivity to social and endocrine challenges to determine whether different stimuli induce distinct modes of steroid conversion across seasons (i.e., photoperiod). By implementing these manipulations I addressed how changes in behavior are associated with hormonal interactions with target tissues at a level of detail that is rarely studied.</p>\n<p>This allowed me to construct a neuroendocrine profile of seasonality and subsequently connect these individual parameters to aggression across time (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). Physiological factors ultimately directly modulate aggression; therefore, I was able to postulate an integrative model of how the variation in aggression across seasons is regulated by the environment, hormones from varying sources and target tissues. Across long days (light 16h:dark 8h) and short days (light 8h: dark 16h), different melatonin profiles are produced. These melatonin profiles modulate many physiological systems, including reproduction, and although not as well studied, those that are associated with aggression. During long days, hormones are produced predominantly from a gonadal source and during short days, the body undergoes a &lsquo;seasonal switch&rsquo; via melatonin, in which hormones are then produced primarily from an adrenal source. Adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is higher in short days than long days and conversely, circulating 17b -estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) is lower in short days than long days. DHEA can act on the brain by serving as a prohormone during short days and be converted to active androgens and estrogens, which can bind to their respective receptors (i.e., androgen receptors, AR; estrogen receptors, ER). There is a seasonal shift in modes of metabolism, an adrenal source (i.e., DHEA) in short days and a gonadal source in long days (i.e., E<sub>2</sub>). Concomitant with these changes in endocrine function are the site-specific changes in estrogen receptors (i.e., ER&alpha;) in brain regions associated with aggression (i.e., bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, BnST; lateral septum, LS; and periaqueductal gray, PAG), but not reproduction (i.e., arcuate nucleus, ARC; anteroventral periventricular nucleus, AVPV; and preoptic area, POA), decoupling the effects of reproduction and aggression during short days. Taken together, the data from this project suggest that short-day increases in aggression in female Siberian hamsters appear to be facilitated by a combination of a &lsquo;seasonal switch&rsquo; in hormone source, seasonal changes in steroid sensitivity in the brain, metabolism of adrenal prohormones into active steroids and melatonin as a primary mediator of these different neuroendocrine mechanisms across seasons. These data offer insights into the patterns and processes by which natural selection can and has altered organismal responses on a seasonal timeframe as well as during social encounters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/06/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nikki&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rendon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1406063/1406063_10324619_1473178425063_LDSDconceptualmodel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1406063/1406063_10324619_1473178425063_LDSDconceptualmodel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1406063/1406063_10324619_1473178425063_LDSDconceptualmodel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Theoretical model based on data from this project of neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying seasonal changes in aggression in female Siberian hamsters.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nikki Rendon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nikki&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rendon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
