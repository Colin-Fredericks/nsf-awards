Over the last decade, there has been enormous progress in Iwasawa theory and the study of Galois representations fueled by advances in the p-adic variation of automorphic forms (e.g. the proofs of the Main Conjecture of modular forms and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture along with recent developments in attaching Galois representations to automorphic forms).\r\n\r\nIn this conference, experts will lecture on the most recent developments and applications relating to p-adic variation to bring the participants of the conference up to date in this quickly evolving field. Many young researchers will participate. Some of the conference's lectures will be delivered by recent PhDs. In addition, funding will be provided to over 50 graduate students and recent PhDs in total, to be selected through an application process. Special attention will be given to any applications received from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nConference website:  math.bu.edu/Glennfest/Glennfest.html",

Many young researchers and graduate students in number theory in the US were first introduced to the subject through PROMYS.   Honoring Glenn Stevens with a large research conference was a fitting tribute to his 60th birthday.  \n\nDuring the conference, there were 25 talks over the five days of the conference.  Between talks, coffee breaks were held in a large open space in which participants could congregate.  There was also a banquet held in honor of Glenn Stevens' contributions.  We were able to provide funding to 64 postdocs and graduate students for travel and/or housing.  \n\nThe response to the conference was overwhelming.  The lecture hall was filled to capacity, and almost all potential speakers we contacted agreed to speak.  We heard world experts Barry Mazur and Michael Harris explain the huge impact of Stevens' work in their talks.  We also learned of the latest contributions from a variety of junior researchers, postdocs, and graduate students.  At the conference banquet, dozens of people of all ages gathered to share their stories of how Stevens affected their mathematical and personal lives. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jared Weinstein"
