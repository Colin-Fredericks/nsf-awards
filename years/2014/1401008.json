 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prime numbers have fascinated people for millennia because of their orderly definition but unpredictable behavior. It is only recently, in the past few decades, that primes have proved useful in cryptography, where it is often important to generate large primes. For instance, one can program a computer to find the first prime with 100 digits. Knowing how long this takes in general amounts to studying the distribution of the prime numbers. This distribution is intimately connected to properties of the Riemann zeta function, the most basic example of a so-called L-function. The PI will study many of the statistical properties of the Riemann zeta function and other more general L-functions. \r\n\r\nThis project will study analytic properties of L-functions and automorphic forms. For instance, the PI plans to study the quantum unique ergodicity conjecture in some new contexts such as in higher rank and along an arbitrary curve. The PI has had prior success for the Eisenstein series restricted to a particular geodesic in the upper half plane. These problems fit into the general setting of how eigenfunctions of the Laplacian behave as the eigenvalue grows large, a topic of great interest in geometry, mathematical physics, etc. However, in the arithmetical setting these problems are related to quantitative analytic properties of L-functions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research conducted on this project concerns the analytic behavior of L-functions and automorphic forms.  L-functions are mathematical objects that encode a wide array of arithmetical properties.  For instance, the simplest L-function, called the Riemann zeta function, has properties that are related to the distribution of the prime numbers amongst the collection of all positive integers.\n\nOne theme of research of this project is on moments of L-functions, especially moments that are one larger than a certain natural boundary inherent in the problem.  With Eren Mehmet Kiral, the PI obtained a bound on the fifth moment of certain automorphic L-functions.  The fourth moment is a natural boundary.  In this way, one obtains a better upper bound on an individual L-function.  With Ian Petrow,  the PI obtained a bound on a cubic moment of a different (but related) family of automorphic L-functions.  In this case, the second moment is a natural barrier.  This result has applications to understanding how many solutions certain quadratic equations have, especially the case of quadratic forms in three variables.\n\nAnother theme of research concerns the behavior of automorphic forms.  Automorphic forms are a different class of mathematical objects whose properties are responsible for much of our understanding of L-functions. With Junehyuk Jung, the PI showed that a certain family of Eisenstein series, which is a particularly interesting class of automorphic forms, often changes sign.  In a later solo work, the PI analyzed the behavior of the Eisenstein series when restricted to certain curves.  This line of research is part of the area called arithmetical quantum chaos, which studies the high energy limit of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian.\n\nAs part of the PI's broader impact activities, he mentored REU students each summer over the award period.  These REU students engaged in meaningful research on problems related to the PI's research (often involving the zero sets of automorphic forms).  Many of these research projects resulted in publications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew Young"
