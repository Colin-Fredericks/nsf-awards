 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will analyze the systematics and revise the taxonomy of onchidiid slugs (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Pulmonata). Onchidiid slugs are unique within gastropods for their ecological diversity - including species that live in the sea, fresh water, and on land. As such, research on Onchidiidae will provide a unique opportunity for this project to study general evolutionary transitions between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and between closely related species. Total species diversity and distribution are currently unknown (147 species have been described worldwide, most of which in the tropical Indo-West Pacific), and will be documented here with a new taxonomic revision based on both morphological and molecular data. Field expeditions will provide fresh material for systematic and ecological analyses. Results will be published as articles and monographic revisions, as well as taxonomic identification keys.\r\n\r\nResearch and education will be integrated through a series of innovative activities involving undergraduate students from the host institution. One PhD student and at least two undergraduate students will be trained in field collecting, anatomical dissection, Scanning Electron Microscopy, molecular systematics, and theoretical issues in taxonomy. Enhanced onchidiid systematics will be beneficial to scientists from different fields - for example, physiologists using onchidiids as a model to study photoreception, and conservation biologists using onchidiid slugs as a keystone indicator of the diversity and ecology of heavily-threatened coastal habitats.",

There are now 120 species, more than half of which are new to science. Species diversity has been investigated through an integrative approach, using both DNA sequences and anatomy for every single species. Complete revisions of an entire group including more than 100 species are rare because, usually, some species are missing in data sets. Thanks to an extraordinary amount of time spent in the field, all known species of Onchidiidae are represented in the data set built during this award. The natural history of every single species was also thoroughly documented with new, first-hand, field observations. As a result, species can now be easily and reliably re-identified using various tools, such as color of live animals and DNA sequences. Prior to this award, the relationships among all species was also extremely confusing. Now, all species are classified in 10 different groups (genera) that are all well known and well delineated.
