 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Luis Echegoyen and his research team at the University of Texas at El Paso will prepare and characterize endohedral \"clusterfullerenes\", for potential uses as acceptor materials in high efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Endohedral clusterfullerenes are carbon cages that entrap a variety of clusters, resulting in unusual electronic properties.  Of fundamental importance will be the interplay between the properties of the encapsulated clusters and the corresponding addition positions on the exohedral carbon surfaces. The long range goal is to control, in a predetermined way, the regiochemistry of multiple additions on the surfaces of these fullerenes. This team will explore reaction regiochemistry using independent multiple addition processes as well as tethered ones, where the adduct reagents are connected by a well-defined spacer. The properties of these compounds will be characterized using a wide variety of techniques, including X-ray crystallographic analyses, spectroscopy and electrochemistry, specifically looking for evidence of endo-exo cluster-cage interactions and their relationship to the overall chemical and electronic properties of the compounds.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses mainly on two families of endohedral clusterfullerenes, the trimetallic nitrides, in which the carbon cages encapsulate M3N clusters, and the dimetallic sulfides, which entrap M2S clusters. Efforts will be devoted to entrapping mainly transition metals and avoid rare earths, including mixed metallic sulfides, M1M2S@C2n, where M1 and M2 and transition metals and n>39. Intrinsic as well as chemical properties will be fully explored. An outreach program will continue to impact middle school students, primarily eighth graders of Hispanic origin, by exposing them to Energy and Nano concepts and laboratory practices. Besides this important broader impact there are potential societal benefits to be derived from the compounds and materials prepared, especially in OSCs, and from the training provided to the students involved in the project, many of whom are from Hispanic backgrounds. Because Professor Echegoyen is heavily involved in international collaborations with many scientists around the world, an additional broader impact results from these fertile intellectual interactions.",

Of particular significance are fullerene carbon cages that incorporate single uranium ions or never before seen uranium clusters such as U=C=U, a perfectly characterized species possessing unique uranium-carbon double bonds. Another important discovery was the structural characterization of a compound containing a Sc<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> cluster inside a C<sub>88</sub> cage, which exhibited a heptagonal ring, the first ever on a C<sub>88</sub> cage. The significance of this discovery is that this compound offers detailed mechanistic insights about the growth processes involved, see Figure 2. 2) The development of new synthetic procedures to prepare new and unexpected derivatives of [60] and [70]fullerenes (the 60 carbon cage compound is identical in shape to a soccer ball, possessing 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons). Figure 3 shows four unique tethered <em>bis</em>-adduct [70]fullerene derivatives whose addition patterns had never been observed previously, thus adding to the list of unique fullerene derivatives with interesting electronic properties, potentially useful in the construction of efficient solar cell devices. 3) The preparation of new <em>bis</em>-adduct<em> </em>derivatives of endohedral clusterfullerenes led us to the conclusion that the nature and structure of the encapsulated cluster dictates and controls the regiochemical arrangement of the adducts on the surface of the carbon cage. This electronic control limits the number of possible isomers, from a statistical maximum of 91 to only 3 or 2, depending on the cluster, see Figure 4. 4) Finally, we were successful in applying several of the newly synthesized [60] and [70]fullerene derivatives as anti-HIV agents and as efficient electron transporting layers in perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices. As anti-HIV agents, some derivatives were extremely potent at inhibiting HIV infectivity at 3 &mu;M but, more importantly, we showed that the action mechanism does not involve the HIV protease, something that had become an established paradigm for 25 years. Many of the synthesized compounds under this grant were also shown to be very effective in efficient PSCs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of the compounds prepared with support from this grant are entirely new, never before synthesized that provide considerable insight into fundamental electronic and structural properties that had never seen before, as well as the potential for biological and photovoltaic applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many students and postdoctoral associates participated in the projects supported by this grant, including four Hispanic coworkers, thus enhancing the training of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in chemical research. We also have strong international collaborations with Poland, Germany and Spain, which provide very strong intellectual input but also a very important broader impact for the students and postdoctorals involved in the work. We had short to medium visits from some of these collaborators to our laboratories, which expanded the cultural horizons of all of the group members and provided a more global perspective for all of the people involved.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/04/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Luis&nbsp;Echegoyen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1408865/1408865_10317130_1559676171339_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1408865/1408865_10317130_1559676171339_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1408865/1408865_10317130_1559676171339_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Independent 1,3-dipolar Cycloadditions to Trimetallic Nitride Endohedral fullerenes.
