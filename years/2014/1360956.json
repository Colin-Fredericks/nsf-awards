Undergraduates at six institutions from their junior year to their first year post-graduation will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative research.  The community of practice element will convene stakeholders at each partner institution who are invested in translating the results from this project into educational practice. A Professional Pathways Model that explains how students beliefs about their career options and their own abilities affect their career decisions will be proposed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "PEPS OUTCOMES REPORT Final\nWHAT IS THE PROBLEM?\nConcerns about a shortage of engineers have led to calls to increase engineering retention. Yet, these calls often focus on retention in the major or among experienced workers and fail to consider the significant numbers of engineering students who leave the field almost immediately after graduation. To increase retention during the college-career transition, we must learn more about the factors contributing to early career engineering attrition, and particularly, \"problematic attrition\" (where an individual is \"pushed away\" from engineering by negative factors).\nOur study begins bridging this gap by following students from college into the postgraduate world enabling us to study how students? first career decisions unfold. Our study focuses on students? transition from their junior year to the first year after earning their bachelor?s degrees, as this enables us to explore what happens right before and right after they graduate. This national study draws on data from six U.S. institutions, and has a specific objective of bridging research findings to practice. Our mixed-methods study, based on career professional staff interviews and student surveys and interviews, addresses the following research questions:\n&#9679;      How do engineering students develop beliefs about their career options and abilities?\n&#9679;      How do these beliefs influence their career plans and preparation over time?\n&#9679;      How might research findings on students? beliefs and plans be used in improving career development services?\n \nWHAT WE LEARNED---STUDENTS\nWe surveyed juniors and seniors at our partner schools in Fall 2016, and again, one year later. Results indicate that student?s confidence in two areas, career exploration and job acquisition, are highly related and influenced by a common set of experiences, including having had an internship/co-op, having been a student leader, and taking courses that emphasizing engineering careers or skills.

When career-related options and skills are included, they contribute to student confidence in engineering, as well as confidence in career discovery and job acquisition skills.\nEngagement in EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (including internships) has positive career discovery and engineering skills payoffs. \nThe group that supports students? sense of preparedness/confidence in career discovery and job acquisition skills is not homogeneous, with FACULTY,  INDUSTRY CONTACTS and FRIENDS playing particularly strong roles. \nBecause the group that supports students in developing career- and job-related skills is not homogeneous and a variety of activities (both inside and outside the classroom) contribute to students? preparedness it is challenging to identify the \"customers\" are for Career-related research findings.  Our Purdue and SJSU examples show how Career Services might use such findings.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruth A Streveler"
