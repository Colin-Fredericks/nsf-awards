 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate human interaction with simulated agents in situations where humans expect empathic communication, such as healthcare.  In domains such as this, the person interacts with computer-based interventions (CBI) as an education process evolves.  Almost all psychosocial interventions currently available on the web are delivered merely via text.  Research indicates that many users will lose interest and drop out, although completion is critical to achieving desired goals.  Human-computer interaction literature suggests that interacting with simulated agents can increase the user's engagement, but that the user will expect social competence when interacting with them.  This project will answer a set of research questions for the design of simulated characters with some empathic intelligence, to create a new modality for the delivery of CBIs.  The specific health-related application area will facilitate development and evaluation of new techniques and design principles, that will have much wider applicability, potentially whenever people interact with computer-based systems through simulated agents. \r\n\r\nThis research will advance the ability of computer scientists to create competent simulated agents that can adapt their verbal and non-verbal behavior to the user's affective states, and over time tailor their interaction to the specific user to produce the maximum positive impact in terms of users' engagement and achievement of their goals.  The model of empathy and social competence developed will enable simulated characters to adapt in real time to a user's short-lived emotions over a single interactive session.  Longer-term affective states will be modeled over long-term interaction via follow-up sessions with the same individual.  Thus, development of rapport between a human and an artificial intelligence is a dynamic process over time, and the research is expected to discover new principles that might not be seen in exclusively short-term interactions. The project will provide: (1) a scheme to design tailored interaction by constructing a dynamic user-model with user's demographic information and fluctuating personal characteristics; (2) a model of empathic verbal communication built by combining motivational interviewing techniques with an ontology-based dialog system; (3) a computational model for the integration of verbal and non-verbal communication cues by adapting the character's facial expressions, vocal modulation, and kinesics to its verbal utterances in the context of the session.  In addition, the research will engage scientific questions about diversity in communication style across human groups, facilitated by the fact that the project is housed at the region's principal minority-serving research university.  The fact that the research will involve students in the development of systems that integrate multiple technologies will give them an excellent educational experience, gaining competence that will be valuable for a range of future careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur Empathic Embodied Virtual Agent (EEVA) project investigated human interactions with simulated agents, which are digital human-looking characters able to interact using the main communication channels that humans innately use to communicate.  We studied how the role of empathy and rapport, expressed with multiple social cues (facial expressions, body gestures, and spoken utterances), can be simulated on digital agents.\n\n \n\nWhereas establishing rapport is important for any successful communication , clinical psychologists become experts at establishing rapport with patients during their training.  We therefore identified counseling as a good testing domain for our work on \u2018digital rapport\u2019.  Our tenet is that, if our rapport-enabled agents are well accepted in as sensitive a context as discussing one\u2019s at-risk behaviors, they will be defacto well accepted in other, less sensitive contexts (e.g. intelligent digital tutor, digital museum guide).\n\n \n\nSo we developed computational models of rapport based on knowledge we derived from videos of therapy sessions we recorded between a licensed clinical psychologist and patients.  We annotated the videos in terms of what social cue(s) the psychologist expressed with what word, and used these annotations to create models of rapport that either (1) use hand-crafted rules to control the agent\u2019s messages, or that (2) derives such rules from processing these annotated videos with machine learning AI algorithms.\n\n \n\nOur approach was further constrained by our goal to model human-agent rapport in conversations conducted over the Internet, which complicates matters significantly.  Indeed, our project is one of the very few to attempt to (1) provide interactions with a socially interactive agent online, with (2) real-time processing of the user\u2019s social cues and utterances, and (3) corresponding real-time adaptation of the agent\u2019s social cues along with its spoken utterances.\n\n \n\nThe project culminated in the design, implementation, and deployment of EEVA, programmed to deliver the content of behavior change intervention previously proven effective for heavy drinkers, using our models of rapport.  The result is that users can now access EEVA website, 24/7 anytime anywhere, where a rapport-enabled agent asks them about their alcohol consumption, and helps them to find ways to reduce their abusive consumption.\n\nTo evaluate our EEVA agent, we compared how heavy drinkers rate the acceptability and usefulness of the same behavior change intervention delivered by EEVA versus delivered with a text only user interface.
