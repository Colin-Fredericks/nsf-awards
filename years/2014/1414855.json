 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering (BRIGE) provides funding to develop and test a simulation framework to enhance and support the decision making process for sustainable retrofit of existing buildings. This framework will be developed using agent based modeling (ABM) to integrate the building stakeholders' requirements and behaviors, the budget constraints, the required energy savings and green house gas emissions reduction benchmarks, and possible retrofit measures to simulate their complex interactions. The primary goal is to identify optimal retrofit measures that save energy use while delivering an enhanced environment for all building stakeholders. To achieve this objective, data will be collected from three case study buildings. The ABM will consist of individual agents, implemented in software as objects with states and rules of behavior. Running the model instantiates an agent population of the building stakeholders who interact with each other and their environment, and make decisions based on information they receive about the existing building condition, and the environmental/economic impacts of the feasible retrofit measures.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will result in several contributions to the field of decision making to sustainably retrofit existing buildings; namely (1) understanding how the requirements of the different building stakeholders affect the sustainable retrofit decision; (2) determining to what extent information about environmental impact, economic constraints, and technical feasibility influences these requirements; and (3) developing and testing an ABM simulation model of these requirements and influences. Aligning the building stakeholders' requirements for enhanced work environment, profit maximization and energy savings, while choosing sustainable retrofit measures, is key to achieve targeted reduction in green house gas emissions from the building sector. The model validation through case studies will ensure its practical value to private and public entities looking to reduce the environmental impact of their existing buildings.",

A Simulation Framework to Study the Effect of Material Performance on a Building's Life Cycle Energy:</strong> Reducing the energy requirements during a building&rsquo;s life cycle can be achieved through selection of sustainable construction materials during the material production and construction phase and also by accurate estimation and control of energy usage during the use and maintenance phase. This research proposes a lifecycle energy monitoring framework that couples LCA and energy simulation analysis using a system dynamics modeling paradigm to enable a distributed simulation platform that can monitor and control the energy requirements during all phases of a building&rsquo;s life cycle. The primary three objectives of this research are to: (1) define dynamic factors that affect the overall energy performance of the building? (2) develop a framework that performs a coupled life cycle energy analysis and system dynamics simulation to analyze the impact of various dynamic factors on buildings&rsquo; life cycle energy requirements? and (3) Validating the framework by performing a sensitivity analysis on a case study building example. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can help in understanding the optimal maintenance and replacement period of major building materials.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Classification of Uncertainties in Nearly Zero Energy Investment Refurbishments and Associated Project Evaluation Approach:</strong> Nearly Zero Energy Refurbishments provide many of the benefits of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings to the aging building stock, and offer an opportunity to make them more resource efficient and environmentally friendly, with an increased social and financial value. However, high initial costs and uncertainties about the expected benefits characterize this type of investment and affect the building stakeholders&rsquo; decision on whether to go ahead with such a project or not. Given the special case of existing buildings and associated challenges to refurbish them to nearly zero energy, this work and associated activities aimed to identify and classify uncertainties that characterize and make this type of investment a highly uncertain endeavor over the project lifecycle. It also provides recommendations about managing these uncertainties during the project evaluation phase. Finally, a new approach to project evaluation based on the option pricing theory is presented along with a case study example.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Modeling Effect of Building Stakeholder Interactions on Value Perception of Sustainable Retrofits:</strong> Alignment among building stakeholders is necessary to ensure that sustainable retrofits achieve the purpose of maximizing economic, environmental and social value of the building. However, dynamic stakeholder opinions and value maximization perceptions result in conflicting requirements that hinder the adoption of truly sustainable retrofit solutions by decision makers. This work enhances and expands the preliminary agent based model, developed by the PI and her team during early stages of the project, to understand how social network interactions can help stakeholders with different characteristics prioritize their values on cost awareness, energy saving and organizational performance, to ultimately come up with an optimal retrofit decision for a commercial office building.
