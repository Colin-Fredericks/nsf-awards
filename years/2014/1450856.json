 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular cloning--the construction of recombinant DNA--is the foundation of modern biology, particularly synthetic biology. However, traditional cloning methods and DNA synthesis have failed to meet growing demand and are limiting the pace of discovery and engineering. Advanced DNA assembly technologies are improving throughput, but the fact that researchers are still responsible for performing these steps in-house suggests there may be an unaddressed market opportunity. This I-Corps Teams proposal will explore the commercial feasibility of DNA assembly as a service.\r\n\r\nSynthetic biology has provided cutting-edge technologies that aid in the manipulation of recombinant DNA, but the full potential of these new techniques has not yet been realized. Many scientists shy away from adopting new methods because they seem overly difficult compared to their current practice. Some reluctantly pay exorbitant sums to get their DNA synthesized. A DNA assembly service company would disrupt the current custom DNA market, offering lower prices and faster turnaround times than any existing provider. The consequences of this advance will be two-fold: the general pace of research--both basic and applied--will accelerate; and the cost of research will be reduced. The latter effect has interesting implications for the education and training of the next generation of biologists and bioengineers. If the cost of conducting research is reduced, not only can more scientists be trained, but they can be taught to think differently, where they are restricted only by the scope of their ideas and aren?t limited by an inability to implement them.",
