By increasing the number and quality of STEM majors through focused recruitment, retention, and career placement practices, the Tech Valley Scholars (TVS) program is helping to meet regional workforce development needs in New York's greater Hudson Valley.\r\n\r\nKey project elements include cohort support activities centered on a TVS one-credit seminar each semester, continuous mentoring and guidance of students throughout the program, and creation of an innovative learning environment using the latest developments in STEM education research.  As TVS participants, undergraduate students gain experience working on teams and developing skills and perspectives that are necessary for innovations in the application of STEM technologies.",
