 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1441457\r\nThis proposal is to conduct a workshop to examine fundamental science needs in NanoEHS.  Research in this topic has reached a plateau of understanding by using fundamental testing methods.  New approaches to deeper scientific questions are needed.  The workshop will identify new questions in order to bring a better understanding of the interactions of nanomaterials with living systems.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the workshop are as follows:\r\n1. Engage a broad range of participants to focus on the theme of the workshop topic NanoEHS: Fundamental Science Needs\r\n2. Identify areas where fundamental studies are needed to better understand NanoEHS.\r\n3. Identify challenges and opportunities in understanding NanoEHS: Fundamental Science Needs, i.e. identify problems, techniques and methods including, but not limited to, the role of computation and theory, size-dependent behavior for very small particles such as quantum size effects, and surface structure.\r\n4. Articulate the importance of fundamental physics and chemistry within interdisciplinary approaches to NanoEHS: Fundamental Science Needs and identify opportunities for collaboration.\r\n5. Prepare a manuscript to a journal that summarizes and highlights the workshop discussion and findings.\r\n6. Disseminate workshop findings further in a symposium at an upcoming Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization (SNO) Meeting or some other appropriate meeting venue.",
