 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a flexible transparent conductor material to be used as a low-cost transparent electrode for the fabrication of organic light emitting diodes for flat panel display and lighting applications. The project will result in a prototype substrate, on which organic light emitting diodes will be demonstrated with high light emission efficiency and simplified device structure. This substrate has the following unique features: high surface conductivity, low surface roughness, and mechanical flexibility; this is a combination of properties that no existing material can provide. These features provide the important advantages of lower cost and higher light emission efficiency when compared to the leading competing transparent electrode in this market space.  The integrated substrate is important because the commonly used flexible transparent electrode technology cannot meet the performance requirements for future flexible displays that would be required for wearable electronics, an area which is gaining increasing attraction.\r\nThe project engages Polyradiant Corp. to optimize the processing of the integrated substrate for scalability study, transition onto roll-to-roll pilot production line, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The surface conductivity, surface smoothness, and visual transparency of the integrated substrate will be optimized via processing conditions and polymer formulation. The light extraction efficiency of organic light emitting diodes based on the integrated substrate will be enhanced by at least 100% by adding nanoparticles into the substrate. A solution-based process will be developed to fabricate prototype integrated substrate and validate the prototype for high-efficiency flexible light emitting diodes. The new substrate will pave the way to low-cost, high-efficiency, and flexible organic light emitting diodes. \r\nThe potential economic impact is expected to be hundreds of million dollars in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in organic light emitting diode based displays and lighting panels with a present market size of ~$4B and growing rapidly.",
