An analysis of satellite observations and reanalysis products including computation of composite sea surface temperature, air-sea fluxes and moisture budget associated with ARs will be undertaken. An examination of the impact of low frequency variability such as El Nino Southern Oscillation and Madden Julian Oscillation on ARs will also be investigated. An intercomparison of global climate model simulation, including the evaluation of AR simulations and the impact of the double Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) problem on precipitation along the U.S. West Coast through AR activity will be performed. The research will include conducting atmospheric coupled model experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SST), which include the erroneous SST field associated with the double (ITCZ) problem. Finally upper ocean processes associated with ARs that could influence SST and air-sea fluxes of moisture using ocean coupled modeling experiments will be examined.\r\n\r\nThis research will shed insights into ARs that are an important mode of providing precipitation to the western US.  Enhanced understanding of ARs thus has important societal impacts and benefits.",

When the AR makes landfall, large-scale on-shore currents that hit the coast, generating strong narrow northward jets along the west coast of North America (Fig. 3). In the open ocean, the AR generates prominent changes of mixed layer depth especially south of 30&deg;N due to the strong surface winds and air-sea heat fluxes. The prominent cooling of SST is observed only in the vicinity of AR upstream areas primarily due to the large latent heat flux.
