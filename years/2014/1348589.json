 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems that evolve with time appear at the core of nearly all scientific endeavor, including biology, chemistry, physics, and the social sciences.  Given the current state of the system, can one predict the future state?  How does this evolution of the state of the system depend on the parameters of the system?  Many such dynamical systems are far too complicated for a rigorous study, so one resorts to simpler models, which are hoped to indicate the types of behavior that one should expect experimentally.  One venue for such simpler models is the iteration of holomorphic maps, the topic of this project.  Completing these projects will provide a deeper understanding of fundamental properties of dynamical systems in several complex variables and it will build connections with other areas of mathematics.  The broader impacts of this project are largely educational, focusing on both high school students and Ph.D. students. Funding for this project will help to develop an interest and talent in mathematics among high school students, both local and throughout Indiana.  It will help to train at least one supported Ph.D. student at Indiana University-Purdue University and also to train Ph.D. students from all over the United States by means of two workshops on holomorphic dynamics in several variables.\r\n\r\nThe main research goal of this project is to explore several examples where the iteration of a holomorphic self-map of a complex manifold has a connection with another area of mathematics or mathematical physics.  Not only does the connection allow for applications in the other area, but the context coming from that area usually gives the mapping extra structure, allowing for a significantly deeper study. Four projects are proposed relating dynamics in several complex variables to Thurston theory, the Ising model from statistical physics, the spectra of certain operators arising from self-similar group actions, and complex time ordinary differential equations (the Painleve equations). The proposed research projects are designed around three principles: (1) exploring connections between two or more different areas of mathematics can lead to surprising new results, (2) dynamical systems having an additional context from another field can be studied significantly more deeply, and (3) a study of concrete examples often leads to statements and proofs of more general theorems.  Partnered with the main research goals are several educational goals: (1) leading local high school students on specially tailored research projects, (2) helping to run and improve the Indiana University-Purdue University High School Math Contest, (3) leading Ph.D. students on the main research projects mentioned above, and (4) organizing two workshops on dynamics in several complex variables which have a training component for Ph.D. students.",

Many interesting holomorphic self-mappings of a complex manifold arise in contexts from physics and from other areas of mathematics.

While doing so, several fundamental new theorems about the iteration of rational mappings in several variables were proved.  Meanwhile, interesting applications to problems from physics were also discovered and conveyed to researchers in that field.  Indeed, this communication also led to a paper written jointly with physicists.\n\nThe first image included with this report illustrates the chromatic zeros for the Diamond Hierarchical Lattice which were studied by the PI and one of his Ph.D. students using Migdal-Kadanoff renormalization.\n\nThe PI and his collaborators also obtained results that are beyond the original scope of the proposed project. They proved new fundamental results about the energy level spectrum of the quantum harmonic oscillator, results about the correlation between zeros of random polynomials, and results about how singular hypersurfaces are transformed under finite holomorphic maps.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe research performed led to several fundamental new theorems about the dynamical systems obtained by iterating rational mappings in two or more complex variables.  It also led to further important questions for future research, which were explicitly stated in the published papers and were presented to colleagues at research meetings.  The work funded by this grant led to new connections between different areas of mathematics and between mathematics and theoretical physics.\n\nEducational Projects and Broader Impacts:\n\nThe CAREER grant program places considerable emphasis on a balance between research projects and educational activities.\n\n(1) Workshop organization:  The PI organized two research workshops that were primarily for the training of Ph.D. students and postdocs.  The first of these workshops took place in August 2016 and was titled \"Connections Between Complex Dynamics, Statistical Physics, and Limiting Spectra of Self-similar Group Actions\".   It brought together people from these three fields in order to stimulate interaction and produce new progress.  The first two days of the workshop consisted of \"learning talks\" that were given by and intended for graduate students and postdocs.  The third day consisted of \"mini-course\"-style talks given by experts in all three areas and the fourth and fifth days consisted of research talks, again by experts in these three areas.\n\nThe second workshop took place in March of 2022 and was titled \"Complex Dynamics School: Building a bridge to higher dimensions\".  Like the previous workshop, the first two days were dedicated to \"learning talks\" that were given by and intended for graduate students and postdocs.  The remaining three days were devoted to mini-courses given by six experts in the area, with each mini-course consisting of two hour-long lectures.\n\n(2) Leading Ph.D. students on research projects:  One of the PI's Ph.D. students completed his degree in 2020 and was heavily involved in research projects related to Migdal-Kadanoff renormalization.
