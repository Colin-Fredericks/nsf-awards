This approach can be easily transferred to K-12 curricula, increasing access to STEM learning for diverse student populations. By developing an engineering faculty member's expertise in engineering education research, it will enhance communication and collaboration among faculty members and student researchers in different disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to apply well-developed cognitive frameworks in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) to develop a new Blended Learning (aBLe) approach to teaching programming languages. This approach will accommodate a variety of learning needs and abilities, while potentially increasing student engagement in online components. It will provide better preparation for face-to-face classes that will emphasize the problem solving needed in other general education courses instead of just keywords, syntax, and symbols. It will also encourage the development of problem solving skills students need to persist in a lifetime of learning.",

Furthermore, use of this approach places greater emphasis on student-focused, problem-solving techniques that can be utilized in other courses across knowledge domains.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The study tested the hypothesis that the use of cognitive frameworks in second language acquisition for the development of a blended learning of programming languages can improve engagement and the learning experience of engineering students. The qualitative and quantitative data collected during the study helped were analyzed to determine if the implementation of SLA-aBLe modules in programming courses had an impact on student learning and student engagement in the class. Five course modules including screencasts, PowerPoint slides, online quizzes, and think-pair-share lab practices were translated into the SLA-based framework and then these materials were disseminated to students. Three instructors who teach introductory programming classes were trained in the proper use of the SLA modules and used them in at least one introductory programing course section a semester between 2015 and 2017. The lessons learned from applying SLA-aBLe frameworks in this context have been disseminated at various conferences as either oral/poster presentations, or workshops such as American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), First Year Engineering Experience Conference (FYEE), ASEE Southeastern (SE) Section Conference, and international conferences. This has been provided a richer understanding of how SLA-aBLe affects student&rsquo;s learning of the programming language. In addition, professors at other Universities have begun using the materials developed and provided by the program to enhance programming language instruction at their institutions.&nbsp; Applied projects that involve changes to classroom instruction are difficult to do, however the SLA-aBLe project implemented change in a controlled manner and then assessed the effects of the change using sound research and measurement strategies.&nbsp; Results found that even with intervention limited to only one-third of the total class material, there was a positive impact of the SLA techniques on both student workload and course grades.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts </strong></p>\n<p>The broader significance and importance of this project is that it fundamentally changed how students learn programming using SLA-aBLe.

This project promoted and improved the role of women as research faculty, undergraduate, and graduate students in the professions of engineering and engineering technology through collaboration, publications, presentations, and communications. It enhanced collaborations between the engineering field and cognitive sciences. The project website was created and maintained with links to department and university sites. All project-related materials were accessible on the project website and were free to download by any interested instructors. The project materials have been implemented at ERAU and other institutions. The positive outcomes of the project have been presented at various conferences.
