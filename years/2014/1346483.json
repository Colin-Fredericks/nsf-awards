 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in antistatic aerospace high-performance coatings. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem for vehicles which utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials. Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. This project will characterize and correlate the structure and properties of new conductive polymer nanostructures that are synthesized from inexpensive raw materials and dispersed in organic solvents for direct incorporation into commercial paint formulations. These new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the host's conductive properties are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this project, the research team will develop technical plans for the scalable and economic synthesis of polymer additives, control and optimize the nanostructure of the additives to maximize conductivity at low concentrations, enhance the electrical conductivity through chemical doping, and demonstrate successful incorporation in commercial coatings while preserving performance specifications. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to enabling the increased adoption of lightweight carbon reinforced composites and plastic structural materials in the aerospace industry. The design of lightweight vehicles using these components, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles. Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of robust antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies. Coatings containing polymer nanostructures will provide improved charge dissipation, reduced weight, improved durability, and will cost less than competing materials. Success in aerospace applications will could also enable the adoption of these technologies in other sectors (e.g. automobile), expanding the economic and ecological benefits and providing follow-on commercial opportunities.",
