 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our brains are composed of trillions of dendritic spines and synapses that serve as sites of communication between neurons within complex neuronal circuits.  Dendritic spines and synapses are thought be unique and display different properties and activities, which points to an urgent need to study individual spines and synapses within brain circuits.  However, this is currently not feasible due to the lack of available technologies for investigating individual spines and synapses.  In this project, a new technology will be developed that will allow researchers to examine the properties and activities of individual spines and synapses.  Because a major function of spines and synapses is to transmit signals that control information flow within the brain, studying these structures at an individual synapse level will lead to a new understanding of how information is relayed among brain circuits to control cognitive function.  Furthermore, since changes in the structure and function of spines and synapses are associated with many neurological disorders, insight gained from studies examining individual spines and synapses could lead to better treatments for various neurological disorders.  Our project will combine the expertise of neurobiologists and engineers to develop the new technology.  As such, training opportunities will be provided for both graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary environment that will be extremely beneficial to their long-term career development.\r\n\r\nTo develop this technology, a new class of microfluidic platforms, with integrated graphene probes  will be designed to investigate synaptic activity with single synapse resolution.  Graphene-based sensors, which have the capability of detecting single molecular charge and capturing electrical and optical events in tens of picoseconds, will be combined with scanning photocurrent microscopy to detect local electrical and chemical signals at sub-synaptic resolution (~ 500 nm).  These unique properties of graphene enable the new platform to map the activity of neurons with single synapse spatial resolution, sub-millisecond temporal resolution, and single-molecule-charge sensitivity.  The obtained data with assays enabled by this new platform will provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie cognitive brain function.This award is jointly made by two programs the Instrument Development for Biological Research program (IDBR) and Emerging Frontiers (EF) in the Directorate of Biological Sciences (BIO).",
