 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a nuclear physics experimental project at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The goal of the experiment is a better understanding of the internal quark and gluon structure of the proton and neutron constituents of nuclear matter.  The proposed research will provide fundamental information on the momentum distributions of the quarks inside the nucleons of the helium-3 and tritium atoms, using a new method of comparing directly measurements of inelastic electron scattering from helium-3 and tritium nuclei.  This method is complementary to experiments done in the past at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which showed the existence of point-like \"partons\" inside the nucleons, by scattering electrons from hydrogen and deuterium nuclei.  The new method will eliminate inherent theoretical uncertainties in the Stanford method.  The results will test long-standing predictions of the Quark Model of the nucleon, and of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons.  In addition, a new proposal will be prepared for a measurement of elastic electron scattering from the tritium nucleus, which will provide critical information for the development of a \"standard model\" describing the structure and dynamics of the simplest, lightest nuclei in nature.  The project is expected to make significant contributions to the advancement of basic nuclear physics science, and to graduate education and training by offering doctoral dissertation topics on related science and instrumentation, which provide experience needed for careers in education, medical physics, homeland security, high technology, and national laboratories research.\r\n\r\nThe project will make use of a tritium, helium-3, and deuterium target system under development at Jefferson Lab, and magnetic spectrometers in the Hall A facility of the Lab. Unpolarized electrons with energy up to 11 gigaelectronvolt will be scattered from the above nuclear targets. For the inelastic measurements, scattered electrons will be detected with the electron High Resolution Spectrometer and a refurbished BigBite Spectrometer. The ratio of the measured cross sections for tritium and helium-3 will determine reliably the ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, and subsequently the ratio of the probability distributions for an up quark compared to a down quark in the nucleon. The ratio of the tritium and helium-3 cross sections to the deuterium cross section will provide additional information about the effect of the nuclear environment on quarks in the nucleon. A comparison of the effect for these two mirror nuclei is considered to be essential for a full explanation of this effect. For the elastic measurements, the hadron High Resolution Spectrometer will be also used for detection of tritium recoiling nuclei. The two tritium form factors will be measured up to large momentum transfers by means of a Rosenbluth separation. This group will play a major role in all aspects of the project, namely the i) refurbishment, checkout, and calibration of the BigBite spectrometer, ii) preparation of all experimental apparatuses to be used, iii) acquisition of the experimental data, iv) data analysis, and v) publication of the results. The graduate students involved will be exposed to and gain expertise with both hardware and software development.",

The focus of the project was on the preparation and execution of a highly-rated Jefferson Lab (JLab) experiment (MARATHON, E12-10-103) on deep-inelastic scattering of electrons from hydrogen, deuterium, and the helium and tritium three-nucleon mirror nuclei.  A secondary objective was the continuation of the data analysis and publication of results from JLab experiment E04-18, which performed elastic electron scattering from the 3He and 4He helium isotopes.  Another objective was the preparation and submission of a new JLab proposal for the measurement of the electromagnetic form factors of tritium at large momentum transfers.\nThe core of the intellectual merit of the conducted research was the  acquisition of precise MARATHON data, currently in the analysis stage, which are expected to provide important information on fundamental nuclear-particle physics observables, namely i) the ratio of the inelastic structure functions of the proton and neutron, with the subsequent determination of the ratio of the down to up quark distributions in the proton, in order to test predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the quark model of the nucleon, and ii) the EMC effect of the three-nucleon mirror nuclei, which is necessary for the full understanding of the modification of the nucleon structure functions in the nuclear medium.  The above data were collected in the winter of 2018 using a cryogenic target system comprised of hydrogen, deuterium, helium and tritium cells, and the two High Resolution Spectrometers (HRS) of the Hall A Facility of JLab.  Three KSU graduate students are currently working on their doctoral dissertations analyzing data from the MARATHON experiment.  They have made significant contributions to upgrades of the experimental apparatus used in the experiment, as well as to software improvements for data acquisition, and online analysis and monitoring.  They also worked, prior to MARATHON, on a  refurbishment of the nuclear electronics, detectors, and data acquisition system of the JLab Hall A BigBite spectrometer.\nAnother accomplishment of the KSU group was the finalization of the analysis and publication of JLab Hall A data on the charge and magnetic elastic form factors of 3He.  For this measurement, scattered electrons and recoil nuclei were detected in coincidence using the two Hall A HRS of JLab.  The extraction of the elastic cross section employed a complete Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment, tracing particles originating at the target through the spectrometer magnets and the detectors. This work complements previous work of the KSU group on other few-body nuclear physics observables, the deuteron and 4He form factors, which are widely considered, along with the tritium form factors, as the ``observables of choice'' for testing the nucleon-meson standard model of the nuclear interaction, and as essential for the establishment of a canonical model describing the internal structure and dynamics of the light nuclei of nature.

In this experiment, besides elastic electron-4He coincidence events, events from quasielastic electron scattering from 3He clusters in 4He were also observed.  The analysis of this class of events is in progress.  The results so far are indicative of a significant 3He clustering in the 4He nucleus.  \nThe broader impact of the conducted research was to a) advance our knowledge of the quark-gluon substructure of the proton and neutron, the basic constituents of nuclear matter, in the context of the quark model of the nucleon and of quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force in nature, b) further our understanding of the internal structure and dynamics of the lightest ``few-body'' nuclei in nature and aid in the establishment of a canonical hadronic model for their description, which has been a theoretical challenge for more than 50 years,  c) contribute to basic nuclear science education by providing topics for four doctoral dissertations, in progress, in experimental nuclear physics, and d) contribute to the success of the 12 GeV program of Jefferson Lab, which aims at a better understanding of the theory of quantum chromodynamics, while advancing nuclear radiation detection and particle acceleration technology, areas that have been producing technological and industrial applications for the benefit of the society. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerassimos G Petratos"
