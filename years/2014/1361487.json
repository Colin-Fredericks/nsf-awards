 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cratons are the old, stable cores of continents.  They are regions that have not experienced significant deformation for the last 2.5 billion years.  A variety of geochemical and geophysical data indicate that they are underlain by thick mantle lithosphere that is unusually cold relative to the surrounding mantle.  The internal structure of the cratonic mantle also includes layering in both physical and chemical properties.  However, much remains to be learned about the origin of this internal structure.  The researchers plan to use the velocities at which seismic waves propagate through the cratonic mantle to provide bounds on the temperature of the mantle rocks, their chemical composition, and their grain size and rock fabric.  The multidisciplinary research team plans to directly measure the geochemistry and rock fabric of samples of the cratonic mantle that have been erupted to the surface to provide complementary information on their chemical evolution and deformation history.  The goals of the proposed work are to: 1) better constrain layering in geochemical and seismic velocity structure internal to cratonic mantle lithosphere, 2) explore the relationships among different types of layering, and 3) shed new light on the processes that formed the cratons and the mechanisms that permit them to remain stable over billions of years.  Understanding the stable cores of continents will help us understand the evolution of the Earth and its continents through time.  This project will contribute to the education and career development of two or more graduate students and several undergraduates, and the interdisciplinary nature of the project will serve to broaden their research expertise. Our faculty team will also teach a semester-long seminar at Brown on the topic of cratons for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe team proposes an integrated program of seismological and xenolith-based geochemical and microstructural analyses and geodynamical modeling focused on three mantle lithospheres that have experienced varying degrees of disruption in the last 2 billion years: the Slave craton, the Wyoming craton and the Colorado Plateau.  Each region provides excellent xenolith suites that sample the deep cratonic mantle and broadband stations that will allow progress on resolving seismic velocity structure. They plan to investigate the relationships between different types of layering in the cratonic mantle (mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuities, layering in azimuthal anisotropy, depletion, refertilization, grain size, olivine fabrics) with a variety of new techniques.  Joint inversions of scattered wave, surface wave, ambient noise and SKS splitting data will provide better constraints on seismic structure.  In xenoliths from a range of mantle depths we will use well-established analytical techniques to determine bulk and trace element compositions and major, trace and water contents in their constituent minerals to establish: the pressure-temperature conditions of the last tectonomagmatic event, the degree of hydration of the mantle, and the source of the metasomatic fluids/melts that affected the lithospheric mantle (subduction-related versus subduction-unrelated). Xenolith microstructural analyses will yield constraints on grain size, water content, and lattice preferred orientation. Thermobarometry, modal analyses, volatile content and grain size will be used to predict seismic velocities via a combination of elastic models (which include the effects of composition) and anelastic effects; these predictions will be compared to the observed seismological layering.  Based on these comparisons, a range of models will be defined that reflect the best fits to geochemical, microstructural and seismological constraints. To explore the implications of these models for the stability of the cratonic mantle, we will use the xenolith constraints to calculate effective viscosity using experimental flow laws for olivine, as well as density. The range of possible density and viscosity structures for each study region will be incorporated in geodynamical numerical modeling of lithospheric stability, including their vulnerability to subduction processes at their margins.  This work will provide new insight on several questions. 1) What is the internal layering (physical and chemical) of the cratonic mantle lithosphere? How do different types of layering correlate with each other? 2) How has their internal structure permitted stable cratons to remain largely intact over billion-year time-scales? How does subduction at the edges of a craton affect the stability of the cratonic mantle lithosphere? 3) How do the different types and scales of cratonic layering 'test' models of cratonic formation?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCratons are the ancient, stable cores of continents that have not experienced significant tectonic events (such as mountain building or rifting) for more than 500 million years.  It is well known that the lithosphere beneath cratons is unusually thick, more than 200 km in some regions, whereas the lithosphere in younger continental regions is thinner (on average approximately 100 km).  However, the structures internal to the cratonic lithosphere are not well understood, nor is the boundary between the cratonic lithosphere and the asthenosphere (the underlying, weaker mantle).   In this project we gained new insight on the cratonic lithosphere by combining studies of its structure using seismic waves with analyses of mantle xenoliths (samples of the cratonic mantle that were carried to the surface in magmatic eruptions that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago).\n\nTo image the internal structure of cratons, we developed new approaches that combine the resolving power of two types of seismic waves: earthquake body waves that convert from one direction of vibration to another when they encounter a change in wave velocity and thus are effective at mapping the properties of this type of boundary, and surface waves that provide good constraints on absolute wave velocities.  We applied this approach, and other seismic wave imaging methods, to the Wyoming and Superior cratons in the north-central U.S. and found that low velocity layers exist within the otherwise high velocity mantle portion of the lithosphere.  By comparing the observed wave velocities to velocities predicted for cratonic thermal structure and typical rock chemical compositions, we learned that the low velocity layers require very unusual compositions, for example higher than typical volumes of certain minerals that are rich in volatile chemical elements. \n\nThe xenoliths provide direct samples of the mantle from the Wyoming craton.  Geochemical analyses of the xenoliths suggest that the mantle of the Wyoming craton experienced infiltration by fluids and partial melt, processes which could form the type of volatile-rich mantle layer seen by the seismic waves.  We also studied analogous fluid and melt infiltration processes in xenoliths from the mantle beneath the Sierra Nevada in California, which formed in an ancient subduction zone.  However, the microstructures of the mineral grains in the Wyoming craton xenoliths revealed another facet of the Wyoming craton mantle: that its last episode of deformation occurred under very different conditions where water was largely absent.  Together these results show that although the cratonic mantle can remain intact for billions of years, it experiences repeated episodes of alteration under varying conditions.  Some stages of this alteration may be the origin of the strong layering that appears in the internal structure of the cratonic mantle lithosphere. \n\nWe also learned that the transition from the high velocity cratonic lithosphere into the lower velocity asthenosphere is typically very gradual on a global basis.  This drop in velocity over 80 km or more can be explained by a gradient in temperature.  This gradual transition differs from the oceans, where the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition occurs over a smaller depth range.  However, the rapid transition beneath oceans is not simply explained by melting of the mantle where upwelling occurs.\n\nThis project contributed to the education and career development of four graduate students and four postdoctoral scholars at Brown University.  It was also the basis for a graduate seminar on the structure and evolution of cratons that reached a broader group of students and faculty.  The results of this work have been shared with the scientific community through five peer-reviewed journal articles and 13 presentations at scientific meetings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen M Fischer"
