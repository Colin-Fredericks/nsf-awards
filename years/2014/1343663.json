This project will capture examples of such phenomena\r\nas how much industry builds on government-funded university research, the long incubation\r\nperiods sometimes needed for research to be translated into major industry activities, the\r\nsteady work and funding required to get from initial exploration to large-scale commercial\r\ndeployment, the interdependencies between research advances in different subfields, and the\r\ncomplex nature of the IT research ecology. This project will build on earlier work by\r\ndeveloping additional and/or more in-depth examples and providing updated information\r\non research impacts and the other phenomena listed above in the context of these examples.",
