 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring STEM content knowledge to visitors to Cuyahoga Valley National Park via mobile device applications. Visitors will be able to use their mobile phones to access details about Park features (such as where they are in the park, what they are looking at, and where are related features), supporting just-in-time STEM learning. \r\n\r\nCuyahoga Valley National Park receives around 2.5 million visitors every year and experiences multitudes of inquiries. Until this project, visitors were subjected to less than optimum signage for information and background about a given feature that may or may not be of interest to them. In this project, knowledge building information will be selected by the visitors and delivered to them with convenience and speed. The data base supporting this effort will provide the visitor with identification and the history of park features as well as more in depth knowledge building information while they are in the park and after the leave, providing a more holistic experience than is currently available.  The investigators will build the system in parts, testing the feasibility at each stage and evaluating affective and cognitive outcomes of each portion. Research questions that will be addressed in the course of this project include:  (1) What outcomes associated with use of this GPS-base system could inform future development and implementation? and (2) What contributions do these GPS-based mobile learning applications have on informal science learning as understood within the Six Strands of Informal Science Learning? It is expected knowledge generated in this project will stimulate additional programing for increasing efficacy and use in other widely ranging venues. If successful, it is easy to imagine how this STEM knowledge-building application could be extended for use in other venues across the country.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was conducted to answer two important questions.  First, what is the feasibility of using mobile devices and apps in park settings?  Second, what is the impact of such tools on informal science learning of park visitors?  The intended intellectual merit of the project was three-fold:  1) to test just-in-time, interactive learning for a large number of visitors; 2) to understand how to use mobile apps in large outdoor settings with limited Internet connectivity; and 3) to understand more about mobile application use for science learning in informal settings.  The intended broader impact was to further impact the design of future informal science learning tools, to increase participation of underrepresented groups in park settings, and to further enhance the relationship between park scientists and visitors. \n\nTo answer the research questions, the team created an application called ParkApps NE Ohio.  The tool is a mobile application available on both Apple iOS and Android platforms.  It is supported through a website for park administrators, scientists, and visitors. \n\nResearchers found that it was indeed feasible to create and implement a mobile solution for informal science learning in parks.  To complete such a task, however, the team had to overcome three obstacles.  First, the native iOS and Android operating systems are not specific enough in GPS accuracy to provide detailed information for users.  A user could easily walk 20-50 feet past an intended learning activity due to the insensitivity of the technology.  The team created a new solution that provided accuracy down to 8-12 feet by triangulating location calculations.  Second, parks do not often have map or science content in formats that are easily transferable to web- or mobile-based systems.  The team solved this by creating a web-based solution where park administrators and scientists could easily upload new information like map data, adventure tracks, and citizen science data collection requests.  These changes would automatically update the app without further programming efforts.  Finally, many of the park locations&mdash;particularly those near rocky terrain&mdash;had difficulty connecting to cellular towers.  Most settings were without WIFI access.  And, many visitors&mdash;including those in lower socioeconomic settings&mdash;did not have access to devices with cellular connectivity.  To counter this, the team created the app in such a way that it would still work without Internet access.  By overcoming these three obstacles, the team was able to prove the feasibility of implementing mobile devices in parks. The results will have long-lasting educational value for national, state, and local parks trying to implement such plans in the future. \n\nThe second research question was created to address learning that might occur from use of this tool. At the time of the completion of this grant, longitudinal data was still being collected.  However, there were three important outcomes that pointed to the positive outcomes in using mobile devices in parks for informal science learning.  First, in many parks (including those that span large geographic areas), there is limited access to park rangers and park scientists.  ParkApps NE Ohio was downloaded thousands of times in both iOS and Android formats.  Data collection shows thousands of interactions with science content in park settings across Northeast Ohio.  Put succinctly, the app was successful in putting educational content in the hands of park visitors that may not have had access to that content.  Second, and addressing the broader impact, helping scientists create content for the app helped them realize the collaborative potential of quickly reaching visitors for citizen science projects.  Although citizen science was not new to either park partner, the tool provided instance access with visual content and increased visibility to multiple park visitors.  A major learning, therefore, was that the use of educational apps did not have to be solely focused on dissemination; they could be used as tools for increasing science knowledge.  A final learning related to content development and dissemination.  The app and website created a model where anyone could create and disseminate adventure tracks.  There are deep theoretical and practical questions of ownership of scientific content&mdash;particularly in national parks.  In other words, many scientific communities would want some level of ownership over the delivery of scientific information.  However, in an era of socially-constructed content, there were a lot of questions raised about whether the development of adventure tracks within the app could be created by others outside of park administration.  This was not answered in this grant but is an important next step in further exploration of informal science learning with mobile technologies.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard E Ferdig"
