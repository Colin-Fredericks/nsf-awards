 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will create a ten-week summer research experience for a diverse pool of non-traditional students to work with faculty advisors from Portland State University's Center for Climate and Aerosol Research. Students will be shown the linkages between components of the Atmospheric system that are important in studies of climate, aerosols and air quality. Students will have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for conducting field, laboratory and modeling research in the Atmospheric Sciences. They will explore the need for high quality data that can be obtained from measurements and which leads to reliable climate and air quality model predications. This REU site will make extensive use of an online Learning Management System (LMS) to foster collaboration before, during and after the ten-week summer session. Within this dynamic research environment students will conduct meaningful research projects which address issues in the Atmospheric Sciences.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The atmospheric system is dynamic and complex. The study of the atmospheric system requires researchers to develop state-of-the-art tools for observation and modeling; these activities ensure the continued advancement of knowledge about the processes that force and regulate the atmosphere's synoptic and planetary circulation, air quality, weather and climate. It is therefore of the utmost importance to sustain the pool of human resources required for excellence in synoptic and global atmospheric dynamics, air quality and climate research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The specific goals of this REU are to: (1) develop an innovative training program that will provide research experiences on aspects of Climate and Aerosol Research, (2) develop a collaborative asynchronous online mentoring program, and (3) provide opportunities to enhance diversity in the STEM workforce. The REU experience is intentionally designed by the project team to develop the following skills in the undergraduate students: technical oral communication, technical writing, research ethics, analytical analysis, numerical analysis, statistical analysis, hardware development, and effective communication to a general audience. A particular strength of the REU model is the use of an existing curriculum, developed under previous NSF funding at PSU that provides a time-tested platform for rapidly preparing students for research in atmospheric science. The REU experience is also innovative in that it will contain graduate and professional-level socialization experiences, specifically tailored to the recruited populations, in the effort to familiarize students with the science culture and facilitate positive identification with science. The combined internal and external evaluation plans will allow this REU to contribute to the development of improved REU models for mentoring rural and Native American students from community colleges. The evaluation will contain elements not only in regard to student characteristics and program effectiveness, but will also serve to inform program hosts about the needs of the underrepresented groups we intend to serve.",
