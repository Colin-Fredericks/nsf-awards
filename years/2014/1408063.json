 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human circulatory system can deliver a drug to every cell in the body; however, bringing a drug inside a tumor cell without affecting the healthy cells remains a formidable task.  Availability of a technology capable of high-specificity delivery of anti-neoplastic drugs would be a breakthrough in cancer research. The objective of this research is to conduct basic in-vitro and in-vivo studies to understand the underlying physics of drug-loaded magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) at highly localized tumor sites. The engineering approach lies in increasing the porosity of the cell membrane, via application of a low-energy magnetic field, to allow the drug to penetrate inside the cancer cells without affecting the surrounding healthy cells. The proposed approach will form a basis of a novel external-field-controlled procedure to treat various cancers, including ovarian, breast and lung. An important goal of the project is to motivate students, especially underrepresented minorities at FIU and in South Florida, to pursue cross-disciplinary degrees at the intersection of nano-engineering and medicine. The interdisciplinary research team includes an electrical engineer, a gynecologic oncologist, a clinical pharmacologist and a cellular biologist. \r\n\r\nIn ovarian cancers, intraperitoneal delivery through a surgically implanted catheter has shown improved survival rates. However, catheter complications and toxicity have precluded widespread adoption of this technique.  In this study, a new nanotechnology is proposed to take advantage of (i) the difference between the membrane electric properties of cancer and healthy cells, and (ii) the capability of magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) at body-temperature to serve as localized converters of a remotely supplied magnetic field into the MENs' intrinsic electric fields that can trigger local nano-electroporation effects. The technique allows to remotely control the electric fields in the vicinity of intravenously injected MENs-loaded drug and consequently to enable drug delivery with required specificity to the tumor cells.  Electroporation will be used to deliver a drug inside the cytosol via application of high enough electric field to overcome the threshold required for increasing the porosity for drug penetration inside the cell. The required specificity is due to the lower threshold of the cancer cells being by at least a factor of two than that of the healthy cells. Scanning probe microscopy and comprehensive surface spectroscopy will be used to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the MENs' interaction with both the cancer and healthy cellular microenvironment under different field conditions.  Ovarian cancer will be used as a model with nanoparticles core shell of cobalt iron titanate and barium titatnate as basic MENs in conjunction with paclitaxel as a popular mitotic inhibitor drug. Standard assays will be used to study the MENs' toxicity under different field conditions. A mouse animal model will be exploited to conduct in-vivo studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits: This project for the first time studied the physics of the novel proposed effect coined as \"nanoelectroporation\" to cure cancer from the perspective of electrical and computer engineering. We have completed several orthogonal in vitro and in vivo experiments to confirm the main hypothesis that due to the use of magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs), the novel effect enables wirelessly controlled and scaled down (into the nanoscale) version of the well-known process known as \"electroporation\". Particularly, we have proven that this effect strongly depends on the cellular membrane potential and we can control electric properties of cells using wirelessly applied magnetic fields. It is known that cancer cells have different values of the potential compared to their normal counterparts. Therefore, like with the conventional electroporation, we can distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts to enable unprecedented specificity of cancer treatment. However, despite the great advantage of the high specificity, the conventional approach is strongly limited because of the excessive field exposure (&gt;1000 V/cm) of the surrounding normal cells and resulting side effects. In contrast, with the proposed approach, we use magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs) to wirelessly control local electric fields via application of magnetic fields and thus enable a non-invasive high-efficacy procedure. In this case, the high fields are extremely localized in the vicinity of the nanoparticles (administrated intraveneously), which in turn are drawn to cancer cells only, and therefore don?t display any detectable side effects. By studying at least 10 different cell lines, we have proven that the threshold magnetic fields required to ensure the drug-loaded nanoparticles penetrate the cells are proportional to the cell membrane potential.  Thus, given the value of the potential for cancer cells is smaller than that for its normal counterpart, by selecting an applied field value between the threshold values for cancer and surrounding normal cells, we can ensure the drug-loaded nanoparticles penetrate the cancer cells, while sparing the normal cells.  To understand the underlying physics, our experiments have been conducted on different cancer cells lines including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, and brain cancer (glioblastomas) using a number of independent techniques for in vitro and in vivo studies. Animal studies on mice have been successful, the animals were completely cured of cancer within a three-month period.  \n\nBroader Impacts: Our studies have been published in over 10 high-impact journals such as Applied Physics Reviews (Impact Factor: &gt;12), Scientific Reports, Nanomedicine, Nanoparticle, Bioelectronic Medicine, Applied Physics Letters, and IEEE Transacations.
