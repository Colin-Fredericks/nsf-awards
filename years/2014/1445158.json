The proposed research will not only advance the basic science and technology of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems, but will also lead to the development of additional LOCs that do not require external optical components.  \r\n\r\nThis project will design and develop a smartphone interface system that would enable rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable measurements with simultaneous detection using a medical sensing and diagnostic platform (MSDP) with a disposable cartridge lab-on-a-chip (CLOC) biochip. For integration with advanced mobile platforms They will utilize Google's open hardware platform, Project Ara, exploiting Java programming language which is commonly used by all mobile smartphone companies, including Google's Android. This device will include the use of an inexpensive, single use, disposable and universal CLOC that would be available in both developed and developing countries. The MSDP will perform detection on-chip, obviating the need for bulky detection equipment, paving the way for a truly portable medical diagnostic add-on for future smartphones.",
