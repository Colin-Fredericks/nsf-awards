To accomplish this goal, project scientists will drill long sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Towuti, a large lake on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, which contains the longest known record of terrestrial climate from anywhere in southeast Asia. These cores will be analyzed for their physical, chemical, and biological properties to deduce past variations in rainfall in the heart of the tropical Pacific region. These data will be used to assess the response of regional rainfall to changes in orbital cycles, greenhouse-gas variations, and global glacial-interglacial cycles.\r\n\r\nThe tropical western Pacific is an extremely important part of the global climate system, yet its response to global climate forcings and change remains poorly understood. This work will provide the longest continuous record of climate available to investigate the fundamental processes that control Indonesian climate variations. The research team will collaborate with scientists from Indonesia, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia on this project, stimulating interdisciplinary and international research training opportunities for students and teachers. The project will contribute to developing new museum displays and will engage the public via live web outreach activities.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nLake Towuti is the largest tectonic lake in Southeast Asia and is a high priority paleoclimate target within the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Seismic reflection and shallow sediment cores indicate that Lake Towuti contains a 100-200 m thick section of stratified lacustrine sediment that continuously spans the last ~650,000 years BP, the longest known terrestrial section in Southeast Asia. This research--a collaboration between scientists from Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, and the University of Minnesota--will investigate the response of tropical western Pacific climate to changes in orbital forcing and global climate boundary conditions through the late Pleistocene. The research is part of a multinational drilling program on Lake Towuti. This award provides funding to drill, to develop age models for the cores, and generate climate proxy reconstructions of the past ~650,000 years based upon a suite sedimentological, geochemical, and organic geochemical measurements.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Changes in tropical western Pacific hydrology exert enormous influence on global atmospheric circulation and on the concentration of atmospheric water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas. Despite its importance, the response of western Pacific hydrology to global climate remains highly uncertain. The team will collect and develop the longest continuous record of climate available from this region and compare this record with reconstructions from low and high-latitude marine and terrestrial sites to understand the response of tropical Pacific hydroclimate to changes in orbital forcing and global climate boundary conditions during the last 650,000 years.\r\nBroader Impacts: This work will provide important insight into the mechanisms governing long-term change in tropical hydrology and will provide a benchmark test-bed for paleoclimate models to simulate climate under different boundary conditions than the present. This project will provide interdisciplinary, international research training and learning opportunities to US and Indonesian students and scientists. This work will contribute to the development of new museum displays, and will engage the public with scientists in the field via interactions through web outreach activities. The research to date generated considerable publicity and local educational opportunities within Indonesia, including documentary programs on national television. The team will continue these activities throughout this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project brought together over forty scientists from the USA, Indonesia, and several other countries to drill long sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Towuti, a large tectonic lake located on the island of Sulawesi in central Indonesia.  These cores were analyzed for their physical, chemical, and geological properties to unravel the environmental and climatic history of Indonesia.  Indonesia is located in the so-called Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, a region with the warmest ocean waters anywhere on Earth.  This warmth fuels the largest zone of heavy tropical rainfall in the world, and changes in this rainfall pattern can influence climate worldwide (such as occurs during El Ni&ntilde;o events).  In addition to understanding climate change, Lake Towuti has an extraordinary biologial diversity, highlighted by the regon's rainforests.  The lake also has an exotic chemistry derived from peculiar, metal-rich rocks in its catchment.  We used the cores from Lake Towuti to understand changes in regional biodiversity and chemistry through time in this environment.\n\nThe project recovered over 1000 meters of cores from the lake, which contain sediments deposited during the last 1 million years.  This is by far the longest record of terrestrial environments from this region.  Our results indicate that Indonesian rainfall, as well as the region's rainforests and Lake Towuti itself, are very sensitive to the Earth's glacial-interglacial cycles.  This is important, as it suggests that hydroclimate in this region could be an important feedback to the glacial-interglacial cycles.  Moreover, our results suggest Indonesian rainfall is sensitive to glacial-interglacial forcings, including changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, global temperatures, and ice sheet extent.  Comparing our climate estimates to climate model predictions, we find that model underestimate climate changes in this region, suggesting large changes in rainfall in this region in the future.\n\nAs part of our research activities, this grant provided scientific research training opportunities for four Brown graduate students, three undergraduates, and two post- doctoral researchers including four women, one Indonesian student, and one student from an historically underrepresented group.
