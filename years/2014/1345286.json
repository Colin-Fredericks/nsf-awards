 "awd_abstract_narration": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a Future Internet Architecture inspired by years of empirical research into network usage and a growing awareness of unsolved problems in IP. Its premise is that the Internet is primarily used as an information distribution network, which is not a good match for IP, and that the future Internet's \"thin waist\" should be based on named data rather than numerically addressed hosts. This proposal continues research started in 2010 under NSF's FIA program. It applies the principal investigators' (PIs) increasing understanding of NDN opportunities and challenges to two national priorities--Health IT and Cyber-physical Systems--to further evolve the architecture in the experimental manner that has proven successful. The research agenda is organized to translate key results in architecture and security into library code that guides application development towards native NDN designs. It simultaneously continues fundamental research into the challenges of global scalability and opportunities for innovation created by \"simply\" routing and forwarding data based on names.\r\n\r\nThe NDN research agenda includes: 1) Applications--exploring naming and application design patterns; rendezvous, discovery and bootstrapping; the design of in-network storage; and use of new synchronization primitives; 2) Security & trustworthiness--providing basic building blocks of key management, trust management, and encryption-based access control, and anticipating future security challenges; 3) Routing and forwarding strategy--developing and evaluating path-vector, link-state, and hyperbolic options for inter-domain routing, addressing routing security and trust, and designing fast forwarding and mobility support; 4) Scalable forwarding--aiming to support real-world deployment, evaluation and adoption via an operational, scalable forwarding platform; 5) Libraries & tools--developing reference implementations based on the team's fundamental results; 6) Social & economic impacts--considering specific questions of the target environments and broader ones arising in a \"World on NDN.\" The PIs choose Mobile Health and Enterprise Building Automation & Management Systems as specific environments to validate the architecture and drive new research. Domain experts will be 1) Open mHealth, a non-profit patient-centric ecosystem led by Deborah Estrin (Cornell) and Ida Sim (UCSF); and 2) UCLA Facilities Management, operators of the second largest Siemens building monitoring system on the West Coast. To guide research on the security dimensions of these environments and NDN more generally, the NDN team has convened a Security Advisory Council to complement its own effort.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: NDN builds on lessons learned from the success of IP, preserving the thin waist, hierarchical naming, and end-to-end principles. The design recognizes the major shift in the applications communication model, from the \"where\" (i.e., the host/location) to the \"what\" (i.e., the content). Architecting a communications infrastructure around this shift can radically simplify application designs, enabling them to communicate directly using content names they desire and leaving it to the network to figure out how and from where to retrieve it. NDN also recognizes that the biggest weakness in the current Internet architecture is lack of security, and incorporates a fundamental building block to improve security by requiring that all content be signed.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The success of new architectures requires community involvement and uptake. NDN has built momentum through a commitment to an open source model that has spurred substantial research activity in both architecture and current implementation. Project members are often invited to present at \"future Internet\" meetings around the world, and the PIs have performed high-visibility demos of NDN's ability to handle large scale distribution. Industry is also showing increasing participation. Finally, NDN has significantly impacted students, generating several Ph.D. theses, related industry internships, and both graduate and undergraduate classes that can now present a comprehensive alternative to IP to stimulate discussion of what network architecture design really means.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nhe heart of the current Internet architecture is a simple, universal\nnetwork layer (IP) which implements all  the  functionality  necessary\nfor  global  interconnectivity.   This thin  waist was  the  key  enabler\nof  the Internet?s explosive growth, but its design choice of naming\ncommunication endpoints is also the cause of many  of  today?s  persistently\nunsolved  problems.   NDN  retains  the  Internet?s  hourglass  architecture\nbut evolves the thin waist to enable the creation of completely general\ndistribution networks.  The core element of this evolution is removing\nthe restriction that packets can only name communication endpoints.  As\nfar as the network is concerned, the name in an NDN packet can name\nanything &ndash; an endpoint, a data chunk in a movie or a book,  a service,\nor a command to turn on some lights.  This conceptually simple change\nallows NDN networks to use almost all of the Internet?s well-tested\nengineering properties to solve not only communication problems but also\ndigital distribution and control problems.\n\nSeven years of NDN design and development efforts tackled the challenge\nof turning this vision into an architectural framework capable of solving\nreal problems.  An application-driven  architecture  development approach\nforced the team to fill in details and to verify and shape the architecture\ndesign.  The NDN team translated this vision into a simple and elegant\npacket format design, a modular and extensible NDN forwarding daemon,\nand a set of supporting libraries.  The team explored the utility of the\narchitecture for four environments: building automation management\nsystems, mobile health, multimedia conferencing tools, and scientific\ndata applications.  The implementation and testing of pilot applications\nin these network environments motivated research progress in namespace\ndesign, distributed dataset synchronization, trust management,\nencryption-based access control, and stateful forwarding.\n\nTo enable testing and research on mobile platforms, the team developed\nana Android version of the forwarding daemon.  The team also developed\nand maintained supporting software libraries, including new APIs, transport\nmechanisms (Sync, information maximization), and security functionality,\nthat leverage inherent capabilities of NDN, e.g., schematized trust,\nname-based access control.  At least four of the principal investigators\ndeveloped curriculum material and/or entire classes on NDN technology\nand underlying architectural principles.  The team also hosted annual\ncommunity meetings (NDNComm) to promote a vibrant open source\necosystem of research and experimentation around NDN.\n\nNDN has gained increasing attention in the broader networking community,\nas evidenced by the NSF/Intel?s new program on Information Centric\nNetworking at Wireless Edge Networks (ICN-WEN) and DARPA?s Secure Handhelds\non Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program.\nNSF?s FIA and FIA-NP programs have nurtured NDN from an architecture vision\nto an operational prototype.  The conclusion of NSF?s FIA-NP program\nmarks the end of the beginning of an exciting journey in architectureresearch.  Most NDN project team members have received funding to carry\non NDN design and development efforts through other programs, including\nNSF CRI (Univ.  Arizona, Univ, Memphis, UCLA, Washington Univ.), NSF CC*\nIntegration (Colorado State Univ.), and two expected awards from the\nNSF/Intel ICN-WEN program.  The NDN team will continue to expand its\ncollaborative efforts to refine the NDN architecture and demonstrate its\ncapabilities to support 21st century communication scenarios.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly C Claffy"
