 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the initial operations of Future Earth, an international research program that will provide the knowledge required for societies to face the challenges posed by Global Environmental Change (GEC) and to identify opportunities for transitions to global sustainability. Building on 30 years of international collaboration under the ICSU GEC programs, Future Earth aims to facilitate collaboration among natural and social science researchers and stakeholders from many countries. New research ideas and collaborations will emerge from this multidisciplinary framework. Future Earth will also help develop the next generation of globally engaged STEM researchers across many disciplines. This award will allow the interim leaders of Future Earth to begin implementation, continue regional engagement, support clustering of existing GEC projects so that they can make a full contribution to Future Earth, and create a small number of fast track initiatives.",
