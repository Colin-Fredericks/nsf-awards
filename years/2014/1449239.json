 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanism design lays the economic foundations for the design and analysis of economic institutions, social and computer protocols, service provisioning, and other applications where participants may act selfishly in their own best interest. A common paradigm for real-world mechanism design is trial and error: a mechanism is proposed, it is executed, then changes are made to it based on its performance. In order to make these changes an econometric analysis must be undertaken, i.e., the participants' actions in the mechanism (assumed to be in equilibrium) must be reverse engineered to obtain the participants' preferences. Using these inferred preferences, potential changes to the mechanism can be evaluated and ranked.  While mechanism design theory for the most part relies on knowledge of the market, real world mechanisms tend to do some market analysis on the fly. The PIs research will combine econometric inference with mechanism design theory to investigate the econometric properties of mechanisms and design mechanisms that are simultaneously good at market analysis and exploiting that information to attain an objective specified by the mechanism designer.\r\n\r\nThis research program will introduce econometric techniques to computer science and will bring together topics from computer science and economics that have yet to be studied together. For example, these issues are very important in practice especially in the rapidly growing areas of sponsored search and targeted display advertising where auction mechanisms have been deployed for pricing and placement of advertisements and a major challenge is in adjusting the mechanisms in response to past data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This  project develops data-driven methods that enable a principal to adjust  the parameters of an auction so as to optimize its performance, i.e.,  for \"mechanism redesign\". We study a paradigmatic family of auctions and  develop a method for counterfactual inference that allows the  equilibrium revenue or welfare of one auction in the family to be  estimated from the equilibrium bids in another.  One application of this  method is a framework for A/B testing of auctions, a.k.a., randomized  controlled trials, wherein an auctioneer can compare the revenue of  auctions A and B.  Another application is in instrumented optimization  where we identify sufficient properties of an auction so that the  revenue of any counterfactual auction can be estimated from equilibrium  bids of the former; we then optimize revenue over auctions with these  properties.\nIntellectual Merit:\nThe  main technical contribution of this work is a method for counterfactual  revenue estimation: given two auctions we define an estimator for the  equilibrium revenue of one from equilibrium bids of the other.  Our  estimator has a number of appealing properties that contrast with the  standard econometric approach to inference in auctions. In the standard  approach, first the value distribution is inferred from bids of the  first auction using equilibrium analysis, and then the estimated value  distribution is used to calculate the expected equilibrium revenue of  the second auction.  To infer the value distribution, the standard  approach employs estimates of the derivative of the bid function via an  estimator that typically must be tuned to trade-off bias and variance  using assumptions on the bid distribution.  In contrast, our method  estimates revenue directly from the bids and our estimator requires no  distribution dependent tuning.  Our method is statistically efficient  with estimation error proportional to one over the square root of the  number of observed bids.\nBroader Impact:\nIn  2015 the PIs organized the first Workshop on Algorithmic Game Theory  and Data Science in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Economics and  Computation (EC 2005), prominently featuring work on this project. The  workshop received a huge amount of attention and has led to this area  receiving a considerable amount of focus from researchers in the field.\nOur  results can be applied to problems in online market place design of,  for example, Uber, Zillow, Booking.com, Google, etc.  Results from this  proposal have been presented to research groups at technology companies  like these and have played an important role in collaboration with these  companies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Denis Nekipelov"
