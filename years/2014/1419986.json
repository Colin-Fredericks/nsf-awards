 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine communities of the northern and southern hemispheres are kept distinct by warm water and strong currents near the equator. Nevertheless, many taxa have established \"antitropical\" distributions, occurring in temperate zones on either side of the tropics but not within the warmest tropical regions. Although paleontological studies and molecular phylogenies provide information about the timing and direction of trans-tropical colonization, the existence of single species with antitropical distributions provides an opportunity to begin to investigate several fundamental questions about the recent history of and future prospects for biological connectivity between the northern and southern hemispheres. This project focuses on characterizing connectivity across the tropics in the antitropical gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans. This eastern Pacific species is found in both hemispheres but is absent from the warmest waters immediately to the north of the equator. Previously-collected data show that mtDNA haplotype lineages are shared between northern and southern hemisphere populations, and that the separation between north and south has been relatively recent, within the last 160,000 years. This research has two main goals. First, the investigators will use multi-locus sequence data and microsatellite loci to estimate the time of separation of northern and southern populations and how much gene flow has occurred since that split, both over evolutionary timescales and across recent generations. The second goal is to characterize larval thermal tolerance and performance as a means to test the hypothesis that temperature is a barrier to larval dispersal across the warmest tropical regions in P. elegans. Although several other hypotheses can potentially explain what keeps P. elegans out of the tropics, such as the isolating effects of the equatorial boundary currents or post-settlement processes, assessing the temperature sensitivity of the dispersive larval stage will provide the first important physiological test of how temperature limits connectivity. Understanding the history of gene flow and the temperature tolerance of dispersive larvae will provide insight into the impacts of recent and projected increases in tropical sea surface temperatures on recent and future patterns of connectivity between the hemispheres.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide financial support and training in fieldwork, population genetics, and larval ecology for two graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers. Undergraduate students will be involved with aspects of the research through a hands-on lab class taught in Molecular Population Biology and recruitment from courses taught at Clemson. The investigators will also continue to engage a local school district (LaFrance, South Carolina) via classroom visits by scientists (PI, graduate students, and postdocs). The investigators publish actively in leading scientific journals and written invited contributions for the fields of biogeography and life history evolution. Research in the their labs is disseminated via web pages and previous work has reached the public through a wide variety of media outlets.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the central goals of ecology is to find out why species live where they do.  Understanding adaptations that allow species to survive and reproduce in their native habitats helps us understand the processes that generate new species, and sheds light on how environmental change can disrupt species\u00c6 ranges and cause populations to differentiate and potentially form new species.   This research focused on Pollicipes elegans, an intertidal marine barnacle with an unusual geographic distribution in the tropical eastern Pacific ocean.  The distribution of P. elegans is \"antitropical\": abundant at the edges of the warmest waters of the tropical eastern Pacific but rare within this warm region, an area known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).  These northern (Mexico: cool tropical), southern (Peru: cool tropical), and central (El Salvador: warm tropical) populations of P. elegans live in regions that differ substantially with respect to temperature and seasonality. \n\nWe used a combination of genetic and physiological data to test hypotheses about the origins of P. elegans and its ability to adapt to different temperatures.  Adults are stationary and cannot move, so colonization of new habitats and exchange of genes between populations happen at the larval stage; larvae are generally thermally sensitive, so high water temperatures may may isolate adult populations from each other, potentially leading to local adaptation or even speciation.  We first used microsatellite frequencies and DNA sequence data to estimate the timing of separation between populations of P. elegans in Mexico, El Salvador, and Peru, as well as to measure the amount of larval dispersal and genetic connectivity between these three distant populations.  We found that the antitropical distribution of P. elegans did not form in a stepping-stone-like manner, as would have been expected. Instead, P. elegans used to be more abundant in the warm ITCZ but expanded its range north and south in the last several hundred thousand years, likely in response to climate change.  The northern population is genetically very distinct from the other two, suggesting that P. elegans is in the process of separating into at least two species. \n\nOur larval experiments showed that larvae of the three populations were physiologically adapted to the different temperatures in their respective regions.  We showed this by describing the optimum, deteriorating, and lethal temperature ranges for larval metabolic performance.  We found that all three populations live within their respective optimal ranges, but larvae from Mexico are close to the upper limit of their optimum during warm months and therefore have limited capacity to disperse through warmer waters that currently isolate them from central populations.  Larvae from the southern population (Peru) also would not be likely to tolerate tropical temperatures, so for the southern and northern P. elegans populations, high tropical temperatures are likely to be a direct physiological barrier to equatorward dispersal.  Only a handful of studies have explicitly examined geographic variation in thermal performance of larvae, even though larvae are often the life stage that allows species to exchange genes between populations and to colonize new areas.   Our study is also one of the first to show that tropical populations are living further from their thermal limits than conspecific extratropical populations.\n\nOverall, our study indicates that repeated cyclical global warming and cooling, which causes expansion and contraction of ancestral tropical species\u00c6 ranges into adjacent subtropical regions, is punctuated by periodic geographic isolation and adaptation of populations to their local temperature environment.  Our work suggests that climate-driven geographic isolation and adaptation may be an important driver of tropical marine species diversity. \n\nThe data generated from this research can be accessed online at http://www.bco-..."
