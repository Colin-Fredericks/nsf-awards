 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interactions of fluids and solids control some of the most critical geochemical and geodynamic processes in subduction zones. These include flux melting of the mantle and geochemical transport by fluids and magma, possible rheological weakening of the mantle wedge, and control of seismicity and fault mechanics.  Quantitative models for the solid mantle flow have been developed but there has been relatively little work to numerically simulate the production, transport, and coupled interactions of fluids and melts with the solid. This requires a more general computational framework that can deal with a wide range of uncertainty both in the physical model and input parameter space.  This project continues the development of TerraFERMA (the Transparent Finite Element Rapid Model Assembler), which will be used to: quantify potential fluid and solid flow paths at subduction zones; develop a better understanding of reactive, open system flux melting; and investigate the effects of fluids on solid-state rheology.  Model predictions will be tested against a suite of observations from the relatively robust location of arc volcanism to the compositions of lava samples produced at these sites. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project include support of an early career scientist working at the interface between computational and Earth science and the development of a new computer code for integrating geochemical and geochemical dynamics in subduction zones. The resulting computer code will be incorporated into holdings of Computational Infrastructure for Geosciences, which provides open access to software for scientific purposes. Increased understanding of mantle deformation, magmatism, and thermal structure of the Earth at subduction zones could lead to improved knowledge of where brittle behavior (earthquakes) is more or less likely along the megathrust fault that marks the boundary between the downgoing plate and the surrounding mantle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nArc volcanism associated with subduction zones is a result of melting of the Earth's mantle and the subsequent migration of that melt to the surface of the Earth.  The mantle isn't hot enough to melt by itself so this melting takes place only in the presence of sufficient quantities of water, which has been transported from the ocean floor to great depth (~100km) by the subducting oceanic crust (the slab).  This water is released from the slab as it travels down, increasing in temperature and pressure along the way and injecting the water into the mantle at whatever depth it is no longer stable in the slab.  Around the world slabs start their journey into the Earth at different temperatures so the water is expected to be released at different depths in different subduction zones.  The aim of this project was to make progress reconciling this prediction with the observation that the volcanoes occur at a very consistent location relative to the slab.  To do this we require a focusing mechanism to transport the water from a range of depths to the location of the volcano.  The primary candidate to focus this fluid is the resistance of the mantle to the opening of pore space as the fluid travels through it.  This resistance interacts with many other aspects of the model, like the tendency of cold regions of the mantle to suck up the water or the growth of large mineral grains in hot areas of the mantle.\n\nThe interactions of different aspects of the physics of these models makes them inherently difficult to model.  There is a lot of uncertainty about which variables to consider or even what equations to solve.  It also becomes challenging to succinctly describe these models in publications, which is important if the scientific results are going to be understandable and reproducible.  As part of this project we have developed a software framework that allows models to be fully described in a single file, which can then be distributed with publications.  It uses advanced software libraries developed for use by computational scientists and developers.  Our hope is that our framework makes these tools more accessible to a larger community of geodynamic researchers beyond our application of it to subduction zones.  The framework (called TerraFERMA) is available online at terraferma.github.io.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cian R Wilson"
