Many modern systems including lasers, thermoelectric energy converters, and transistors are based on materials containing structures much smaller than one micron.  These structures can cause very large reductions in the thermal conductivity,  sometimes by a factor of ten or more, as compared to the familiar bulk values reported in handbooks.  To predict and engineer the thermal conductivity in both bulk and microstructured materials, it is essential to understand the mean free paths of the energy carriers, that is, the average distance between their collisions.  Although various models of the thermal conductivity have been used widely for more than half a century, when these models are applied to microstructures they often exhibit large disagreements with each other.  The heart of the model disagreements is their different mean free path calculations, yet direct experimental measurements of the full distribution of mean free paths have not been reported to date for any material.  Therefore, the primary goal of this CAREER proposal is to experimentally measure the full distribution of mean free paths in several standard materials.     \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this objective, this project will pursue two complementary experimental strategies, designed to cover a very large range of length and time scales.  The first approach involves systematic measurements of steady-state conduction in microstructures with sizes ranging from around 50 nm to around 100 microns.  The data will then be transformed into mean free path spectra using a new Fredholm integral equation.  The  second approach involves measuring ultrafast thermal transients ranging from around 0.1 ns to around 10 microseconds, and analyzed using the Boltzmann transport equation. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this CAREER proposal is in advancing the fundamental understanding of thermal conductivity.  By experimentally quantifying the real mean free path distributions, these measurements will help identify which of the standard models in use today can actually be correct.  This project will also test a postulate recently introduced by Y. K. Koh and D. Cahill to relate their observed frequency-dependent thermal conductivity to a mean free path distribution.  The project also proposes to develop an all-electrical pump-probe apparatus that should be more accessible and less costly than the important optical pump probe experimental technique.      \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include both engineering relevance and an education/outreach component.  The fundamental knowledge gained will be relevant for a wide range of materials systems including alloys, crystalline materials, and amorphous materials, and for thermal engineering of numerous applications including lasers, transistors, and thermoelectric energy conversion.  The outreach activities are built around workshops at regional high schools based on thermoelectric energy conversion and visualizing the nanoworld at the human scale.  At the end of each workshop the workshop materials will be donated to the classroom for their future use.  The workshop content has already been strengthened by two iterations with the intended high school science teachers, and one teacher will be recruited and supported for a summer to optimize the workshop content and disseminate it on a website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis primary objective, and outcome, of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of how heat is carried in solids materials.  One of the greatest differences between a material that conducts heat easily, such as diamond, as compared to one that resists heat flow, such as glass, is the ease with which heat carriers can travel through the material.  In good thermal conductors, the heat carriers travel relatively long distances between collisions, a length known as the mean free path.  For many practical materials around room temperature, the heat is carried by atomic vibrations known as phonons, and the mean free paths important for heat conduction are thought to range widely, from ~10 nanometers to ~10 microns.  However, various models to predict the distribution of mean free paths can disagree with each other, and it is not easy to design suitable experiments to measure the distribution directly.  Further, designing and interpreting such an experiment requires careful theoretical modeling.  Motivated by these needs and challenges, this CAREER project resulted in several experimental and analytical outcomes which advance the fundamental understanding of the mean free path distribution in semiconductor and dielectric materials. \n\n \n\nOne set of experiments compared pure silicon (Si) to alloys of silicon with germanium (SiGe), the first measurements of this kind on large single crystal alloy samples.  The results showed that even though the alloy has additional scattering mechanisms, its heat conduction is actually dominated by longer mean free paths.  This result that appears initially paradoxical, but was predicted by the majority of previously published models.\n\n \n\nAnother set of experiments studied the effects of grain size and grain boundary scattering as compared to pure single crystals, again the first measurements of their kind, and using silicon as a model system.  The results show how the grains mainly scatter the long mean free path phonons, shifting the distribution to shorter values.  There is both a fundamental and practical elegance to the complementary nature of these two studies: the first mechanism shifts the distribution to longer values, while the second mechanism shifts it to shorter.\n\n \n\nTo strengthen the experimental understanding, this project also undertook two significant modeling studies.  In the first, we rigorously derived a mathematical framework used to understand the physics of the mean free path distribution, and developed a technique to relate the experimental measurements at steady state to the underlying distribution.  In the other, we studied the relationships between the surface temperature, heat flow, and the mean free path distribution, to help guide and interpret a class of experiments where the surface of a sample is heated periodically.\n\n \n\nThis project also supported several outreach activities.  For two summers, our research lab hosted a teacher pair as part of the BERET program (Berkeley Engineering Research Experience for Teachers), mentored by a PhD student from the lab.  As an example of their work, using the support of the CAREER project, in the first summer they built a demonstration rig to show fundamental concepts about energy using a thermoelectric module, including the ability to convert heat to electricity and vice-versa, which was then given to the teacher to keep and use in her own science classroom.  This project has also supported the design and building of other related energy-conversion demonstrations for the Science and Engineering Community Outreach (SECO) group at Berkeley, and our public outreach at a science night at the California Academy of Sciences. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chris E Dames"
