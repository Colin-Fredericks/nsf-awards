The study will encompass the Dan River, site of a recent coal ash spill.   It has significant benefits to environmental and public health protection. The synergized arrays of education outreach and public education programs and strategies related to leading-edge water quality monitoring technology, as well as environmental and health implications of coal ash contamination of river water, will bridge the gap between scientific research, field implementation and public health protection. They will present the technology, benefits, and societal and environmental impact of rapid scientific community response to disasters to a wide range of audiences at various levels.\r\n \r\nThe proposed study will demonstrate the application of a  toxicogenomics-enabled in vitro assay scheme and methodology platform that can be an effective toxicity evaluation method for timely and informative water quality monitoring, as urgently needed by incidents like the Carolina coal ash spill. The results will lead to a paradigm shift in water remediation efficacy assessment from methods that suffer from often biased and limited chemical information to a more reliable method that identifies realistic endpoints and better reflects the actual risks to receptors. This will provide timely and useful information needed to facilitate containment and response strategies development and, to help inform the public and government of any potential ecological and health impacts associated with the spill.",

The contaminants of primary environmental concern in coal ash contain selenium, mercury and arsenic. However, the effects of other constituents, such as cadmium, lead, chromium, copper, nickel and zinc, and of the ash itself are also a concern. In addition, as the byproduct of coal combustion, many of those trace elements and heavy metals are concentrated in coal ash.

This study aims to provide a fast and initial assessment of the toxicity of the Dan River water and sediment with spatial and temporal resolution. We collected both river water and sediment samples along the river at multiple locations and at different time points after the spill. We applied an array of toxicity assessment methods including both conventional cytotoxicity tests as well as quantitative toxicogenomics and <em>in vitro</em> molecular assays targeting a variety of toxicity endpoints and mechanisms including oxidative stress, DNA damage stress and potential genotoxicity, protein stress, membrane stress and general stress. In addition, we measured the spatial and temporal changes in various metals and investigated the major drivers among them for reactive toxicity by testing the toxicity of designed mixtures of 12 metals at their detected concentrations. The results suggested that the distribution of heavy metals and toxicity profiles of both surface water and sediment leaching change with time and location, likely related to the transport and differential fate of ash particles of different size and density. There seemed to be an increase in toxicity in sediments leaching at locations downstream of the spill compared to up-stream control at widelife access point. There was no clear trend of water toxicity and metal concentrations observed in the river water samples, likely due to the rather quick dilution and washing effects from the river. Sediment leaching water showed generally higher molecular toxicity than surface water and also seems to lead to specific higher toxic effect on cellular chemical and protein stress.
