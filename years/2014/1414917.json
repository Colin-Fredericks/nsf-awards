 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural disasters often lead to catastrophic conditions making human response efforts risky and potentially hazardous. Consequently, there is an increased need to develop robotic systems capable of collaboratively navigating and collecting information in unstable environments. Current collaborative robotic systems capable of navigating these environments are limited in their ability to process and combine their individually collected data.  Post processing at an off-site location is usually necessary and may not be achieved in time enough to initiate a strategic response. This research will lead to the development of an onsite robotic system capable of processing information from other robotic systems in real-time. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Makoto Kumon who has expertise in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) and is developing a collaborative MAV acoustic localization system at Kumamoto University.  Dr. Kumon's system provides an application and a platform for developing a robotic system capable of real-time complex data processing.  This research will provide an important contribution toward the response of autonomous robotic systems in dynamic and complex environments.\r\n\r\nThe system will be an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) which is capable of traversing through indoor environments as well as outdoor environments. The UGV will act as a compact mobile base station capable of receiving and processing data from a team of MAVs.  The MAVs will collect acoustic data of a sound source at an unknown location. The goal of the research is for the UGV to be capable of processing the acoustic data to obtain a belief of the source location in real-time. The objective is for the UGV to recursively update the belief of the sound source location as it searches for it and continually receives data from the MAVs.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this research sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) was to develop a robotic platform capable of processing data from multiple sensor nodes into a globally consisten model of the environment.  This is a relatively computionally expensive and complex problem and required the platform to have the computational resources necessary to meet this demand.  This system was also required to be mobile, allowing it to autonomously navigate to a location of interest.  The completion of this system would serve as a platform for research in collaborative robotics and research in multi-sensor fusion techniques for roboic navigation.  Through the East Asian and Pacific Summer Institute fellowship this system was completed and was involved in data collection for initiatives in collaborative robotics and multi-sensor fusion.  These initiatives are ongoing and involve a continued collaboration between American and Japanese students.\n\nOne project involving this system is an autonomous all-terrain mobile relay station for processing and transmitting data for outdoor acoustic localization.  This is a collaborative robotic project, involving micro aerial vehicle tracking and path planning.  Another research project involving this system, is a multi-sensory approach to outdoor robotic navigation in a densely dynamic environment.  Both research initiatives make contributions to the advancement of robotic applications in real world environments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Howard Brand"
