 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MIST project aims to increase the success of STEM majors at the University of Maine at Machias (UMM), a small, rural, public liberal arts college with a curriculum built around issues of environmental and community sustainability. Like colleges in many rural and economically challenged regions, where educational attainment rates are significantly and chronically lower, UMM excels at providing critical education and workforce development, but science majors have lower retention and graduation rates than their peers. Persistence from the first to the second year of college has been identified as a key bottleneck limiting student success. The MIST project will transform the first-year experience for freshman science majors using practices shown to improve retention, focusing specifically on the needs of students who have risk factors associated with high drop-out rates, such as poverty, being the first in their family to attend college, or belonging to an underserved minority group. The project will build on the success of preliminary work by (1) instituting a 10-day summer program and other supports to help at-risk students transition to college, (2) restructuring tutoring services to supplement the instruction that students receive in classes, (3) incorporating more inquiry-based and problem-solving learning experiences, and (4) developing better approaches to career awareness and preparation. Increasing the number of STEM graduates will help to meet workforce demands while ensuring that students have access to rewarding and well-paid jobs locally.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will adapt key best practices to improve first-to-second-year retention rates. In particular, they will undertake the following four initiatives:\r\n\r\n(1) Implementing a 10-day bridge program and residence hall learning communities to support transition to college and overcome barriers to attendance and success for at-risk students and underserved students (e.g., first-in-family college attendees, rural poor, and minority students). Questions to be used to measure success include: How effective are the various elements of the bridge program in (a) increasing STEM excitement and determination, (b) decreasing the need for developmental math courses, (c) creating effective study skills, and (d) increasing awareness of compelling STEM educational pathways and careers?\r\n\r\n(2) Implementing a Supplemental Instruction (SI) program to boost student persistence and success by providing structured group instruction that is highly integrated with classroom and laboratory activities. Questions to be used to measure success include: What effects, if any, does SI/tutoring have on (a) student performance in tutored courses and (b) general MIST program goals (excitement, determination, study skills, awareness of and interest in STEM courses and careers)?\r\n\r\n(3) Transforming instruction in all first-year STEM courses to incorporate more inquiry- and problem-based learning, career awareness, and engaging field experiences. Questions to be used to measure success include: What elements of transforming the instruction in key foundational courses (content, instructional technique, tutoring, etc.) are associated with (a) an increase in student achievement, satisfaction, confidence, and engagement and (b) first-to-second year retention?\r\n\r\n(4) Developing career awareness and preparation activities and resources for first-year students. Questions to be used to measure success include: To what degree do the MIST career website and alumni-student exchange activities increase awareness in first-year students of STEM career opportunities and educational pathways?",
