 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170?, general purpose, Ocean/Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125? general purpose Coastal/Local vessel. All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. \r\n\r\nBoth R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Melville are Global vessels owned by the Navy.  They support multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all of the world?s ocean basins. R/V New Horizon, owned by the State of California, focuses primarily on offshore California but has been used for work throughout the Pacific. The primary working area for R/V Sproul, also owned by the State of California, has been the continental shelf and coastal environments off Southern California. In 2013, R/V Roger Revelle completed 266 days, 73 (27%) of which were for NSF. Melville completed 307 days, with 169 (55%) being for NSF. New Horizon sailed 163 days and 57 (35%) were for NSF while Sproul had 31 total days with 10 (30%) funded by NSF. \r\nThe schedule for 2014 shows Revelle with 247 total days with 62 (25%) of them for NSF. Melville is scheduled to sail 128 days with 80 (63%) of them for NSF. New Horizon has 144 total days with 62 (43%) for NSF and Sproul has 13 days scheduled with no NSF days in 2014.\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\t1) Deadweight Tester\t$  15,425 \r\n\t2) H2000 ROV Spares\t  $  40,933\r\n\t\t$  56,358 \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

However, the department had no spare components for the vehicle. Any failure, no matter how small, will end ROV operations until repair can be made or a replacement component is purchased.  \n\nA minimal set of spares was determined for offshore ROV operations by the manufacturer. Funds from this award were used to purchase these items. They are now carried to sea with the ROV.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Woody C Sutherland"
