 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated analyses of sedimentary basin evolution, structural timing, and geochronology of bedrock and basin fill will better define the history of erosional exhumation, thrust-fault propagation, tectonic subsidence, and structural partitioning of the Andean fold-thrust belt and proximal foreland basin in west-central Argentina.  The project focuses on the delineation of north-south variations among three key regional transects along the transition from the central to southern Andes at 31-35 degrees south.  Although available evidence suggests periods of rapid eastward advance of Cenozoic fold-thrust deformation toward the craton, the temporal and spatial relationships are not well resolved.  Further unclear is the degree to which the structural and sedimentary processes have been influenced by major north-south contrasts in the geometry of the subducted Nazca slab, the magmatic history of the Andean volcanic arc, and the configuration of inherited pre-Cenozoic structures.  This field-based investigation will generate sedimentary, structural, and chronological datasets to compare and contrast the detailed evolution of the distinct frontal tectonic zones in the eastern retro-arc region of the Andes Mountains in order to evaluate the advance of shortening and erosional recycling of foreland basin fill.\r\n\r\nThe transition from the central to southern Andes includes the best-understood example of modern flat-slab subduction and a key example of inversion tectonics by reactivation of preexisting rift structures.  This active continental margin provides an excellent opportunity to examine the potential controls on rapid advance of crustal shortening and wholesale partitioning of adjacent foreland basins, a process suggested for other convergent orogenic systems.  A detailed investigation of basin development and bedrock exhumation in the eastern retro-arc zones will allow us to explore the potential importance of structural inversion and magmatic pulses in the advance of the deformation front, as well as the dynamic upper lithospheric response and surface expression, or lack thereof, resulting from flat-slab subduction.  This will further understanding of Andean tectonics and provide valuable insights that can be extrapolated to regions of current and past flat-slab subduction in other convergent systems.\r\n\r\nThe project will support field and laboratory investigations by a faculty member, a postdoctoral scholar, and graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at Austin.  These efforts will be integrated with those of regional experts from academic institutions and the hydrocarbon industry in Argentina.  This project will promote new international academic-industry collaborations and establish the framework for academic exchange visits, in order to providing reciprocal international learning experiences and facilitating longer term research collaborations. The project will also support public outreach and education through existing programs in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT-Austin, including the GEOFORCE program.\r\n\r\nFunds to support the international activities associated with this project are being provided by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     This geoscience research project addressed the evolution of the Andes Mountains and foreland basin system in west-central Argentina, near the transition between the Central Andes and Southern Andes.\n\nThe project investigated the timing and eastward advance of mountain building in the fold-thrust belt and resulting partitioning of the original foreland basin into a series of smaller, compartmentalized sedimentary basins.  The results reveal a complex Mesozoic-Cenozoic geologic history of basin development, fault activity, and bedrock exhumation, with implications for understanding the mechanisms driving crustal shortening and surface uplift along ocean-continent convergent plate boundaries.  The selected study regions also enabled delineation of the upper lithospheric response and surface consequences resulting from the temporal and spatial transition from initial steep-slab to later flat-slab subduction.\n\n     The investigation evaluated the evolution of distinct tectonic zones in the eastern Andes in order to constrain the eastward advance of shortening deformation and recycling of foreland basin sediments.  This was addressed through an integrated multi-proxy approach that utilized sedimentary basin analysis, structural mapping, and geo/thermo-chronology of bedrock and Neogene basin fill of the Andean fold-thrust belt and foreland basin system along three east-west transects: San Juan (31.5&deg;S), Mendoza (33&deg;S), and Malarg&uuml;e (35&deg;S) transects.  The reigning paradigm is that the Frontal Cordillera thrust belt was structurally activated at ~10 Ma, with subsequent eastward advance of faulting into the Precordillera, which was progressively uplifted from ~5 to 2 Ma in response to late Cenozoic shallowing of the subducting Nazca slab.  Our results contrast with this paradigm and show that rapid exhumation of the Precordillera commenced at ~12-9 Ma, similar to timing of large-scale, rapid advance of deformation and foreland basin partitioning observed along strike in the north-central Andes of Bolivia and Peru.  The higher resolution results identify discrepancies in kinematic histories and basin evolution, which prove critical to better understanding the influence of variations in subduction geometry/dynamics on lithospheric deformational processes in conjunction with sedimentary and surface processes.  The Argentine Andes (27&ndash;36&deg;S) remain perhaps the world?s best example of active flat-slab subduction, offering insights that can be extrapolated to ancient flat-slab system dynamics in ocean-continent convergent plate boundaries (including the Laramide orogenic system and pre-collisional Tibetan plateau).\n\n     This research project provided field, classroom, and laboratory training for 16 graduate and undergraduate research assistants: 4 Ph.D. students at the University of Texas at Austin (including two international students, one a citizen of Argentina), and 12 graduate and undergraduate research assistants from UT-Austin and the Universidad Nacional de San Juan (UNSJ), San Juan, Argentina.  They received laboratory and field training in sedimentology, stratigraphy, sandstone petrography, U-Pb geochronology, and U-Th/He thermochronology.  During the project, the Ph.D. students obtained additional graduate research grants from several scientific societies.  Two Ph.D students were awarded prestigious three-year NSF Graduate Research Fellowships and one received Honorable Mention.  The undergraduate assistants from UT-Austin obtained instruction in rock sample processing, mineral separation, and interpretation of sediment provenance data.\n\n     The project initiated collaborative ties with international academic and industrial partners in Argentina, including the Universidad Nacional de San Juan (UNSJ) and hydrocarbon companies YPF, Tecpetrol, and Pluspetrol.  Three UNSJ graduate students were involved in field research in Argentina.  The PIs and Ph.D. students gave professional lectures and conducted field activities with international collaborators, and hosted an international Ph.D. student at UT-Austin.
