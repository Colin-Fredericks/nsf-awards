The project will recruit Ambassadors from community college personnel, amateur astronomers, and planetaria, and provide them with training in science communication and public outreach. The Ambassadors will subsequently have hands-on, in-depth experiences at three major U.S. observatories: the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Gemini Observatory, and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Finally, the Ambassadors will disseminate their newfound knowledge to the public, providing a pathway to connect the American public to U.S. scientific investments overseas.",

By 2025 it is estimated that Chile will be home to 70% of the world's ground-based astronomy infrastructure. The U.S. is a major investor in astronomical observatories in Chile. Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), Las Campanas Observatory (LCO), Gemini, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the up and coming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and eventually the Giant Magellan Telescope Observatory (GMTO) are all examples of major U.S. investments in astronomy research facilities in Chile. The U.S. contribution to ALMA construction alone was $500 million; LSST is expected to cost $665 million, and GMTO more than $700 million.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many advantages to an informed citizenry, in particular when it comes to understanding science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).&nbsp; However, a significant challenge for these facilities is keeping the U.S. citizenry informed about the investments being made, and the significant benefits of building and maintaining these observatories nearly half a world away in Chile. The Astronomy in Chile Educator Ambassadors Program (ACEAP) developed an innovative program strategy to address this issue. ACEAP brings amateur astronomers, planetarium personnel, and K-16 formal and informal astronomy educators to U.S. astronomy facilities in Chile. While at these facilities, ACEAP Ambassadors receive extensive training about the instruments, the science, data products, and communicating STEM concepts to the public. Throughout the expedition in Chile and when they return home, the Ambassadors share their experiences and observatory resources with schools and community groups across the US through a variety of media and face-to-face presentations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 2015 and 2016 ACEAP brought together two diverse groups of astronomy educators and outreach professionals. Each cohort consisted of nine Ambassadors. The Ambassadors funded their travel between the U.S. and Santiago, Chile. Grant funds supported travel expenses during the nine-day expedition in Chile, and provided a $500 stipend to each Ambassador following completion of their seven required outreach events/activities. While in Chile, Ambassadors visited the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), Gemini-South Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA). In addition, Ambassadors visited two tourist observatories, Observatorio Astronomico Andeno and Cerro Mayu Observatory, and local schools where the professional observatories engage in astronomy education and outreach. Throughout the expedition in Chile the Ambassadors worked to gain a deeper understanding of the professional observatories, their outreach efforts and resources, and the larger picture of astronomy in Chile and why it is perhaps the best place in the world for ground-based astronomy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2015 and 2016 Ambassador cohorts engaged in a wide variety of outreach activities including school visits and other public talks, blogs, TV/radio broadcast, published articles, live broadcasts back to their home institutions from Chile, etc. Ambassadors have recorded more than 150 ACEAP related education/outreach activities, reaching nearly 15,000 people via face-to-face interactions/presentations, and potentially over 400,000 people via Internet, radio, TV, and print media. It is important to note, Ambassadors continue to use knowledge and resources from their experience in Chile in their ongoing outreach activities. Further, external evaluation of the project indicates a high level of success. Ambassadors noted how ACEAP helped them to hone their presentation techniques to make them more personal and therefore more engaging. Strong improvement was found in Ambassadors&rsquo; comfort discussing U.S. astronomy endeavors in Chile with an average two-point increase on the five-point Likert scale; their knowledge of how to use social media as a marketing and educational tool also increased by more than one point. Ambassadors also continue their interactions with each other and Observatory personnel they met in Chile.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACEAP is a collaboration between AUI, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, AURA, The National Optical Astronomy Observatory, and Gemini Observatory, and is supported by the National Science Foundation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439408/1439408_10342231_1513985417708_pic_ACEAP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439408/1439408_10342231_1513985417708_pic_ACEAP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ACEAP at &quot;Light Art&quot; at CTIO\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439408/1439408_10342231_1513985417708_pic_ACEAP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ACEAP at &quot;Light Art&quot; at CTIO\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ACEAP Ambassadors spend two nights at CTIO where they learn about operations and the science taking place at the facility.
