 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how complex characters evolve is central to developing fundamental theories of trait evolution.  One such theory, Dollo's Law, which states that once lost, complex characters cannot be re-evolved, has challenged biologists for more than a century.  Despite recent evidence suggesting that complex characters can and do re-evolve, there is a lack of understanding of how and why these evolutionary reversals take place.  The proposed study will address these questions by elucidating the functional underpinnings and the developmental mechanisms of complex trait re-evolution. This project will result in an unprecedented integration of functional morphology and developmental genetics in an evolutionary framework, facilitating communication between these fields.\r\n\r\nThe research project will use an integrative approach that synthesizes developmental genetics and functional morphology in a phylogenetic framework to study limb and digit loss and subsequent re-evolution in the Southeast Asian burrowing lizard genus Brachymeles.  Objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether a phenotypic trait that has been lost re-evolves with the same or different functional capacities, and whether re-evolved digits develop via the same or different developmental mechanisms as ancestral digits.  Surface locomotor velocity, acceleration, and burrowing speed and force will be quantified using high-speed video and a force transducer for ancestrally and re-evolved pentadactyl, intermediate, and limbless species. The developmental basis of limb and digit reduction and re-evolution in Brachymeles will be characterized to identify hypothesized developmental constraints on limb and digit re-evolution.  Mesenchymal condensations of digits in embryos will be identified using histochemistry and in situ hybridization of nine genes associated with limb and digit patterning. The project will be also involve and train undergraduate and graduate students in research methods and will promote international collaborations.  Minority and female students will be actively recruited and encouraged to participate in the research training opportunities provided by the project.  Biologically themed outreach programs resulting from this project will target disadvantaged communities and local K-12 schools.  Findings from the proposed project will be publicly disseminated online as part of an established biodiversity information website (http://philbreo.lifedesks.org/), at scientific conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, and through other existing databases (http://datadryad.org/).",

Although it has been long hypothesized that once lost, complex characters cannot be re-evolved, recent studies have challenged this argument, referred to as Dollo's Law. This research focused on addressing these questions using an integrative approach that brought together scientists with backgrounds in vertebrate function and kinematics, developmental genetics, phylogenetics, and biodiversity science to study limb and digit transitions in the Southeast Asian burrowing lizard genus&nbsp;<em>Brachymeles</em>. This unique genus of burrowing lizards is found almost exclusively in the Philippines, where species represent a complete spectrum of body forms, from externally limbless, to having limbs with fewer than five digits, to having more typical lizard-like limbs with five digits each. The major objectives of the study were to determine whether a phenotypic trait that has been lost re-evolves with the same or different functional capacities, and whether re-evolved digits develop via the same or different developmental mechanisms as ancestral digits.</p>\n<p>Five international research expeditions were supported during the course of this grant, aimed at collecting relevant functional and developmental data critical for testing hypotheses of limb and digit evolution. Surface locomotion, burrowing force, and morphological and ecological information was collected in the field for 15 target species representing a spectrum of observed body forms, from five-digit to limbless species. In total, complete data is now available for roughly 1,000 running videos, 850 burrowing videos, and more than 1,000 force recordings, associated with site-specific ecological data (i.e., soil particle sizes and load-bearing capacity, soil pH, canopy cover, etc.). During the same expeditions, developmental series were collected for focal species representing distinct body forms (limbless, intermediate, and five-digit species) to address the developmental basis of limb and digit reduction and re-evolution in&nbsp;<em>Brachymeles</em>. Ongoing analyses of functional data from natural experiments will test whether re-evolved digits offer performance advantages to the lizards that have them, while genetic approaches will elucidate developmental patterns in embryos to test whether digits appear to have re-evolved by the re-activation of digit elements early in development.</p>\n<p>One of the exciting, early results published from this work in 2018 in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of Morphology</em>, employed analyses of genetics, morphology, osteology (bones), and myology (muscles) to study limb and digit evolution for the focal genus. The results of this study reveal strong support for digit, but not limb re-evolution; however, only for the hands of these species which have quite modified digit elements with a reduction in hand musculature. The findings stand in contrast to the pattern of digit reduction accepted widely as Morse?s Law, and present the first evidence of distinct modes of digit reduction among major groups of lizards.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong><strong>.</strong>Research expeditions conducted in the Philippines involved three research faculty from three US Universities, one staff curator and one collection manager from the Sam Noble Museum, one postdoctoral researcher from Yale University, two MS and four PhD graduate students, and four undergraduate students from the US (including three women and one African American student). Two of the graduate students from OU went on to secure Fulbright Fellowships for international research projects in the Philippines and Thailand, respectfully, as a result of their exposure to international field research experiences supported by the grant. Additionally, two undergraduate students and a faculty member from the University of the Philippines Los Ba?os and Laguna State Polytechnic University were involved in biodiversity research as part of the grant, resulting in the discovery and description of a new species of slender gecko from the Philippines.</p>\n<p>International expeditions also resulted in the collection of more than 2,700 vouchered amphibian, reptile, and invertebrate specimens and associated datasets from 10 sites across the central and northern Philippines. Ancillary datasets tied to these vouchered collections include more than 4,000 photographs, 600 amphibian infectious disease swabs, and more than 400 microbiome swabs. The surveys led to the discovery of more than 10 new species of lizards, three new species of frogs, and several new species and genera of invertebrates, a number of which have now been described formally in research publications supported by this work.</p>\n<p>Finally, biologically themed outreach programs resulting from this project included workshops and activities in functional morphology,&nbsp;biodiversity, and scientific illustration, including workshops for grade 8?12 students and another for college-level students through Clark University.

Additionally, a new research component was developed into an upper-division, undergraduate Herpetology course at the University of Oklahoma. The classroom research experience has now been offered twice, resulting in three peer-reviewed publications during the first iteration to date, each led by a team of undergraduate students in the course.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cameron&nbsp;D&nbsp;Siler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353683/1353683_10313871_1540871155893_TeamPhoto1_150dpi--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353683/1353683_10313871_1540871155893_TeamPhoto1_150dpi--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Expedition Team Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353683/1353683_10313871_1540871155893_TeamPhoto1_150dpi--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Expedition Team Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of the US and Filipino expedition team for a 2017 trip to the northern Philippines.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cameron D.
