 "awd_abstract_narration": "While many efforts have been made to instill technical and professional skills in engineering graduates,there has been little change in the pedagogy of most engineering education institutions in the U.S.In order to see real, sustainable improvement in engineering education practice, we must have positive change in both the behaviors of the participants and the systems within which these participants act. This work will gather case data and apply organizational theory models to better understand the change management activities and opportunities in one successful model program, Iron Range Engineering, a 100 percent problem-based learning program that grew out of a collaboration between a two-year and a four-year institution. This exploratory study will also lay the groundwork for a larger study to create a guiding model for others trying to build and implement sustainable change in engineering education.\r\n\r\nBy completing a case study of a successful change effort in engineering education and applying organizational management models to analyze this effort, this project will increase the ability for others in engineering education to create and sustain change both\r\nwithin a single course/classroom and across curricula. This will create better infrastructure\r\nfor engineering education to meet the challenges set out by society, industry, government, and the profession in national reports on engineering education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe engineering profession is becoming steadily more global in nature, creating the need for engineering education to develop a graduate who is prepared for a career in this global economy and able to create innovation to help solve the big issues both at home and around the world. There have been many efforts to change engineering education to better reflect this evolving reality, though only a few of the efforts are sustained at the program or degree level. This study set out to better understand why so few efforts have resulted in sustained, positive change by studying the creation of one of the successful programs. \n\nThe successful program we studied is the Iron Range Engineering (IRE) program in Minnesota. Starting in January of 2010, Itasca Community College and Minnesota State University, Mankato collaboratively deliver the IRE program and graduates receive their bachelor's degree in engineering. The core focus of the IRE model is student-empowered development of technical and professional knowledge and competencies in context of industry-sponsored projects.  The program is 100% project-based and does not utilize traditional courses.  Through semester-long projects, students acquire the technical and professional competencies as part of their degree completion.  Each required competency is defined by a set of measurable outcomes; for each outcome students are placed on a Bloom\u00c6s taxonomy-based continuum from novice to expert. This is an exciting innovation in engineering education and one of several models that fit the evolving nature of problems engineers can solve for society.\n\nWe used interviews and focus groups with individuals involved in the creation of IRE as well as organizational artifacts of IRE in contrast to traditional engineering programs to discover the barriers faced by the IRE team as they moved from idea to reality and what they did to overcome these barriers. Interviewing both those who supported the creation of the new program and those who did not (some of whom are still not totally supportive) allowed us to understand the creation process and potential barriers from all perspectives. \n\nWe identified 32 categories and subcategories of perceived barriers to the development and implementation of the IRE program, which were used to code a total of 299 units of text across the 16 interviews.  Of these 32 types of perceived barriers, 10 were determined to be rooted in the issue of credentialing.  A total of 145 units of text, or 48% of all text coded as perceived barriers, were coded with these 10 credentialing-related codes.  Therefore, it appears that credentialing is a significant hurdle to implementing a program such as IRE.  It is also apparent that when stakeholders talk about this type of hurdle, they may not use the term \"credentialing,\" but rather focus on the piece of the credentialing process most relevant to their own position or role. Regardless of the exact terminology used, the types of barriers cited most frequently by those involved in the development and implementation process of the IRE program can be placed under the larger umbrella of credentialing, or the challenges of fitting something new and non-traditional into existing boxes. This is important because many of our systems, including financial aid, sports eligibility, and ability of our veteran's to use their college study benefits, are based on a set of course \"boxes\" into which non-traditional and particularly innovative programs may not fit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer N Karlin"
