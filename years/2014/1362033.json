The center and its partners intend to engage in a cooperative program of research and education in the following key areas: (a) Composites, (b) Foundations, Towers, and Infrastructure (c) Manufacturing and Design, (d) Structural Health Monitoring, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Testing, (e) Control Systems and Energy Storage, and (f) Wind System Planning, Siting, and Operations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed I/UCRC will have broad impacts with respect to the environment, the economy, and education. With large minority populations near Lowell and Dallas, the Center is well situated to involve underrepresented groups within the wind energy field. The Center intends to leverage best practices from several successful programs to develop and integrate educational activities that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse student populations and encourage under-represented minority and female students to pursue STEM careers. In addition to workforce development and R&D, WindSTAR will provide a forum in which multiple facets of the wind industry (e.g., wind turbine manufacturers, manufacturers of key components, materials suppliers, suppliers of ancillary equipment, service companies, and wind project developers) can work together to solve precompetitive problems that hinder the advancement of wind energy.",

The Center is a partnership between academia (UMass Lowell and UT Dallas), the federal government, and the private sector. The Center?s industry partners include OEMs, component suppliers, and owners/operators of wind plants. The current composition of the Industrial Advisory Board of WindSTAR includes 11 Full members and 3 Associate members that span a broad sector of the wind energy industry.</p>\n<p>The goals of the WindSTAR Center are to: (1) conduct research that benefits its wind industry members; (2) bring together university and industry researchers to conduct basic and applied research on wind energy; (3) combine state-of-the-art capabilities and knowledge to execute projects relevant to industry partners; (4) train students in the advanced technologies that are important to industry partners and to have a pipeline of state-of-the-art talent flowing from academia to industry; (5) foster a community for networking, interactions, and collaboration; and (6) help to make wind energy widespread by lowering the levelized cost of energy through performance increases, improved reliability, material components, and modeling capabilities, as well as reduced capital/operating expenditures of wind turbine systems. Throughout the grant period, the WindSTAR Center has been able to make significant strides toward achieving these goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The WindSTAR Center has executed 50 research projects, 26 were led by PIs from UMass Lowell (UML) and 24 were led by PIs from UT Dallas (UTD). The research projects span topics including Composites and Blade Manufacturing; Structural Health Monitoring and Non-destructive Inspection; Wind Plant Modeling and Measurements; Control Systems for Wind Turbines and Wind Plants; Energy Storage and Grid Integration; and Foundation and Towers. The key accomplishments of these research projects were disseminated in 22 journal publications (7 from UML, 15 from UTD), 31 conference papers (13 from UML, 18 from UTD), and resulted in 5 students obtaining their M.S degree (2 from UML, 3 from UTD) and 6 obtaining their Ph.D. degree (2 UML, 4 UTD). Several of these students were hired by member companies and are working in the wind industry or academia. Advancements were made in the understanding of composites, material forming simulation tools, techniques for the detection of damage and defects in materials and blades, structural health monitoring of turbine foundations, blade leading edge erosion, control system algorithms for improved power production, and materials for offshore towers. To date, seven different software packages have been created and delivered to the Center?s members.</p>\n<p>A patent was granted at UML for wind turbine foundation monitoring.&nbsp; The WindSTAR Center faculty and member companies were also awarded several multi-million dollar wind energy related grants supported by NSF, DOE, ONR, and ARPA-E, and the Center received several supplemental funding grants through the NSF such as Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Non-Academic Research Internships for Graduate Students (INTERN).</p>\n<p>The Center leadership has actively recruited new members every year and hosts two in person meetings annually except for summer 2020 through spring 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the meetings were held virtually. Each meeting included a reception and keynote presentation. The Center also executed a ?WindSTAR Day? in which each of the project PIs provided webinars allowing the Center member companies to view them in real time or recorded. In 2020 the Center initiated a webinar series that provides information about a specific research topic of interest and has a broad audience (5000+) in the wind power industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both undergraduate and graduate students have been exposed to scientific research. Many of these students were involved in meetings with companies and presented at scientific conferences. The students also wrote conference and journal papers with guidance from the faculty mentors. At the K-12 level, students and teachers attended wind energy seminars at a middle school and were exposed to experiment engineering and design. Educational materials were produced and widely distributed through social media. The Center has been involved in K-12 outreach via the KidWind Project and created educational materials in collaboration with Futurum. The article was very well received with thousands of engagements across social media platforms (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram).</p>\n<p>A summary of Major Accomplishments is presented for the Center in the 2020 Annual Report for Public Release and can be found on the Center website: <a href=\"http://www.uml.edu/windstar\">www.uml.edu/windstar</a>
