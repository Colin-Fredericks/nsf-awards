 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Spintronics, based on the manipulation of the spin of an electron and not its charge, provides a promising avenue for a more energy efficient and faster architecture for electronics. In order to realize such a new architecture, low dimensional materials with spin polarization are required. In this research project, low dimensional spin polarized metals are developed based on a magnetic insulator grown adjacent to a low dimensional metal. Success of the research can have significant impacts on not only complex oxide materials but also more broadly materials science and device physics. These research activities provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, high-school outreach activities at a newly established high school in the form of mini courses and curriculum development are in progress.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: This research project focuses on the development of emergent materials with spin functionality formed at the interface of a ferromagnetic insulator and a low dimensional electron gas. In order for the ferromagnetic insulator to induce spin polarization in the entire metallic layer, a low dimensional electron gas, made from the surface of perovskite strontium titanate, is combined with a spinel structure oxide material. Understanding the modifications in the electronic and magnetic structure at the non-isostructural interface and the extent to which the electronic and magnetic interactions can be tuned across this interface is the core of this project. The research activities include materials synthesis, structural and magnetic characterization as well as the demonstration of spin dependent effects in transport measurements.",
