 "awd_abstract_narration": "One method for remediating contaminated groundwater is to introduce a chemical solution that will react with and degrade the contaminant.  This remediation method is most successful if the introduced chemical solution is spread throughout the contaminated area. The porous materials through which groundwater flows are naturally heterogeneous, meaning that water flows more easily through some parts and less easily through others.  This heterogeneity naturally causes some spreading, called passive spreading, of the chemical solution into the contaminated groundwater. Additional spreading, called active spreading, can occur by inducing certain time-varying patterns of groundwater flow in the contaminated area. Certain time-varying flows, classified as chaotic advection, are known to substantially enhance active spreading.  \r\n\r\nBoth passive and active spreading lead to enhanced degradation of the contaminant; however, the combined effect of active and passive spreading is not well understood.  In this project, a suite of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations will be used (1) to investigate the interplay between passive and active spreading and the role that each plays in enhancing degradation, and (2) to develop strategies for designing chaotic advection patterns for different patterns of heterogeneity. The laboratory experiments will be conducted using novel laser-based optical techniques to visualize and quantify the combined effects of passive and active spreading on contaminant degradation.  \r\n\r\nActivities such as remediation of contaminated groundwater, extraction of geothermal energy, and certain types of mining of metals all rely on spreading of chemical solutions in porous geological materials.  Because of the natural heterogeneity of geological materials, an understanding of the relationship between heterogeneity and chaotic advection and their effects on spreading is critical to the success of these applications.  This project will also develop new laboratory techniques that could provide a breakthrough in measurement of reactive transport in porous media.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGroundwater, which occupies the pore space within soils and rocks, represents 99% of the world?s supply of liquid fresh water. As such a large reservoir, groundwater represents a valuable supply for drinking water, agricultural irrigation, and industrial demand. If groundwater becomes contaminated, it must be remediated to protect the quality of the water supply.  One method of groundwater remediation is in situ remediation, in which a chemical or biological amendment that can react with and degrade the contaminant is injected into the contaminated groundwater.  Because degradation reactions only occur where the contaminant and amendment are in contact with each other, the success of this remediation process is driven by the ability to spread the amendment throughout the contaminated groundwater.\n\nPrevious numerical simulations showed that the delivery of an amendment into contaminated aquifers can be improved by sequentially injecting and extracting water from a series of wells surrounding the contaminant plume to create time-varying groundwater flow that partially blends the amendment and contaminant plumes.  Through this process, the amendment spreads into the contaminated groundwater more quickly and more uniformly than would occur under natural groundwater flow, so contaminated sites can be remediated more completely and in less time. One challenge to this approach is that soil properties are heterogeneous, i.e., they vary in space, so groundwater and the amendment can flow more easily through some regions of the aquifer than through others.\n\nThe present work, a collaboration between the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Colorado Boulder, used a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of the heterogeneity of soil properties on the spreading and reaction induced by specific injection and extraction sequences.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe major goal of this project is to identify how the physical features of soil heterogeneity and the spatial patterns of induced flow enhance or suppress plume spreading and reaction during in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater.  This investigation was conducted through a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations.  The laboratory experiments simulated transport of the contaminant and amendment plumes in porous media by using Pyrex glass beads as the porous medium, glycerin as the fluid, and fluorescent dye as the contaminant or amendment.  Five ports were used to inject or extract glycerin in a predefined sequence to create time-varying flow fields that transported the dye plume through the porous medium.  A laser excited the dye, and the light intensity of the dye was a surrogate for concentration of the contaminant or amendment.  Several novel experimental techniques were developed for this project, including a method for sequentially simulating the transport of both the contaminant and the amendment with a single dye, and methods for ensuring that fluid movement is not affected by the presence of the apparatus walls. \n\nNumerical simulations were used to isolate the effects of individual flow components and individual heterogeneity features on plume spreading and reaction.  These individual flow components, such as diverging flow from a single well or dipole flow between two wells, form the building blocks of the more complex flows used in the experiment or in other numerical simulations.  The building block flows were validated with the results from the laboratory experiments.\n\nThe key result is that spreading and reaction are enhanced when the flow and heterogeneity combination create plume movement such that the interface between the contaminant and amendment plumes are predominantly perpendicular to the local flow direction.  If the heterogeneity of soil properties at an actual contaminated site is known, the results of this project can be used to design injection and extraction sequences that produce flow fields that complement the heterogeneity and enhance contaminant degradation.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe results of this project can be used to improve remediation of contaminated groundwater by reducing the time required for remediation to acceptable concentration levels, and by producing more complete degradation of the contaminant.  This study focused on the degradation of dissolved contaminants that reacted with dissolved chemicals in the amendment.  The results can be adapted to other reactions such as chemical precipitation, biofilm growth, and dissolution reaction during in situ leach mining.  The results can also inform design of groundwater injection that require isolation of the injected fluid, such as during aquifer storage and recovery and injection of heating and cooling water.\n\nWe also devoted significant effort to creating, implementing, deploying, and improving K-12 outreach activities, including a classroom demonstration accepted for publication on the website TeachEngineering.org, and numerous hands-on classroom activities with public school students in Denver and Boulder.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roseanna M Neupauer"
