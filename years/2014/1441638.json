 "awd_abstract_narration": "The edge of the internet continues to grow rapidly over the wireless medium. Sustaining this growth rate \r\nis not trivial. The vagaries of the wireless channel, in conjunction with the distributed nature of large scale \r\nnetworks, raises diverse challenges in capacity, scalability, reliability, and security. Every new opportunity \r\nhas to be maximally exploited to cope with the escalating end-user demands. Emerging antenna capabilities \r\noffer one such opportunity. Crucial advances have been made in antenna systems, as well as in the wireless \r\nprotocol design community. Early evidence shows that significant end to end performance benefits can be \r\nextracted by effectively integrating antenna-awareness into the network protocol stack. However, such inte- \r\ngration is not trivial, and entails a rich set of research challenges. This project, named Spotlight, is oriented \r\nto achieve this goal, through theory, protocols, and a prototype demonstration. Instead of attempting all- \r\nencompassing solutions, the project categorically targets wireless mesh network architectures. \r\n\r\nSpotlight takes an active step towards integrating independent innovations from diverse research disciplines. \r\nSpecifically, it brings the two communities of antenna systems and wireless networking closer to each other. \r\nResearch results is being disseminated through technical publications, seminars, and tutorials. Moreover, the \r\nproject is committed to tightly integrate research and educational plans. Techniques from Electrical Engi- \r\nneering is being unified with algorithms from Computer Science, and presented in new courses for graduates \r\nas well as undergraduates. Hands on experiences are integral components of these courses, enabling stu- \r\ndents to appreciate the translation of theory to real life systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nPI: Romit Roy Choudhury\r\nECE, Duke University\r\n",
