 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project upgrades network capacity to the Northwest Indian College cyberinfrastructure, creating an Internet2-connected network space for scientific data at the main campus, and increasing the connectivity of extended campus locations to enable rural student participation in research projects.  Changes include the addition of highly-available storage and database services as part of a scienceDMZ, the establishment of IPv6 connections capable of transmitting big data to and from partner institutions, and the integration of existing directory services with common federation services for access control.  The associated increase in bandwidth also permits enhanced video telepresence to increase collaboration with partnering institutions and augment remote instruction between campuses.\r\n\r\nNorthwest Indian College hosts atypical education and research opportunities because scientific inquiry at the school is pursued with an indigenous understanding of the planet.  Because the students and faculty begin with unique questions, they produce unique data sets.  This project enables that data to be shared with the larger research community.  Likewise, giving students expanded access to the catalogs at partner institutions increases the number and scope of research and analysis opportunities in a number of fields, including marine biology and oceanography, botany, geology, and health and human services.  The exchange of information is expected to foster knowledge seeking and innovation among students at Northwest Indian College, and present culturally-relevant education and research opportunities to Native students at other institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCC*IIE Campus Design &ndash; Internet2 Infrastructure\n\nNorthwest Indian College\n\n \n\nNorthwest Indian College is a small institution consisting of the main campus just outside of Bellingham, Washington and several satellite locations on tribal lands throughout Washington and Idaho; all in rural areas.  Bridging the gaps between these sites has always been a challenge due to both their geographic positions and infrastructural inadequacies and with the satellite sites having inconsistent access to the school?s resources.  The funds from this grant were put directly into modernizing the network and computing infrastructure at Northwest Indian College, providing not just consistent connectivity and access, but a capacity for student engagement that has not previously been possible.\n\nThis grant funded high speed connections to the state intranet at six locations, providing reliable access to academic resources across the sites, as well as Internet2 partner Instructure, which now hosts the school?s learning management system.  Accordingly, the college has been able to transition from an almost entirely face-to-face modality of teaching and learning&mdash;a less than ideal model for an institution with many small rural locations&mdash;to offering nearly all classes through some form of online delivery, including upper division science and technology courses that were previously unavailable at most sites.\n\nAdditionally, this grant funded a more than 300 terabyte private cloud dedicated to hosting research data.  The cloud model provides flexibility and high availability, and can be easily expanded to provide viable service for years to come.  Building a cluster of this scale has been fiscally impossible for Northwest Indian College up until this point, and the school has been forced to rely on larger institutions to host the results of its research.  While still new, the college has already begun to move its data into this cloud, and is beginning to use it to share information and curriculum with other schools.\n\nIn summary, this grant has increased the quality and scope of education that Northwest Indian College delivers, allowed the school to coordinate more closely with other institutions, and provided a mechanism by which the college can share its research with the world.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael R James"
