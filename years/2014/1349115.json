 "awd_abstract_narration": "In steep mountain terrain, debris flows can dominate sediment transport and bedrock channel incision, and drive landscape change.  Although debris flows are often generated from landslides that fluidize upon failure, there is increasing evidence for the importance of debris flows generated from runoff and overland flow, especially in steep alpine landscapes and following wildfire where dry, loose sediment collects in channels and chutes prior to failure.  The initiation mechanisms for debris-flow generation from runoff are not well understood.  To address this, a series of experiments that will form the baseline to test and develop theory for debris-flow initiation in mountain channels will be conducted.  The experiments will take place in a new state-of-the-art facility at the California Institute of Technology designed specifically to investigate sediment transport processes on very steep slopes.  The proposed work will test four hypotheses concerning the onset of debris flows over a wide range of channel slopes and sediment sizes.  The expected outcome from this work is new insight into the underlying mechanics that control debris-flow initiation from within channels, and the development of predictive models that link debris flow initiation to topography, such as channel slope, and environmental perturbations, such as floods and wildfires.  \r\n\r\nDebris flows are one of the most dangerous and costly hazards of mountainous terrain worldwide.  This work will improve our understanding of debris flow initiation and aid in our ability to forecast hazards and develop better land-use strategies.  The results will have applications for the Los Angeles area where runoff-generated debris flows are common following wildfire, in cases resulting in loss of life and property damage. These results will be made available to the public through journal publications and to the scientific teaching community through the GeomorphLectures Wiki, designed to be a resource for young educators.  Educational and outreach activities include training scientists at the undergraduate, PhD and postdoctoral levels, and volunteer classroom presentations and laboratory tours through collaborations with the Pasadena Unified School District, CA.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project is to improve our ability to predict when and where debris flows occur in steep mountain terrain. Debris flows are concentrated slurries of water, mud and rocks that pose significant hazards to people and infrastructure.  Previous work has focused on debris flows initiated from landslides on hills.  However, field observations suggest that debris flows might also initiate in river channels during rainstorms, especially where channels are filled by loose sediment.  In-channel debris flow initiation appears to be especially common in the drylands, such as in the southwest U.S., following wildfire.  To date the mechanics of debris flow initiation by runoff has received little study. \n\nIntellectual Merit: Our goal is to address this knowledge gap using a new state-of-the-art indoor river facility where we can create debris flows and river floods under controlled conditions.  We developed theory for the conditions that trigger debris flows and tested the theory across a wide range of conditions using the experiments.  We also compared the theory to observations of debris flows in southern California, including the Montecito debris flows of 2017, which we monitored through the study period.  Our main result is that we have quantified the transition from dilute sediment transport by rivers to concentrated debris flows in steep channels ranging from 3 to 30% grade.  In experiments, we systematically explored what controls this transition including the effect of channel slope, grain size, flood size, and flash floods.  In natural channels, we quantified sediment mass balance through a fire-flood cycle in which sediment is evacuated from hills to channels in the dry season, and then flushed from channels as debris flows during rainstorms.  Our work fills an important gap in our basic understanding of geomorphic processes in steep landscapes, with broad implications for landscape resilience, natural hazards and sustainability. \n\nBroader Impacts:  The results have been disseminated in scientific journals, through conference presentations, and through public outreach with local schools, laboratory tours, and the news media.  In addition, this project led to the training of one PhD student, two postdoctoral scholars, four undergraduate students, and one high-school intern in quantitative science including field, laboratory and numerical methods.  All students received training in hypothesis development and testing, as well as written and oral presentation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Lamb"
