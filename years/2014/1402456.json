Forging strong international collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign hosts.  This fellowship to Adam W. Ferguson supports research and training to understand the role of human disturbance in shaping the parasite dynamics in a small African carnivore, the genet. There are two host institutions in Kenya: Karatina University under the sponsorship of Dr. Paul Webala and the University of Nairobi under the sponsorship of Dr. David Odongo.  Training goals include learning analytical methods for studies in parasite ecology and career development activities.  Educational outreach includes a network of U.S.  and African scientists interested in understanding the role of wildlife in disease transmission in East Africa. This fellowship is supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International and Integrative Activities at NSF. \r\n\r\nThe research examines how the cat-like, mammalian carnivores known as genets, Genetta spp., mesocarnivores of the family Viverridae, respond to different land use practices and interact with local communities and their associated domestic animals such as cattle and dogs. Specifically, the goal is to understand how these interactions affect the genets' health and parasite loads, which could have ramifications for parasite transmission dynamics to both humans and other wildlife species. Given the abundance of small carnivores, e.g., raccoons, skunks, red foxes, and their important roles in disease dynamics in other rural systems, results from this study, using a model organism, provide information useful for managing parasites and diseases that pose a risk to both humans and domestic animals inhabiting other rural systems worldwide. In East Africa, where local people living in close proximity to diverse wildlife communities depend heavily on livestock, land-use practices could result in changes to parasite communities of local wildlife by altering host density, physiology, and contact rates with domestic animals.",

These adaptable mammals consume prey that are important reservoirs of human diseases (e.g., rodents), carry diseases important to human health themselves (e.g., rabies), and are often found living in close proximity to people and their domestic animals, thereby increasing their chances of transmitting diseases across the human-wildlife-livestock interface. East Africa maintains a diverse assemblage of these species, including jackals, mongooses, and genets. Unlike their North American and European counterparts, the small carnivores of Africa have been understudied when it comes to their roles in disease dynamics. This project sought to remedy this knowledge gap by developing an interdisciplinary and multi-national team of Kenyan and US scientists to examine the impacts of human presence on the behavior, physiology, and parasite communities of small carnivores in East Africa. Our work in Kenya's Laikipia County indicated that small carnivores respond to human disturbance in a number of ways, including the need for more space in disturbed versus undisturbed sites, reduced parasite burdens in areas with high human and therefore high livestock density, and poorer body conditions for those living in disturbed sites. On the other hand, small carnivores seemed to respond positively to small-scale human disturbance to parts of the landscape, benefiting from rotational livestock practices used by East African pastoralists through an increase in prey abundance driven mostly by dung beetles. From our trapping, tracking, and camera trap results, it is clear that small wild carnivores interact with larger carnivores of conservation concern (e.g., lions, hyenas) and domestic carnivores (e.g., domestic dogs), with potential consequences for important diseases such as rabies. The significant impact of rabies on the health of humans, wildlife, and domestic animals in the study region together with a national effort to eliminate dog-mediated rabies in Kenya by 2030, resulted in the establishment of a grassroots campaign to vaccinate domestic dogs against rabies (the most effective means by which to reduce the disease incidence in humans). During 2014-2017, the Laikipia Rabies Vaccination Campaign's (LRVC) entirely volunteer-led team vaccinated a total of 13,155 domestic dogs across 17 communities. This grassroots effort was by definition multi-disciplinary and multi-national, incorporating conservation scientists, wildlife biologists, veterinarians, museum scientists, and university students from 5 countries and 15 organizations to tackle this deadly albeit completely preventable disease. Lessons learned from implementing a One Health approach, a holistic methodology that incorporates human, environmental, and animal health to solve problems associated with diseases, included a need for greater post-vaccination monitoring efforts of dog populations and community-specific vaccination strategies. The culmination of the LRVC into a sustainable, Kenyan-led, effort to mitigate an important disease tied to wild carnivores represented a substantial achievement related to the project's initial goal of establishing a diverse team focused on tackling disease dynamics in East Africa. In addition to supporting novel research related to the role of small carnivores in disease dynamics, the project also created ample time for training the next-generation of scientists. This training resulted in one student earning a Master of Science degree in Natural Resource Management, another student completing her senior undergraduate thesis on small carnivores, and two additional undergraduate students completing international internships tied to the project. In addition, ample opportunities for training larger groups of students in both a traditional and non-traditional classroom setting were realized, with more than 90 Kenyan students participating in 6 workshops or formal courses in biodiversity informatics, wildlife ecology, and museum science. From a personal perspective, the funding provided through this postdoctoral research fellowship in biology had a transformative and lasting impact, providing unprecedented opportunities to both expand my research toolbox and scientific network, ultimately making me into the scientist I am today.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/25/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
