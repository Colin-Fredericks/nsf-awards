 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address one of the most fundamental questions faced by all organisms: when is the best time to reproduce to maximize the survival and success of their offspring. In plants, there are two broad categories of reproductive strategies; annuals that reproduce once and die, and perennials that reproduce repeatedly and cycle through vegetative and reproductive phases. This research will utilize a model plant system, Mimulus guttatus, commonly known as Monkeyflower, native to the west coast of the United States to investigate the ecological and genetic mechanisms underlying flowering time differences in annuals and perennial plant species. The focus on the role of environmental cues, including daylength and temperature, in the transition to flowering is particularly pertinent. This is because climate change is altering temperature patterns and moisture levels that are going to challenge many plant species ability to persist under these new environmental regimes.\r\n\r\nThis project will benefit the scientific community by the development of genomic resources that will enhance our general understanding of what forces influence transitions between reproducing once and dying versus reproducing multiple times prior to senescence. The integrative nature of this proposed research means that students and postdoctoral fellows will receive cross-disciplinary training, and the research also provides training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. Additionally the public will benefit through collaborations with the popular Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science & Technology by providing mentoring to the staff and public workshops to serve the city of Syracuse's middle and high school students.",
