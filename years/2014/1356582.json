 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) is recruiting undergraduate students majoring in Biology, Biotechnology, Environmental Science, or Chemistry.  With strong institutional support, the project seeks to make a sustained impact on STEM programs at UNCP by strengthening connections among UNCP's academic and student support programs, while also reinforcing UNCP's connections with industry and local employers.  \r\n\r\nThe technical implementation of project activities begins during students' sophomore year, when academically-talented cohorts of students who demonstrate financial need receive scholarships, with the goal of increasing the number of students earning STEM BS degrees and advancing to STEM careers or graduate programs.  To achieve its objectives, the project is guided by three core strategies: (1) building a community of scholars, (2) close coordination of program support activities with existing UNCP resources, and (3) a focus on STEM career preparation. The project provides students with enhanced academic support and career preparation services, which include intensive mentoring, tutoring/supplemental instruction, scientific and career workshops, and seminars.  Career-oriented activities are all flexibly-designed to meet the needs of the students.  Rigorous data collection with assessment evaluates the effectiveness of these interventions in meeting the unique needs of UNCP students and to achieve successful student outcomes. Such data is helping to establish a model for achievement that can be replicated in other STEM disciplines at UNCP and sister UNC institutions.",

The program sought to provide participants with both the financial and academic support structures to graduate with their STEM degree under 6 years. Student support structures and key programmatic components included mentoring, research experiences with university faculty; Biology seminar series; weekly cohort meetings that included dedicated tutoring time and career advising workshops offered in conjunction with on-campus departments; and site visits with related industries and graduate school programs. Some of the industry site visits included local companies like Tyton Biofuels, and most others were to the Triangle Research Park with a high concentration of Biotech industry. Indeed, NC has one of the most robust biotech industries in the country that, since 2001, has resulted in the creation of more than 12,000 jobs in the subsectors of drugs and pharmaceuticals, research, testing and medical labs, agricultural feedstock and chemicals. It was then, a unique opportunity for COMPASS scholars to be able to visit Novozymes, Novo Nordisk, Syngenta, Cygnus Technologies, and Alcami among other industrial sites, and learn about careers in those sectors. Other visits included training and academic programs such as the Golden Leaf Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) at NC State University, the Nutrition Research Institute (UNC, Kannapolis campus), the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials, The NC State University Genomics Science Lab, the Genomics &amp; Microbiology Research Lab at NC Museum of Natural Sciences, the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and the Biotechnology program at NC State University among others.

The diversity of the participant group reflects the diversity of the UNC-P community, which is one of the most diverse non-HBCU&rsquo;s in the southeast with minority students representing over 50% of the total student population. This includes a comparatively large American Indian student population as the UNC-Pembroke community is home to the Lumbee tribe, one of the largest tribes in North Carolina and the southeast. 27% of program participants were African American, 35% Native American/Alaskan, 15% White and 19% identified as Other. Also, 85% of participants were female and 15% were male, and over 50% were first-generation college students.

The program has been transformative for the lives and careers of these scholars and even those who persist in their plans to join a professional school recognize that COMPASS opened their eyes to careers and possibilities they did not know existed. In fact, the exposure to careers through site visits and conversations with STEM professionals was one of the most student-cited benefits of the program. Attending and presenting at professional conferences was also valuable and helped student&rsquo;s network and foster a sense of belonging in STEM. Being exposed to research experiences (77% participating) early on has also contributed to their openness to science careers. To assess the lasting impact of the COMPASS Program, per the results of a program alumni survey, 31% of participant are in graduate school or post-bac programs; 31% are in professional school; 15% are in an allied health program or occupation; 11.5% are employed in a science field; 11.5% are employed outside science fields (7.6% of these are applying to professional schools). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The community aspect was without a doubt the most valuable overall to all scholars.
