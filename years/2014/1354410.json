The goal is to demonstrate through archival research that the National Water Carrier served to foster the Israeli state with a strong centralized government through techno-scientific development. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe topic is well situated within STS and stands to make a significant contribution to studies about water management from the perspective of techno-science and actor-network theory. The topic is timely and relevant to the ongoing conflicts over natural resources, state identity, and development; there are no prior studies of the National Water Carrier from this perspective, and water is increasingly scarce in the region. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will be relevant for a diverse audience including historians, STS scholars, area studies specialists, political geographers, and others. They could also have an impact on relevant Israeli and Palestinian audiences.",
