 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southeastern USA is botanically rich, with areas of high global biodiversity in both the Appalachians and the coastal plain.  Millions of plant specimens have been collected from this region over the past four centuries, and these specimens and the information they contain currently reside in museums, or herbaria, at universities across the area.  Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  \r\n\r\nThe interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change. By partnering with Symbiota, Notes from Nature, GEOLocate, Adler Planetarium, iPlant/TACC, and Specify, the project will develop ways to best integrate various efforts for data accessibility. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

Public outreach also included robust collaboration with the Notes from Nature community-science platform and sustained interaction with the Virginia Master Naturalists and the Virginia Native Plant Society. In total, over 75,000 label-transcriptions of Virginian herbarium specimens were completed on this digital platform by over 1000 volunteers, which were incorporated within the SERNEC portal database. The impact of liberating these critical plant biodiversity data and developing human resources are expected to be long-term.

The next edition of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Flora of Virginia</span> will reflect these discoveries. Last but not least, multiple students trained by the award have since advanced to professional degree and Ph.D. programs and many have attained STEM careers.
