 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to build a theoretical framework for transitional bridging - bridges that can be rapidly deployed for immediate disaster relief and can be transformed in-situ for higher load capacity to support long-term, sustainable development. Following natural and anthropogenic hazards, rapidly deployable bridges are critical to restoring vital transportation arteries. The long recovery times following the 2010 Chile earthquake and tsunami demonstrate the need for bridging solutions that can provide an immediate response but also serve as permanent infrastructure. To this end, the project will test the hypothesis that novel adjustable connections can increase efficiency of rapidly erectable bridging systems by enabling a diversity of structural forms which can more effectively carry load using less material. The research plan will also test the hypothesis that novel adjustable modules can provide transitional capabilities. The efficiency of the transitional bridging framework which integrates the adjustable connections and modules will be verified numerically and experimentally.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will be translated to industry through collaboration with a leading design firm. Integrated with this research objective, educational goals include (1) training the next generation of researchers and designers in bridge engineering and deployable structures and (2) increasing the participation and retention of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to develop a new, interdisciplinary, co-taught Deployable Structures for Disaster Relief course for undergraduate as well as graduate curricula in the College of Engineering and the College of Arts & Letters. The PI also plans to collaborate with a local high school to implement \"BRIDGES (Building Relationships to Inspire and Drive Girls to pursue Engineering and Science): an enrichment environment for young women\".",

A total of 44 undergraduate and eight graduate students have taken the PI's Bridge Engineering course, which includes a semester-long research project that is reviewed by practicing engineers.
