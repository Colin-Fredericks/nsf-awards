 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over five decades the large scale properties of the solar wind have been described. These observations have shown that the solar wind flow is turbulent. This research project will refine the description of the solar wind by separating the ordered and disordered structures in the solar wind. The proposal posits that hypothesis that space weather is strongly influenced by the cumulative effects of many small disturbances. The researchers are interested in learning if the properties of the turbulent flows in the solar wind are biased by the presence of small scale \"fossil\" structures whose source is the Sun. The team has proposed to develop and use a series of analysis techniques not currently used in space physics.\r\n\r\nThis research will support graduate students including training them to use the new techniques. The characterization of the solar wind will be useful for others in studying space weather at Earth.",
