 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Guldberg, Robert E. \r\nProposal Number: 1411467\r\n\r\nTissue engineering and regenerative medicine is an interdisciplinary field requiring the integration of bioengineering principles, fundamental biological discoveries, and industry collaboration and partnership to achieve the ultimate goal of restoring function to injured or degenerated tissues. Damaged musculoskeletal tissues collectively represent the most common cause of pain and functional disability worldwide. The three-day Hilton Head Workshop for Regenerative Medicine is an annual workshop series that brings together regenerative medicine experts from a variety of scientific disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge and stimulate new ideas and work to overcome current gaps in the knowledge base that are needed to advance the development of regenerative medicine applications. Another important aspect of convening such experts in one location is the opportunity it presents to foster the development of new researchers and future leaders in the field. The workshop provides important opportunities for graduate student and postdoctoral trainees and young investigators to fully participate in the conference scientific program and to interact socially and connect with world renowned leaders and mentors in the field. The conference theme for the 2014 Hilton Head Workshop, to be held March 26-29, 2014 in Hilton Head Island, SC, is \"Discovery-Driven Transformative Research\" and will focus on highlighting research that has the potential to shift traditional research paradigms, pioneer discovery, and lead to the development of new and innovative technologies. A one-day pre-conference workshop is scheduled for Wednesday, Mach 26, 2014, titled \"Challenges and Opportunities in Central Nervous System Regeneration\" that will address current research advances in the field of neurobiology and neural cell regeneration.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe conference will advance knowledge within the broad, cross disciplinary community of those engaged in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine through the presentation of knew and transformative research. The conference engagement and networking opportunities have the potential to launch new collaborative research and education initiatives in the U.S. and will potentially foster new international collaborations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe multidisciplinary focus of the workshop and diversity of attendees has the ability to impact many sectors of engineering and science and to advance progress in academic-industry collaborations. While the workshop is kept intentionally small in participant numbers, the attendees and speakers come from all over the U.S. and abroad to offer new perspectives and forge new collaborative relationships. This conference has the ability to impact several levels of attendees, with particular focus on women, trainees and young investigators through the activities and events planned. This conference will inspire and help train the young future leaders of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",
