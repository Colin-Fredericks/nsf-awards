The symposium will foster advances in the leading research on various types of III-Nitride material growth and device technology   by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. The program provides the opportunity for scientific exchanges and discussions on exciting breakthroughs in the terahertz field and the understanding the underlying physical mechanisms.. Topics to be addressed include III-N Bulk growth of AlN, GaN, InN, III-N nanostructures, defect control and surface effects, III-N devices such as Filed-Effect Transistors and Light Emitting Diodes. The Symposium will promote interactions between leading researchers in material growth and device technologies and will focus on the technical challenges of these materials and their applications. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through and Abstracts book..",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe International Symposium on the Growth of III-Nitrides (ISGN) series of conferences have been premier international forums for experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories to present their latest progress and exchange ideas in the fundamental and applied aspects of III-Nitride bulk and epitaxial growth technologies as well as related device advances. \n\nIII-Nitride compound semiconductor materials underlie many of today's most advanced high-performance devices such as LEDs, laser diodes, and transistors which are becoming an essential part of the solution of many global problems.  In the future, III-Nitride solar cells, nanostructure materials, and other innovative devices will play a similar significant role in improving the human condition. \n\nThis conference was organized to foster the continued advancement of this important field of research and development, and it provided an opportunity for student training and development in several ways.  First, it provided a venue for students to give their presentations to a wide audience with many experienced specialists in attendance which provided a very useful interaction in the question sessions and beyond at coffee breaks and in the evenings.  Secondly, it allowed the graduate research assistants (GRAs) to interact and compare experiences and research ideas.  Thirdly, it provided an opportunity for the GRAs to see state-of-the-art equipment and services related to this field which is difficult to experience any other way than by attendance at a conference.  Finally, it will give them an opportunity for the publication of their results in a well-recognized refereed journal.\n\nThe funds provided by NSF were used to support the USA-based graduate students who gave oral or poster presentations at this  conference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
