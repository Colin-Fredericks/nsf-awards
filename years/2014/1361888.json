 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of the planned I/UCRC for Advanced Vehicle Manufacturing aims to integrate multiple universities and disciplines to advance research that is intended to extend knowledge in the fields of smart assembly, logistics, and process diagnostics through data analytics and statistical modeling. Moreover, a better fundamental understanding of adapting emerging manufacturing methods and advanced materials with environmentally friendly (waste, fuel, emissions) vehicle designs will be explored. Research will also include an improved understanding and integration of the health, safety, and environmental issues of emerging manufacturing techniques.\r\n\r\nVehicle manufacturing is a sector of significant economic impact to the U.S., especially to the southeast. The Center intends to address the major challenges faced in advanced vehicle manufacturing and in the process have a major economic impact. With the cross-disciplinary expertise of the faculty and industry support, the center will also provide opportunities for interdisciplinary education. Workforce development and cross-training will be addressed through collaboration with a consortium of community colleges that work closely with the auto industry. The research team has significant involvement in diversity, veterans and K-12 outreach initiatives and the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate researchers.\r\n",
