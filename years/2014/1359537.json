 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support scientists to participate in a symposium at the 2014 meeting of the\r\nSociety of Comparative and Integrative Biology in Austin, Texas focused on unifying cellular and biochemical mechanisms with studies of mate choice and social interactions within the broader investigation of ornamental traits. It will bring together experts on the mechanisms that link condition, stress, and ornaments (and armaments).  Over the past two decades, the hypothesis that ornamental traits signal the condition of animals has become a prominent paradigm in behavioral and evolutionary biology. This symposium wil integrate insights from physiological studies of stress response, particularly related to endocrine control, immune systems, and oxidative state, with evolutionary investigations of animal ornamentation. \r\n\r\nBy convening a symposium on a central topic in evolutionary and physiological ecology, information will be made available to the numerous graduate students, undergrads, postdocs, and faculty who attend SICB meetings. By filling half of the presentation slots with early career scientists including a majority of slots filled by women, the symposium will promote the development of a talented group of U.S. scientists. Through social events, students will have a chance to interact with prominent researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF award was to support a symposium \"Stress, condition, and ornamentation\" at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting in Austin, Texas in January, 2014.  Ten faculty from three countries participated in the symposium including five women, two postdoc, and five early career faculty.  Three hundred and twenty two scientists attended one or more of the talks, including an estimated two hundred graduate students and fifteen undergraduates.  A post-meeting social gathering was held the following the symposium and 63 scientists attended the gathering and spent three hours discussing issues raised that the symposium.
