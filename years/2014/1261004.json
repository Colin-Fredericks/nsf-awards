 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the biology of MRE and transform understanding of ecosystem functioning in similar ways as the recognition of the role of AM fungi in plant ecology transformed the understanding of plant community dynamics.  Furthermore, if MRE are indeed parasites of Glomeromycota, then understanding how their ancient asexual fungal hosts dealt with parasite pressure will become a pressing issue of general interest.  Finally, identifying forces that drive MRE population dynamics will be important for understanding genome evolution in MRE and their Mycoplasma relatives. The project includes opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, including research experiences in microbiology, molecular genetics, and bioinformatics.  Undergraduates will be recruited through the Microbial Friends & Foes REU and the Cornell Office of Undergraduate Biology, and high school students through BOCES.  More than half of the students mentored by the PI have been from groups underrepresented in science.  The PI works with the Cornell Office of Academic Diversity Initiatives to create training opportunities for minority undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to understand the life history and evolutionary genomics of the newly discovered mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE) of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (phylum Glomeromycota).  AM fungi and their endobacteria are components of a complex symbiotic association that also includes the majority of terrestrial plants, and may be one of the most common multi-partner symbioses on the planet.  AM fungi colonize roots of land plants and assist in the uptake of mineral nutrients in exchange for plant-assimilated carbon.  Thus, AM fungi are pivotal in shaping the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems.  While the biology of MRE is largely unknown, they are distributed in all major lineages of Glomeromycota and exhibit substantial genetic variability within individuals of their AM fungal hosts.  This pattern is inconsistent with evolutionary theory in that mutualistic endosymbionts are predicted to be genetically uniform within a host.  Consequently, it is hypothesized that MRE are parasites and that their genomes exhibit features consistent with a parasitic lifestyle.  This project will integrate the ecology and evolutionary genomics of MRE to elucidate their role in the Glomeromycota.  (1) An assessment of the effects of MRE infection on host fitness will reveal whether MRE are parasites or mutualists.  (2) Sequencing and de novo assembly of MRE genomes will enable inferences about MRE metabolic features.  (3) Elucidating forces that drive MRE population dynamics will reveal mechanisms responsible for MRE genome evolution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the course of the project, we characterized a novel heritable bacterial endosymbiont of fungi, ?Candidatus Moeniiplasma glomeromycotorum? (CaMg), which we initially referred to as MRE.  This endobacterium is widely distributed across major lineages of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, subphylum Glomeromycotina).  AMF form mutualistic associations with roots of the majority of terrestrial plants.  They provision plants with mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, in exchange for photosynthesis-derived carbon.  Consequently, AMF play important roles in functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and global nutrient cycling, and are of rising interest in sustainable agriculture as alternatives to non-renewable mineral fertilizers.  Understanding the role of endobacteria in AMF biology and their impact on AMF phenotypic diversity will allow for developing rational strategies for deploying AMF in agriculture.  We discovered that the association of CaMg with AMF may be as old as the AMF symbiosis with plants, dating back to the early Devonian.  CaMg is metabolically dependent on AMF and its distribution across AMF is related to environmental conditions experienced by the host.  Importantly, CaMg displays a mode of molecular evolution that deviates from the patterns observed in other heritable endobacteria, thus defining a novel trajectory of genome contraction.  In particular, CaMg genomes accumulate mutations at a rate that exceeds mutation rates in most other bacteria.  Yet, genomic degeneration appears to be countervailed by genetic recombination and mobile genetic element activity.  These patterns suggest that CaMg may be an antagonist of AMF.  While we were unable to establish the specific role of CaMg in the AMF biology, we generated important general insights into the impact of endobacteria on the biology of their fungal hosts using a recently emerged model system of the symbiosis between Rhizopus microsporus (Rm) and its Burkhoderia endobacteria.  In the Rm-Burkholderia symbiosis, we discovered that endobacteria interact with host reproductive biology, both asexual proliferation and sexual reproduction, by modulating expression of a gene central to fungal reproductive development.  This observation offers an important clue towards elucidating a trajectory that lead to the loss of equivalent modes of reproduction in AMF.  In the Rm-Burkholderia symbiosis we also determined that changes in the host lipid metabolism are essential for the symbiosis establishment.  This finding will help focusing future efforts towards understanding how AMF interact with their endobacteria.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Teresa E Pawlowska"
