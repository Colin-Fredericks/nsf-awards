 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests the extent to which science fair participation addresses the opportunity gaps that limit STEM pipeline diversity, such as access to educational opportunities, exposure to career possibilities, quality of educational programs, and institutional and personal competitiveness. It focuses on advancing secondary school teachers' motivation and ability to lead their students in science fair projects, and develop a long-term appreciation for the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning. The five-year program targets rural, high-need schools, and economically disadvantaged students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups. The high quality, competitive, inquiry-based science fair projects lead students through a strong STEM pipeline leading to increased participation in higher education and potentially STEM careers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project goals are to: (1) establish a network of STEM teachers and area administrators that pro-actively engage students in project-based learning and give them access to university resources and guidance to empower inquiry-based STEM learning; (2) increase the number of students from underrepresented groups in rural Alabama that participate in high-quality science fair projects; (3) develop a sustainable relationship between Auburn University and local public schools for continued growth beyond the scope of the project; and (4) increase positive student attitudes towards STEM through exposure to higher education, career options, and interactions with university research mentors. To accomplish these goals, the project leadership engages middle and high school teachers and administrators from vertically aligned schools (e.g., a middle school that feeds into a specific high school) in professional development workshops that focus on science and engineering fair project development and hosting local science fair competitions. Teachers and students develop high-quality science fair projects using university laboratories and faculty guidance.  Trained teachers and administrators become agents of expanding the network and establishing a STEM culture in their schools.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe project leverages Auburn University?s College of Sciences and Mathematics Outreach Center activities to establish partnerships between Auburn University science and engineering faculty and high-need public schools in southeast Alabama. Over 720 students, 48 science teachers, and 12 administrators from 34 school districts are gaining access to Auburn University research facilities and faculty expertise in developing high-quality science fair projects. The program promotes a culture of project-based STEM learning and positive STEM identity among students who might not consider STEM higher education as an option. The model of university and local school system interaction to enhance URM interest and engagement in STEM higher education can be scaled and replicated nationwide.",
