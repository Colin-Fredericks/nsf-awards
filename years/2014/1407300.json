 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species that inhabit Northern latitudes are expected to experience dramatic climate changes in the coming century, and both basic and applied scientists need information about the effect of these changes on living natural resources.  This project will produce useful statistical tools and baseline data for long-term population monitoring and management, and deliver important information regarding the ability of wildlife to persist in a changing landscape. One PhD student will be trained through this research, and will communicate results to collaborating public lands agencies for direct application to defining management units, modeling future distribution and abundance of wildlife populations, and planning for potential species range shifts.  Results will also be broadly disseminated through public forums including invited speaking events, professional meetings, public radio, and school presentations.\r\n\r\nWhen climate and landscape patterns change beyond an organism's physiological threshold, the options for persistence of that population are limited to adaptation or migration.  Reliable identification of genes underlying signatures of natural selection is a necessary component of detecting the spatial scale at which adaptation to local conditions occurs, and provides critical information for understanding evolution and population resilience.  However, the relative sensitivity of statistical tests to detect selection has not been rigorously examined, even less so for populations in natural landscapes.  This project investigates the accuracy and precision of our ability detect local adaptation in naturally occurring populations at both smaller, landscape level scales, and broader, species-level scales.  A combination of computer simulations and empirical information from novel genetic techniques will facilitate investigation of the influence of environmental variation, different population sizes, and migration rates on local adaptation of a northern alpine wild sheep throughout its range.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIdentifying adaptive genes and identifying locally-adapted populations in the wild is very challenging; yet it crucial for understanding adaptive responses of species to changing environments.  Identification of spatio-temporal patterns of adaptation is important in designing predictive models of a species\u00c6 ability to persist, shift its geographic distribution, and to maintain connectivity among populations despite changes in climate and landscape patterns.  \n\nThe main goal of this proposal was to advance our general understanding of our ability to detect local adaptation and adaptive genes (alleles) influenced by landscape and environmental variation given different population sizes, gene flow rates (or dispersal), and natural selection regimes across complex landscapes.  We used a computer simulation approach to gain understanding of the relationship between complex environments, demographic parameters, including population size and dispersal distances, and the development of adaptive genetic differences between populations over time. Specifically, we wished to refine understanding of our capacity to quantify and avoid false positive and false negative detections (type I and II errors) when using new statistical outlier-locus detection methods and also approaches to detect a correlation between genetic and environmental variables (e.g. and allele\u00c6s frequency and the local temperature or disease prevalence).  \n\nWe found that individual-based methods performed best in selection gradients (with gradual, continuous change across space) and more often correctly identified gene-environment interactions, but that type I error rates (false positives) were quite high, especially when dispersal levels were low and genetic drift high.  Our results suggest caution is required in applying both population- and individual- based methods to detect molecular signals of local adaptation, and careful consideration of Nm, genetic drift, and patterns of IBD in the study population is recommended when interpreting results.  A combination of methods and using corroborating results is the most conservative approach to identifying loci under selection; an even better approach is to additionally conduct simulations and combine with empirical data to improve inference.   \n\n Our results revealed signals of natural selection in Dall\u00c6s sheep populations throughout their range across Alaska.  We found signatures of selection in genes (\"candidate adaptive genes\") that influence immune function, signaling pathways for regulating cellular processes, tumor suppression, respiratory health, reproduction, and olfactory receptors.  We also demonstrated the relevance of environmental heterogeneity in influencing locally adaptive genetic variation in candidate adaptive genes.  \n\nIn this research we also used targeted next generation resequencing and SNP genotyping in a non-model species (Dall\u00c6s sheep; Ovis dalli dalli) to detect molecular genetic patterns of natural selection and correlation of putatively adaptive allele frequencies with environmental variables, thus applying findings from the simulation studies to an empirical data set.  Moreover, this work provides valuable insights into the general understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation in a free-ranging, wild species. Continued development and application of these molecular tools and computation methods will advance the accumulation of evidence for the genetic basis of adaptation in this and many other species and ecosystems.  \n\n This award has resulted so far in two research articles published in high-quality academic journals (two more in review or in preparation) and several presentations at international, national, and local meetings, in addition to presentations for the general public.  The PhD student successfully graduated and landed an excellent (\u00e6dream\u00c6) job conducting similar research.\n\nOur results suggest that these molecular and statistical genomics approaches can be used to identify adap..."
