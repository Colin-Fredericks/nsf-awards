 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are rapidly bringing the computing\r\npower traditionally associated with massively parallel supercomputers\r\ninto the mainstream devices we use today. They have the power to\r\nrevolutionize computing by enabling orders of magnitude faster and\r\nmore efficient execution of many applications. Unfortunately, many\r\nmodern applications and users cannot take advantage of the computing\r\ncapability present in today's GPUs because today's GPUs are used as\r\nsecondary devices to the much less powerful CPUs. As a result, the massive\r\ncomputing power of GPUs gets wasted and underutilized for a large\r\nnumber of important applications.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to take a fresh and comprehensive look at GPU design\r\nwith the goal of enabling GPUs as first-class computing engines that\r\ncan benefit an overwhelming majority of real-world applications and\r\nusers. To this end, this project systematically investigates the\r\nhardware/software design space of three new execution models, which\r\nprogressively turn a GPU into an independent, first-class compute\r\nengine in a hybrid computing system: 1) an enhanced master-slave model\r\nwhere the GPU is able to perform multiple-application execution, 2) a\r\nnew peer-to-peer model where the GPU is autonomous of the CPU, 3) a\r\nhybrid model where GPUs and CPUs are integrated on the same die and\r\nare equals from the applications' and system's viewpoint. The project\r\ncomprehensively develops software, hardware and software/hardware\r\ncooperative scheduling, resource management, and system design\r\ntechniques for all three models.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project can pave the way to making GPUs\r\nfirst-class computing engines used in all aspects of our everyday\r\nlives for a majority of applications. Doing so is not only expected to\r\nlead to much higher degrees of energy efficiency and user productivity\r\nbut can also potentially enable new applications and devices that can\r\ntake advantage GPUs.",
