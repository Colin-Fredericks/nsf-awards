 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase II Monitoring and Evaluation project from St. Edward's University (SEU) intends to spark a systemic change in science and mathematics teacher education in the region.  By examining the objectives of an earlier Phase I teacher scholars project at SEU and extending its findings and questions into the future, this project will: (1) illuminate the successful components of the recruitment strategies employed; (2) clarify results of SEU's partnership with Austin Community College in the original Phase I work; and (3) determine the value of the professional development summer institutes held in Phase I. The investigation will also provide insight into building relationships with local STEM community stakeholders to use research as a means to jump-start future teacher leadership in the Austin region.\r\n\r\nThis project also provides funds to extend the Phase I induction program for three additional years. By doing this, SEU will support the final cohorts of scholars as well as provide additional long-term research data for dissemination.  During this time the project will measure: (1) the impact of the project on SEU Phase I Noyce scholar performance as teachers, (2) their completion of the teaching requirement, and (3) their retention in the teaching profession. The principal investigators will also explore the formation and strengthening of community partnerships between the high-tech industry partners and the local STEM teacher preparation enterprise.  By examining the professional development growth of early career science and mathematics teachers over an extended period, the findings will uncover important factors related to teacher retention and growth.  Ultimately, this study will help fill crucial gaps in the current knowledge base of factors related to the continuum of science and mathematics teacher development from recruitment through the critical induction years.",

The grant activities explored and clarified challenges related to a partnership with a local Community College through extensive stakeholder participation in focused workshops and reflection; examined the impact of the teacher education teacher induction support program on Noyce Scholar professional development through survey and interview data, provided innovative instructional practices related to student-centered instruction and built teacher knowledge around emerging technologies and cross-cutting concepts through expansion of the STEM teacher circle to include regional industry and business partners. These activities led to an increase in the science teacher leadership capacity for two scholars. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Examining the professional growth of early career teachers over an extended period uncovered important factors related to teacher retention and growth. For example, extending the induction program to five years resulted in a decrease in Scholar participation from 86% to 13%. Clearly, priorities and areas of interest changed over time as beginning teachers developed. Despite building a very strong community of practice from initial grant activities, the network and community unraveled over time. Clearly, maintaining strong communities of practice for more than three years is a challenge without strong internal motivation from the members of the group. Implications for others with induction programs of this type include recognition that groups exist for the time and with the focus needed by the members of that group. If that need has passed, the group may dissolve, despite funding, incentives, or other benefits. This outcome is important because it adds to the literature base on a critical time for teacher retention. The fifth year in teaching is often a tipping point for either staying or leaving the discipline for other opportunities. &nbsp;Understanding factors related to teacher transitions from early to mid-career help can fill crucial gaps in our understanding of these critical years.</p>\n<p>A second outcome from the work with early career teachers and their participation in the induction program is that developing local teacher leaders can be accelerated with opportunities to interact professionally with the greater science and mathematics education community. Two scholars took advantage of teacher leadership mini-grants offered by the program and presented their work at a national conference.</p>\n<p>One other important outcome from the grant activities centers on the development of healthy partnerships between community college and private universities related to teacher preparation pipelines. Community College students are generally an untapped source of potential STEM teacher candidates. Finding ways to ease transfer issues related to cost, culture, and credit hours has always been a challenge. The current study added an additional and important outcome to the knowledge base in this area by uncovering that the perceptions of each institution?s faculty, advising specialists, and students further complicated successful transfer. Additionally, findings indicate that the social and organizational status held by each partner impacted the perceptions of stakeholders ? sometimes negatively ? which discouraged transfer and distanced potential students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> The aim of this work was to build on the successes and challenges of a former Phase I Noyce project at St. Edward?s University. There are three main broader impacts from our work. &nbsp;First, our program will contribute to the current knowledge base on factors related to the continuum of science and mathematics teacher development ? a crucial and critical need considering the continued shortage of qualified teachers in this country. &nbsp;Second, the surge of interdisciplinary STEM careers, a continued entrepreneurial spirit in our region and the rise of contemporary teaching and learning models like design thinking, STEAM, and maker-centered education matched our program goal to provide professional development related to engineering, making, and technology in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The monthly STEM teacher circles became opportunities for study and skill development in topics like virtual reality in the science classroom, making and makerspaces, and exploring the grand challenges of engineering. because Austin and surrounding areas are enjoying a period of rapid growth and attention from STEM-related industry, we aim to: a) tap into the diverse and growing entrepreneurial spirit of our region b) take advantage of the strong infrastructure in place to build science and mathematics teacher knowledge and c) build potential for industry and community partnerships between our Noyce Scholars and local stakeholders. &nbsp;Finally, by expanding the topics and presenters for STEM teacher circles to include more community and STEM industry partners, participants studied factors beyond the walls of the university and schools. Finally, the greater impact of the outcomes related to the STEM teacher pipeline partnership will inform other Noyce partnership programs, as well as any group engaged in building a strong and dedicated science and mathematics teaching force.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Steven&nbsp;Fletcher</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
