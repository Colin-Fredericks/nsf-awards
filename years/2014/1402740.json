 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astrophysical objects can accelerate particles to energies beyond the reach of any ground-based accelerator yet built.  What drives this acceleration is an important question in astrophysics.  High energy gamma-ray emission is a key diagnostic and can be used to probe the acceleration mechanisms.  With this award the University of Iowa particle astrophysics group will use the VERITAS imaging air Cherenkov telescope for a systematic study of pulsar wind nebulae, the most common galactic high energy gamma-ray sources.  Studies of Pulsar Wind Nebulae address central questions in high-energy astrophysics including the acceleration mechanism and the propagation of relativistic particles in the interstellar medium.  To extend the broader impacts of this work, each year the Iowa group will host an undergraduate summer intern from an underrepresented minority who will be directly involved in the research.  This program will draw on the success of the minority recruitment program of the Math Department at Iowa, including their extensive network of colleges with large minority enrollments, and the connections of the Adler Planetarium with minority-serving institutions in the Chicago area.  In addition, the group will work to increase public interest in astronomy and broadly disseminate the results of their research through the public astronomical observing program run by the local chapter of the Society of Physics Students.\r\n\r\nPulsar wind nebulae are powered by relativistic particles accelerated in the termination shocks of the winds emanating from rotation-powered pulsars.  The Iowa group will study the whole population of pulsar wind nebulae in the northern hemisphere using VERITAS follow-up observations of sources discovered by Milagro and in the near future by HAWC forming an unbiased survey. The goal is to produce a complete inventory of powerful, nearby leptonic particle accelerators in the northern sky.  The group will also conduct detailed observations of selected pulsar wind nebulae at multiple wavebands to constrain their physical properties. The Iowa group will also continue to operate and maintain the VERITAS pointing monitors and contribute to VERITAS operations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe universe contains astrophysical objects that accelerate particles to energies beyond the reach of any accelerator yet built by humans.  What drives these accelerators is a major question in astrophysics.  We have used the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), an array of four telescopes in southern Arizona to study astrophysical particle accelerators in our Milky Way galaxy by observing the high energy gamma-rays that they emit.  \n\nWe discovered the brightest and fastest high-energy gamma-ray flares ever seen from a binary star system called LS I +61 303.  LS I +61 303 contains a massive, gaseous star orbiting with a neutron star or black hole.  The flares grow to peak brightness in less than one day, suggesting that particles are accelerated to very high energies also in less than one day.  This provides insight to how particles are accelerated in this exotic system.  \n\nWe followed up on a discovery made with NSF's High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory of a new gamma-ray source located near the plane of our Galaxy called 2HWC J1953+294.  The VERITAS observations confirmed the discovery of this TeV gamma-ray emitting source.  The superior imaging quality of the VERITAS data showed that the object is associated with a nebula created by winds driven by a rotating neutron star previously seen by radio and X-ray telescopes.  With VERITAS we were able to identify the astrophysical source and determine its physical nature.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip E Kaaret"
