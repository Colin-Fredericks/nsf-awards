California, Berkeley, EAR-1325230\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nWhile carbon and strontium isotope, magnetostratigraphic, and paleontological records exist for the early Neoproterozoic Era, and are the primary bases for correlation of stratigraphic sections around the world, radiometric calibration is limited.  Most carbonate platforms well-suited for the development of chemostratigraphic data are developed on passive margins far from explosive volcanic activity that might deliver zircon-rich ash to the basin.  The Tambien Group of northern Ethiopia is ideal for solving this problem because it is a thick carbonate-containing succession deposited in a back-arc basin proximal to active volcanism.  We will develop integrated chemostratigraphic, paleomagnetic and U-Pb geochronological data from the Tambien Group of northern Ethiopia to provide a new backbone for stratigraphic correlation in the 100 million years preceding Cryogenian glaciation (~820-720 Ma).  Our overarching goal is to understand how and when potentially unique geochemical and paleogeographic boundary conditions were developed that allowed for global glaciation at the onset of the Cryogenian Period.  This grant was jointly supported by the International Science and Engineering Division.",

Determining when and how such a large climate shift occurred will have a lasting impact on our understanding of the feedbacks that control Earth&rsquo;s climate through time.

While limestones are the sedimentary rock of choice for recording information about ancient seawater chemistry, most limestones form on quiet passive margins without explosive volcanic activity. In contrast, basins developed close to active subduction zones, such as the basin that formed in northern Ethiopia, contain ash from explosive volcanic activity interbedded with marine limestones. These ash beds can be dated precisely by studying the radioactive decay of uranium to lead preserved in zircon crystals within the ash. In northern Ethiopia, we developed an time-calibrated records of the physical and chemical environment that document the rate and duration of important events in the 100 million years preceding the Sturtian glaciation (Fig. 3).</p>\n<p><br />Over four field seasons, working with students and Ethiopian collaborators, we created and refined geological maps of four distinct regions (Figs. 1 and 2), measured 22,645 meters of stratigraphic section, made 3,139 carbon and oxygen isotope, 214 major/trace element, and 142 87Sr/86Sr measurements, and U-Pb dated 168 zircons to high precision (Fig. 3). In Swanson-Hysell et al. (2015), we demonstrated that the Bitter Springs Stage, previously interpreted as the possible expression of large-scale oscillatory true polar wander and associated paleomagnetic, sea level, and carbon isotope change, is globally synchronous and lasted no more than 23 million years. In MacLennan et al. (2018), we showed that both the enigmatic Islay carbon isotope anomaly and the initiation of the Sturtian snowball Earth are globally synchronous, but are separated by 18 million years and likely unrelated. In Park et al. (2018), we brought together all of our work to generate a new, time-calibrated global composite isotope stratigraphy for the &gt;100 million years preceding onset of the Sturtian snowball Earth (Fig. 3). Park et al. (2018) then used this composite stratigraphy to ground truth a model that evaluates a range of hypotheses for the initiation of snowball Earth conditions.
