 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southeastern USA is botanically rich, with areas of high global biodiversity in both the Appalachians and the coastal plain.  Millions of plant specimens have been collected from this region over the past four centuries, and these specimens and the information they contain currently reside in museums, or herbaria, at universities across the area.  Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  \r\n\r\nThe interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change. By partnering with Symbiota, Notes from Nature, GEOLocate, Adler Planetarium, iPlant/TACC, and Specify, the project will develop ways to best integrate various efforts for data accessibility. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC) involved the collaboration of 12 southeastern States for digitizing plant natural history (that is, herbarium) specimens.  Specimen digitization includes capturing images of specimens, transcribing historically typed or hand-written specimen label data, and assigning geographic coordinates in a process called georeferencing.  Digitization is important for sharing specimen data among researchers studying taxonomy, morphology, biogeography, and ecology of plants in a rapidly changing world.  The emphasis on plants in the southeastern region of the United States is relevant because this area has a unique biogeography, a high number of plant species, and a high level of endemism, meaning that there are a large number of species found only in the Southeast.  In Arkansas in particular (funded by Award 1410098), the Ozark Highlands and Ouachita Mountains are specific regions with endemic species, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain is a highly altered landscape for row-crop agriculture.  Therefore, natural habitats statewide in Arkansas need to be explored botanically to develop appropriate conservation protocols and to understand the basic science of species distribution and the applied science of invasive species prevention and mitigation and impacts of environmental change.  Relying on a historical record of specimen collections to track these changes over time is critical.  Prior to this project, eight herbaria in Arkansas held specimens and the data associated with them only within each institution.  Now that the project is complete, there are 102,580 specimen images available to the scientific community and the general public through the SERNEC Portal (sernecportal.org).  Associated with those images are 50,000 complete data transcriptions and an additional 75,000 with skeletal data, which means the specimen images have data associated with state, county, plant family name, and plant species name.  Skeletal data are important for researchers who are searching for availability of specimens to use in research based on geography and taxonomy.  In addition to making specimens and data available, the outcomes of this project include newly developed protocols for engaging citizen scientists in the process of specimen label data transcription.  Through the citizen science platform Notes from Nature (notesfromnature.org), we have engaged 1549 citizen scientist data transcribers who volunteer their time to assist in the scientific enterprise.  This project built the integrated infrastructure to store specimen images in CyVerse, host them in the SERNEC Portal (a portal within the Symbiota platform), and deliver them to citizen scientist collaborators through Notes from Nature.  After data are transcribed, the herbarium curators receive a consensus of the transcription so they can link the transcribed label data to the specimen image.  This approach of connecting herbarium curators to a community of citizen science volunteers is a significant step in broadening participation in science.  We also developed state-specific lesson plans for high school teachers to use Notes from Nature in their high school classrooms to teach students about natural history collections, taxonomy, plant diversity, and the nature of science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Travis D Marsico"
