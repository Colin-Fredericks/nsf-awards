This\nproject was closely overseen by NSF CPS Program Director\nDr. David Corman, and the PI is very grateful for his support.\n\nThe workshop took place February 6-7, 2014 at the Waterview <br />Conference Center in Arlington, VA, and brought together <br />multi-disciplinary experts from industry, academia, and government to <br />discuss future CPS research challenges in this space.  The participants <br />were experts in the foundational science, engineering, and technology <br />underlying next-generation cyber-physical systems, particularly in the\napplication domain of medicine, including medical devices.\n\nThe workshop featured three tracks: Monitoring and Diagnosis;\nModeling, Verification and Trustworthiness; and Intervention,\nControl and Prosthetics.  Each track comprised three 20-min\nInvited Plenary Talks, three Short 5-min Presentations on Highlighted\nWhitepapers, four 7-min Breakout Report topic discussions, and one\n30-min general discussion period.  With this structure in place, the\nworkshop attendees were able to define a compelling research agenda\nin an area of scientific, technical, and engineering exploration with\nsignificant potential societal impact.\n\nA key outcome of the project was the Workshop Web Site hosted at \nhttps://cps-vo.org/group/2014MedicalCPSWkshp.  The web site contains\na wide array of information about the 2014 NSF Medical CPS Workshop,\nincluding the agenda, speaker bios, presentations, registrants\nlist, and the workshop final report.  The PIs are grateful to Frankie\nKing, School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, for developing and\nmanaging the project web site and for her support in organizing the\nworkshop.\n\nTrack 1: Monitoring and Diagnosis\n\nThis track focused on problems related to data collection and usage in\nmedical CPS.  Monitoring is a two-fold problem in this field: precise\ninformation is needed, but the sheer amount of available data can often\n\"drown out\" what is needed in the given moment.  We must use CPS\nsolutions both to improve monitoring, and use discovered data in an\nintelligent manner to help with diagnosis.\n\nThis track featured the following plenary talks:\n\nWearable Sensor Systems for Long-Term Health and Environmental\nMonitoring, Veena Misra, NCSU.  This talk focused on the use of\nnanotechnology to build a new class of sensors.  These devices push\nthe boundaries of modern wearable technologies by cutting power costs\nand traditional rigidity while offering innovative new solutions in\nenergy harvesting.\n\nHow a Wealth of Information Begets a Poverty of Attention: The Special\nCase of Data Overload in the ICU, J. Perren Cobb, M.D., Director of\nthe Massachusetts General Hospital Critical Care Center.  This talk\nfocused on arising problems in the ICU from an over-abundance of data.\n\nTrack 2: Modeling, Verification and Trustworthiness\n\nThis track focused on the problem of defining trustworthiness in \nMedical CPS models and systems, and how to build models that are\nrealistic enough that their verification results are useful.\n\nIf featured the following plenary talks.\n\nTrustworthy Health and Wellness, David Kotz, Institute for Security,\nTechnology, and Society, Dartmouth College.  This talk addressed the\nissues of authentication, privacy, trustworthy control, and\naccountability in a mobile-rich and cloud-rich environment.  These\nissues are critical in the healthcare domain, but the solutions are\napplicable to other domains.\n\nPatient Safety Challenges for Medical Device Innovation, Julian\nGoldman, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\nThis talk addressed the problem of when a medical-device-related\nadverse event occurs, it is often difficult or impossible to identify\nthe root cause of the failure.  A Patient-Controlled Analgesia system\nwas used as a case study.\n\nTrack 3: Intervention, Control and Prosthetics\n\nThis track focused on robotic and networked medical solutions,\npreventing attacks and outbreaks through constant monitoring, as well\nas new, advanced prosthetics.  It featured two plenary talks.\n\nMoving Beyond Current Approaches to a Broader View of Epilepsy\nMonitoring, Steven Schater, Center for Integration of Medicine &amp; \nInnovative Technology.  This talk focused on in-home monitoring\nwith video-EEG; and needs unmet by current approaches and emerging\ntechnologies to surpass them.\n\nImplantable Networks of Wireless Nanoelectronic Devices, Pedro\nIrazoqui, Center for Implantable Devices, Purdue University.  This\ntalk focused on physically distributed networks of nanoscale wireless\nsensors for  glaucoma IOP monitoring, seizure detection, prosthetic arm\ncontrol), and heart failure warning.  Such systems require a network of\nimplantable wireless devices, CMOS compatible nano-biosensors,\npackaging, and energy harvesting.\n\n\n</pre><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/16/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Scott&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smolka</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
