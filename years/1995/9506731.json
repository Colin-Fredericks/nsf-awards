 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    This award provides partial support for the continuation of activities of the Polar Research Board (PRB) for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995.  The activities are designed to make research in the polar regions more productive and responsive to the needs of the United States, and to maintain U.S. awareness and representation in ongoing international science programs.  Overall, the Board's program provides national and international scientific and technical information of the U.S. government policy makers and the polar research community, represents U.S. interests in international non-governmental polar scientific organizations, and conducts special programmatic studies in areas of polar science and technology deemed necessary by the government, research and business community, or the PRB.    To that end, the Board will actively assist the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) in U.S. preparations for, and holding the International Conference for Arctic Research Planning in 1995.  The conference, to be co-hosted by Dartmouth College and the U.S. Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, is sponsored by the PRB and the National Science Foundation.  During the year, the Board will also provide information on the activities of IASC and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)(a non-governmental science organization which also serves as an advisory body to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, to the U.S. government agencies and polar research community through regular meetings, mailings and electronic mail.  An annual report of the Board for 1995 will be published, and its activities will also be reported in the Journal of Antarctic Research and Arctic Research of the United States.",
