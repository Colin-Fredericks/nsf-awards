 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505941  Becerra      This award is under the North American Research Fellows  Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers from  the United States, Canada and Mexico, to visit research  establishments in one or both of the other two countries for  periods of three to twelve months. The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Judith X. Becerra to work with Dr. Daniel  Pinero at Ciudad Universitaria (UNAM) in Mexico.  A second  year of support will be provided by the Postdoctoral and  Junior Investigator Research Fellows Program, to work with  Dr. Michael Hammer at the University of Arizona.    This research will involve comparison of DNA phylogeny of  the chrysomelid genus Blepharida with the evolution of  chemical and morphological traits of its host, the genus  Bursera.  The PI will also determine whether adaptive traits  in plants and insects have evolved under each other's  evolution by testing whether the ages of the associated  clades of plants and insects are equivalent.  The U.S.  portion of the award will be spent estimating the probable  dates of origin of species of Bursera and Blepharida by  calculating the rates of nucleotide substitution in the ITS  (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequences obtained, following  the molecular clock hypothesis.  This research will provide  the first evaluation of the significance of plant defensive  chemical compounds, defensive plant morphology, and  counterdefensive insect morphology and behavior, for the  evolution of host exploitation by phytophagous insects.  ***",
