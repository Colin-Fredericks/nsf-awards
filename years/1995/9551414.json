 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical and numerical models play a very important role  in our understanding of biophysical processes in the nervous  system.  With the advent of high-speed graphics workstations and  new mathematical and numerical methods for describing complex  dynamical systems, many difficult problems in neuroscience can now  be addressed.  Coupled with the explosion in experimental  neurobiological data, these new developments have lead to the  emergence of the rapidly growing field of computational  neuroscience which represents a remarkable coalition of  interrelated disciplines:  neurobiology, computer science,  biochemistry, artificial intelligence, molecular biology,  mathematics, psychology, physics, and philosophy.         The project lays the foundation for a Laboratory for  Computational Neuroscience at Wesleyan University.  Because of the  new computer technologies and new theoretical and numerical methods  for describing complex systems, this exciting interdisciplinary  field should be both accessible and appealing to undergraduate  students.  The proposed facility will provide the foundation for  both undergraduate courses and research opportunities in the  modelling of neurobiological processes from the  electrophysiological behavior of single neurons to the  spatio-temporal patterns of activity in neural networks.  In  addition, these facilities will also be available for the further  development of courses and research projects in other  interdisciplinary areas of computational science.",
