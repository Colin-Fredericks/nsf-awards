 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the university is creating a Digital  Technology Network (DTN), which is a hands-on laboratory facility  for undergraduate biology majors and nonscientists, in lower- and  upper-level courses.   The backbone of the DTN is a local area  computer network adapted to the needs of cmurses in each  curricular area.   Instead of a traditional experience in which  students are passive recipients of faculty knowledge and  expertise, the DTN promotes the development of experienced  practitioners of science.   In introductory courses, the DTN is  used in group problem-solving activities that enhance computer  literacy and analytical skills while promoting critical thinking,  collaborative interaction, and understanding of biological  concepts.   The DTN is becoming part of the normal student  laboratory routine.   Lecture and laboratory are coordinated in  an iterative framework designed to make progressively greater  demands on incipient skills.   From simple beginning exercises  with simulation and physiology, students progress to complex,  open-ended exercises.   In upper-division courses, students  construct and manipulate analytical spreadsheets and population  projection matrices.   They collect and analyze gene sequences in  Internet databases.   They plan and execute physiology  experiments that draw on their accumulated skills in computerized  data collection and analysis, generation of hypotheses and  experimental designs, collaboration with colleagues in the lab  and on the Internet.",
