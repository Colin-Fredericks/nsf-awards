 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507409  Bucher    The long term goal of this pilot project is to understand the  genetic mechanisms of muscle cell specification in a developing  organism. In vitro studies of vertebrate muscle gene regulation  have revealed a complexity of transcription factors involved in  muscle cell differentiation and determination. The analysis of  muscle gene regulation in vivo should extend these studies to  understand genetic pathways and to define regulatory factors that  can only be discovered in vivo. This pilot project undertakes one  aim, comprised of transgenic studies, to investigate the in vivo  sequence requirements for temporal and oviduct lineage specific  expression of the C. elegans troponin T (CeTnT) muscle gene. C.  elegans is an organism having well established genetic and  molecular transgenic approaches and the C. elegans oviduct is an  ideal tissue to undertake these studies: the oviduct is comprised  of only 10 muscle cells that arise through a simple stereotyped  series of cell divisions. Furthermore, similar to some vertebrate  muscle types, the oviduct dose not express the CeMyoD transcription  factor and thus other factors may be revealed. The CeTnT gene  structure is simple and provides an ideal molecular target to study  gene expression. Different CeTnT genomic sequences will be cloned  upstream of reporter genes. Reporter gene expression will then be  assayed in individual cells of transgenic worms to characterize the  in vivo requirements for oviduct specific expression. Dr. Bucher  will test the hypothesis that MEF2 and E-box consensus sequences  are required for oviduct expression. She will also test the  hypothesis that novel consensus sequences are required for oviduct  expression. Identification of new cis sequences elements that  direct oviduct expression will provide the basis for future  experiments involving the cloning of new transcription factors  using molecular/biochemical approaches and by genetic suppression  strategies. The expectation is that these appro aches will  ultimately elucidate in vivo genetic pathways and define new genes  involved in extracellular and intracellular signalling, as well as  transcriptional regulators of the myogenic regulatory pathway.  ***",
