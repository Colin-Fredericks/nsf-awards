 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420798  McDermott  Research Plan:  The literature contains numerous examples  that shows the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis readily responds  to the application of phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and that  nodulated legumes have a higher P requirement for optimum  growth than non-nodulated legumes.  Various symbiotic  features of this agronomically important plant-microbe  interaction are significantly enhanced by P fertilization.  However, we know little about the basis for increased P  requirements of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, or the basis of  the P respone, particularly the role of the bacterioids in  this response.    In the proposed work, R. meliloti will be used to begin a  qualitative and quantitative assessment of Rhizobium genes  that are affected by P availability.  R. meliloti, strain  104A14, has been mutated with a transposon that carries a  promoterless lacZ gene which behaves as a reporter gene when  insertion is in the correct orientation relative to the  active promoter.  After extensive screening, 19 mutants were  identified that exhibited significantly greater reporter  gene activity when the cells were P-stressed relative to  when the cells were provided adeuate P.  The reporter  mutants will be further characterized to determine what  role, if any, they have in P acquisition, what metabolic  role the wild-type gene may have, and if their expression is  influenced by other environmental stimuli.  Further, their  symbiosis phenotype will be determined with host genotypes  that are either P-use efficient or inefficient, and under  conditions where P is either limiting or in excess for the  host plant.  Finally, selected mutants will be studied at  the sequence level.  The effected gene(s) will be cloned an  sequenced to help in their identification.    Education Plan:  The Education Plan involves three levels of  instruction: 1) development of new courses, 2) traditional  graduate student and posdoctoral scientist training, and 3)  specialized undergraduate research training.  The n ew  courses being developed include one undergraduate course and  one graduate course, taught in alternate years.  A  specialized undergraudate research training program is also  described.  The purpose of this program is to identify  talented undergraduate students and provide them with one-on-  one training.  The program is geared to enhance the training  opportunities for those students who are planning on  postgraduate school and a research-oriented career.  The  research conducted by these undergraduates will be under the  direct supervision of the PI and will part of the work  described in the Research Plan.",
