 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ku    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Teh-Lung Ku and his  colleagues will conduct uranium series dating on a series of  speleothem (cave limestone) deposits from the  archaeological/paleontological site of Zhoukoudian which is  located near Beijing, China. This site is one of the most  important in the world because its deposits span a major portion  of the last Ice Age and contain both archaeological materials and  hominid remains. The hominid cranial material from the site  played a basic role in the definition of Homo erectus in Asia.  Nine of the 13 layers at Zhoukoudian, locality 1 contain hominid  remains. The layers are also very rich in archaeological  materials including both stone tools and faunal remains and may  contain the earliest evidence for the controlled use of fire. A  major problem with the site has been the inability of scientists  to obtain good age estimates for each layer. Dr. Ku and his  colleagues will collect speleothem from secure geological  contexts and conduct uranium series dating. Additionally, the age  determination will be carried out using thermal ionization mass  spectrometry - a recently developed technique that has  revolutionized the geochronology because of the technique's  unparalleled precision and sensitivity. It has the potential to  extend the U-series dating limit from ca 350 ka to ca. 600 ka.    Paleoanthropologists wish to understand how hominids developed  both culturally and physically over time. Data to date indicate  that the Far East played an important role in this process but  unfortunately relatively few sites have been discovered and  excavated in this part of the world. For this reason Zhoukoudian  with its rich fossil and archaeological record is extremely  important. More precise dating will allow these remains to be  interpreted in a broader geographical context.",
