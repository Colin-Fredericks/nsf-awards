 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work would apply an existing modular model of the open  magnetosphere to three problems that are critical to the NSF  Geospace Modeling Program.  The objectives of the proposed work are  to develop a predictive understanding of (1) injection of solar-  wind plasma through the dayside magnetospheric cusp, (2) externally  or internally imposed time variations of the polar cap  configuration, and (3) reverse convection driven by a nearly  northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).  The proposed method  combines physical-numerical modeling with spacecraft data analysis.    The model, developed over the past decade with partial support of  the GEM program, describes the quantitative mapping of the solar  wind electric field from the magnetopause to the polar ionosphere  along interconnected magnetic field lines.  A machine-potable,  user-friendly version of this model for steady-state applications  has recently been made available to the GEM research community.  A  recent extension of this model permits relaxation of the steady-  state assumption for time-dependent applications.    The first application, modeling of cusp ion injection, involves an  ongoing collaboration with T. Onsager to couple his Liouville  mapping procedure with the modular open magnetosphere model to  produce quantitatively realistic simulations of cusp ion  distributions for comparison with real spacecraft data for a  general range of input solar-wind/IMF conditions.  This study is  intended to elucidate the mechanism(s) if injection of solar-wind  plasma at the dayside magnetopause to form the cusp and adjacent  boundary features.    The second application will explore two types of quasi-static time  evolution of the polar cap, those driven externally by solar-  wind/IMF variations and those driven internally by magnetotail  dynamics as communicated to the ionosphere by the electric field  mapped from the tail merging line.  This study will exploit the  unique properties of the polar cap not only as an obs ervation site  but also as a reference frame for theoretical-numerical modeling.    The third application will continue a collaboration with N.U.  Crooker to develop a quantitative model of the overdraped lobe  configuration proposed by her to explain the otherwise enigmatic  observation of sunward convection on putatively open lobe field  lines connected to the solar wind during intervals of nearly  northward IMF.  This and related northward-IMF phenomena represent  perhaps the widest gap in present theoretical understanding of  solar-wind-magnetosphere coupling.",
