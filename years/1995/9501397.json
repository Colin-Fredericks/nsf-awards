 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501397  Agler      After the spectral theorem it is difficult to think of a theorem that has had a more profound effect on the development of operator theory and its myriad of applications to mathematics and science than the Sz.-Nagy Dilation Theorem. The idea of representing a general operator in a specified class of operators as part of a nice operator in the class has had many successes. This project further develops this point of view with a primary focus on unsolved problems in operator theory and the theories of one and several complex variables.      Hilbert space operators are infinite generalizations of matrices. The infinite generalization of a vector is frequently a function and for this reason Hilbert space operators are frequently modeled as the operator of multiplication on a space of functions. This project involves finding models for operators. Once such models are obtained many basic questions about the structure of these operators become more natural.  ***",
