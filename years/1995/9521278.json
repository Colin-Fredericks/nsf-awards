 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521278   Irani   This faculty internship project builds on an existing relationship between the principal investigator and the Minnesota Valley Engineering, Inc. Under the existing relationship, Minnesota Valley Engineering  funded the investigator to undertake a preliminary study to design fabrication and machining cells to feed a jumbo pressure vessel assembly shop. In the course of the study, it was found that the two most employed algorithms used for cell formation, namely, matrix clustering and operation sequence clustering proved inadequate for the problem. The study also pointed to the need to develop a library of algorithms for use in manufacturing flow analysis. Thus, the objective of this internship is to undertake the development of an enhanced algorithm for use in cell formation. This algorithm will incorporate the strengths of the matrix clustering and operation sequence clustering algorithms.  To meet its objective, the project will (1) explore the clustering effectiveness and computational benefits of different enhancements, (2) develop a core algorithm for material flow analysis that incorporates operation sequences, batch quantities, and intercell and intracell flows, (3) develop layout design lectures, (4) undertake the development of a technology transfer program with local companies interested in cellular manufacturing, and (5) create an enhanced version of STORM for teaching students in industrial engineering and operations research.    Material flow analysis and improvement is at the core of competitive and economic manufacturing. It will reduce the cost of material handling  within and between cells or machine stations. Additional benefits include reduction in machine setup times, production cycle, and work-in-process inventory. Thus, this project is addressing a problem that is widespread and one in which many companies stand to gain in several ways if an effective solution methodology is found.",
