The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite      receivers to pin point the location of research sites,      communication equipment including radio transceivers and      satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data      communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.             The Project Director, Steve Rabalais is fully qualified to direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the  acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.              This project will allow the institution to replace an inadequate  fathometer.  ***",
