 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417374  Berry    Rheological and rheooptical studies are being carried out on  nematic polymers and their solutions.  The linear and  nonlinear viscoelastic properties of this technologically  important class of materials are complex owing to the  inherent anisotropy of the properties of an ordered, nematic  phase.  Four nematogenic polymers are to be studied to  provide a systematic variation in the molecular  characteristics giving rise to nematic order.  Three of the  systems are solutions of chains with large persistence  lengths characterizing their conformation, but with  differing degrees of rigidity to the molecular conformation.  Two have high rigidity of structure, but with persistence  lengths differing by a factor of two: poly (1,4-phenylene-  2,6-benzobisthiazole), PBZT, and poly (1,4-phenylene-2,6-  benzobisoxazole), PBZO, with the former having the higher  persistence length.  The third, poly(1,4-phenylene-  terephthalate, has a persistence length similar to PBZO, but  is believed to have a less rigid structure.  The fourth  sample is a poly(1-olefin sulfone) known to form an ordered  fluid over a range of temperatures.  The proposed studies  include static and dynamic light scattering on aligned  monodomains to determine the Frank curvature elasticities  for distortion of the director field, and associated  viscosities, as functions of chain length, concentration and  other variables.  Third harmonic generation on the same  samples will be used to assess surface layers of special  alignment, including a biaxial nematic alignment, that may  be important to rheological behavior.  The emphasis will be  on the use of creep and recovery and rheooptical  measurements on nematic preparations, with no prior  treatment to induce overall alignment, augmented by studies  on monodomain samples to determine whether the preparations  align in a slow shear flow.  %%%  The rheology of isotropic solutions of nematogenic polymers  comprising rodlike sequences catenated by monomers imparting  a no n rodlike linkage will also be studied.  The study is  directed to elucidation of aspects of the molecular dynamics  of semiflexible chains.  It is postulated that chains may  exhibit a marked suppression in molecular mobility, perhaps  leading to a structural glass similar to one proposed  theoretically, but never found, for nematogenic rodlike  polymers.  This could occur owing to the severe restriction  to rotational motions expected for each of the rodlike  subunits, leading to an overall suppression of molecular  diffusion, and solid-like behavior under small stresses.  A  yield behavior to fluid-like behavior is anticipated at  larger stresses, owing to the relatively weak intermolecular  interactions leading to the structural glass.",
