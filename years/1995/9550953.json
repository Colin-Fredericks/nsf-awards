 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Drafting and Design Department is incorporating rapid  prototyping as a key element in the revision of the curriculum.    Objectives of this project are: (1) to modernize the drafting and  design technology curricula by providing the required rapid  prototyping laboratory equipment; (2) to establish a rapid  prototyping laboratory for hands-on learning concordant with  curriculum development recommendations for associate degree  engineering technology courses; (3) to implement available  distance learning technologies for cost-effective rapid  prototyping laboratory access by other 2-year associate degree  programs; (4) to offer rapid prototyping laboratory access to a  regional consortium; and (5) to provide rapid prototyping  laboratory access for the university's project to implement,  integrate, and pilot implement a national model for manufacturing  education.     The current basis for design representation is the  solid geometric model.   New program outcomes would be enhanced  by providing students with the opportunity to take the next  logical step (i.e., from a solid geometric model, seamlessly and  quickly, to an actual prototype of the part to be manufactured).    Students acquire additional knowledge and skills at the design -  production interface, the type of concurrent engineering that is  becoming commonplace in heavily technological advanced  manufacturing operations.",
