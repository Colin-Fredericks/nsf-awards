 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503227  Yarmush  This project is on research to study the use of hydrostatic  pressure as a mild and effective means of dissociating  antigen-antibody complexes, thus providing a rational basis for  the design of strategies which utilize this pressure sensitivity  in separation and/or sensing applications.  The proposed studies  include three aspects: (1) fundamental solution-phase  thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the  pressure-induced phenomena for a panel of antibodies using high  pressure fluorescence spectroscopy; (2) protein engineering  studies directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms  mediating pressure effects; and (3) thermodynamic, kinetic and  pressure cycling studies with immobilized antibodies to develop  operational strategies for practical pressure elution on a large  scale.  In addition to providing the rational framework for the  development of strategies for engineering and utilizing pressure  sensitive antibodies, this research could also result in advances  in the fundamental understanding of pressure effects on protein  structure and function.  ***",
