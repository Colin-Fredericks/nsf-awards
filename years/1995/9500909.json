 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500909  Walnut    The project consists of two parts.  First,  the investigator  proposes to apply   new results in sampling theory to do high-resolution signal  processing by   combining several low-resolution versions of a given signal. It  was   observed by Berenstein and others that a mathematical model of  this   problem (called multisensor deconvolution) is uniquely solvable  but ill-  posed, and difficult to solve numerically. The investigator has  found   Shannon-type sampling formulas on unions of regular lattices with    incommensurate densities, which provide simple solutions to the   multichannel deconvolution problem in special cases.   The  following   applications are envisioned: 1) Sharpening measurements taken by  CT   scanners by combining measurements from several low-resolution   detectors.  This could ultimately lead to inexpensive measuring  devices with   resolution comparable to expensive high-resolution machines. 2) A  recently   proposed scheme to increase resolution in an industrial  tomography   problem involves sampling on unions of regular grids of  incommensurate   size.  The investigator's sampling results could lead to a  complete solution   to this problem. 3) New techniques are required to do  \"superresolution\" in    electronic imaging since the theoretical limit of pixel  resolution is rapidly   being reached.  Deconvolution at high-resolution of several  low-resolution   images is a natural approach to this problem.  Second, the  investigator and   others have successfully shown that wavelets are a natural tool  for   recovering edge features of an image from local Radon transform  data.  The   investigator proposes to develop these local algorithms with the  following   goals envisioned: 1) Find ways to recover locally density as well  as edge   features of an image, and develop an algorithm competitive with  existing   local tomography algorithms and 2) Identify the wavefront set of  an image   using wavelets, and ultimately apply the techniques to the   at tenuated Radon   transform.    The first part of the project is concerned with increasing the  resolution of   remote sensing devices such as electronic cameras.  Suppose, for  example,   that a CCD camera has a resolution of 1 millimeter, that is, it  can   distinguish features of a scene that are at least 1 mm on a side.   Features   smaller than that are blurred into their surroundings. Berenstein  and others   observed that some classical mathematics led to a possible way to  increase   resolution without designing an expensive high-resolution device.   If one   took several images of the scene with cameras identical to the  first but   which had slightly poorer resolutions than the first (this could  also be   achieved by repositioning the same camera), then in theory one  could   recover features of the original scene to arbitrary resolution.   In practice,   arbitrary resolution is not possible, but it seems that real  increases in   resolution can be achieved.  The investigator has formulated an  approach to   this problem from the point of view of sampling theory.  Using  this   approach, the investigator has been able to produce numerically  stable   twenty-fold increases in resolution in a one-dimensional model  problem.   More work is required, but the following applications are  envisioned: 1)   Producing high-resolution measurements from CT scanners by  combining   the measurements from several low-resolution scanners and 2)  Increasing   the resolution in a specific industrial tomography problem by a  direct   application of the investigator's new sampling results.  The  second part of   the project is concerned with \"local\" CT scans.  In existing CT  scanners, an   entire slice of a patient's body must be exposed to radiation  even if the   doctor is interested in looking at only a small region. The  investigator   proposes to use a new and powerful signal processing technique  called   wavelets to find efficient algorithms for obtaining an image of a  small area   of a patient's  body while only exposing the area of interest to  radiation. It is   hoped that these techniques will be competitive with existing  so-called local   tomography algorithms.",
