 "awd_abstract_narration": "To strengthen its undergraduate curriculum, the Department of  Biology has recently instituted a series of undergraduate  research courses required for the Bachelor of Science degree in  Biology.   The course series (1) begins with a course in  scientific methods and research proposal development, (2)  continues with a semester of directed undergraduate research, and  (3) concludes with a symposium presentation and a written thesis  or journal publication.   Additionally, two new interdisciplinary  Bachelor of Science degree programs with concentrations in  hazardous waste management or natural and cultural resources  management have been developed.   This project provides new  equipment to support interdisciplinary undergraduate research  activities to detect heavy metals and chlorinated organic  compounds in environmental samples; examine the transport of  these substances through water, soils, and sediments; and  investigate the applied use of plants and microorganisms in  bioremediation.   Additionally, the equipment undoubtedly  enhances the educational experience in the courses physical  geology, physical geography, soils, environmental chemistry, and  toxicological chemistry within the management degree programs.    The major equipment items include an automated gas chromatograph,  an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with computer station for  equipment control and data analysis, lab-top centrifuge with  rotors, two bench-top incubator shakers, a portable hand-operated  sieve shaker, and a Spectronic 20, single-beam spectrophotometer.    The undergraduate research program, the envirolmental programs,  and this new equipment are essential components of the  university's mission to seek a high level of excellence in  undergraduate education including the natural and physical  sciences.",
