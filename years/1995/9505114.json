From the modeling  standpoint, spatial priors that are mixtures over simple  Markov random fields (MRF's) are developed in two distinct  contexts.  In the first, mixtures will be constructed to allow  robust inference when anomalies, and heterogeneity  are present in the spatial process.  In the second context, mixtures over different scales  will be considered, so that the scale of the MRF can  be rigorously treated as a parameter when making inference.  Only very recent advances in Markov chain  Monte Carlo (MCMC) make inference from such models possible.  Applications in agriculture, imaging and environmental monitoring  will be considered.    The proposed research will develop statistical methodologies for  analyzing spatial data which combines information at various scales.    Development of spatial models suitable for agriculture,  imaging (eg. remote sensing and medical imaging), environmental  monitoring and assessing environmental trends are main goals  of this research.  Current statistical methods typically require  restrictive assumptions which often make formal analyses   in these areas difficult or impossible.  This methodology will relax these  assumptions.  A primary motivation for combining information from various   scales is for dealing with geographical information systems used  for environmental monitoring.  Such systems invariably contain data   at varying scales which can be incorporated in the analysis.",
