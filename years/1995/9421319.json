Bass  Verbal and non-verbal communication skills are widely used  throughout the animal kingdom for mate selection and reproduction,  food collection and formation of social structures.  However, the  brain mechanisms involved in communication are frequently complex  and difficult to study.  Dr. Bass, a highly regarded behavioral  neuroendocrinologist,  has identified and characterized a unique  neural system of vocal communication in a simple vertebrate species  during his previous investigations.  This system is unique in that  a single muscle is responsible for the generation of sound.  In the  present study, Dr. Bass will use a highly creative and integrative  approach to study the brain mechanisms involved in generating  rhythmical vocal behaviors and the role of androgens in  gender-specific differentiation of that circuitry and behavior.   Previous studies identified a brain command center for vocal  behavior and electrical recordings will be used to determine the  anatomical connections of the system.  Additional studies will  investigate the ability of androgenic hormones to act within this  command center to facilitate the development of vocal behaviors in  these animals.  These studies have the potential to define the  actions of hormones on neural pathways leading to behavior changes,  which may be applicable to other species including man.",
