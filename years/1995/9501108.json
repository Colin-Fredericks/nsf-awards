 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501108  Wybourne  The phase memory of electrons is maintained in samples with dimensions  less   than  the  electron-electron  and  electron-phonon  interaction  lengths.  In this situation there is no dissipation in the sample, and  parts  of  the  sdample outside the classical current  path  influence  transport  phenomena  associated with the electron's  phase.   In  the  proposed  research,  a related transport regime in  which  the  sample  dimensions are greater than the electron-electron interaction  length,  but  less than the electron-phonon relaxation length, will be studied.  In  this case phase memory is lost, yet dissipation within the  sample  remains  unlikely.  To study the relationship between dissipation  and  sample geometry, electron transport measurements will be made on metal  microstructures  of  different  shapes  under  conditions   far   from  equilibrium.  Fluctuations in the electron energy loss are anticipated  when  the  electron-phonon  relaxation length  approaches  the  sample  dimensions.  Dissipation in the sample is expected to be dependent  on  the  acoustic mode confinement in the structure, especially  when  the  confined  acoustic  mode energy spacing is greater than  the  internal  energy of the electron gas.  %%%  Many  experiments have been reported on phase coherence and  ballistic  electron transport for which energy dissipation occurs mainly  in  the  circuit  contacts.  Little experimental work has been directed towards  the  onset  of  dissipation in microstructures (as in computer  chips)  that occurs when the characteristic length associated with energy loss  becomes   comparable  to  the  sample  dimensions.   In  the  proposed  research,   electron  transport  measurements  will  be   made   under  conditions  far  from equilibrium in order to study  the  relationship  between energy dissipation and the geometry of  a microstructure.  The  connection  between  dissipation and the acoustic  properties  of  the  microstructures will also be inve stigated.  ***",
