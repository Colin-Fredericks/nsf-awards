 "awd_abstract_narration": "As  computer  Systems  become  ubiquitous  and  more  information  becomes  available  electronically, it is increasingly  important  for  computer systems to be able to collaborate with  each  other  and their users.  The develop ment of the underlying theories and  formalization needed to build collaborative systems will have far-  reaching  practical  import  as well  as  addressing  challenging  computer  science   problems.  The Shared Plan  formalization  of  collaboration  (Grosz  and Kraus, 1995; Grosz  and  Kraus,  1993)  provides  a  specification of the capabilities to act and  mental  attitudes  that agents must have to participate in  collaborative  activities with one another.  This formalization will be extended  developing strategies for elabmrating partial plans by specifying  axioms that treat more completely the attitude of intending  that  a  proposition  hold.  In addition a collaborative  communication  system  based on Shared Plans will be designed: this system  will  both  demonstrate  the value of a model of collaboration  to  the  design   of  human-computer  interface  systems  and   test   the  formalization.   The  proposed research will  contribute  to  the  development of computer agents that are fully collaborative, with  each  other and their users; it will also enable the construction  of more flexible and user-friendly interfaces.",
