 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming in the purchase of a Rapid Scanning  Stopped-Flow spectrometer.  This new instrumentation will enhance the research in a number  of areas including the following:  Mechanisms for the Decomposition of Peroxynitrite;  Activation of Carbonyls by Lewis Acids; The Reactions of Di- and Trisulfides with  Dimethyldioxirane; Metal-Alkyl Protonolysis Kinetics Studies; and Stopped-Flow Studies  of Luminescence Sensors Based on Complexes Containing MLCT Excited States.    A Stopped-Flow spectrometer is used to follow the kinetics of fast reactions in which the  reagents cannot be previously mixed.  The Stopped-Flow method uses a small solution volume  in a static reactor connected to a rapid-mixing device.  The mixed solutions passed into the  reactor is stopped when a steady state is reached, and the reactant concentration is monitored  spectrophometrically.  The Stopped-Flow method is used in fast reactions, such as enzyme-  catalyzed reactions.",
