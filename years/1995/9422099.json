Glajch of the Division of   Analytical Chemistry (DAC) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) will   organize and conduct a novel  three year symposium series entitled \"New   Voices at the Frontiers\" for inclusion in the April 1995, March 1996, and   April 1997 national ACS meetings. The major objective of these symposia   is to provide a prominent forum for increasing the visibility and   participation of young chemists in the analytical chemistry research and   education community.  The invited participants will be current award   recipients of the DAC Graduate Fellowships and/or the IM Kolthoff   Enrichment Undergraduate Awards. Each awardee will present a 20 - 25   minute presentation of his or her accomplishments. In addition, each   symposium will include a 45 minute keynote address to be given by a   preeminent analytical chemist known for accomplishments as a researcher   or educator.  All participants in the program will be guests of honor at   a reception immediately preceding the DAC poster session.",
