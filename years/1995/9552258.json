 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to improve educational experiences  for students enrolled in physical science, integrated science,  and calculus-based introductory physics.   The first objective of  this project is to equip an available room so that students in  the physical science laboratory course and students enrolled in  the integrated science sequence can benefit from a modified  version of the research-based lab activities (for example, Tools  for Scientific Thinking) that have been used with great success  in the introductory physics labs.    The second major goal of  this project is to enable the physics department to enhance  student learning in the calculus-based introductory physics  course by using the \"Workshop Physics\" format--a technique that  Priscilla Laws at Dickinson College has shown to be educationally  effective.    Ten audiovisual computers are provided through this  project.   Site licenses for software packages are also provided.    Version 1.1 of the \"Scientific Reasoning Series,\" along with  SoftWindows, allow the department to upgrade and update this  software, which has been used on a limited scale with the  physical science labs.   \"Interactive Physics\" (version 2.5) is  being used in a pilot program for the physical science and  integrated science classes to determine if this program can be  used effectively with these students.",
