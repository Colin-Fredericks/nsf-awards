 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520526  Neuman  The goal of this research is to develop inexpensive  instrumentation for the detection of bacterial vaginosis  (BV) in the patients home.  This instrumentation is to be  based upon new sensor technology resulting from research at  the Duke-North Carolina Engineering Research Center for  Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies support by the National  Science Foundation.  The investigator's goal is to develop  low-cost microelectronics-based biomedical sensors for  accurate detecting of bacterial vaginosis with an  intravaginal probe.  A tampon-like disposable probe will be  developed in two forms-one with electrical connection to a  linear eternal electronic readout (a microcomputer) for the  doctor's office and another self contained unit (battery  operated) for home testing for BV infections.    The multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research team  is quite impressive and the impressive investigators have  extensive experience in the areas necessary for completing  the work plan.    The project involves multidisciplinary interactions from  three universities.  Fundamental chemistry studies and  development of the biosensors will be carried out in the  Department  of Chemistry at the University of North  Carolina; microelectronics fabrication of sensors will use  facilities of the Case Western Reserve University and North  Carolina State University; economic modeling will be done at  Duke University and Case.  The potential for cost reduction  is through the development of simple technology for  detecting BV that will reduce the cost of diagnosis as well  as reducing treatment costs resulting from nonspecific  diagnosis.  ***",
