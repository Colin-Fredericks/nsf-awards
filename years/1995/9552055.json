 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses (1) how to make Priscilla Law's Workshop  Physics (WP) applicable and cost-effective at the university with  a large number of students taking physics and (2) how to enhance  learning in the physics laboratory for the average student,  particularly Science, Engineering, and Architecture majors.   For  these objectives, new equipment establishes networked  Microcomputer-Based Laboratories in two physics laboratories.    The university is using the \"Motion and Force Evaluation Test\" of  Ronald Thornton's Tools for Scientific Teaching (TST) project as  a screening device to determine which students should take an  Introductory Physics course before taking the University or  College Physics courses.   This Introductory Physics course is  being run like WP.   Those students who actually need intensive  training get it, but those who do not go on to the standard  College or University Physics courses, thus educating the  students in a cost-effective way.   All the students also use the  computer tools in a Physics Lab course which most of the students  at the university must take.   About 600 students, primarily  Engineering and Architecture majors would be exposed to the TST  microcomputer-based lab each year.   Since the experiments have  been developed primarily for Science and Engineering majors, new  experiments are being developed for the Architecture majors, to  suit their interests and profession.   This pilot program can  have national significance by establishing a model for those  universities who have a large number of physics students and  limited lab space.",
