 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMR-9419257  Marchetti  This project addresses several theoretical aspects of  nonequilibrium superconductivity and nonlinear collective  transport.  Vortex arrays pinned by extended defects, such  as twin boundaries, are studied.  The hydrodynamics of flux-  line liquids will be derived and applied.  Specific models  for flux lattices are studied to understand the general  features of collective nonlinear dynamics and transport in  driven disordered systems.  Also, the dynamics of  topological defects produced when a systems is quenched from  a disordered to an ordered phase across a symmetry breaking  transition is also included as a new direction of research.  %%%  This project concerns, in part, a theoretical analysis of  arrays of linear defects found in high temperature  superconductors.  This understanding should contribute to  the goal of controlling the energy loss present in a variety  of applications of these materials.  The study of these  defects and how they move should also have applications to  other classes of materials which are currently of interest  in the laboratory.  A close collaboration with  experimentalists and theorists at Argonne National  laboratory is planned as part of this work.",
