 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will arrange  summer research internships for 10 middle-grades education  majors and 10 experienced middle-school science or  mathematics teachers in faculty research laboratories.  Preservice and in service interns will work in pairs so that  the preservice students can benefit from the classroom  experience of their service partners as they assimilate the  significance of their research experience for the practice  of teaching.  A series of meetings will be held during the  summer to facilitate this assimilation.  During the same  summer, a working group of discipline faculty, education  faculty and middle-school teachers will develop a two-  semester interdisciplinary courses entitled \"The Nature of  Science and Mathematics.\"  The preservice participants will  take this course during the following academic year, when  they will also complete their student teaching in the  Guilford County Schools.  Every effort will be made to place  student teachers in the classrooms of their research  internship partners.  Assessment of the graduates' first  semester of independent teaching will be carried out in the  following fall semester to examine the effect of the  research experience and the  interdisciplinary course on  their teaching of science and mathematics in the middle-  school classroom.",
