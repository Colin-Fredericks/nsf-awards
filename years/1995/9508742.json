These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of   doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry.   The Postdoctoral researcher will be engaged in a joint research effort that unites   researchers at Texas A&M University with a group at the David Sarnoff Research Center   in Princeton, New Jersey.  The research will focus on the application of techniques in   algebraic geometry, notably geometric invariant theory, and computational algebraic   geometry to problems in image recognition, image database indexing for content-based   retrieval, and computer vision.  The fellow will do original research to develop a theory of   equivariant correspondences coming out of questions motivated by problems in relating 3-  D objects to 2-D images and vice versa.  The work will involve the design of algorithms to   implement the results, as well as an analysis of their robustness with respect to geometric   variation.",
