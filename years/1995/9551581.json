The laboratory will consist of 20 Hewlett Packard 486  computer work stations networked via Novell software through an  existing local file server.  Using Visual Basic multimedia software  and object oriented programs developed by supervising instructors,  a central user interface allows access to, and control of, the  various instructional media.  Functions and rules, designed to be  independent of subject mater, are implemented using a decision  table processor.  A combination of interactive digitized video and  audio is integrated with graphics and text presentations.  The  students are provided with lecture, drill, problem solving, open  ended questions, review, and testing as deemed beneficial or  necessary.  The computer guides each student through an  individualized tutorial session.  The route taken by the student is  based upon that particular student's activities.  Therefore, each  student participates in a unique tutorial session geared to his  specific requirements and cognitive style.  Students who have  already utilized two of the currently available MIND mathematics  sessions responded positively to correction of their errors in  judgment and reasoning.  The ability of MIND to provide  constructive, instructive feedback creates a mentoring atmosphere  dramatically different from other developmental mathematics  tutorial softw are.",
