This research will develop theories for macromolecular  solvation and implement them into simulation algorithms and to  study specific interactions of water and counterions with proteins.   Simple continuum solvent models are insufficient to describe  phenomena such as hydrogen bonding, local dielectric perturbations  and phenomena involving separations of only a few water layers.  To  understand and model the molecular nature of solvation, the  approach used here is the development of statistical mechanical  integral equation theories.  First, the previously proposed  integral equation theory for solvation of globular molecules will  be extended to proteins.  To facilitate this, a new model of water  for simulations will be developed, which is equivalent to TIP4P in  structural properties but is three times faster than 3-site water  models in Monte Carlo simulations.  Without further development,  this theory can then be used to predict the solvation of a given  structure; e.g., a crystal or NMR structure of a protein.  Second,  this theory of aqueous solvation of macromolecules will be  incorporated into dynamics simulation algorithms.  Currently,  addition of explicit solvent into a molecular dynamics simulation  is the only simulation method to include the molecular nature of  water, but it is very costly in computer resources.  Several  different methods of incorporating this theory are discussed.  The  final goal is incorporation of ionic strength effects into  simulation methods.  %%%  The development of theories of aqueous solvation of biological  macromolecules is crucial to understanding their structure and  function.
