 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500940  Soner    This is a proposal to National Science Foundation to work on the  applications of nonlinear partial   differential equations to phase transitions, evolving surfaces  and  stochastic control. The proposed studies in evolutionary phase  transitions and evolving surfaces concern the development of the  asymptotic analysis of  systems of reaction-diffusion equations  (including the phase-field, Cahn-Hilliard, and the vector valued  Ginzburg-Landau equations), the further study of the interface  propagation with three or more phases, the analysis of the  dynamics of  surfaces with it arbitrary codimension, and the development of a  level  set approach for these surfaces. The proposed studies in  stochastic  control concern the analysis of mathematical financial models and  the  approximation of complex, controlled systems  by simpler and more  tractable continuum models.  The theory of viscosity solutions  have been  very successful in establishing  the connection between various  approximate and the original models.  Proposed here is to  continue this  research when the continuum models are singularly controlled.    In  mathematical finance, partial differential equations have been an  efficient tool not only in the analysis but also in numerical   computations.  Option pricing provides a good example of this.   The  principal investigator proposes to use the theory of viscosity  solutions  in the analysis of models with transaction  costs.  %%%    Research on the phase transitions and evolving surfaces is  related to  several models in  materials science modeling the dynamics of grain boundaries,  interfaces  between different phases and defects.  Understanding the  propagation of  defects and interfaces is of fundamental importance not only for  its  intrinsic interest but also for its technological importance.   Research  on stochastic control is related to problems in manufacturing,  communications and mathematical finance.  In mathematical  finance,  Black-Scholes type option  pricing problems will be investigated  in the  presence of transaction costs.  ***",
