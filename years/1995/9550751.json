 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the Delaware State University Summer Science Camp are  to increase students awareness of mathematics and science careers,  to develop a deep appreciation for mathematics and science in  underrepresented minority students (African-Americans, Native  Americans and Hispanics), to improve and strengthen students  academic preparation in science and mathematics.  The objectives  are to build the confidence levels of students so positive  attitudes will gradually replace negative attitudes toward science  and mathematics, to maintain the students high interest in science  and mathematics by mentoring, counseling and continuing with  follow-up activities during the academic year. to develop  participatory laboratory activities, to expose students to  professional role models through interactions with local scientists  and mathematicians, to use the team approach to expose students to  scientific principles, laws and theories via group science  projects, to increase the depth of the student's prior experiences  in reading interpreting and communication through the individual  tutorial conference technique, and to urge parent to become more  involved in their children education.  The methods to be employed  are hands-on classroom activities, computer-assisted instruction in  each subject area, science exploratory field trips and experimental  demonstrations in research laboratories.  Local scientists, SSC  staff, those in industries, undergraduates will serve as role  models.  Students will get the opportunity to present their science  projects to the community and will be engaged in follow-up  activities during the academic year.  There is expected to be an  increase in underrepresented minorities who are committed to  attending graduate school and obtaining Ph.D. degree in Science,  Mathematics and Engineering. The challenge is to provide productive  citizens that are versatile and well-trained to met the nation's  need of scientists.  ***",
