The long term goal of the research is to elucidate  quantitatively the dynamical and entropic aspects of DNA  recognition by protein domains.  The initial phase of this research  will use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational and  dynamical properties of the GCN4 bZip homodimer, in the presence  and absence of DNA.  In the bZip classes of transcriptional  activators, the basic domain recognition helices are stable only in  the presence of DNA.  Dynamical features of DNA-recognition are  hypothesized to include: (i) surface exposed, presumably mobile,  side chains in the free protein are buried in the major groove of  the DNA upon complexation, (ii) low energy deformation of the DNA  upon protein binding implies increased conformational flexibility  of the free DNA at the site of the deformation, (iii)  conformational changes in the backbone of the protein may be  necessary to accommodate the  -helix into the major groove of the  DNA, and (iv) ancillary amino acid residues that interact with the  minor groove or phosphate backbone may be disordered in the absence  of DNA and ordered in the complex.  The (nascent) structure and  conformational dynamics of the GCN4 bZip domain in the absence of  DNA will be characterized using J-coupling measurements and spin  relaxation techniques, including homonuclear NOESY and ROESY  experiments, and heteronuclear R1, R2, R1p, and NOE experiments.  In  the presence of DNA, spin relaxation experiments will be used to  obtain information on the dynamical properties of the complex that  is complementary to the existing crystallographic structural  results.  Comparison of the dynamical properties of the free energy  of DNA binding from configurational entropy of  individual amino  acid residues.  %%%  Proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences are critical for  regulation of gene expression.  Explication of the molecular basis  for sequence-specific recognition is crucial to a fundamental  understanding of cellular transformation.  In the past, the three-  dimensional structures of DNA-binding proteins in the absence and  presence of DNA have been studied to determine the interactions  between the protein and DNA that confer sequence specificity.  The  main hypothesis of the present research is that internal motions of  the proteins and DNA (i.e. time-dependent changes in the structures  of the molecules) also are important in modulating sequence-  specific recognition.  The hypothesis will be tested for the DNA-  binding domain of the protein GCN4, a member of class of proteins  called bZip transcriptional activators.  GCN4 is an ideal candidate  for testing the above hypothesis, because the portions of the  protein that recognize the DNA molecule are presumed to be  disordered (with large amplitude motions) in the absence of DNA and  rigid (with small amplitude motions) in the presence of DNA.   Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), which analyzes the  properties of atomic in very strong magnetic fields, will be used  characterize the dynamical properties of GCN4.    ***",
