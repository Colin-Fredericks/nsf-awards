 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project describes work in portable, high performance  algorithm development, with experimental system support for I/O  intensive  programs.  For these programs the data access time is  the predominant component  of the running time.  The work has  three thrusts.        (1)  Multiprocessor  Multi-disk File Systems.            In ongoing research, an experimental  multiprocessor          multi-disk file system has been built, which runs on  Intel Paragon.  The file system was built to support a  prototype for a standard  application programmer  interface; the interface has been designed to facilitate  the production of portable programs.  A major portion of  this project is to  evaluate the efficiency of  theoretically optimal data access algorithms that  have  already been designed, and to validate the paradigms used      to  design  these algorithms for a two-level memory  hierarchy.        (2) Additional  Two-Level Memory Model Algorithms.            LAPACK is a natural (and very  appropriate) package for  upgrading to accommodate for out-of-core data sets.  A  portion of these algorithms will be redesigned and  implemented as prototypes  for testing and validation.  Completed programs will be released for public use  and  evaluation.        (3) Three-level Memory Model.            A significant  research goal is to develop a memory which  captures critical performance and  latency behavior  between main memory, disk systems, and tape systems, for  many  of the contemporary computer architectures.  Such a  model is intended to  support the development of I/O-  efficient algorithms.",
