The  U.S. organizer, Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of  Wisconsin-Madison, will work with Dr. Peter Krizan of the Jozef  Stefan Institute to prepare a workshop agenda that includes  lecture courses on state-of-the-art instrumentation techniques in  experimental elementary particle physics.  These lectures will be  augmented by six laboratory courses designed to demonstrate the  material presented.  Participants will include advanced graduate  level students and recent PHD researchers largely from the United  States, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe.  However,  representatives from the Americas, China, India and Taiwan will  also attend.  The overall goal of this activity is to foster new  links among the up-coming generation of world physicists in an  area that increasingly requires international cooperation.  ***",
