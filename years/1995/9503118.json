Wolf, UC at Berkeley and nine other U.S. scientists in a  Workshop in Lie Groups and Quantum Groups, to be held in  Cordoba, Argentina in August, 1995.  Dr. Wolf is the U.S.  organizer, the Argentine co-organizers are Drs.  Juan Tirao  and Roberto Miatello, of FAMAF, the Faculty of Mathematics,  Astronomy and Physics of  the University of Cordoba,  Argentina.  Some publication expenses will also be  supported.    Lie theory is one of the central areas of mathematics, with  a wide range of applications in harmonic analysis,  differential geometry, number theory and physics, and  also  plays an important role in applied mathematics. In South  America there are several excellent centers of activity in  this area, notably in Argentina and Chile.  The workshop  will bring together internationally known U.S. and Argentine  researchers, who will discuss recent developments in the  field, and  will set the stage for a number of joint  research projects between U.S. and Latin American  scientists.  The program will include specialist  and  topical lectures, as well as formal and informal discussions  among the participants. In addition to senior researchers,  young scientists and graduate students from the U.S.,  Argentina, Brazil and Chile will participate.  Training and  development of these students will be another  major aspect  of the workshop.  U.S. as well as Latin American scientists  and students will benefit from this interaction, in an  important area of mathematics.  ***",
