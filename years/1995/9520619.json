 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Branka Ladanyi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical work in the   area of solvation and reaction dynamics in molecular liquids and   molecular clusters.  She will use a combination of formal theory and   computer simulations to study the factors which influence solvation.    Instantaneous normal mode analysis will be used as a means of describing   the molecular events contributing to the short time dynamics of   solvation.  This tool will be used to study the dependence of solvation   on the solute-solvent interactions resulting from solute electronic   transitions and from solvent and solute vibrational degrees of freedom.    Systems involving hydrogen bonding liquids, such as water and alcohols,   will be studied to investigate the role which solute-solvent hydrogen   bond formation plays in solvation dynamics.  The question of the influence of solvents on the dynamics and outcome of   chemical reactions is of central importance to chemistry, given that most   chemical reactions in nature and in chemical industry occur in the   presence of solvents.  Ladanyi's research will help to gain a better   understanding, on the molecular level, of the factors which determine the   way chemical reactions are influenced by the presence of solvent.",
