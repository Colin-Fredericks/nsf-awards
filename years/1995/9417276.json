 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417276  Lazonick    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project between  Dr. William Lazonick of the University of Massachusetts-Lowell and  Dr. Kazuo Wada of the University of Tokyo. The objective of this  cooperative research project is to study indigenous innovation in  materials, machines, and intersectoral technology transfer as well as  the role of national technology policy in promoting and facilitating  indigenous innovation.  By comparing the experiences of  Great  Britain, the United States, and Japan, the collaborators will analyze  the distinctive national characteristics of technology in the transition  from textiles to automobiles.  This project expects to make the  analysis of successful industrial development in advanced economies  relevant to the experiences of less developed and developing  economies.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working on the biochemical properties of wood.   Dr. Eriksson s  group has extensive knowledge and experience in biochemistry of  cellulolytic enzymes including CDH.  The team led by Dr. Samejima  has worked on enzymatic surface analysis of cellulose and pulp.  By  combining these expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper  understanding and more rapid progress than can either group alone.   Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
