 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Pecora is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research involving   motions in liquid and polymer systems.  A variety of light scattering   techniques are used such as Fabry-Perot interferometry and   photocorrelation spectroscopy as well as total intensity light scattering   and transient electric birefringence decay.    The dynamics of both   dilute and nondilute solutions of rigid and semirigid rodlike molecules   including polypeptides, collagen, small rodlike protein,   oligonucleotides, and DNA fragments will be studied.  The effect of   interaction and entanglement will be investigated, and the nature of slow   modes will be elucidated.  A model composite liquid has been developed   which consists of small coated silica spheres and a rigid polymer   immersed in a solvent.  This system will also be studied by dynamic light   scattering and transient electric birefringence decay.  Composite liquids are a ubiquitous class of materials which contain   polymer, particles and solvent.  They are used as ceramic precursors,   lubricants, paints and coatings, adhesives,  and in chromatographic   columns.  Due to their complexity and the lack of adequate model systems,   the interactions between the species in such systems are not well   understood.  Pecora  has constructed a model rod/sphere composite liquid   whose dynamics can be studied over a wide range of composition of both   the rods and the spheres using an experimental technique known as dynamic   light scattering.",
