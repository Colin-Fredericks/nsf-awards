University of Maryland  Title: Atmospheric Convection, Surface fluxes and Ocean Mixing         During TOGA COARE    This is a three year project to study multi-scale organization of  atmospheric convection, surface fluxes, and ocean mixed layer  structure in the TOGA COARE domain during IOP.  The work has two  major components.    1) Analysis and integration of TOGA COARE observations, including   ISS/PSS soundings, high solution GMS satellite data, radar data,  air sea fluxes and ocean mixed layer measurements, obtained during  COARE domain during IOP.    2) Utilization of TOGA COARE observations to simulate convective  radiative mixing processes within OSA based on a two dimensional  version of Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Model (GCEM) and an embedded  mixed layer-Ocean circulation model (MLOM).    A better understanding of multi-scale processes achieved by this  research project is essential for improving the physical processes  in climate models.  The expected achievement of the proposed  research will help to enhance our capability in simulation and  prediction of climate variability.",
