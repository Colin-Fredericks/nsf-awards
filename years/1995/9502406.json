 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. William  Quintana, Chemistry Department, New Mexico State University,   is supported by the Inorganic,  Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career   Advancement Award to synthesize amino acids that  contain boron polyhedra   and to develop educational activities that directly involve students,   thus making them more responsible for their own development. By expanding   known amino acid preparations, derivatives of alpha-amino acids in which   the alkyl group is substituted by a boron containing group will be   synthesized. Likewise, the alpha-carbon atom of the amino acid will be   replaced by a boron atom to produce boronated amino acids. These   compounds then will be characterized by a variety of physical and   spectroscopic methods. The educational component emphasizes course   development at both the lower and upper undergraduate levels and will   include the incorporation of demonstrations, the establishment of study   groups, and the initiation of outcomes assessments.   Amino acids which are modified to be slightly different from the   naturally occurring amino acids have numerous potential applications.   Because  the modified amino acids resemble the natural ones, they may   enter into biological systems but, because of the differences, they will   not function exactly as their natural analogs. Consequently, modified   amino acids can be used to probe or change biochemical processes. The   purpose of the research portion of this project is to develop methods to   produce new amino acids that contain boron instead of the usual carbon   atoms. These have potential applications as enzyme inhibitors and in   Boron Capture Neutron Therapy, a treatment being developed for some   cancers. Both the research and the educational portions of this project   are designed to serve the significant population of minority students   enrolled at New Mexico State University.",
