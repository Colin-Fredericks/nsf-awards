This conference is primarily concerned with the biology of genetic exchange systems and the genetics of a variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic systems: it is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area.  One significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently are limited.   Funds are being provided for travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas that comprise prokaryotic genetics.  %%%  This is the major meeting held annually in the United States where the genetics of a wide variety of bacteria are discussed.  ***",
