 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  study of structure and defect chemistry at grain boundaries in  conventional and nanocrystalline ceramics.  During the tenure of  this three-year continuing grant, Professor Tissue and his students  at Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University will approach  this problem using laser-excited fluorescence (LIF) techniques.   Rare earth ions will be incorporated into ceramic materials and  these local probes, which segregate at interfaces during materials  synthesis, will be interrogated using LIF.  The objectives of this  research are (1) to characterize the structure and defect chemistry  at grain boundaries, (2) to determine the utility of probe-ion  spectroscopy for interface characterization, and (3) to identify  novel optical properties of rare-earth ions in restricted  geometries.  Also during this grant period, Professor Tissue will  pursue an education plan that focusses on the development and  evaluation of chemistry hypermedia for undergraduate students in  instrumental analysis and analytical chemistry.    The ability to probe the structure and composition of grain  boundaries and defects in ceramic oxide materials is of crucial  importance in materials chemistry and processing.  This CAREER  research project utilizes rare-earth based laser induced  fluorescence in the development of an enabling analytical  technology with which to address this problem.  The educational  aspects of this CAREER project will give rise to the integration  state-of-the-art information technology in the teaching of  chemistry at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",
