 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intermountain Herbarium is a Regional Systematics Resource Center for the Intermountain Region.  It currently comprises over 216,500 accessioned specimens.  These are stored in the equivalent of 196.5 full-sized herbarium cabinets.  The quality of these cabinets varies widely.  Over have (110.5 full-sized equivalents) are standard cabinets that protect specimens from ceiling leaks, insects, and dust.  The remaining cabinets (86 full-sized equivalents) do not do so.  The storage space for unaccessioned specimens is also of major concern.  For lack of better facilities, these are stored on open shelves that provide even less protection than the substandard wooden and metal cabinets.  An additional hazard facing many of the specimens in the collection is the severed overcrowding that exits.  A recent count revealed 310 shelves so crowed that the folders have to be squeezed slightly when being taken out or returned.  In each instance, the cabinets on either side are so full as to preclude relieving the situation by redistribution of the specimens.  The need to upgrade the specimen  storage facilities in the Intermountain Herbarium became evident in 1993 and 1994;  three separate instances of damage form insect infestation were discovered, four ceiling leaks occurred, and approximately 300 unmounted specimens had to be discarded because of a ceiling leak that had occurred in 1986.  Some precautions have already been taken to minimize further damage.  Specimens are now routinely frozen before being placed in the collection or loan cabinets and polyethylene sheets have been stapled across the tops of all wooden cabinets.  Neither of  these measures, however, can provide the level of protection provided by standard herbarium cabinets  that seal tightly when closed.  It is essential that the herbarium be able to place all the specimens  it houses, both its own and those loaned by other institutions, whether accessioned or not, in good  quality cabinets.  This will require the purchase of 130 standard-sized cabinets:  100 to replace the  existing substandard storage, 24 to relieve overcrowding, and 6 to accommodate the next five years.  In addition, non-archival genus folders need to be replaced and new folders made between the taxonomic  treatment of the Asteraceae in recent publications affection the Intermountain Region, a nomenclatural  program designed to remove inconsistencies and provide cross-references in this family is needed to  facilitate use of the collection",
