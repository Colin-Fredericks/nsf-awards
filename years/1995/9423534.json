 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports a project to study the tectonic evolution of  the Arctic by providing paleogeographic constraints on mechanical  models proposed for the opening of the Canada Basin. Current  geophysical and geological data upon which these models are based  typically lack the required detail and resolution (e.g.,  geophysical data), do not provide unique solutions (e.g.,  stratigraphic and basin axis correlations), or remain  interpretive due to overprinting during younger orogenesis (e.g.,  structural relationships). The two models that best fit the  meager data base invoke (1) rifting of Arctic Alaska-Chukotka  from the Lomonosov Ridge followed by sinistral translation along  the Canadian Arctic Island margin or (2) rifting and rotation of  Arctic Alaska from the Canadian Arctic Islands. These models  differ in the assumed pre-Cretaceous paleogeographic position of  northern Alaska. Thus isotopic studies designed to constrain the  paleogeographic origin of Arctic Alaska could potentially provide  significant insights into the evolution of the Canada Basin.    Nd isotopic analyses have been successfully utilized to provide  general constraints on paleogeographic models. Combining Nd data  with U-Pb isotopic analysis of single detrital zircons, which  allow discrimination of specific age populations, provides a  powerful tool for correlation of displaced stratal sequences and  their source regions.  This research will involve a U/Pb detrital  zircon study of Proterozoic metaclastic rocks at 4 localities  across Arctic Alaska in an effort to provide additional  constraints on its paleogeographic origin.  Proterozoic rocks  will be targeted in order to determine the primary cratonal  signature and establish a baseline for similar detrital studies  in Paleozoic and younger strata of the Arctic Alaska region.  Comparison of the resultant isotopic data with known detrital  signatures from the Canadian Arctic and Cordilleran margins will  bear directly on critical evaluation of current  models for the  tectonic evolution of the Canada Basin. In addition, results of  this study will address the presence or absence of pre-  Mississippian terranes, the significance of 2.0 Ga Nd model age  reported for Proterozoic rocks in northern Alaska in terms of  homogeneous source versus multicomponent mixing, depositional  ages of the Proterozoic clastic rocks sampled, and potential  correlation of Arctic Alaska with crustal fragments (Yukon-Tanana  and Ruby terranes) presently outboard of the Cordilleran  miogeocline.",
