 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Southeast proposes a three-year  project to develop and implement the Rural Alaskan Sanitation  Education Program.  The project establishes a centralized  educational center at the UAS Sitka Campus, as well as a system for  dissemination of curriculum to teachers and students in remote  villages throughout the State.  The program is modeled on the  recommendations of the Federal Field Working Group on Rural Alaska  Sanitation Problems and represents a cooperative effort of  secondary/postsecondary educators, Native leaders, and those State  and Federal agencies responsible for environmental sanitation  programs in the State of Alaska.       The program addresses a critical public health need,  throughout Alaska and other rural settings, for sanitation  technicians and environmental scientists.  It is designed to  establish cultural awareness of the linkage between the environment  and public health, engaging village youth as agents of change.       The program will provide a cross-disciplinary curriculum in an  articulated 2+2 tech-prep format for grades 11-14.  Curriculum  components encompass an academic core (math, written and oral  communications, social science); laboratory science (chemistry,  microbiology, geology, climate) and systems technology (hydraulics,  mechanics, electronics.       Students will complete a systematic program leading from  secondary diploma to postsecondary associate degree, along with  field experience necessary to achieve technician certification  under Alaska regulations for operation of water and wastewater  treatment, distribution, and collection systems.  An academic and  career counseling program, based on professional mentoring and  service learning, will assure that students completing the program  are prepared both for transfer to baccalaureate degree programs and  for transition into the workforce in rural Alaska.",
