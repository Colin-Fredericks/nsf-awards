An ultra-high-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope  will  be  used  to  synthesize both individual and arrays of magnetic structures  directly  on III-V semiconductor substrates and devices. The intrinsic  magnetic behavior of the structures will be examined using microscopic  Hall bar magnetometers, Aharonov-Bohm rings, ballistic transport,  and  high-sensitivity  mechanical  torque measurements.  The  influence  of  magnet   particles   on   the  spin-dependent  electronic   state   in  semiconductors  will  be  investigated  through  femto-second-resolved  Faraday  and  luminescence spectroscopes. In  particular,  the  latter  studies include spatially-resolved optical microscopy.  %%%  This   experimental  and  theoretical  project  employs   atomic-scale  lithography,  low-dimensional  electronic  transport,  and  ultra-fast  magnetooptical  spectroscopies  at  low  temperature  to   investigate  quantum  magnetic structures. A unique aspect of the work  is  the  in  situ  fabrication of \"nanomagnets\" only a few dozen atoms in diameter,  whose  optical and magnetic properties will be investigated. The  work  encompasses semiconductor physics, optics, and magnetism. The training  gained  by  students in the areas of optical science  and  engineering  will  prepare  them  for a wide spectrum of career opportunities.  The  nanosize   magnetic   semiconductors  exhibit   novel   magnetooptical  phenomena  that are currently incompletely understood, but  which  are  felt to have great potential as possible device structures.  ***",
