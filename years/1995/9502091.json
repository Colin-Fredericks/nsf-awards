 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in computer and telecommunication technologies enable network communication from any location and mobility that will lead to new collaborative database applications. This research focuses on data management demanded by these new mobile applications, that extends beyond the traditional distributed database management. Specifically, its goal is to develop appropriate protocols (1) for the management of mobile data replicated on both mobile and stationary hosts over low-bandwidth and tenuous wireless network connections, and (2) for the processing of transactions and activities that produce and access these mobile data. Given the inherent resource limitations on a mobile host and the fact that disconnections do not necessarily imply the failure of the disconnected machine, recovery and  disconnection management are approached in an integrated manner. This research combines both  theoretical investigation, building on the ACTA extended transaction framework, and empirical  evaluation that will result in an experimental platform for mobile and wireless distributed computer  systems. By considering t he pragmatic issues in developing protocols for mobile data management, this  investigation will facilitate the development of such important applications as telemedicine that  support remote diagnostics or surgical interventions. The experimental laboratory to be established  will also provide hands-on experience for undergraduate students exposing them to the research process  itself, thereby encouraging their development of mature scientific thinking.",
