 "awd_abstract_narration": "A serious, continuous need clearly exists for dissemination  of models of computer usage that have been demonstrated to  be effective in supporting undergraduate education.  The  1995 National Educational Computing Conference (NECC '95),  with an anticipated attendance of more than 5,000 persons,  offers an excellent opportunity to devote several regular  conference sessions to exactly this kind of sharing of  ideas, programs and products.    As program chair for NECC '95, this principal investigator  seeks funding to enable the Conference to invite  researchers, scholars, and practitioners from all of the  sciences and from other disciplines that the NSF Department  of Undergraduate Education (DUE) supports to participate in  these special sessions.  The purpose will be to demonstrate,  discuss, and even produce cross-pollination of their work.    Appropriate DUE projects can be identified from the  abstracts in Project Impact:  Disseminating Innovations in  Undergraduate Education, a compendium of the projects  featured at the DUE sponsored activity May 31 - June 3, 1994  in Arlington, Virginia.    Inviting principal investigators who have developed  interesting products such as software, multimedia, etc. to  display and discuss those products not only showcases NSF-  supported research, but provides opportunities for one-on-  one interaction, hands-on interactive experiences,  stimulating exchanges of ideas, and improvements in uses of  computer technology in science education at all levels.",
