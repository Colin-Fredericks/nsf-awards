At the same time, changes in the relative timing of  different developmental events (heterochrony) can be an important  source of novelty in evolution, particularly when the timing of  reproductive maturity changes relative to somatic maturity. The  vegetative development of the shoot in plants is marked by several  more or less discrete phases that can be distinguished from one  another on the basis of a variety of morphological and  physiological traits. A large number of obvious phase specific  traits have been defined in maize, greatly facilitating the genetic  and molecular analysis of the process of phase change in this  species. Recently, Dr. Poethig has identified a new mutation,  glossy early flowering, that dramatically accelerates both  vegetative and reproductive development. Mutant plants produce  leaves with adult vegetative fates abnormally early in shoot  development and also flower early. Although extensive work on woody  plants has suggested that the vegetative phase of the shoot is  linked in some way to its reproductive capacity, gef is the first  genetic link between these two aspects of shoot development in  maize. Dr. Poethig proposes to a) characterize the phenotype of gef  at a molecular, histological, and morphological level, b) determine  its cell autonomy by clonal analysis, and c) establish its  relationship to other genes involved in phase change by analyzing  double mutations. In addition, he proposes to conduct extensive  genetic screens for new mutations affecting phase change. these  screens will involve screening in a wild type genetic background  for mutations that accelerate vegetative phase change, and  screening a gl15-2 background for mutations that either enhance or  suppress this partially functional mutation. These experiments  should provide new insight into the relationship between vegetative  and reproductive maturation in plants, and provide th e genetic and  molecular resources necessary for future research on the mechanisms  of this important aspect of plant development.  ***",
