 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in the field of arithmetic geometry. The fundamental role played by height functions throughout arithmetic geometry is well established. The new theory of canonical heights developed by Call and Silverman has raised many interesting questions involving arithmetic geometry and its relation to dynamics. The main goal of this project is to extend these recent advances in the theory of canonical heights to study the dynamics of polynomial and rational maps on projective space and to investigate the arithmetic properties of surfaces and abelian varieties.     This research belongs to the general mathematical area of arithmetic geometry. This ultramodern research area combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number theory and geometry. The new insights arising out of this combination are producing increasingly powerful tools to solve long-standing problems like Fermat's Last Theorem, which have resisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of mathematicians. In addition, though arithmetic geometry is sometimes regarded as among the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been developing insightful new techniques leading to dramatic progress in such applied areas as error-correcting codes and cryptography.",
