The  particular systems that will be studied included reaction centers  from the primitive anoxygenic organisms known as heliobacteria as  well as Photosystem I of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.   Specific proposed experiments include low-temperature picosecond  transient absorbance spectroscopic studies of energy transfer and  trapping in both heliobacteria and Photosystem I, picosecond  transient absorbance measurement in the blue spectral region in  both systems, and investigation of secondary electron transfer  reactions in heliobacteria monitored using EPR and millisecond  timescale transient absorbance spectroscopy.  These experiments  will give new insights into the energy trapping process in reaction  centers that contain integral core antenna pigments and will help  to identify and characterize some of the early electron acceptors  in these systems, including chlorophylls, quinones and FeS centers.  %%%  This project will increase our understanding of how plants and  other photosynthetic organisms convert the energy of sunlight into  chemical energy.  The process of photosynthesis supplies all of our  food and most of our energy needs.  Many aspects of how  photosynthesis works are not understood at a deep level.  This  project is designed to give detailed knowledge of the chemical  mechanism of this essential biological process.  ***",
