 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421585  Mattice    This award supports Professor Wayne Mattice and a postdoctoral  fellow and a graduate student from his research group at the  University of Akron, to collaborate in materials research with  Professor Kurt Binder of the Physics Institute of the University  of Mainz, German, and Professor Ulrich Suter, of the Polymer  Institute of ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.  The objective of their  collaboration is to develop improved methods for the study of  polymers.  Combining the strengths of the three research groups  and avoiding duplication of effort will facilitate efficient  development of algorithms and software for simulating physical  properties of these macromolecules.  The new software should be  particularly robust because it will combine the special strengths  of the three laboratories.    Simulations of the physical properties of macromolecules  generally are much more difficult than simulations of small  molecules.  These challenges arise from differences in the  numbers of conformations, distance scales and time scales.  There  are several current approaches for the design of simulations,  each of which have only limited application to selected  circumstances.  For example, fully atomistic simulations are  severely limited in the time and space scales of the physical  phenomena that can be addressed, while, on the other hand,  simulations on lattices can incorporate large scales of time and  distance, but cannot incorporate sufficient structural detail so  that the chains in the simulations can be identified with real  polymers.  The proposed U.S.-European collaboration is intended  to develop methods that combine the best attributes of both these  techniques, so that the simulations will have greatly improved  usefulness.  ***",
