 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528908  Bierly    The International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) program and the  Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program of the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) have included monitoring activities in their plans that  will establish baselines for atmospheric chemistry research and  assessment. The baselines are to be established by operating a series of  six monitoring stations in remote, un-industrialized areas throughout the  globe.  A GAW baseline station is currently operating on the Tibetan  plateau, and will soon be followed by baseline stations in Ushuaia,  Sumatra, Mt. Kenya, South-east Algeria, and a final proposed station North  of Bel=E9m, in Brazil.  Baselines are to be established at each of these  stations in five basic areas: a) the chemical  composition of rain and  snow, b) atmospheric gases, including greenhouse gases, ozone, and  reactive gases like SO2 and NOx, c) aerosol chemical and physical  characteristics, including total concentration and vertical profiles, d)  solar radiation, including UV-B, and e) radio-nuclides.  A series of GAW  regional monitoring stations also exists in more industrialized areas  around the globe.  The data from these regional stations will be used in  combination with the baseline stations to assess anthropogenic impacts.  An effective means of establishing a stations for global atmospheric  chemistry data set collection, gathered using not only similar equipment,  but similar measurement methodologies, is to build a local capacity in  atmospheric chemistry with a series of standard courses offered in  different areas of the globe by leading scientists in the field.  A pool  of international volunteer lecturers has been recruited by a previous  effort of the IGAC and GAW, in collaboration with the International  Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the Global Change System for  Analysis, Research, and Training (START).  This NSF grant, on behalf of  the Inter American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), will cover  tra vel and per diem costs of Latin American scientists from countries that  have or will have GAW regional stations, as well as those scientists  responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the GAW baseline  station at Ushuaia.  The first two-week course will be held at the  Instituto de Qu=EDmica F=EDsica de los  Materiales, Medio Ambiente y Energ=EDa (INQUIMAE) of the University of  Buenos Aires, and will cover emission, infra-red, UV/visible, and tumble  diode laser spectroscopy, gas chromatography, conductometry, colorimetry,  coulometry, enzymatic techniques, and quality assurance and control  techniques, as well as data assessment and management methods.%%%  This program will train local experts to operate global atmospheric  chemistry monitoring stations.  These 'baseline' monitoring stations will  collect data from areas relatively free of pollution, and allow comparison  with similar data from industrial areas in order to assess how much  atmospheric pollution is related to human activity.  The training program  is being carried out as a U.S. contribution to the Inter American  Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), which has a strong commitment  to training scientists in the Americas.  Sixteen nations of the Americas  are Member States of the IAI, a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative  research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the  Americas. The National Science Foundation is the U.S. Government agency  designated by the White House to carry out U.S. responsibilities within  the IAI.  ***",
