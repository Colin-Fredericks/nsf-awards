 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421034  Adams    Several  problems  in  nuclear magnetism of  solid  helium-3  will  be investigated  at  temperatures as low as 20  microkelvin  and  magnetic fields  up to 20 Tesla. Ordering  in the high-pressure hexagonal-closed packed  phase,  which  is expected to be ferromagnetic because  of  the dominance  of  triple exchange, will be achieved by using  the  helium  nuclei  for  the  second  stage demagnetization.  The  high  field  to paramagnetic  phase transition, which occurs near  20 Tesla  where  the system becomes fully magnetized, will  be studied by measurement of the melting  pressure  to  obtain the magnetization.  The  nature  of  this transition  at low fields near the triple point ( where the low-field,  high-field,  and paramagnetic phases coexist) will be  investigated  by nuclear  magnetic resonance and thermal  transport measurements.  These three                          investigations  will  provide  additional  insight  into   the  fundamental behavior of this model magnetic substance.  %%%      Solid  helium-3  is  considered a model magnetic system  for  studying fundamentals of magnetism. Because of the small  mass and  weak  forces between  atoms, the effect of  interest occur in a range of temperature near absolute zero,  below that of interest for electronic systems, but above  those  for  heavy nuclear magnets. Since the helium  is  highly compressible, effects can be investigated over a wide  range of density by  application  of  moderate pressure. In  particular,  the  type  of magnetic structures occurring in  two different type of crystals can be studied.  Methods of  investigation include nuclear magnetic resonance, melting  pressure, constant-volume pressure, and thermal  conductivity. Knowledge gained will be of use in  understanding magnetic phenomena in more complicated  magnetic systems.  ***",
