 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  proposed project will investigate directed improvisation,  a  new   paradigm   for  multi-agent  human-computer  collaboration.  Basically,  one  or  more  users  direct  one  or  more  computer  characters  with  abstract  instructions  and  constraints.   The  characters   improvise  courses  of  behavior  that  follow   the  directions,  express distinctive styles of   behavior,  and  meet  other   objectives.    The  resulting  \"work,\"   comprising   the  individual and interactive behaviors of the characters,  reflects  a collaboration among all of the human and computer participants.  Human  users  collaborate  with  one  another  to  determine  the  abstract  structure  and quality of their characters'  behaviors.  Computer  characters collaborate with users and with one  another  to  improvise  the  details of their individual  and  interactive  behaviors.    Objectives of the project are: (a) develop a  model  of  the   directed improvisation paradigm for multi-agent  human-  computer   collaboration;  (b) develop and  implement  a  domain-  independent   model  of  computer agents  capable  of  performing  directed    improvisation   in   single-agent   and   multi-agent  configurations;  (c)  develop and implement a  domain-independent  model  of  interfaces  for one or more human users to collaborate  with one another while  directing the improvisational behavior of  computer  agents;  (d)   instantiate the  implemented  models  of  agents and interfaces in an  experimental testbed application:  a  Computer-Animated     Improvisational   Theater    (CAIT);    (e)  demonstrate,  analyze,  and  evaluate the directed  improvisation  paradigm  in  the  CAIT testbed.    Directed improvisation  is  a  promising   new   paradigm  for  multi-    agent   human-computer  collaboration,   potentially  useful  in  a    diverse   set   of  applications.  The CAIT testbed also has intrinsic   significance  as  a pioneering example of enjoyable experience-  based learning  environments,  a new  kind of computer game, and a   new  artistic  \"form\" for interactive stories and entertainment.",
