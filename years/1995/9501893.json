The  Aalen model incorporates the possibility that both value and contribution  of  covariates may change over time.  Most important, no particular parametric  shape of this time-dependence is assumed.   In the current project, kernel smoothing will be used to estimate the  regression coefficient curves.  A major objective is to develop data-driven  bandwidth selectors, and to investigate their properties.  It is expected that  the resulting methods will improve upon currently used empirical estimates.   Moreover, kernel methods allow one to estimate the regression coefficient  curves themselves, as opposed to cumulative coefficients.  This is  particularly important for graphical data analysis. The new smoothing methods will be implemented in XLISP-STAT, an object- oriented programming language; a user-friendly interface will be provided.   Dynamic graphics will be used to support visual data exploration.  As part of  the project, the developed smoothing procedures will be used to analyze  epidemiological data. On the side of education, the development of a new lecture course on  ``Smoothing Methods in Curve Estimation'' for statistics majors at the M.S. or  Ph.D. level is proposed.  Research results of the current proposal will be  included.  Dynamic graphics software will be used to demonstrate smoothing  techniques in class, thus giving students access to cutting edge technology   An important problem in medicine is to predict the survival of patients,  given their current condition and treatment.  The condition of a patient is  described by \"covariate values\", such as blood cholesterol, blood pressure,  number of antibodies, etc.  A central problem in analyzing survival data is to  assess the influence of covariates;  for example, to quantify by how  much an  elevated level of blood cholesterol increases the risk of stroke. Often the  influence of covariates is known to change with time.  In this case standard  methods tend to fail. The proposed project develops risk estimates based on the Aalen model.  This  model is extremely flexible.  The influence of covariates is allowed to change  over time, without assuming any particular shape of this time-dependence  beforehand.   In this project,  modern smoothing techniques will be adapted to estimate the  influence of covariates.  Smoothing methods are extremely useful for  descriptive data analysis, and widely used in statistics.  In the context of  survival data, however,  the use of corresponding methods is a very recent  development, with many open problems. Part of the project is the user-friendly computational implementation of the  newly developed estimation procedures.  Interactive graphics will be used  extensively to support visual data exploration.  With the provided software,  smoothing methods in Aalen hazard regression will be available for  practitioners for the first time. The new smoothing procedures will be used to analyze epidemiological data. On the side of education, the development of a new lecture course on  ``Smoothing Methods in Curve Estimation'' for statistics majors at the M.S. or  Ph.D. level is proposed.  Research results of the current proposal will be  included.
