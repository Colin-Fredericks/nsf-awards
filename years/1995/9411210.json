 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Z. Goodson is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies which will lead to the   calculation of accurate energies eigenvalues for atoms and molecules. The   supported research involves the extension and improvement of a newly   developed theoretical approach based on dimensional perturbation theory,   DPT, as well as the application and validation of the theory. The   applications to be performed concern the total ground state energies for   several small diatomic and one triatomic system. The research will also   determine the molecular vibrations of selected systems. For the analysis   of the vibrations, the usual Born-Oppenhiemer, BO, approximation which   involves the separation of electronic and nuclear motions will not be   used.  Instead, the DPT will be used to simultaneously treat the motion   of both electrons and nuclei. While the BO approximation is normally   adequate, there are cases where the coupling of different BO energy   levels is very strong and the approximation breaks down. The supported   research on DPT may lead to a practical method for treating such cases.  The theoretical determination of energy levels and, hence, of potential   energy surfaces is a very important problem in theoretical chemistry and   has occupied the efforts of a large number of researchers over a long   period of time. It is a central problem because the energies of a system   must be known in order to interpret the significance of various   experimental spectroscopic measurements and to interpret and predict   chemical reactivity. While there have been dramatic advances in the   ability to determine these energies using traditional ab initio and   density functional methods, it still remains a formidable computational   task at the forefront of theoretical research. This is especially true   for large systems and for systems which contain heavy atoms. It is not   certain that the DPT methods which are the subject of the supported   research will replace the traditional methods; however, this research is   expected to give an understanding of their potential.",
