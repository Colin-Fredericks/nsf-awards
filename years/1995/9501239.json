 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501239  Haller    Resonances are regions  in the phase space of a dynamical system in which the   frequencies of some angular variables become nearly commensurate. This proposal is   aimed toward the development and  application of new geometric methods for the study   of complicated dynamics near resonances. The main  goal is to capture invariant   structures in the phase space with a strong impact on the general evolution of the system.   Ideal candidates for such structures are hyperbolic  partially slow manifolds that arise in   many resonance problems and carry physically important motions with different time   scales. A subtle combination of regular and singular perturbation techniques can describe   this effect in detail by detecting remarkable families  of solutions connecting   neighborhoods of these manifolds. Such solutions describe repeated, complicated   transitions between physically distinguished motions    Many evolutionary processes in nature as solutions of sets of differential equations. Sets   of these solutions can be visualized as surfaces in some higher dimensional phase space   and irregular transitions between different states of the evolutionary system appear as   chaotic orbits connecting these surfaces. This proposal deals with the detection of such   transitions in the important and frequent case when the solution surfaces are composed of   solutions with several different time scales. The proposed mathematical techniques can be   used to  study yet unexplained details of molecular vibrations, patterns  of surface waves   in ocean dynamics, gravitational interactions of planetary systems, and chaotic   oscillations of engineering structures.",
