 "awd_abstract_narration": "A particle transport/separation flow system is currently under  construction and allows the laboratory investigation of particle  technology and separation concepts to be introduced for the first  time into the existing undergraduate curriculum in the College of  Engineering and in the Department of Chemical Engineering.   New  instruments, a stack analyzer, pressure transducers, a particle  characteristics tester, and a data acquisition board are being  incorporated with the particle transport/separation system  through this project.   This enables labs on cyclone separation  of powders from air, particle characterization, flow regime  identification for gas/solid transport, and hopper operation to  be incorporated into classes.  The pneumatic transport/separation  system has been completely designed and constructed undergraduate  students and has served to begin to introduce particle technology  and environmental separations to a small number of self-selected  students.   This project integrates particle technology into a  number of the undergraduate classes, thus enabling all  engineering undergraduates to become aware of the importance of  the knowledge of particles.   Additionally, all chemical  engineering students can learn the various concepts pertinent to  the transport and separation of particles in their existing  undergraduate courses.   The new instrumentation can result in a  number of experiments of varying learning objectives on particle  technology, which is a vital area of knowledge that has  previously been neglected in chemical engineering education.   Classes such as Process Control, Fluid Dynamics, Exploring  Engineering, and Transport Phenomena will integrate the  experiments to affect over 1,500 students in the next 5 years of  use.",
