Load forecasting and the optimal estimation of voltage phasors,  generator frequency deviations, and their rate of change will be  the basic information for the development.  Based on these  values, a static index and a transient index will be developed  for voltage instability prediction and transient stability  detection, respectively.  During normal operating conditions, the  static index for voltage instability is calculated, and its  future values are predicted.  Once the system enters a transient  state, the transient index, which is for transient instability  detection, will be computed.       Load flow solutions are considered as the intersections  between a space and a space curve.  The angle, between the  gradient vector of a space surface and the tangent vector of a  space curve at an operating point, may be considered as the  static index for voltage instability.  Its closeness to 90  degrees may indicate the proximity of the operating point to the  voltage collapse point.  The directional derivatives of the bus  injection power in the space surface equation, in the direction  of the tangent vectors of the space curves, are possible  candidates for weak bus identifications.  The proposed indices  are available for the voltage phasors and the load flow Jacobian.   To predict voltage instability, the voltage instability index may  be computed based on the future load and its corresponding load  flow solutions.  By comparing the voltage instability index for  the current operating condition with the index for the predicted  load, one may conclude if the system will become close to or away  from the voltage collapse point.       If the system is in transient state, the unstable mode will  be detected primarily.  The predicted generator angle difference  in the post disturbance period is proposed for this purpose.   Once the unstable mode is pred icted, the high dimensional power  system model may be aggregated into a low order model.  The  kinetic energy of this aggregated low order system is proposed as  the transient index for transient in stability detection.  ***",
