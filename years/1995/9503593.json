 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zehr  95-03593      The  primary productivity of the oceans is intertwined  with  the   biogeochemical  cycling  of  nutrients  required   for  autotrophic  growth.  Although there is not clear  agreement  on  which nutrients limits ocean productivity, it is evident  that the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are  present  at  low  concentrations in the  oligotrophic  ocean  gyres.   The  argument  for  N limitation  has  always  been  complicated  by  the  fact  that  N  deficiency   could   be  alleviated  by  the biological reduction of atmospheric  N2.  Yet  few  N2  fixing organisms have been found in  the  open  ocean.     The  development of DNA amplification  and  probe  techniques for characterizing N fixation genes are  powerful  tools   for   assessing  N2  fixation   potential   in   the  environment.   Recent advances have demonstrated  that  this  approach  can be used to assay the expression of N2 fixation  genes,  which  will be developed further  as  part  of  this  program.   The  goals of this research will be to  complete,  substantiate  and extend the conclusions from prior  studies  of  N  fixation  in  the context of physical,  chemical  and  biological  parameters of the Atlantic and  Pacific  Oceans.  This research will answer the question of the presence of N2  fixing  species in the oceanic environment and  the  factors  limiting  the  distribution and expression  of  N2  fixation  genes.",
