 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constructions of Wavelets on Finite Domains and Applications to  Boundary Integral Equations Proposed by Charles A. Micchelli and  Yuesheng Xu Abstract:   It is proposed to construct wavelets on  finite domains and use them to solve boundary integral equations  which are reformulations of boundary value problems of partial  differential equations in the plane or space.  Traditional  methods employed to solve the boundary integral  equations are  Galerkin methods, collocation methods, and product integration  methods by using a standard basis of piecewise polynomials,  B-splines or trigonometric polynomials. These methods usually  lead to full matrices for the discrete equations, which are   computationally expensive. Wavelet bases provide an alternative  approach for  the possibility of improving these methods. They  often form better bases in  the space of piecewise polynomials or  other function classes in the sense that the coefficient matrices  of the linear or nonlinear systems obtained from these bases are  sparse and well-conditioned. This leads to numerically fast    algorithms that preserve the nice features that the traditional  methods  possess and at the same time improve upon them. The  proposed projects include constructing orthogonal wavelets,  pre-wavelets and  biorthogonal wavelets on finite domains in  multidimensional spaces using the matrix refinement equations,  designing decomposition and reconstruction algorithms in terms of  the matrices in the refinement equations, and developing   numerically fast algorithms for the boundary integral equations  using the wavelet bases constructed.     Partial differential  equations have long been used to mathematically model a  wide  variety of physical phenomena that occur in fluid flows,  electro-chemistry, stress analysis in materials and a host of  similar practical problems.  Transforming these partial  differential equations into boundary integral  equations gives  rise to problems that can be analyzed both  theoretically and  nu merically. Since the nonlinear equations arising are difficult  if not impossible to completely solve theoretically, a numerical  method to these problems is necessary. Wavelet bases provide an  alternative approach to classical methods and result in  mathematical problems for which numerically fast algorithms can  be obtained. This alternative wavelet method preserves most nice  features of traditional methods and in many instances gives  substantial improvements.",
