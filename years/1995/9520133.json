This  Research Planning Grant study seeks to reconstruct the ways that  private business owners in china conceptualize citizenship and  their own roles and competencies as citizens through the use of  Q-methodology.  Citizenship is defined as the privileges and  duties attached to full membership in the community.  Private  business owner refers to those individuals whose income is  largely (though not wholly) dependent on self employment in  industrial or commercial spheres and who define themselves as  private or individual entrepreneurs.  Two stages of research will  be undertaken.  The first stage is an intensive ethnographic  examination of the current discourse on citizenship among private  and individual entrepreneurs.  This stage involves semi-  structured interviews and careful analysis of documentary  resources, including newspapers, journals, books and manuscripts.   This ethnographic research forms the basis for Q-sort method  which allows the researcher to model selected entrepreneurs  reactions to a set of statements about citizenship.  With this  methodology the researcher explores the subjective understanding  of selected individuals in a way that is constrained by  statistical results.  While the initial need is for description  and definition, the long term goal is an unfolding comparative  study on citizenship and business ownership that attempts to  establish the role of political culture in the process of  democratization.  ***",
