 "awd_abstract_narration": "CHROME (Cooperating Hampton Roads Organizations for Minorities in  Engineering), a collaborative partnership southeastern, Virginia,  will operate three math and science Academies for African-American  males.  The goal of the Academies is to increase the pool of  African-American males interested in and prepared for SMET careers.   Specific objectives are to: (1) stimulate more positive attitudes  toward and interest in math and science, (2) raise the level of  awareness of SMET careers and interest students in SMET careers,  (3) encourage students to complete high school, (4) prepare them to  enroll and succeed in Algebra I and higher math and science  courses, (5) develop understanding of the scientific process, and  (6) improve communication skills.   The Academies will be an  integral part of a broad and remarkably effective regional  initiative which has been promoting minority and female  participation in SMET for eleven years through CHROME.  Students  will receive extensive and continuing enrichment and support  through high school via the very effective network of school-based  CHROME clubs as well as Academy follow-up programs.  The nurturing  environment, team structure and many group activities will help  solidify a supportive and enduring peer group.  Each student will  have a mentor, one of many local African-American in SMET careers,  who will take a personal interest in and encourage the student,  discuss career interests and paths, and provide ongoing support.   Students also will be exposed to role models of minorities in math  and science in the university faculty and students, work site  contacts, and guest speakers.    A total of 75 rising 7th and 8th grade African-American males will  be served at three sites, sponsored by partner universities:   Hampton University, Norfolk State University, and Old Dominion  University.  The partners offer both predominantly (or, in the case  of ODU, significant) minority student populations and strong SMET  research and degree programs.   Students will be drawn primarily  from four minority-majority urban school districts in Hampton Roads  and selected for their interest in and need for the program.  ***",
