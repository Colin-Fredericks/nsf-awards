 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates a class of pebble games  developed  by Moschovakis and Aczel, by studying the behavior   of these games.  There is much current interest in the intersection of    logic and complexity theory, and pebble games have been used to    because of their expressibility and their intuitive appeal.  These    games will be applied to two kinds of  problems.  First, there  are some queries that might not be expressed in certain logics,  e.g., it is conjectured that the graph distance relation    dist(x,y) > dist(u,v) cannot be expressed in the fragment of least    fixed point logic (without successor) that admits only finitely    many alternations.  Second, there are some problems in random    graph theory that might best be addressed with pebble game techniques.",
