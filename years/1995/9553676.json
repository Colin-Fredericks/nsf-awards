 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort by six technical  institutes, a public land grant university, a state department of  technical and adult education, and industry representatives to  develop applications for multimedia and distance learning  technologies in Electronics Engineering Technology associate degree  programs in Georgia.  Forty-eight technology faculty will be  trained in multimedia applications.  A Curriculum Development Team  of technology faculty, industry representatives, and instructional  technology specialists will create multimedia applications for four  technical, math and physics courses in the electronics eneineering  technology program.  Project objectives target curriculum materials  development, faculty enhancement, student access through distance  education, and industry involvement.  Teaching/learning problems  addressed by the project include diverse academic preparation,  background and learning styles of students at technical institutes;  the impracticality of time and placebound instructional delivery  for adult students, the fast-changing technology and knowledge base  in engineering technology fields, and faculty need to diversify  teaching approaches and uses of instructional technologies  available in Georgia.",
