 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for expanding and improving  undergraduate biopsychology teaching laboratory curriculum.   Two  upgraded versions of current courses (Laboratories in  Neuroanatomy and Animal Learning) and two new ones (Laboratories  in Hormones and Behavior and Human Psychophysiology) are being  offered to approximately 200 biopsychology majors.   A laboratory  complement is provided to lecture course material and emphasizes  the dynamic, i.e., ever-changing, nature of scientific discovery.    Other goals of the laboratory curriculum are as follows: (1) to  provide undergraduates with hands on experience in  state-of-the-art neuroscience research methodologies through  small group instruction in the laboratory, preparing them for  careers in the health sciences; (2) to teach undergraduates the  scientific method, by having them design and conduct independent  experiments to test specific, self-generated scientific  hypotheses; (3) to improve scientific literacy (including  critical thinking) and communication, by requiring students to  read the original scientific literature and present their own  data in written and/or oral form; (4) to enhance our students'  computer usage skills.   Achievement of these goals enables  graduates: (1) to be cognizant of their own physiology; (2) to  evaluate critically the enormous amount of information  (scientific or otherwise) presented by the media; (3) to compete  successfully in the markeplace for jobs or additional  postgraduate education; (4) to succeed in the increasingly  technology-driven workplace of current and future society.",
