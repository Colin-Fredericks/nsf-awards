 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at a method to significantly reduce the cost of fuel cells which are actively being developed as the power source for electric vehicles. Specifically, this program will demonstrate the practical application of inexpensive catalysts, containing little or no noble metal, as H2-oxidation catalysts in a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The catalysts are intended to replace the costly Pt anode catalysts, currently used in PEMFCs. Objectives of the Phase I program are to demonstrate short-term stability of the catalysts, develop efficient electrode structures for use with these catalysts, and evaluate the tolerance of the catalysts to contaminants in the fuel stream. The program will culminate in continuous operation of a 40-cm2 active area PEMFC containing the most promising catalyst for a minimum of 200 hours. The development of inexpensive catalyst to replace the Pt-based PEMFC anode catalysts would result in a significant reduction in PEMFC cost, increasing the economic competitiveness of PEMFC-powered vehicles with vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines.",
