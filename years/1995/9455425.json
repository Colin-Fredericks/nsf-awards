Many  of these students tend to equate success in college with the  ability to memorize facts, and need more exposure to critical  thinking skills used by scientific investigators.  Research on  gender issues in science education indicates that computer  simulation is a particularly effective way to interest more women  in pursuing scientific careers.  We are developing highly  interactive experimental simulations based on existing  upper-division laboratories in our biotechnology curriculum  (Virology, Molecular Biology, and Animal Cell Culture).  These  simulations are used by Introductory Biology students to generate  and test their own hypotheses while working in small collaborative  groups. Students manipulate objects on the computer's screen much  as they would in reality.  For example, they can \"spin\" the dial of  a micro pipette or operate the control panel of a  spectrophotometer, DNA thermal cycler, or electron microscope.   Digitized video images of students using actual equipment are  incorporated into the simulations to make them more realistic.  Undergraduate education majors enrolled in a teaching methods class  are involved in the evaluation of the simulations which gives them  first-hand experience in evaluating the uses of technology in the  classroom.  The editorial staff of BioQUEST  will provide  assistance in the dissemination of the simulations.",
