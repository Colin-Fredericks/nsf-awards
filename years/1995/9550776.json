 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the proposed program will be to increase the number of  minorities entering SMET careers by providing a foundation for  life-long interest in science and mathematics for at least 50  participants annually; and, to provide activities which encourage  the participants to consider SMET as possible career choices.  The  specific objectives are to:  motivate students to remain in school  and interest them in studying the sciences and mathematics; to help  students understand science and future scientific questions through  hands-on, mind-on activities; help students become more self-  reliant in their school work while raising their self-esteem;  provide enriching learning experiences to improve the qualitative,  quantitative and analytical skills of the participants and to show  the importance of science, mathematics, and communication skills in  our daily lives; expose students to a board range of participatory  activities and to professionals in the area of science, math,  engineering and computer science; offer students information and  guidance in the career exploration process and the academic  preparation needed for a variety of professions, especially  potential math and science careers; heighten students' awareness   of science and mathematics disciplines as potential career choices,  including science teaching, encourage students through science  participation, knowledge and attitude to take prerequisite courses  for college majors in science and/or math; and, capture the  attention and assistance of more parents by preparing them to  support their children through actual involvement of the program's  activities.    The methodology will include providing academic enrichment in SMET  during a 5-week Summer Science Camp and Academic Year Follow-Up  Activities.  During the summer, Classroom and laboratory activities  in mathematics (including algebra), science (life and earth),  computer literacy and scientific communications will be offered.   Research methodology and career expl oration activities will also be  included.  Academic year follow-up activities will include an  extension of the summer content/activities on Saturdays and  participation in the South Carolina Middle/Elementary School  Academy of Science (SCMESAS) activities.  In this effort the  College will join with the middle schools in Richland County School  District One to establish SCMESAS clubs in their schools.    The desires outcome for the program will be an increase in the  number of minorities enrolling in SMET courses in both high school  and college with a subsequent increase in both the program  participants and their peers entering SMET careers.",
