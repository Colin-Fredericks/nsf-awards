The workshop  is  organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff, University of  Wisconsin-Madison, and Professor Alberto Franco de Sa  Santoro, from the CBPF, Brazil.    LISHEP95 is an international activity that builds on current  strengths in Brazil and is expected to have significant  impact on the development of high energy physics in  Latin  America.  It  will be organized in three sessions:  Session  A, \"Particle Physics for High School Teachers\" will  be held  6-10 February. Session B, \"Advanced School on HEP\", for  which the audience will be advanced graduate students and  young  Post-Doctoral Associates, will be held 8-19 February.  Finally, Session C, the \"cbt Workshop on Heavy Flavor  Physics\", aimed at active researchers in the field of heavy  quark physics, will be held 20-22 February.    LISHEP will contribute to the stated U.S. goal of  internationalizing large science projects and is likely to  lead to increased collaborations between U.S. scientists and  scientists from the region.  By enhancing existing science  programs and highlighting the technological stimulation that  results from them, this meeting will help to make the  developing countries in our hemisphere stronger scientific  and engineering partners in the future.    ***",
