 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400810  Bechtold    The investigator proposes to study several fundamental aspects of premixed   flame propagation.  Of primary concern will be flames whose characteristic   dimension is much larger than their thermal thickness so that the flame can   be viewed as a hydrodynamic discontinuity.  Such flames have taken on   new significance in recent years due to their role in modeling turbulent   combustion.  In one phase of the project, hydrodynamic flame models will   be used to study the dynamics and extinction characteristics of premixed   flames in unsteady environments. The investigator also proposes to extend   existing flame models that have employed one-step-chemistry   approximations by considering a two-step mechanism that better captures   the branching-recombination nature of flames.  The methods that will be   used include asymptotic and perturbation techniques together with   numerical computations. This work will provide a better understanding of   flame-flow interactions which are an important feature of turbulent   combustion.    Nearly all combustion devices of practical importance operate in a turbulent   combustion regime.  This includes spark-ignition engines, incinerators,   rockets, forest fires, etc.  The complexities inherent in each of these systems   have prevented a deep understanding of turbulent combustion.  However, a   partial understanding of this topic can be achieved by first comprehending   various fundamental aspects that are common in many of these systems.    For example, a turbulent flow field is characterized by random spatial and   temporal variations, and a flame situated in such a flow will get stretched   and distorted.  In addition, the heat released by the combustion process will   affect the flow field.  In this work the investigator proposes to study these   interactions theoretically. There are two main themes: (i) to examine flame   response in unsteady (time-dependent) flows; and (ii) to extend existing   flame models to include additional eff ects due to chemical reaction.  This   work will provide a better understanding of flame-flow interactions which   are an important feature of turbulent combustion.",
