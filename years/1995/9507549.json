 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507549  Wurtele  The maintenance of a balance between anabolism and  catabolism is crucial to the net biosynthesis of  phytochemicals.  This metabolic balance is particularly  evident during seedling development when large quantities of  seed reserve (lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) are  catabolized.  The resultant intermediates are then utilized  as substrates for the biosynthesis of new phytochemicals, or  they are respired to generate ATP, which supports the  biosynthetic reactions.  These metabolic interconversions  require the coordinate action and regulation of many  antagonistic processes.    This award will study the catabolism of leucine and  subsequent utilization of the derived carbon in young  seedlings of soybean and Arabidopsis, as an example of how  organisms coordinate complex interconnected metabolic  pathways to achieve net interconversions of biomolecules.  In plants, the catabolism of leucine is thought to occur in  mitochondria, via a set of reactions which are partly in  common with a pathway by which mevalonate may be metabolized  to non-isoprenoid compounds.  Acetyl-CoA thus formed from  leucine and mevalonate can be further metabolized for  respiration, gluconeogenesis, and lipogenesis.    These investigations will define previously unknown  mitochondrial metabolic processes and begin to indicte how  they interface with metabolism in other organelles.  The  understanding of catabolic provesses will ultimately provide  a better understanding of how plants maintain a balance  between anabolism and catabolism.  Comprehension of how this  balance is regulated may open new, as yet unforeseen,  avenues to the improvement of agricultural production.",
