 "awd_abstract_narration": "Essex Community College is implementing new curricula and  pedagogical methods in several mathematics and computer science  courses with the objective of having students adopt a more active  role in the learning process.  A classroom laboratory of Macintosh  computers and additional student demonstration stations with  projection devices for regular classroom use will be used to  replace the lecture method by classroom and/or laboratory  activities, for problem-driven experimentation and discovery in a  wide variety of mathematics and computer science courses.  Learning  styles beneficial for female students will be emphasized, including  use of cooperative learning groups, as 60% of ECC students are  female.       The department has prepared to adopt the Harvard Consortium  calculus curriculum in all sections as they are offered, beginning  with Calculus I.  The NSF-funded Math Modeling/Precalculus Reform  Project will be adopted in experimental sections, while control  sections will continue to use a traditional precalculus curriculum.  Use of a CAS will enable exploration of realistic problems, reduce  emphasis on hand manipulations, and provide a visualization tool.   NSF-funded Project Chance materials will be incorporated into  statistics and mathematics for liberal arts courses.  Students in  mathematics for elementary education majors will explore NCTM  standards-based materials, including technology appropriate for  middle school algebra.  Two new introductory computer science  courses, in multimedia technology and Internet resources, will be  offered.  These and several existing computer science courses will  be taught in a stimulating multimedia environment to increase  student motivation, and also encourage use of, and develop  familiarity with, computer technologies among students who depend  upon the college for their computing experiences.",
