 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kimmel       The investigator and his colleagues organize a conference on  the mathematical modeling of heterogeneous biological populations.  The topics concern populations of genes (including dynamics of  genome evolution), populations of cells and tumors, as well as the  natural history of cancer, and selected topics from epidemiology  such as AIDS.  These biological topics are integrated with the  mathematical topics of branching processes, stochastic models,  random walks, spacial processes, structured populations,  semigroups of operators, and dynamical systems.  This selection of  subjects is motivated by recent advances in the mathematical  theory of populations and in new data available from various  branches of molecular and cellular biology, and biomedical  sciences.       The aim of the conference is to provide an interdisciplinary  international forum for an exchange of views and experiences  between biologists working on real life data and mathematicians  developing and analyzing model equations.  Special efforts are made  to facilitate a mutual understanding between the usually disparate  groups of theoreticians and experimentalists, and between  established scientists and younger colleagues.  The conference  fosters exchanges between mathematicians and quantitative  biologists in the relevant fields from the the west with  colleagues from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.",
