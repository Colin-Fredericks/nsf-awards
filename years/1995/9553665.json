 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this NSF proposal is to develop a new and  innovative curriculum for introductory college physics to be known  as Introductory College Physics 2000 (ICP/2).       This algebra-based course will be modular since its genesis is  the Principle of Technology Modules developed in the 1970's.  ICP/2  will be available in hard copy, but IBM and MAC versions on CD-ROM  will be emphasized since it will allow the instructor using the  material to edit it before printing for classroom use.       The new curriculum will incorporate what is now known, through  studies in cognitive science, about teaching strategies that will  improve student learning.  The modules will be developed to  introduce activities designed to enhance a student's conceptual  understanding and ability to make connections to related ideas.       Introductory College Physics 2000 will target the students in  technology courses, although it will be suitable for all college  students.  With the introduction of TechPrep and similar programs,  more technology students are taking college physics.  Each module  in the new curriculum will use modern technological devices to  introduce the physics concepts.  This will motivate the  technological students and help them see the connections between  physics and their chosen fields.       This college physics course will maintain a rigor that will  make it highly transferrable to universities.  It will emphasize a  hands on approach and will introduce all the major concepts of  introductory physics.  However, it will be the philosophy of ICP/2  that it is more important for students to fully understand fewer  basic concepts and have confidence in applying them to new  situations than it is for them to be exposed to more ideas that are  neither understood nor remembered.       Project ICP/2 will involve consultants and two other community  colleges in Washington and Pennsylvania During the first year,  advisory boards and other writing centers would be formed.",
