 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507197    The  speed and maneuverability of fishes have long  captured  human imagination. Most research has been concerned with how  fish  swim at high speeds and accelerate at high rates,  but  as  yet  we  have  little understanding of  the  causes  for  differences between species. Maneuverability may provide the  unifying explanation, yet there are virtually no studies  on  fish maneuverability, its effects on speed and acceleration,  or  how  variability in fish body and fin form  improves  or  restricts  maneuverability.  The  purpose  of  the  proposed  research is to fill this gap.  Maneuverability includes  two  components:  the  ability to turn in a small  radius  circle  (turning  radius)  and  the ability to  turn  at  high  rate  (agility).   Fish  use  different  patterns,  or  gaits,  of  locomotion to swim at different speeds. Their primary  gaits  are  routine swimming powered by the median and paired fins,  cruising and sprinting with the body and tail fins, and fast  start   accelerations  using  the  body   and   tail   fins.  Maneuverability differs between gaits, and experiments  will  be  performed to measure maneuverability in each gait  using  mazes,   circular   raceways,   and   fast   start   trials.  Maneuverability   will  be  measured  using   frame-by-frame  analysis  of  movie or video recordings. Three fish  species  varying  in  body  shape and fin location will  be  studied.  Measurements   of  maneuverability  during  feeding   around  obstacles and movement through mazes will determine  whether  how  shape  affects motor performance (maneuverability)  and  energy  gain  during median and paired fin swimming.  During  sprints,  fish  are expected to reduce speed to  turn.  This  contrasts with current theory for fish, which may  be  based  on  sub-maximum performance levels. Analysis  of  fast-start  maneuvers  will  test  a  unified  model  in  which  overall  performance depends on speed, the timing of a turn  and  its  radius.   These variables determine  the general  pattern  of  the  behavior,  the  specifics of  linear  acceleration  and  deceleration  patterns and the final escape trajectory.  The  research    will    provide   detailed    measurements    of  maneuverability in various activities and a unified approach  to intra- and inter-specific variation in swimming behavior.  Because maneuverability may constrain habitat selection, the  research  should  contribute to solving  problems  like  the  rehabilitation of aquatic habitat. Understanding the factors  that   limit   speed  and  maneuverability  will  facilitate  construction  design  that  minimizes  fish  losses  due  to  entrainment in industrial practices.",
