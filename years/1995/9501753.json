 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Phelan  U/ Hawaii  CTS-9501753    Research on the contact resistance between nonmetallic compounds at cryogenic temperatures will performed. This work has applications in mechanical cryocoolers and in applications of high-temperature superconductors. The work will focus on combinations of metallic-nonmetallic  and nonmetallic-nonmetallic contacts. The work will use experimental measurements to aid in developing a model of the contact resistance at these conditions with the goal of providing a tool for the thermal design of cryogenic equipment.    The education program includes development of advanced nontraditional courses in heat transfer as well as a new undergraduate course in Energy Conversion Systems. Of special note are proposed student exchange programs with a Japanese university and outreach programs to native Hawaiian and Filipino students. These programs have special value for the investigator+s home institution of the University of Hawaii.",
