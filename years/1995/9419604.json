 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419604 Allen  Research will be carried out to explore and study a new approach to scanning calorimetry.  The proposed approach is potentially a very powerful method for directly obtaining quantitative values for small enthalpy of reactions at interfaces, surfaces and near surface regions.  We expect to achieve sensitivity equivalent to the enthalpy of submonolayer desorption, to demonstrate the utility of the method for the measurement of extremely small amounts of heat generated during solid/solid reactions and surface processes as well as low enthalpy of internal microcrystalline processes.  We will measure the kinetics of interface reactions such as the nucleation of silicides at buried interfaces, and begin a study of near surface processes, such as point defect annihilation and coalescence of vacancies in silicon following ion implantation. %%% The primary goal of this program is to develop a high sensitivity microcalorimeter based on modern thin film techniques, and to demonstrate its useful in gaining fundamental materials science information on surface science phenomena such as the enthalpy of surface reconstruction, phase transformations, and individual microscopic properties of surface chemistry processes such as the decomposition of adsorbed species during atomic layer epitaxy.   An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials and processing research.  This research will contribute to improving the general perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and tele communica tions.  ***",
