 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503582  Cvitanic        This project, which is funded through the Applied Mathematics Program, the  Statistics and Probability Program, and the Economics Program, will investigate  various mathematical problems of stochastic analysis and control that arise in the  context of modern theory and practice of nonlinear financial markets.  These  include (i)  questions of optimization, hedging and pricing of contingent claims in   markets with transaction costs, as well as in markets in which the prices can  depend in a nonlinear fashion on the investment strategy and wealth of the agent;  (ii) nonstandard models for asset prices. Mathematical questions related to (i)  include existence and uniqueness of certain forward-backward stochastic  differential equations, viscosity solutions to certain partial differential equations and  variational inequalities, as well as a non-standard  stochastic control problem in  which the terminal loss function has a random component.  With regard to (ii), it is   expected that a new kind of stochastic calculus will have to be developed,  one  which goes beyond the semimartingales framework.        One of the reasons for the present gap between the theory of finance and  the reality of the stock market is the prevailing assumption in theoretical work that  the market is perfect in the sense that every financial contract can be priced by  calculating exactly its present value. This is, however, not the case in reality due to  different types of market  friction\" such as transaction costs, different interest  rates, presence of large investors who can influence the asset prices, and so forth  Thus, it is very important to develop new methods for pricing financial instruments  in imperfect markets, some of which will be the focus of this research.  In a similar   vein, the risk one undertakes when buying or selling financial instruments is  typically much larger than predicted by the perfect-market theory (as recent  scandals involving the trading of options confirm).   This project will develop a   theory of risk-hedging in imperfect markets that is more general and at the same  time  more applicable to realistic financial markets than current theory.  ***",
