The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support an eight-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Lynn M. Walker to work with Professor Paula  Moldenaers at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium.    The blending of polymeric materials during processing is a  rapidly growing industrial practice with the goals of  capitalizing on specific pure component properties and  lowering processing costs.  Blending offers an almost  infinite range of final properties, the potential to utilize  recycled and high volume materials and the ability to use  existing processing equipment without costly alterations.  Unfortunately, the blending of polymeric materials is not  fully understood at a fundamental level, making the robust a  priori prediction of final properties almost impossible.  This limits the widespread use of heterogeneous blends,  especially those containing complex and specialized  polymeric materials.  However it is the unique properties of  these complex polymeric materials that offer the most  potential gain in blending processes.        The purpose of this research is to gain a fundamental grasp  of the flow-induced behavior observed in one special group  of blends. Specifically, the PI will study heterogeneous  blends containing a matrix of flexible polymer and  inclusions of liquid crystal polymer (LCP), and perform  several rheological and rheo-optical experiments on a model  blend. The results will provide quantitative estimates of  the macroscopic and microscopic parameters used in present  models for heterogeneous blends.   ***",
