 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Mechatronics\" is a strategy which involves integrating mechanical  engineering, electronic engineering and computer science into the  fundamental design process, rather than engineering each set of  requirements separately. This project will conduct an intensive  summer workshop and a follow-up conference to enhance the  knowledge, skills and instructional capabilities of 40  undergraduate faculty members drawn from institutions throughout  the USA to launch and lead interdisciplinary courses in  \"Mechatronics Education\" at their institutions. The workshop will  illustrate how mechatronics engineering concepts can be  successfully introduced at the undergraduate level in an integrated  way--from the design of complex products to final manufacturing.    The program will be offered in the following three phases: A  six-day Residential Workshop at CalPoly (Summer '95) involving  hands-on projects and demonstrations on design and manufacturing of  complex products and concurrent engineering, a two-day follow-up  session at an industrial site (Summer '96) in which participants  report on efforts to introduce new concepts at their home  institutions. During a one year follow-through phase, the  participants will utilize electronic mail and teleconference  facilities to exchange ideas.    The participants will be provided with ample opportunities to gain  hands-on experience with several traditional and state-of-the-art  manufacturing processes as well as concurrent engineering tools.  Lecture notes, comprehensive multi-media course material  demonstrating the equipment, software and the manufacturing  processes used by the participants during the workshop in the  design and fabrication of the complex products will be prepared and  will be made available to the participants.    The follow-up activities will be in the form of a conference that  will be held at an industrial site, and industry participation will  be provided through tours of plants in the San Francisco bay area.  Conference proceedings  in which the participants report on their  accomplishments will be prepared as an outcome of the workshop.  Several papers will be submitted for publication, and presentations  will be made at national ASEE conferences.",
