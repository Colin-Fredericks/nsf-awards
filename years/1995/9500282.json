 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500282  Gerhardt    The  objective of the proposed research is to determine  the  relationship   between  pore  microstructure   and   thermal  treatment   for   the   creation  of   controlled   porosity  materials.  To accomplish that task the following activities  will be carried out:  (1) Fabricate colloidal silica/soluble  silicate    monoliths    having    systematically     varied  microstructures  with respect to both average  pore  size(s)  and  polydispersity.  The pore structure will be  engineered  by  modifications in chemical processing.  (2)  Characterize  the  microstructure of the precursor materials fully  before  sintering  using a combination of microscopy  (optical,  and  electron  microscopy),  and  several  different  measurement  techniques.   (3) Quantitatively characterize the  evolution  of  the microstructure ex-situ by means of pore size,  shape  and  distribution measurements on isothermally sintered  and  quenched  samples.  Extend the sintering studies to  in-situ  isothermal sintering and simultaneous scattering experiments  by  means of a unique small angle neutron scattering furnace  at  the  NIST reactor.  (4) Utilize computer simulation  and  modeling  to  help elucidate the microstructural  mechanisms  responsible for the observed pore structure evolution.    %%%    Numerous  engineering applications such as  superinsulators,  filters,  and sensors require porous materials.  Understand-  ing  the  pore  structure  evolution  during  sintering   is  essential  for  the  fabrication and control  of  the  final  microstructure in porous materials.  Materials such as those  studied  in  this  project offer a notable  opportunity,  to  tailor   thermal   conductivity  for  insulating   purposes,  dielectric constant for sensing devices and elastic  modulus  for porous structural ceramics.",
