Previous  studies  of  1/f  noise and random telegraph switching noise in a-Si:H in our laboratory  suggest  that  the  noise arises from inhomogeneous current  filaments  whose  resistance varies in time, possibly due to the motion of bonded  hydrogen  inducing  bonding  rearrangements  which  alter  the  defect  structure   of  the  material.   Amorphous  silicon  films   will   be  synthesized in an rf plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition  system  at  the  University  of  Minnesota, for which  the  doping  level  and  deposition conditions are systematically varied.  The temperature  and  bias  dependence of the random telegraph noise of these films will  be  investigated  to determine if the switching noise arises from  current  microchannels.   The  non-Gaussian statistics which  characterize  1/f  noise  will be investigated as the properties of the a-Si:H films  are  varied.  Finally, the long-range disorder at the mobility edge will be  characterized by comparing the difference between the thermopower  and  conductivity  activation energies,  and will be  correlated  with  the  noise  behavior as well as with the optical and structural  properties  of   these  films.   These  efforts  will  significantly  improve  our  understanding  of the fluctuation phenomena in a-Si, a technologically  important material.  %%%  Hydrogenated  amorphous  silicon  (a-Si:H)  is  increasingly  used  in  photovoltaic devices, input scanners, fax machines, photocopiers,  and  thin-film  transistors for flat-panel displays.  All of these  require  the  large  surface  area advantages of amorphous semiconductors.   As  these  electronic  devices  are made smaller,  fundamental  electrical  noise  in  the amorphous silicon ultimately limits device performance.  An  understanding  of the microscopic m echanisms responsible  for  the  noise  phenomena is therefore crucial if amorphous semiconductors  are  to  achive their technological potential.  The principal aim  of  this  research  project  is to elucidate and study these mechanisms  as  the  properties  of the thin-film semiconductor are systematically  varied.  Previous  studies  of  the electronic noise in hydrogenated  amorphous  silicon  in  our laboratory discovered that the noise itself  exhibits  time-dependent fluctuations, that is, the noise has noise!  Studies of  the  noise  of the noise provide important information concerning  the  degree  of  electronic  disorder and long-range  correlations  in  the  material.   This research will significantly advance our knowledge  of  fluctuation phenomena in amorphous silicon in particular, as  well  as  improve  our  understanding of the physics  of  non-linear  relaxation  processes in disordered solids, in general.  ***",
