 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Program.  This study will examine how two low income Mexican-American communities use social networks to deal with day to day economic issues.  Theoretical issues focus on how social capital that is manifested through social networks facilitate or constrain economic participation.  Fieldwork has been completed in the first community, made up of Mexican migrants living in San Jose.  Funding is requested for establishing residence from which to conduct participant observation of a second community, made up of Chicanos in Los Angeles.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of poverty and urban life, immigrant communities, and the economy and it will provide policy makers with information about the ways to promote economic resources in poor communities.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
