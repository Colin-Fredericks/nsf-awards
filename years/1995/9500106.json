 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500106  Ducharme  The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of  Nebraska will purchase a pulsed laser system for us with several  research projects.  The proposed pulsed laser system consists of:   1) a commercial Q-switched Nd:YAG pump laser and second harmonic  generator, 2) a custom narrow bandwidth pulsed dye laser, and 3) an  optical table, detectors, and optical elements suitable for use  with high power lasers.    The pulsed laser system will be used to conduct dynamical  measurements on a much shorter time scale (equal to or greater than  5 ns) than is possible with our CW lasers (equal to or greater that  1 ms), extending the scope of several research projects.  These  projects include:  1) Dynamical studies of photorefractive polymers  elucidating charge generation, trapping, and transport processes,  2) All-optical modulation caused by combined pyroelectric and  electro-optic response in pyroelectric materials in the sub-  microsecond time scale during which the pyroelectric effects are  dominant, 3) Dynamical response of the photorefractive nonlinear  Fabry-Perot etalon which exhibits intensity dependent asymmetric  transmission and may exhibit optical bistability, 4) Spectroscopy  and dynamics of modulated absorption in photorefractive materials  to obtain energies, lifetimes, cross sections, and other  information concerning (\"deep\" and \"shallow\") traps, and 5)  Nonlinear optical effects on polymer/crystal nanocomposites.  ***",
