 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Natural Science Department is modernizing and strengthening  the experimental biology curricula.   Recent developments include  the establishment of a new Comparative Physiology course as a  component of several experimental and medically oriented  undergraduate programs.   Fulfillment of the teaching and  research goals of the university through these programs depend on  significant expansion of existing facilities.   This project  provides instruments including osmometers, a benchtop pH meter  and microelectrode, a portable pH meter and dissolved oxygen/BOD  Probe, a 10- g digital microbalance, a digital  humidity/temperature meter, and a Ward's Physiogrip  Muscle  Physiology System and square-wave stimulator.   New analytical  techniques and experimental approaches are being incorporated  into several interacting courses within the biology programs and  developed through planned collaborations with faculty at other  institutions.",
