 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will examine the feasibility of developing an integrated model to predict the impact of hurricanes as dynamic turbulent system on large bodies of shallow water. Technology International Incorporated has previously shown that the integration of separate models for hurricanes and shallow bodies of water into a single model has the potential of simplifying the complex task of simulating the interaction between the two systems. Several constraints were initially imposed on the model to estimate the feasibility of the integrated model. Such constraints will be relaxed and some of the effects discounted in model formulation will be taken into account. The model will be solved numerically for various situations and the stability of the interface region in the hurricane-water system will be investigated. To demonstrate the prediction capability of the model, conditions at onset of chaos will be evaluated.",
