 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522266  Cheng  The proposed research is focused on,  on-line dielectric  diagnostics of operating transformers in the framework of  electric PD detection.  The proposed approach consists of three  fundamental parts:  (1)PD signal detection, (2)Signal  preprocessing and (3)classification.  In the first part, temporal  PD signals as well as external noise signals coupled through  power lines are collected by using a data acquisition system  developed previously.  These signals are picked up from ground  wires of both transformer and bushing, from the air, or others.   Then they are fed into the block of signal preprocessing, where  noise cancellation and other classical techniques of signal  processing are employed.  The study of stochastic characteristics  of PD's and noises will help to design reliable and effective  filters.  Features used in the PD recognition block will be  determined in the task of PD & noise characterization.  After  performing feature mapping from the filtered temporal signal, a  neural network is used to identify defect types of dielectric  insulation in operating transformers.  The neural network is  trained with the knowledge of PD patterns from the task of PD  characterization.  ***",
