 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support funds for a Penrose Conference on the  tectonic development of the Arctic Ocean Basin.  Penrose conferences are  sponsored by the Geological Society of America and they are intended to bring  together researchers at critical junctures in the development of scientific thinking  in fields of geology and geophysics.  The title of this conference is \"The Tectonic  Development of the Canada Basin and Surrounding Regions\", and it will be held  September 28-October 3, 1995.    The tectonic history of the Arctic region is still extremely controversial and of  great importance not only to our understanding of global tectonics, but also to  understanding the framework of the known and conjectured oil and mineral  resources of the Arctic.  The movement of the tectonic plates involved in  evolution of the Arctic region have not all been identified, even 25 years after the  plate tectonic revolution.  In particular, how and when the Canada Basin section  of the Arctic developed during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic is still debated in the  scientific literature.  The Eocene to recent evolution of the Arctic Ocean was  thought to be reasonably straightforward, consisting of identified seafloor  spreading along the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge in the Eurasian Basin.  But now, recent  field work indicates that some of the Cenozoic seafloor spreading motion in the  Eurasian Basin was transformed into the Canada Basin.  Similarly, recent analyses  of ERS-1 satellite derived gravity data over the Arctic Ocean to 84 N have added  new information, some of it relating directly to the controversy concerning the  origin of the Canada Basin.    At the present time, the various groups that work on the many different aspects of  the Arctic tend to work independently of one another, and attend different  national and international meetings.  Therefore, substantial progress could be  made in the understanding of Arctic tectonics by bringing together the key  scientists from these groups to integrat e studies based on terrestrial geology and  geophysics around the margin of the Arctic, marine geological and geophysical  studies, and aeromagnetic, aerogravity and satellite data.  In addition, the Russian  data that were not available to western scientists until recently, need to be  incorporated  into the tectonic models for the Arctic, along with new data  obtained through joint research undertaken between Russian scientists, and  scientists from Germany, U.S. and Canada.    This meeting is an opportunity to advance understanding of the present geological  and geophysical knowledge of the Arctic, and to plan coordinated and cooperative  future work in the Arctic.",
