Proposal IBN-9511642:           'Behavioral Ecology of Monkey Spatial Movements'         The goal of this project is to understand the rules animals  use to decide where to move  within a known home range.  Much  evidence from studies of animal foraging suggests that they  attempt to maximize food intake relative to foraging costs.  When  costs are proportional to distance moved between known resources,  the problem is essentially similar to the human 'Traveling  Salesman Problem' , in which the goal is to travel among N known  cities in the shortest possible distance.  This problem has  resisted precise mathematical solution despite great efforts, and  thus the possible rules that animals might use are far from  obvious -- even the approximate solutions to this problem offered  in the economics literature typically involve vast numbers of  calculations on powerful computers.  Do animals use simple or  complex rules, do they 'look ahead' to more than the next  immediate goal, how closely do their rules approach the best  possible solutions available on computers today?       A wild population of fruit-eating primates (capuchin  monkeys) were chosen as the study animals because they need to  solve such spatial problems every day.  Their major resources,  fruit trees, are scarce and fixed in space, while the cost of  traveling between fruit patches in rainforests is very high  compared to moving on level ground or flying.  Some data in  captivity suggest that fruit-eating primates can learn and  remember the locations of large numbers of hidden food sources,  so it is plausible that they can use such abilities to solve  spatial foraging problems in the wild.  In addition, primate  groups can be followed continuously for long periods (weeks),  thus allowing for large sample sizes of natural spatial  movements.  However, because human researchers can rarely know  everything (such as location, productivity, and palatability)  about all the food patches available  to a primate group, the  results of previous observational studies are not easy to  interpret.  To reduce these problems of interpretation, this  project uses a field-experimental approach in which fruit  (tangerines) is provided on a series of  wooden platforms  suspended from trees --  the investigator can completely control  the location, amount of food reward, and food type on the  platforms.  Confounding influences of other, natural food sources  are minimized in this subtropical Argentine study site by working  only in winter, when nearly all natural fruit production stops.       The spatial locations of the platforms are chosen (using a  computer program) so that the sequences of movement choices from  one platform to the next will differ depending on the possible  decision rules used.  The specific rules tested will include ones  that (1) place differing amounts of emphasis on delayed vs.  immediate rewards, (2) trade off distance vs. amount of food, and  (3) examine rewards individually by platform or integrate over  the entire spatial array of platforms.   Investigating the rules  capuchins use to move between known resources will help us to  understand (1) a largely neglected aspect of foraging behavior,  (2) the likely mental organization of spatial knowledge in  primates and possibly humans, and (3) what aspects of the  resource base of an animal species may favor the evolution of  complex mental maps, which have been implicated in the evolution  of intelligence in man's ancestors.  The knowledge about spatial  decisions of these monkeys will also provide important  information about their spatial needs and how they may react to  habitat disturbance, results which may help in conserving this  species in the wild as increasing numbers are taken for  laboratory use.",
