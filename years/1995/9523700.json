S.  Department of Education, National Center for Education  Statistics (NCES).  The grantee, the Association for  Institutional Research (AIR, will organize and administer a  program to support several types of awards to investigators  using these data bases.  The project will consist of three  components.  The first component would support fellowships  to individuals, to support on-site work in Washington, DC  Project would be expected to utilize national databases and  also provide a significant professional development  experience to the fellow.  The second would support research  work at the awardees home institution, either on national  databases or work of such a nature that it will contribute  to an overall understanding of postsecondary education or to  the professional development of personnel working in  postsecondary education.  The third component would provide  small grants for communicating and disseminating information  about the content of the NSF and NCES databases and  techniques for utilization of these databases for analysis.  Activities under this component could include small meetings  or seminars, support for special sessions at larger  meetings, special publications, or other dissemination  activities.  Results from all projects will be disseminated  through a variety of means to the user community.    This project will be administered by the Executive Officer  of the AIR, which will publicize the availability of project  funds, organize and conduct review panels for evaluating  individual proposals.  A Grant and Fellowship Advisory  Committee will provide guidance on program direction and  priorities; NSF and NCES will be represented on the  committee.  Other members will be broadly representative of  the higher education research community.    The project offers benefits including  greater visibility of  issues in postsecondary education and science and  engineering education, and improved data quality fostered by  greater use and scrutiny of existing data sources.",
