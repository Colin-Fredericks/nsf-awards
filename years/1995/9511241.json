 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511241  PALKA  This research will investigate a novel gene that has been found to  be important in sensory system development.  This gene, called  \"defective modalities\" (\"demo\"), when mutated, results in  abnormalities in the visual, olfactory, and gustatory systems.  The  experiments that will be performed take advantage of the power of  an invertebrate model system to analyze this gene at a number of  levels.  Physiological analysis will more completely define the  nature of the defects caused by mutation of the demo gene, a  molecular biological analysis will characterize the gene and its  products, and ultrastructural analysis will be used to define the  subcellular localization of demo expression.  Based on previous  phenotypic analysis, it is hypothesized that the demo product is  involved, as either a receptor or adhesion molecule, in synaptic  transmission in sensory systems.  The multidisciplinary analyses  described above are designed to test this hypothesis.  The results  of these experiments will provide basic information about the role  of adhesion molecules and receptors in the development of sensory  systems.",
