 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503544  Binder  Maryville College is seeking support in connecting its campus to  INTERNet by installing a node on campus.  The support would be in  the form of computer hardware, communications software, and  communication services.  Maryville College currently has dial-in  access to INTERNet through the University of Tennessee in Knoxville  for most of its faculty and staff, but this service is quite  limited, and it is not available to students.  By connecting to  INTERNet via a node, Maryville College would be able to greatly  improve and expand its current computer services to its  constituents, especially its students.    These connections will provide operations management and  information services and it will give the college a 56 thousand  bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high  speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.  The benefits of the NSFNET connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer resources.  Also the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation in educational  resources and incorporate them into their curricula.",
