 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SBIR Phase I project will develop a technology for producing focused cold neutron beams from radioisotopic sources which can be used for neutron absorption analysis.  Analytical uses of neutron absorption techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and neutron depth profiling (NDP) have increased greatly on account of their ability to detect nondestructively many light elements that are virtually impossible to detect by other techniques.  However, most potential users cannot take advantage of these methods because of the techniques traditionally require a reactor as a source of neutrons.  In this project new developed capillary optics technology will be used in conjunction with a californium-252 source to deliver a focused cold neutron beam which is essentially free of gamma rays and higher energy neutrons.  The use of cold neutrons to obtain increased reaction cross section and the reduction in background will improve sensitivity so neutron absorption techniques can be widely used with non-reactor-based neutron sources.",
