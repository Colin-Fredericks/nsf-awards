 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many practical problems, the information concerning the system  under study is often represented in two forms: one is a set of  input-output data pairs, and, the other is a set of linguistic  descriptions about the system, often in the form of IF-THEN fuzzy  rules.  Traditional system identification methods and  classification methods, even including the (model-free) neural  network approaches, can only utilize the input-output data pairs.   This research will continue to develop general methods to combine  both input-output data pairs and linguistic IF-THEN rules into  signal - processing systems designs.    The new direction that this research is taking is the handling of  uncertainty by using fuzzification in a fuzzy logic signal  processor.  The nonsingleton FLSs will be applied to a variety of  important signal processing problems including fuzzy  classification.    The objectives are to: (1) establish a measure of uncertainty for  the output of a nonsingleton FLS, in accordance with estimation  theory practice; (2) develop a nonsingleton FLS state estimator for  nonlinear dynamical systems; (3) extend fuzzy logic classifiers to  include imprecise training samples and noisy measurements, using  nonsingleton FLSs; (4) extend backpropagation and orthogonal least  squares parameter training procedures to nonsingleton FLSs and  classifiers; (5) apply nonsingleton FLSs to the forecasting of  multiple time series and to adaptive filtering problems of noise  cancellation and blind equalization; and, (6) apply nonsingleton  fuzzy logic classifiers to modulation classification.",
