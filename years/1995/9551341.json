 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is developing an undergraduate cell biology course  that promises to be a relevant and exciting course to encourage  students to continue their studies and pursue careers in the  biological sciences and to provide them with the skills to do so.    Through this project, the university is developing advanced  microscopy laboratories that utilize many of the best and most  exciting techniques in cell biology, research.   Recent advances  in microscopy have provided researchers with new views of cell  biology, and a wide variety of fluorescent probes are now  available to study cellular structure and function in living or  fixed cells.   These techniques and instrumentation are brought  into the undergraduate teaching labs in a sophomore core course  in cell biology.   Laboratory exercises using fluorescence  microscopes equipped with contrast enhancing optics and an  imaging processing system are being developed; the students use  this equipment in experiments to examine the current models and  theories in cell biology.   For unlimited viewing, the  microscopes have a color video projection system to allow  students to project their cell preparations to the rest of the  class for examination and discussion.   With the video projection  and recording system, interactive and collaborative learning is  encouraged.   Individual and small group work, peer teaching, and  experimental projects, all of which are very effective teaching  techniques, are all provided.   Students perform experiments of  their own design and present their results orally and in written  reports.",
