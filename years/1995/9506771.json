 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506771  Valavanis  The central mbjective of the proposed work is:  object  identification, classification and avoidance in 3-D  underwater automated surveillance.  The motivation behind  this objective is monitoring and safeguarding wetlands,  coastal fisheries and deep water polluted environments,  which are among the most valuable national resources.  The  specific application domain, directly related to the  proposed work, is surveying and monitoring Louisiana's  wetlands and shallow water fisheries in collaboration with  the Southern Science Center (SSC) - previously known as the  National Wetlands Research Center - and the recently  established National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), both  located at the University of Southwestern Louisiana's  (USL's) research park.    This proposal capitalizes on already available resources,  technology and algorithms, developed for other applications,  but adapts and further modifies and enhances them for the  proposed automated surveillance problem.  The end result  will be:  a detailed methodology/approach for the real-time  sensor based autonomous control and navigation of an  underwater vehicle, capable of automated surveillance in  sensitive environments.  There will be no field studies  and/or vehicle related experiments at this stage.  Three  specific objectives will be accomplished:    i)Development of a detailed architecture for underwater    vehicle motion control.    ii)    Implementation and experimental verification of an    already derived total color difference (TCD) measure and    total color difference tolerance (TCDT) thresholds for    underwater object identification.    iii)   Enhancement and verification of a recently derived    potential based panel method for autonomous vehicle    motion planning in a 3-D workshop environment.  ***",
