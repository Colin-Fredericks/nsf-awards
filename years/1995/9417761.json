Guard cells which flank  stomata fail to undergo a senescence (aging) process like  that which takes place in cells of the underlying tissue  (mesophyll).  Thus a system to culture individual guard  cells has been developed to study the induction and  regulation of senescence.  Guard cells protoplasts (GCP,  guard cells isolated with cell walls removed)  have been  successfully cultured for a week at 36-40o C, but lower  temperatures were not effective at maintaining the guard  cells as guard cells, but allowed redifferentiation and  callus formation.  The following model is suggested to  account for the temperature sensitivity: 1) At lower  temperatures (24-34oC) the plant hormone auxin induces  synthesis of ethylene.  2) Ethylene synthesis results in  cellular senescence or a growth response that results in  callus formation. 3) Ethylene synthesis is inhibited at  higher temperatures.  4) At higher temperatures, abscisic  acid (ABA) counteracts the auxin/cytokinin response, thereby  preventing redifferentiation of GCP.  To test this model the  following experiments are done: 1) The GCP are cultured at  the higher temperature in ABA to test if ABA itself could  induce dedifferentiation.  2)  Examine the levels of  ethylene produced by GCP at lower temperatures.  3) Test  whether other conditions which which suppress ethylene  action also allow the GCP to maintain a non-senescent state.  This is a project supported through the Research at  Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program. Over the prior  award period of three years there were 26 undergraduates  involved in research. A similar level of involvement is  expected in this award.  %%%  The long-term objective the project is to elucidate the  molecular mechanisms that regulate the decline during aging  (senescence) of cells and chloroplasts of plant leaves.  Guard cells wh ich flank stomata fail to undergo an aging  process like that which takes place in cells of the  underlying tissue (mesophyll).  Thus a system to culture  individual guard cells has been developed to study the  induction and regulation of senescence.  In this set-up,  guard cells protoplasts (GCP, guard cells isolated with cell  walls removed)  are successfully cultured for fairly long  periods (days) at elevated temperatures  (36-40o C).  Lower  temperatures are not effective at maintaining the guard  cells as guard cells, but allow redifferentiation and  general cell growth or callus formation. The hypothesis is  that the plant growth regulator, ethylene, causes the cells  to senesce at lower temperatures, but is not produced by the  guard cells at higher tempertures.  Also at lower  temperatures, other growth regulators like auxin and  cytokinin are active, resulting in higher growth rates and  cellular dedifferentiation. These hypotheses are tested by  measuring the levels of ethylene produced by the cells at  different temperatures and by examining if exogeneously  added growth regulators such as abscisic acid interfere with  the aging process. The study leads to a better understanding  of why guard cells fail to senesce and the mechnisms that  induce and regulate senescence in plant cells.  ***",
