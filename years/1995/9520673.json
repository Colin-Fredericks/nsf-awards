 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520673    Within  populations,  there is often  wide  variation  among  individuals.   This  variation may be adaptive,  because  it  allows  different individuals to use subsets of the  habitat  to  which  they are functionally best suited.  This research  addresses  two  questions  regarding  individual  variation.  First,  do locomotor performance and body shape covary,  and  do  individuals  that differ in shape select  parts  of  the  habitat  in  which their performance is best?  Second,  what  are  the  relative  roles  of genetics  and  environment  in  shaping  individual  morphology?   The  model  system  is  a  population  of  fence lizards that utilize multiple  habitat  types and show significant differences in morphology between  individuals.  The research questions are addressed through a  series  of  descriptive and experimental studies.  Locomotor  performance on a variety of substrates will be measured, and  covariance between performance and shape variables  will  be  determined using multivariate statistics. Siblings  will  be  raised  in structurally different habitats, and in different  food  level  and  thermal  regime combinations  to  separate  genetic  and  environmental influences on  body  form.   The  research  will reveal the adaptive significance of variation  within  a  population, as well as the factors  that  produce  that variation.",
