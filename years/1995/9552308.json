 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates basic research training in psychology  with student involvement in multimedia projects that analyze  stress and coping research.   Basic psychology research training  involves courses in seven required and four elective courses.    Basic science issues addressed in these courses involve student  training in conducting and interpreting statistical analysis of  data, utilizing appropriate research designs, developing critical  analysis research skills, and developing capabilities to complete  independent and honors research in psychology.   Students  complete a graded series of increasingly advanced data analysis  and experimental design projects that fit into a competency  growth plan for training students in the scientific approach to  psychology.   Multimedia projects are located in one required  course (theories of personality) and four elective courses in  which students are involved in creating multimedia visualizations  of concepts related to stress, coping, and emotion.   This  project upgrades the computer lab to enhance capabilities in both  basic research and multimedia training.   This project allows  continued development of student projects that enables them to  visualize the interactions among behavioral, physiological, and  cognitive aspects of stress and coping.   Involvement of students  in multimedia projects attempts to build upon Chute's \"Classroom  2000\" model in which students directly experience and work with  course materials in a multimedia format to enhance active  learning.",
