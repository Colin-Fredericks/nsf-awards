 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422043  Iyer     This award is to purchase equipment to support the following two research projects: 1) Automatic Tools for Verification and Debugging of Concurrent Programs and Designs -- In order to deal with the state explosion phenomenon inherent in symbolic verification/analysis of concurrent programs and system designs, the first component of this project will involve the investigation of data flow and abstraction for concurrent systems.  Reachability based techniques will also be considered for specific properties such as deadlock, starvation and livelocks in concurrent programs.  Finally, better algorithms for explaining (to a system designer) the errors detected in a design will  be investigated; 2) Error Control in High-Speed Networking -- The use of conventional error detection in the face of transmission errors, and subsequent correction of the error, in high-speed networks can lead to rapid degradation of the network.  This project will investigate new error control algorithms, their implementation and a study of their performance characteristics.  A common characteristic of these two projects is that they involve algorithms which are computation, and memory, intensive.  ***",
