Detection systems developed, in part,  at the University of Denver, will be further developed and  investigated in terms of their ability to determine these fluxes.         Part 1.  Long-path UV (LPUV) spectroscopy will be coupled with  long-path IR (LPIR) spectroscopy and used to determine the fluxes  of various species.  Two new system approaches will be attempted.   Both make use of the fact that modern corner-cube based FTIR  systems have two input ports for light, and the system responds  intrinsically to the intensity difference between the two.  The  gradient method for flux measurement, which depends on the  measurement of small differences for its sensitivity, can make use  of this ability to directly measure species gradients.  Two light  beams from the same source will be designed to traverse the path at  two different altitudes to be combined in the FTIR for the  difference measurement.  Another configuration of the same system  will send the two beams around two sides of a suspected emission  source.  This should achieve automatic subtraction of all but  emissions from the suspect source.  The FTIR is available from  previous support, however, the telescopes, mirrors, software,  experimental protocols, etc. will be developed under this program.   The long-term goal is more reliable measurements of emission and  deposition of atmospheric species.         Part 2.  An available fast-response, in-situ, total sulfur  monitor will be optimized for response speed and sensitivity.  It  will be used for flux studies by means of the eddy-correlation  technique.  Some of the flux studies will be carried out in  collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research  (NCAR) Atmosphere Surface Turbulence Exchange Research (ASTER)  facility.         Part 3.  An atmospheric pressure, flow system, free radical  dete ctor has been developed and shown to respond to concentrations  of hydroperoxyl (HO2) and organic peroxyl (RO2) radicals.  This  apparatus, named PERCA (PEroxy Radical detector using Chemical  Amplification) has also been shown to respond to a number of  hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon peroxy radicals up to C8.   The research to be performed under this portion of the program is  to study interferences and to develop a portable calibration system  for preparing standards containing known concentrations of free  radicals.         Part 4.  The potential for atmospheric chlorine photochemistry  in oceanic regions has become the subject of an interesting  scientific controversy.  These researchers will develop a high-  sensitivity system that will detect atomic chlorine, thus  potentially detecting traces of halogen amines, which may be formed  if chlorine photochemistry is taking place.",
