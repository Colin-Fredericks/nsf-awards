 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scholfield    Forty years of theoretical research has produced a generally  accepted basic model of two-party electoral competition.  This  basic model is fundamentally premised on the overriding objective  that parties wish to win the election.  Given that the formal  structure of the model is understood, it is possible to examine  variants of the model through incorporating more sophisticated  behavior on the part of the electorate, or varying degrees of  competence on the part of candidate.  Most theories of pre-  election behavior in competitive elections have focussed on  \"policy-blind\" models where parties compete to maximize votes or  to maximize the expected number of seats.  Other models focus on  \"coalition risk\" that assume parties care about policy and form  specific coalitions based on policy agreements.  The proposed  research builds on the investigators previous work on an  equilibrium model of multiparty competition which incorporates  the beliefs of political parties concerning both electoral risk  and coalition risk.  This work  will refine the general electoral  risk-coalition risk model.  Two major questions will be examined:  (1) Do parties simply maximize the expected number of seats or do  their preferences incorporate variances in the electoral  response? and (2) Does the incorporation of policy concerns  provide a superior explanation of party declarations?    It is envisioned that this research, through using computer  simulation and econometric analysis in combination, will not only  advance understanding of democratic theory but also provide a  strong methodological tool that will suggest general techniques  for modelling two stage differentiable games.    ****",
