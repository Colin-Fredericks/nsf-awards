In particular, electronic systems with strong  interactions and topological fluids will be studied.  Topics  to be studied include Fermi and Bose systems with vector  gauge interactions which describe the Mott insulator, liquid  state of flux lines in superconductors, fractional quantum  Hall effect, and topological liquids.  The research will  focus on topological effects of the gauge field, the  character of the ground state of the gauged system,  toplogical instability, and fractionalization of the  spectrum as a result of a quantum phase transition.  %%%  A variety of physical systems will be investigated which are  of current interest.  All of these systems are characterized  by the fact that they are strongly interacting and cannot be  treated using existing theoretical techniques.  The  theoretical approach will be a mathematical one using field  theoretical techniques.  The results of this work will  contribute to both condensed matter physics and its  mathematical foundations.  ***",
