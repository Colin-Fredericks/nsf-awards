 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Anthony Marks, Mr. Staso Forenbaher will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological research in the Estremadura region of Portugal, the westernmost land of continental Europe. During the Chalcolithic (Copper Age), the Tejo estuary penetrated deep inland, effectively turning it into a peninsula over 100 km long and 50 km wide. The area thus forms a discrete archaeological region. Mr. Forenbaher will conduct two types of work. First he will excavate at the site of Casas de Baixo to collect a large systematic sample of lithic materials as well as contextual information and organic for radiocarbon dating. Excavation will be carried out in 1 m. sq. units and continue until an adequate lithic sample has been obtained. Secondly, Mr. Forenbaher will analyze lithic collections from a large number of Chalcolithic sites. These include quarries where raw materials were obtained and stone tools produced, small settlements, larger fortified settlements and human burials. Specimens will be measured and described both to establish artifact classes and to determine the degree of standardization within each. Raw materials will also be sourced to tie them to point of origin.  Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies emerged and it is clear that the Portuguese Chalcolithic sites represent an early stage in this process. Based on very carefully worked artifacts which appear in some graves, it is evident that social hierarchies had begun to appear during this time but the extent to which society generally was organized along such principles is uncertain. Through his research, Mr. Forenbaher will be able to determine how lithics functioned within the social system. He will examine the degree to which standardized products were manufactured and this will provide information on the extent of economic centralization. By tracing finished products to the raw material source he can reconstruct the extent and direction of trade networks and the degree of centralized control involved.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the origins of social complexity and assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
