 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development of an innovative air pollution control device for the destruction and removal of hazardous chemical compounds from industrial stack emissions. Currently, air pollution control technologies are limited either by cost per pound of pollutant destroyed (thermal oxidation) or by space requirements (catalytic oxidation). The proposed process will very efficiently oxidize hazardous air pollutants to such innocuous by-products as CO2, HCl, and H2O and other easily scrubbed compounds. These hazardous air pollutants will be oxidized by reaction with oxidative free radicals which are generated by the application of microwave radiation and formed in the stack. Radical injection techniques are a promising strategy for air pollution control and abatement. Phase I will entail the development of a novel concept: gas phase injection of a single oxidative chemical radical to completely oxidize halohydrocarbons which are present in the stack of an actual ground water pump and treat system. A full-scale process model will be constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the oxidative process. Experimental data currently available from the literature and chemical kinetics calculations show that chemical radical oxidation is a very effective technique for the complete oxidation of most hazardous air pollutants. Finally, this experiment will provide critical data such as radical lifetimes, reaction rates, and control efficiencies which can be used to design a variety of control systems.",
