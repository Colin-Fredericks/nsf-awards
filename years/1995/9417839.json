Carling, Department of Plant, Animal  and Soil Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, while  he is on sabbatical leave in Australia.  Dr. Carling will be  working in collaboration with Dr. Philip O'Brien of the  School of Biological and Environmental Science at Murdoch  University located in Perth, Western Australia. The research   will focus on the genetic and molecular characterization of  Rhizoctonia solani, a parasitic plant fungi.  R. solani is an  important pathogen among crop plants, yet little is known  about its genetics, pathogenicity characteristics, and molecular  biology.    R.solani is divided into a number of subspecific groups called  anastomosis groups (AG) based upon the ability of hyphae of  related isolates to interconnect.  Research will be conducted on  collections of R. solani AG-3 that are virulent on potato and  tobacco plants and on heterokaryotic and homokaryotic isolates of  AG-8 that are either virulent or avirulent on the roots of  potato and wheat plants.  Dr. O'Brien and his colleagues have  been studying the molecular biology of R. solani and have  perfected a technique of generating homokaryotic isolates with a  protoplast procedure used in studying mating and incompatibility  systems.  Dr. Carling and his group have been active in the  characterization of new anastomosis groupings.  The study  brings together the complementary skills of the two research  groups.  The research activity could ultimately lead to  increasing crop yields while using fewer chemical agents to  control disease.  The award is supported under the   U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.  ***",
