 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the investigation is to examine cultural influences on the development of  motivation to be responsive to the needs of others.  Three experimental studies will be undertaken  among samples of American and Hindu Indian adults and elementary- school aged children.  The first  study examines the development of  individuals' perceived reasons for being responsive to the needs of  their peers, with a focus on the structure of these reasons and on their relationship to individuals'  socio-emotional functioning.  The second study assesses whether the presence of role-related  interpersonal responsibilities reduces endogenous motivation for helping behavior and degrades its  quality.  The third study evaluates  the impact of normative expectations to render aid on intrinsic  motivation and on the quality of individual behavioral performance. The research is expected to  demonstrate that, reflecting their contrasting culturally based views of self,  Americans maintain a  less self-determined motivational orientation  toward interpersonal responsibilities than do Indians.  Thus, it is hypothesized that whereas among Americans, normative expectations to help others will lead  to the diminishing of endogenous forms of motivation and will be associated with less adaptive  behavioral functioning, they will not have such effects among Indians.  The research is also expected  to document respects in which the dominant psychological theories of internalization are culturally-  bound.  These theories link acting out of a perceived sense of obligation to feelings of pressure or  coercion.  However, such a linkage is hypothesized not to occur among Indians whom it is anticipated  do not perceive an antithetical relationship between self-determined forms of motivation and social  duty.  Finally, the project is anticipated to reveal that the direction of developmental change in  interpersonal motivation is culturally variable, with Americans developing a relatively exogenous view  of  interpersonal responsibilities and Hindu Indians retaining a relatively endogenous view.       The  investigation will contribute to an understanding of ways in which social development is affected by  the beliefs and values of the larger cultural context.  A series of experimental studies will be  undertaken contrasting the motivation to help others among adults and elementary school aged children  sampled from the United States and India.  Substantively, the research is expected to identify  respects in which the individualistic emphasis of American culture leads Americans to develop less  self-determined perspectives toward helping others than arise in cultures emphasizing more  collectivist conceptions.  It also will provide much needed data on ways  that the contrasting  culturally grounded motivational orientations that develop in the two cultural contexts affect  adaptation in school and friendship relationships.  Regarding developmental implications, the research  focus on the social perceptions and behavior of children from markedly different cultural backgrounds  will make it possible to identify both common and culture-specific aspects of child development.  Finally, on a theoretical level, the investigation will contribute to the refinement of existing  psychological models of motivation by identifying respects in which these models may reflect  culturally-specific assumptions and may need to be modified to account for interpersonal motivation in  more collectivist cultures.",
