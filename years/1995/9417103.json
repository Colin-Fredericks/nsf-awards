 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Bryan E. Kohler of the University of California at   Riverside will engage in a study of electric fields in organic solids   using the technique of hole burning spectroscopy.  Previous successes for   measuring and interpreting the effects of  external electric fields on   transition energies are the bases for the proposed research to map out   the internal electric fields at a molecular site in a molecular system.    Specifically, the effets of electric fields on linear polyene excitation   energy, and the effect of external pressure on the effect of electric   field on linear polyene excitation energy, will be determined for a   number of different guest-host systems where the geometry can be   calculated by standard molecular dynamics techniques.  More complex   systems will become available for investigation with the refinement of   the  interpretative model through a combination of measurement and   theoretical simulation.  Most theoretical models used for the   determination of internal electric fields assume the point dipole   approximation, which is found to be only qualitatively successful.  The   proposed investigations are designed to experimentally measure the fields   using polyene doped alkane crystals.   Much of our understanding of electronic structure of organic solid   solutions is derived from optical spectroscopy.  The amount of   unambiguous information that can be extracted from a given optical   spectrum is increased if the ensemble under investigation is made more   homogeneous.  This may be done by one of several methods of high   resolution site selective spectroscopy, e.g., hole burning spectroscopy.    With this technique resolution enhancements by a factor of up to one   hundred thousand have been achieved.  This in turn has allowed the   investigations of relaxation processes such as, for example, optical   dephasing, and spectral diffusion;  energy transfer in organic solids;   the characterization of photophysical processes in biological systems;   applications of organic polymers to optical data storage and holography;   and others.   The research to be conducted in this project will   contribute to a better understanding of optical processes in diverse   solid organic systems and may lead to improved materials used in optical   and electronic devices.",
