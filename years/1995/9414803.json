 "awd_abstract_narration": "*** 9414803 Barth West Chester University of Pennsylvania is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of research space on the second floor of the science center to create an interdisciplinary Material Research Center (MRC).  This project will enable six faculty members to consolidate and enhance the focus of their materials research and training activities.  Research is presently conducted in cramped locations dispersed throughout the Chemistry department.  Laboratories are  subjected to dust, flooding, and lack adequate temperature and humidity control, creating an unsafe working environment.  Utilities systems such as the HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection will be upgraded and installed to meet current codes.  Once renovations are completed, the MRC will consists of six faculty/student research laboratories surrounding two centrally located service laboratories that will contain spaces for instrumentation, sample preparation, thermal treatment, and glass blowing, and equipment fabrications.  The centralization of research activities, and the provision for shared spaces, will promote better interaction among faculty and students involved in materials research, and provide a more concerted interdisciplinary approach to the study of materials science.  Efficient and improved space will provide students with more research opportunities and will enhance the productivity of faculty.***",
