 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419660  Lawler   Evolutionary theory predicts that predators can cause evolutionary change in their prey and that predators may evolve in response to their prey. Such changes are thought to affect the population dynamics of both predators and prey. However, this important realm of evolutionary theory is practically untested because prolonged studies are required to observe evolution and population dynamics in most animals. This problem can be overcome by studying evolution in micro-organisms, which can evolve rapidly because their generation times are only 4-48 hours. It is crucial to discover whether evolution can alter population dynamics, to determine whether evolutionary processes need to be incorporated into population biology theory. Such knowledge may increase the ability of scientists to predict changes in population sizes.    In this project, protozoan predators and their prey will be grown in replicated laboratory  microcosms, where their population dynamics and other characteristics can be measured with comparative ease. The project consists of four sets of experiments, each on a different predator-prey pair. Prey will be grown for over 100 generations, in microcosms alone and with predators. A wide variety of predator and prey characters will be measured regularly during this time to quantify evolutionary changes. Population sizes will also be monitored. Subsequent experiments will measure the effect of evolution on predator-prey population dynamics. In these, predators from the first experiment will be grown with either of two types of prey: prey that have not coexisted with the predator for hundreds of generations, or prey that have. Differences in the population dynamics of the predator when grown on the two prey types will provide evidence that evolution affects population dynamics.    This research will clarify whether population biologists need to consider evolutionary processes when constructing predictive models of population dynamics, and may establish whether coevolution o ccurs in predator-prey pairs. The theory that this research will test is potentially important to some problems in applied ecology. For example, it is important to know whether pest species can rapidly evolve resistance to predators introduced for biological control.",
