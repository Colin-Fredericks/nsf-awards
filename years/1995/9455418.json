 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an innovative approach to teaching the freshman chemistry  laboratory, students are being exposed to a variety of chemical  principles in the context of biologically-relevant chemistry.  Large numbers of students taking freshman chemistry (upwards of  60%) are pursuing careers in the biological sciences and/or  medicine.  These students are being shown the relevance of  chemistry in understanding biological systems by engaging them in  authentic scientific inquiry.  The program is module-based, where  each module focuses on a specific question that the students must  answer about a biologically-relevant problem.  Each laboratory  module is designed as an in-depth study lasting three to four  weeks.  \"A guided-discovery method\" of teaching the course is  employed, and teamwork and decision-making are emphasized.  Computer pre-labs are used to ensure that the students are  confident in what they need to do when they enter the laboratory,  and interactive videos help them to grasp difficult concepts.  Novel computer based examinations are being developed and tested.  The topics of four of the modules include:  1) the chemistry of  the stomach; 2) skin cancer; 3) lead poisoning; and 4) blood  chemistry.  The fifth module is designed to expose the  undergraduate students to science teaching in the local primary  and secondary schools.  Each college student observes and  participates in a K-12 science classroom, reads articles in  science education journals, works with a science teacher in a  local school, designs and teaches a laboratory-based project for  the K-12 classroom, and participates in discussions and  evaluations about the science lesson that has been taught and the  conclusions that have been reached about the teaching and  learning of science.",
