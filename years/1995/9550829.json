 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Department of Mechanical Engineering is  developing a new mechanical engineering laboratory course that  emphasizes computer-based interfacing and control of thermo-  mechanical equipment.   The course includes a strong design  component and represents a significant improvement in the  curriculum.   A special module of the course is being designed  for ME faculty.   This module is also suitable as a continuing  education course for practicing ME engineers.   Students  participate in hands-on activities and learn both the theoretical  and the practical aspects of interfacing equipment with a  computer as well as mechanical design and control.   Some newly  purchased hardware is used for the experiments.   However,  students design and build their own hardware from design kits  that each receive.   This aspect of the course draws upon  students' past experience in design and includes the following  design considerations: project planning, concept generation and  evaluation, hardware design, and evaluation of the built assembly  in its control operation.  The controls aspect is based on the  use of an interface A/D board, a PC, and various thermomechanical  devices.   The students learn how to set up hardware and write  their own control programs in C.   Control aspects include  automated testing of a process or equipment; monitoring of  pressure, temperature, and shaft speed; warnings if setpoints are  exceeded; safety shutdown of equipment; and collection of data  and sequencing control.",
