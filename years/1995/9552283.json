This  collaborative effort involves four University units:  Departments  of Geography and Instructional Technology, Institute of Ecology,  and The State Botanical Garden.  Students will become active  participants in long-term ecological studies that require them to  test formal hypotheses based on data they collect in the field.   They will be assisted by a computerized geographic information  system (GIS) as they analyze and interpret results.  An interactive  multimedia program, which incorporates a performance support  system, will guide them through the field research and data  analysis.  The following goals are addressed by the project:   instruct students from a broad diversity of backgrounds and  interests in fundamental scientific concepts including the design  and testing of hypotheses; demonstrate the importance of spatial  and temporal variation in the study and understanding of natural  systems; strengthen geography skills and familiarize students with  the purpose and use of computerized geographic information systems;  create interest in scientific research and science education as  career opportunities.  Our immediate audience is the undergraduate  student population of the University of Georgia, where completion  of an environmental literacy course is a requirement for  graduation.  The project will be disseminated as a model that can  be  adapted for use at other institutions to increase environmental  literacy and expose undergraduates, including future teachers, to  new technologies that enhance the study and teaching of science.",
