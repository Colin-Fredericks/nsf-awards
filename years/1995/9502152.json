 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component involves case-based reasoning (CBR) a  technique  that  stores  and later applies  cases  of  known  problems  and their solutions to solve new problems.   Since  few  stored  cases  will exactly match a new  problem,  most  cases will be related at best by analogy to the new one.  In  that  case, it is necessary first to retrieve an appropriate  analogous   case,  check  to see that  it  matches  the  new  problem  in  some essential ways, then adapt it to  the  new  problem  in  such a way as to infer a solution.  In  storing  and  using  cases,  it is necessary to do some  abstraction,  either  at the time that they are stored away for later  use  or  at  the  time retrieved, to avoid having to store  large  numbers of very similar but slightly different cases.   This  project examines the advantages of developing a hierarchy of  abstraction  for  each  stored  case,  a  technique   called  \"stratified  CBR\".  The  stratified CBR  technique  will  be  applied  to  a  typical  search task (route  planning),  two  configuration   tasks  (artifact  design  and  goal-directed  activity   planning),   and  an   analytical   task   (legal  reasoning),   in   order  to  test  hypotheses   about   the  superiority  of  the stratified CBR technique  and  to  gain  experience in using the technique. During the period of  the  grant,  an  educational plan will be developed that  exposes  students to the insights, perspectives, and tools of  AI  by  (1)  educating undergraduates about AI's basic  methods  and  concepts and about AI's philosophical, social, and cognitive  consequences, and (2) educating graduate students  in  other  fields about the AI techniques and tools applicable to their  fields.",
