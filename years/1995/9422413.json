Using the new algebraic result that an inverse limit of  connected free Lie algebras is free, methods of rational homotopy  theory can be applied.  Deeper results seem to be obtainable using  the geometric methods of Pontrjagin and Thom.  Ravenel is studying  problems in stable homotopy theory related to the telescope  conjecture.  This appears to be the best approach to understanding  the stable homotopy groups of finite complexes, which is one of the  oldest problems in algebraic topology.       In more general terms, algebraic topology is the study of  geometric problems (often in more than 3 dimensions) in their  qualitative rather than quantitative aspects, classifying and  counting structures rather than measuring their sizes.  For example  an essential difference between a 2-dimensional plane and a  3-dimensional space is that removing a line separates the former  but not the latter into two separate pieces.  Topologists have  devised methods called homotopy and homology for keeping track of  such properties systematically in very complicated geometric  objects (objects than can arise, for example, as the spaces of  solutions to sytems of ordinary or differential equations).   Neisendorfer and Ravenel's research is concerned with refining and  extending these methods.  ***",
