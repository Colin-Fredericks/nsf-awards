 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are developing curriculum materials for a pattern-based  approach in introductory computer programming courses. Typical  programming instruction tends to focus on the language and has  students develop original and often poor solutions to problems.  Little time for quality feedback from instructional staff is  available. Additionally, current instruction shows little  connection between educational theory and practice.    A pattern-based curriculum for introductory computer science is  being developed and tested. Problem and code patterns are  identified and selected for inclusion in the course. Print-based  instructional materials is produced via a cycle of development,  evaluation, and revision. A prototype of an automated environment  that supports pattern-based instruction and provides supervision  for the higher level of student practice necessary for truly  successful instruction will be produced. Underlying principles  and theory for the approach are proposed and presented.    The proposed instructional material and system will provide a  solid test bed for further research and explication of standard  problems and programs in computing. The pattern-based approach  significantly improves the quality of programs produced by  students after a first course. While this project does not focus  on any special audience, the proposed approach to programming  instruction should ultimately enhance both attraction and  retention of students.    In addition to internal evaluation, two external reviewers will  assess the material twice during the project. Student performance  under the new approach will be tested and compared with that of  students under traditional instruction. Student and instructor  perceptions will be assessed. Descriptive papers will be produced  and submitted to appropriate (CS-Ed & AI) conferences and  Journals.",
