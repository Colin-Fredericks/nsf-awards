 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, funds are provided for the purchase of a  gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS).   The acquisition of  GC/MS capabilities greatly increases laboratory and research  experiences for undergraduates in the growing field of  environmental chemistry and science.   This instrument bolsters  the undergraduate course curriculum in environmental, analytical,  and organic chemistry and provides new research topics in  environmental chemistry for undergraduate students.  Students  benefitting from the strengthened environmental chemistry  curriculum gain new experiences in the following areas:  environmental sampling, sample preparation, fate and transport of  trace organic compounds in the environment, gas chromatography,  and mass spectrometry.   Students integrate laboratory skills  developed in prior courses into the analytical methodologies and  techniques required for environmental analysis.   Emphasis is on  development and testing of modern analytical techniques employing  GC/MS.  Class and research projects include sampling of on-site  monitoring wells for pesticide and herbicide contamination of  local groundwater resources, an evaluation of the persistence of  anthropogenic chlorinated organic compounds in the environment,  measurement of octanol-water partition coefficients of a variety  of compounds, and analysis of zebra mussels in Lake Erie for  bioaccumulation of trace organic compounds.   The hope is that  many nonmajors are attracted to these projects, particularly  biology, environmental sciences, and geosciences students.",
