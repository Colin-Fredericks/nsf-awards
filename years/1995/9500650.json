 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the research of Professor Tate on 1)  various refined conjectures on special values of L-functions,  such as Gross's conjectural refined class number formula and the  corresponding refinements of Stark's conjectures, 2) questions  about the fine structure of the Stark unit in a cyclic extension  of a real quadratic field, and 3) Sklyanin algebras of dimension  5.     This research lies in the general areas of number and arithmetic  geometry. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of  the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing  with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among  the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many  centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last  half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and communication systems. Arithmetic geometry combines two of  the oldest branches of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  The new insights arising out of this combination are producing  increasingly powerful tools to solve long-standing problems like  Fermat's Last Theorem, which have resisted the strongest efforts  of over three centuries of mathematicians. In addition, though  Arithmetic Geometry is sometimes regarded as among the purest of  pure mathematics, it has also been developing insightful new  techniques leading to dramatic progress in such applied areas as  error-correcting codes and cryptography.",
