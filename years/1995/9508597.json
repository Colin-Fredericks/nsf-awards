 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508597  Wolf       The Modern Analysis Group at the University of  California at Berkeley is composed of leading researchers in  most parts of modern analysis, including complex analysis,  knot theory, finite and infinite dimensional group theory,  topological vector spaces, quantum groups and mathematical  physics.  Because of the diversity and depth of this Group  there are unique opportunities for the training of graduate  students and for inter-action between graduate students,  young scientists, and established researchers. The Modern  Analysis Group has a history of close cooperation and  considerable success in such activities.       A comprehensive three-year program of support for  graduate students and postdoctoral visitors would enhance  the group's ability to conduct seminars, accelerate the  completion of individual Ph.D. programs, and contribute to  further interaction with young scientists near the beginning  of their most productive years.  This will make efficient  use of existing resources, and it will enhance the quality  of young scientists working in this rapidly growing area of  mathematics.  The resources of the Group Infrastructure  Grant would be used to support one half time postdoctoral  scholar and several of those graduate students at the most  productive segment of their doctoral training.",
