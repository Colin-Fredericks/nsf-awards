 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enhance the chemistry curriculum  by incorporating the theory and practice of FT-IR analysis in  organic chemistry courses.   Out-dated dispersive IR  spectrophotometers are lacking in the capabilities necessary to  perform the desired experiments and IR techniques.    Incorporating an FT-IR instrument will enhance the organic  chemistry curriculum by reinforcing lecture topics, upgrading  existing experiments, and introducing new experiments.   The  FT-IR is the MIDAC Prospect.   This state-of-the-art IR not only  allows rapid acquisition of spectra and improvements in spectra  quality, but also provides undergraduate students with the  opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the operations of this  instrument which is widely used in universities and industry.    Lectures include more discussion of FT-IR methods and their  applications.   Through this project, lecture topics are  reinforced by studying mechanistic details of reactions, such as  kinetics and intermediate formation.   Additionally, students  will gain experience in sample preparation, analyzing spectra,  fundamental operations of the instrument, and analysis techniques  such as spectral subtraction.   The use of Fourier transform  instruments makes this possible.   The FT-IR instrument makes  significant contributions to the chemistry education and helps  bring computer-controlled instrumentation to undergraduate  students.",
