 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research  in  this proposal addresses the nature  of  visual  problem-solving  and  its  impact on the  design  of  cooperative  systems  which  assist and enhance human performance  in  complex  task  environments.  The first objective of  the  project  is  to  extend  the  cognitive theory of perception  and  problem-solving  interactions, with an emphasis on specific visual problem-solving  tasks.   More extensive analysis of previously collected protocol  data  in  the field of diagnostic radiology will be carried  out,  and   additional   data  from  a  second  visual  problem-solving  application  such  as geographical information  systems  will  be  collected  and analyzed as well.  The results of this  work   are  expected to lead to an improved model of visual interaction,  and  a  more comprehensive theory of how people use visual information  to   solve problems.  The second objective of the project  is  to  apply  this  cognitive theory in the development  of  intelligent  interactive   systems   which   provide   assistance   to   human  decision-makers   in   tasks  such  as  medical   diagnosis   and  geographical   image  interpretation.   The   design    will   be  incorporated  into a number of working prototypes to  demonstrate  proof  of  concept as well as to provide practical platforms  for  testing  and evaluation of underlying cognitive principles.   The  entire research project will be carried out in the context  of  a  comprehensive   educational   program   which   emphasizes    the  development  of  visual  problem-solving aids  for  several  core  courses in a newly evolving computer science curriculum.",
