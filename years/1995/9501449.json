 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501449  Schneider  This is a career award for young  engineering investigators.The  object of this project is to  develop practical and economical  alternative details for the fully  welded and the partially-  constrained moment-resisting  connection.  Clearly, from the  observed performance of steel  connections during the Northridge  earthquake, it is essential to  provide ductility for the bottom  flange.  Therefore, this research  proposes several viable connection  alternatives to be investigated  analytically and experimentally.  Results from the one-year  Northridge research program will be  used to determine appropriate  prototype frames and appropriate  structural steel sizes for testing.    The primary focus of the research  is the experimental performance of  alternate details for steel beam-to  column connections.  A series of  large-to full-scale near-real-time  cyclic deformation tests will be  performed on tee-shaped beam-column  specimens using a 110 kip hydraulic  actuator to deform the tip of the  cantilevered beam.  Deformations  will be imposed at approximately  the same frequency as a beam-to  column joint might experience  during the seismic vibration of a  structural frame.  Also a series of  earthquake simulator tests will be  conducted to investigate true  dynamic behavior of the joints.    Results from this research will  have a great impact within the  earthquake engineering comity.  The  near-real time full-scale tests  will begin to resolve some of the  differences between joint damage  noted after the Northridge  earthquake and typical joint  performance observed in the  laboratory.  Connection  alternatives will be tested in an  effort to improve the ductility of  the connection, and relieve some of  the high stress concentrations  associated with the highly confined  region of the joint.  ***",
