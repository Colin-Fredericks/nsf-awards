 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9501033  PI: Ralston  Scattering theory for N-particle systems      The subject of the proposed research is scattering theory for N-particle   Schrodinger operators with constant magnetic fields. In contrast to the   case when no magnetic field is present (which is now well understood),   very little was previously known about it despite its mathematical and   physical significance. The main task will be to prove asymptotic   completeness for such operators, i.e., to give a complete classification   of all solutions of the corresponding time-dependent Schrodinger equation   according to their large-time asymptotic behaviour. Recently C. Gerard and   the author proved asymptotic completeness for N-body systems containing no   proper neutral subsystems (this class includes atoms and positive ions).   The aim of the proposed research is to extend these results to the case of   general N-body systems, including negative ions and molecules. The main   problem here will be to analyze the dispersive behaviour of the neutral   subsystems. Their dynamics depends on their internal structure and   therefore may be very unstable under perturbations. A deeper understanding   of the geometrical structures related to the magnetic field will also be   required.    This research deals with fundamental questions about how the structure   matter is affected by the presence of a magnetic field. Almost all of   the earlier results on this subject were obtained under the simplifying   assumption that the motion of the nuclei is negligible; mathematically,   this means studying an approximation where nuclei have infinite mass.   However, this simplified model is not always appropriate in physics,   especially since our research has shown that there are important   qualitative differences between the properties of this model and a more   realistic one with finite nuclear masses. Furthermore, although this   problem is of considerable interest in physics and astrophysics (for   example, strong magnetic fields are ex pected to exist on the surfaces   of neutron stars), no predictions could be made on the basis of  experiments. The reason for this is that the magnetic fields that can be   generated in the labolatories are not strong enough for their effect on   the systems in question to be detected. One thus has to rely on a   theoretical analysis of the problem.",
