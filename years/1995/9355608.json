Each of 24 teachers will be trained in a three  week workshop in applying polymer  chemistry in their classes as appropriate to grade level.  The first year will be 24 secondary  school teacher, the second summer 24 middle school teachers and the third summer 24  elementary school teachers.  During the second and third summers, 8 teachers from the previous  summers 24 will be selected to participate in a one week leadership workshop.  This workshop  will be held so that it coincides with the next group's workshop and so that there can be cross  grade level interaction.  During the academic year following each workshop the 24 participants  will also come together for an additional two day  weekend workshop. A very substantial  assessment and evaluation will be carried out using both qualitative and quantitative data.  The  total length of the project is for 42 months, spanning four summers beginning in 1994.  The   workshops will be held at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point.  The cost share of the  project amounts to 41% of the Foundation support.",
