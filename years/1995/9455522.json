The distinguishing  features are: (1) materials based on a strategic sequencing and the  associated level of mastery of key topics, (2) a topical coverage  carefully based on a spiral approach to information presentation,  (3) an integral use of structured labs as a necessary component,  (4) an emphasis on frequent feedback to facilitate learning and  evaluate the effectiveness of instruction, (5) remediation  materials for students requiring additional assistance to meet the  required levels of mastery ,(6) an early use of teams, (7) a  student surveying tool used to track all students to provide  outcome assessment, and (8) review and evaluation by multiple  institutions for iterative material refinement and national  dissemination. The project will be carefully evaluated by a team of  eight consultants with expertise in the fields of computing,  computing education and educational psychology. The materials  developed will also be critiqued by professionals at a wide variety  of other institutions for their input as to the applicability of  the materials to students at their institutions. The resulting  materials will be made available in hard copy and through  electronic media.",
