 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512308  Cadieu    A pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system and ancillary thin film  characterization  equipment will be acquired and used to  fabricate and examine magnetic and optical films. Three  research programs will make use of the PLD facility. One  program aims at developing metallic magnetic films that exhibit  highly specific textures and optimal magnetic properties. As  part of this effort, textured films of rare earth transition  metals and of ferrites will be fabricated and their magnetic  properties will be examined. A second program will utilize the  PLD facility to explore new approaches to photoinduced gradient  index formation, tailoring sol-gel glasses, and photodeposition  in microporous glass.  A third program evolves around the  structural and compositional characterization of the PLD-grown  films. In this effort, the defect and stacking fault densities  of the laser deposited magnetic films will be examined by  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their stoichiometry  will be probed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  %%%  Pulsed laser ablation allows for the deposition of a wide range  of dissimilar materials with exceptional intrinsic properties.  The pulsed layer deposition system will be utilized to  synthesize new types of super magnet systems that are important  for microwave device development. It will also be utilized for  photodeposition and photopatterning processing with  applications in optical waveguides and diffractive optics. The  instrumentation will benefit  researchers from several  departments in a predominantly undergraduate institution.  ***",
