 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Kollman, School of Pharmacy, University of California San Francisco   is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry   Program to continue his research in the development of analytical   potential functions for non-covalent interactions.    This research is   directed at developing and refining molecular mechanical models that   accurately describe both the conformational equilibria and intermolecular   interaction energies between molecules in molecular simulation   calculations.  New models for the electrostatic, van der Waals and   non-additive energies will be assessed, making extensive use of accurate   ab initio calculations to provide calibration.  The models will be tested   on condensed phase systems to enable comparison with experimental   energies and structures.  Applications of these models will be made to   problems in molecular recognition.  Kollman will attempt to determine,   through free energy perturbation theory, binding constants for ionic   binding to spherands, velcraplexes, carcerands, and to the adenine   receptor.  In recent years computer simulations have provided valuable insights into   the detailed molecular dynamics of complex organic and biomolecular   systems such as proteins.   The quality of these simulations depend   critically on the quality of the model potential functions used.  A great   deal of effort has been expended in developing more sophisticated   analytical numerical models for the interaction energies between   molecules.   Kollman's research is directed at improving the quality of   these molecular mechanics model potential functions used for performing   simulations of complex organic and biomolecular systems.",
