 "awd_abstract_narration": "The starting point for this research is a fundamental problem  in  fault-tolerant distributed computing:  reaching agreement among  processes  in a system that is subject to failures.  It is well-known that this problem,  called Consensus, has no deterministic  solution in asynchronous systems, even  if it is assumed that  communication is reliable and no more than one process may  fail.  The impossibility of solving Consensus ( and other related  problems such  as Atomic Broadcast) is one of the most severe  obstacles to implementing  fault-tolerant applications in  asynchronous systems.    In recent work the PI  has introduced a novel approach to  circumvent such impossibility results:  he  showed that unreliable  failure detectors can be used to solve Consensus (and  Atomic  Broadcast), even if the information that they provide about  failures is  highly inaccurate, e.g., even if they make an  infinite number of mistakes.  Since such failure detectors can be  implemented in realistic distributed  systems, and since various  considerations make the asynchronous models  especially  attractive, this work suggests an approach to fault-tolerance  that  is viable in practice.    The objectives of this research are to broaden the  applicability  of this approach by removing the limitations of the earlier work,  and to explore in more concrete terms its practicability.  Specific goals  include:  (1) tolerating communication failures,  including network partitions (the  earlier work assumed reliable  links);   (2) tolerating process failures of various  types (the earlier  work dealt with crash failures only);   (3) considering shared-memory  systems (the earlier work dealt with   message-passing systems); and (4) solving other problems that are   central to fault-tolerant  distributed  computing, including Group Membership and Group  Multicasts (the earlier work  solved Consensus and Atomic  Broadcast).  In order to assess the cost and  benefit of using  unreliable failure detectors complexity questions are also  explored.  Finally, the practicality of this approach is validated by  implementation on an experimental platform.",
