When students begin undergraduate research  projects, industrial co-ops, and jobs, many are ill-prepared to  construct, select, adapt, and use scientific equipment.  This  project introduces a series of self-contained course modules in  practical methods that will come after the first year of college  laboratory courses.  Six foundation modules form a one year course:   (1.) materials, mechanisms & machining; (2.) basic electronic  circuits & measurements; (3.) signals & electronics for signal  conditioning; (4.) computer-assisted experimentation; (5.)  introduction to metrology & transducers; and (6.) optical systems.   Upper division elective modules are: (7.) vacuum systems & surface  technologies; (8.) feedback control; and (9.) lasers &  optoelectronics.  In five weeks, each module will cover a small  number of the most basic methods and technologies of a topic.   There will be 90 minutes of discussion, lecture, and demonstration  and four hours of lab per week.  Students will document their  practical experience through individual portfolios of their  projects.  The modular form of this course material makes it  readily adaptable to other colleges, where further topics can be  developed in the same format.  Student lab manuals, exercises,  suggested projects, lecture transparencies, demonstrations,  software, designs, and parts lists will be available and  continuously updated over the Internet.",
