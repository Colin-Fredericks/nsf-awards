 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the College of Human Biology at the  university is developing a progressive approach to teaching the  Human Anatomy component of the curriculum.   This approach  involves the use of contemporary multimedia technology with  traditional cadaver dissections.   The increase in the number of  students entering Allied Heath and Health Science professions has  increased the demand for these courses.   The advancements  provide students with hands-on training through cadaver  dissections complemented with state-of-the-art computer  simulations in the areas of gross and microscopic anatomy.   The  requested equipment allows for major improvements in those  courses where human anatomy is a significant portion of the  subject matter:  Kinesiology, Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates,  Anatomy and Physiology, and Microscopic Anatomy (which is offered  as an Independent Study).   The requested equipment also allows  for the development of a new course, Advanced Human Anatomy.    These improvements enhance student learning by increasing  involvement, interaction, and interest with the material.    Students also benefit from the hands-on and technological  experiences that are critical for success in the Allied Health  and Health Science professions.",
