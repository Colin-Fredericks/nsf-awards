The principal investigator is a  young scientist who has chosen to pursue the challenging course of interdisciplinary research.          The research portion of Dr. Foley's project is focused on improving understanding of  global environmental systems, particularly the interface between the living biosphere and the  physical climate system.  Climate is of paramount importance to both natural and managed  ecosystems;  conversely, the terrestrial ecosystems significantly influence the exchange of  moisture, momentum, and energy at the land surface-atmosphere interface, affecting climate.   To properly investigate the dynamics of these interactions and to evaluate the potential impacts  of climate change on the system require the use of models which capture the key elements of  the physical and biological processes involved.  Dr. Foley seeks to improve the representation  of biophysical and biogeochemical processes in global and continental-scale ecosystem models.   This will be done by constructing an integrated biosphere investigation model composed of four  sub-models to handle surface fluxes, vegetation cover, nutrient cycling and hydrologic processes.         The educational portion of his project involves the development of new interdisciplinary  instructional materials and interdisciplinary courses for the undergraduate level.         The support for this award is shared by three divisions - Environmental Biology, Earth,  and Atmospheric Sciences as part of the Water and Energy:  Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth  Interactions (WEAVE) Program under Global Change.",
