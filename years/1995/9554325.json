 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matray  95-54325    The Monterey Bay Regional Education Futures (MBReEF) Consortium is a broad based collaboration of scientific research organizations, education, and government agencies, libraries, museums, and business/industry partners working to develop a collaborative educational networking infrastructure, Monterey BayNet, that would build a sustainable base and serve as a national model for the application of telecommunications technology to science education. It is designed to initiate collaborative efforts to a) integrate high speed data communications access (ATM, ISDN, and Frame Relay) and computer technologies, b) identify and make accessible relevant 'real world' data sources, e) develop interactive electronic field trips by student/client groups, educators, and scientific research communities in various ecosystems, and d) ultimately design access to these trips and their relevant datasets residing in a regional environmental electronic library.    Teams of scientists, educators, and students design initial electronic field trips around four exemplars: the Virtual Canyon Project with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the Watershed Project with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, the Virtual Telescope Project with the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy (MIRA), and Building Bridges on the Super Highway with Cabrillo College. These trips will utilize voice, video, and data originating at participating science research agencies, museums, and/or aquaria. In addition, real-time video and data will be provided from the bottom of the Monterey Bay Canyon via MBARI's undersea Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), from the watershed field sites, and 'from Andromeda' via MIRA's virtual telescope. As other participants take these trips, they can, in turn, create yet another level of electronic field trips for yet another group of peers based upon their experience, questions, and interactions. The  process, outcomes and ultimate curriculum products of each field trip created and taken become new input for a regional electronic environmental library. New trips, utilizing existing and new, successive inputs are then created and embarked upon in such a way that the entire information system is recursive and ever changing.    Access to the ultimate field trip utilizing such an infrastructure will result in:      improved quality and effectiveness of instruction and learning in the areas of regional/global marine and environmental studies and astronomy;    the use of data communications to increase access to informational, instructional, and technological resources (voice, video and data);    models for integrating cost-effective telecommunications networking into the science curriculum;    a migration model to allow schools and/or agencies to move from one communications service tier to the next as their needs and applications change;    definitions of the role of voice, video, and data communications in teacher training;    models for product and service dissemination, collaboration between diverse agencies. and military base conversion towards educational use.",
