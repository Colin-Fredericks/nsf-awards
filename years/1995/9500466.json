 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500466 Friedlander   Recent results of Friedlander and  Vishik give a sufficient condition  for linear instability of a  steady Euler flow. It is proposed to extend  this work in several  directions. Friedlander is showing that for  classes of PDE,  including the Euler equations, linear instability under  certain  spectral conditions implies nonlinear instability. Using the   theory of oscillatory integrals it is proposed to extend the  instability  criteria to the more complicated system of  magnetohydrodynamics.  Another line of research is the study of  the completeness of a system  of Floquet root vectors for time  periodic problems of fluid dynamics.  Aspects of this work will  be undertaken in collaboration with M.M.  Vishik, W. Strauss and  V.I. Yudovich.   The question of stability/instability of fluid  motion is a classical  problem that has received much attention  in the past 100 years. It is  fundamental to studies in  meteorology, oceanography, geophysics,  astrophysics and plasma  physics where physical phenomena are  governed by the underlying  fluid instabilities. Despite its long  history, a number of  important questions remain open. It is proposed  to increase our  understanding of the fundamental behaviour of fluids  by studying  the mathematical partial differential equations that  describe  fluid flow .",
