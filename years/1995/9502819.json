 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continued study of certain invariants,  known as local Chern characters, defined for modules over  Noetherian rings.  While numerous properties of these invariants  have recently been discovered, there are still many open  questions.  The main line of study concerns invariants defined by  matrices in a free resolution of a module over a local ring,  where relations between these invariants and classical results in  commutative algebra have led to new interpretations of them,  which, although they are still conjectural in many cases, give  much easier methods for their computation.  Another line of  research concerns the details of the construction itself, and  gives alternative definitions for intersection multiplicities,  leading, among other things, to a new approach to Serre's  positivity conjecture.    This research is concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach  problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.",
