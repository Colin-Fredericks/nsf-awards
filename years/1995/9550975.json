 "awd_abstract_narration": "A project-focused laboratory curriculum in Organic Chemistry and  Biochemistry is being developed to enhance the creation of an  interesting and pragmatic pedagogical interface between two  traditional disciplines.   In the search for commonality, this  hybridized approach to a problem also brings forth needed  relevance to the curriculum.   It gives students the opportunity  to work in teams; to design their own unique procedures for  synthesis, isolation, and characterization of bioactive  molecules; and to examine their reactivities and activities.    This approach enhances discourse and subsequent learning as well  as fosters mutual understanding.   Exposure to modern techniques  as well as state of the art equipment certainly widens student  horizons and improves the employment prospects of those students  who wish to stop at the B.S.  level.   In Organic Chemistry, it  presents a more cutting-edge technique to approximately 30  percent of the sophomore class, each year, who will have the  opportunity to indulge in chemical and enzyme kinetics with  state-of-the-art UV spectrophotometers and use computational  software to assess their results.   In Biochemistry, students  utilize both low-pressure and high-performance liquid  chromatography, as well as spectroscopic studies, to focus their  new structural perspective on the isolation and biophysical  characterization of enzymes, which are the target of therapeutic  agents and metabolic regulation.",
