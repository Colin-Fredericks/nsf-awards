 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520804  Cheng  This project deals with a fundamental  problem which often arises in  intelligent engineering aimed at optimum  design of buildings and civil  infrastructure systems where multiple  variables and loading conditions are  involved. Optimum design means, among  other things, to maximize service life,  safety and functionality while  minimizing material use, labor,  maintenance,etc.    A critical step and requirement in the  process of multi-objective optimal  design is a computational algorithm  which could give consistent, stable  solutions to the complex optimization  formulation. In this project, an  innovative optimization technique,  namely, a genetic algorithm will be  developed for civil structural  applications under seismic condition.  This algorithm is based on the Darwinian  survival-of-the-fittest strategy by  eliminating unfit characteristics and  using random exchange through  reproduction, recombination (cross  over), and mutation.  Emphasis is placed  on formulation of n-parent uniform cross-  over operator and parallelization to  achieve an emerging computing technique  for both global and robust optimum  solutions.  Other research efforts also  undertaken as a part of this research  include structural modeling of building  systems with mixed construction  materials, formulation of multi-  objective functions and constraints for  building structures, development od  optimum based design criteria for static  and earthquake load with/without control  systems, and assessment and improvement  of current optimum design algorithms.  ***",
