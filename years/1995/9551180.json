 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is establishing a Cooperative Multimedia Computing  Laboratory to support undergraduate education in the Department  of Computer Science.   The laboratory is using state-of-the-art  equipment to create a new multimedia curriculum based on three  courses:  Software Engineering, Computer Graphics, and Computer  Networks.   Laboratory assignments are being designed to allow  students to gain experience with large-scale, real-world  applications involving multimedia software, multimedia  interfaces, and multimedia communication.   Initial laboratory  sets are being drawn from environmental science,  computer-assisted medicine, and automated manufacturing.  The  faculty involved in the establishment of the proposed laboratory  have extensive experience in these application areas and in  developing laboratory exercises that expose students to new  technologies and computing methods.  The Department of Computer  Science, the College of Engineering, and the university are very  committed to this project.   Funds have already been allocated  for a preliminary, small-scale version of the laboratory, summer  salaries and course reductions for the three principal  investigators, laboratory space, supporting personnel, and  long-term maintenance of the equipment.",
