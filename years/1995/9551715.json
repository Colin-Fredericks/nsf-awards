 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a Micropropagation Laboratory for  training future horticulture technicians.   As micropropagation  is an asexual method of producing large quantities of genetically  identical plants, the lab is a practical application of the  concept of Toti potency (i.e., each somatic plant cell contains  all necessary information to create an entire new plant).   It is  technologically intensive, and until recently was not practical  on a large/commercial scale.   Current advances are allowing the  process to see ever-greater use in the horticulture industry.    Yet the supply of technicians trained in this technique is not  adequate for the industry's demand.   A curriculum providing  systematic training in techniques currently used by industry is  being developed to help introduce new innovations from research  institutions.   Providing such a curriculum is an innovation for  the industry.   Micropropagation requires a sterile and carefully  controlled environment.   Students must learn the more rigorous  demands of working with plants in such an environment.   This  project provides the equipment needed to train horticulture  students in the micropropagation of a selected assortment of  herbaceous and woody plants.   The requested laboratory equipment  also serves as the foundation of an expanded horticulture  curriculum, offering an option concentrating on micropropagation  techniques.",
