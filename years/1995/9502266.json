 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502266     Silber          This work is supported by a National Science Foundation     Faculty Early      Career Development Award.  The research component will focus     on the      further development of mathematical methods of equivariant     dynamical      systems for application to specific physical problems.      These include      hydrodynamic models of rotating convection and of     magnetoconvection,      models of Josephson junction arrays, and models applicable     to combustion      or solidification problems in various two- and three-    dimensional      geometries.  In each case, the focus is on instabilities for     which there is      clear evidence that symmetry plays a central role.  An     essential component      of the proposed research is to compare theoretical results,     based on model-     independent group theoretic/dynamical systems methods, with     those      obtained by direct numerical simulation of the governing     differential      equations.  The education component will include course     development in      applied dynamical systems at the undergraduate level,     curriculum      development at the graduate level, graduate student     advising, mentoring,      and organizing graduate seminars.          The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the     early      development of academic faculty as both educators and     researchers.  The      Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a     Foundation-     wide  program that provides for the support of junior     faculty within the      context of their overall career development.  It combines in     a single      program the support of quality research and education in the     broadest sense      and the full participation of those traditionally     underrepresented in science      and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the     importance      the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced     academic      careers which include both research and education.",
