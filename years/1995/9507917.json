 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507917  Basu    This project focuses on a continuing puzzle in macroeconomics:  why is aggregate productivity procyclical?  Initially interpreted as unobserved changes in utilization, this stylized fact has been reinterpreted as an indication of large changes in production technology and, more recently, as evidence of large increasing returns to scale in production.  This project explores an explanation based on composition effects: the idea that inputs may consistently move, in cyclcial fashion, from less- to more-productive uses.  For example, industries with higher returns to scale (e.g. durables) also account for a larger fraction of input growth in booms.  A numerical example shows that composition effects can lead to a large overestimate of the degree of returns to scale and a severe overstatement of the importance of technology shocks.  A preliminary application of these ideas to U.S. manufacturing data shows they are quantitatively significant: correcting for compostiion bias reduces the correlation between output and technology shocks by one-half, and the estimate of increasing returns by two-thirds.  These preliminary results indicate that neither large technology shocks nor large firm-level returns to scale are plausible building blocks of business cycle theory.  The project conducts more empirical work to document the full magnitude of compostiion effects; analyzes the link between aggregate productivity and welfare; studies how composition effects may arise naturally in a purely neoclassical model with multiple sectors and quasi-fixed inputs, since quasi-fixity naturally creates divergences between marginal products of inputs across sectors; and models composition effects within the context of endogenous-fluctuation models.  The education plan has four components: course development for intermediate macroeconomics that emphasizes giving students practice in evaluating policy debates; written handouts for graduate macroeconomics that better prepare students for future research; prog ram development to smooth the transition from graduate coursework to disertation research; and the development of a plan to increase minority student retention in the graduate program.    ??",
