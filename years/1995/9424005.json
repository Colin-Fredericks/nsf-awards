The  Principal Investigator, who is from Bartol Research Institute, has  reached an agreement with the NRC which will allow him to run them  and probably eventually obtain ownership.  This award gives time  for the arrangements for transfer to occur as well as to determine  the relative priority of various such facilities.  These  instruments, along with other high latitude monitors, are  especially important contributors to cosmic ray studies because  their fields of view are well defined and also because they are  much more sensitive to low energy cosmic rays, compared to mid-  latitude monitors.  ***",
