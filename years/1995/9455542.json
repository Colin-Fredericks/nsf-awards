 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project takes advantage of recent developments in multimedia  computer technology to create an integrated set of computer-aided  learning (CAL) modules to teach fundamental concepts of geology in  general education courses.  The software consists of  graphics-intensive, interactive multimedia modules that will  include animation, video, sound, and hypertext linking across  topics.  Module topics include global geology, plate tectonics,  geologic time, Earth interior, Earth materials, global cycles,  human influences, and evolution of the Earth.  Questions throughout  the material provide immediate feedback to the students and guide  their progress.  Quizzes after each section assess concept  attainment and provide automated scoring for assessment of student  progress and effectiveness of the instructional media.  The new  modules build on the success of an award-winning pilot module  developed by the PI, and are guided by student evaluations  collected throughout the development and assessment phases.  The  initial target audience will be students in two large general  education courses for non-science majors (>60% freshmen-sophomores,  ~10% education majors) taught by the PI (History of Life) and the  Co-PI (Planet Earth).  The modules have broad applicability to any  introductory geology general education course, and will be  published, widely advertised, and disseminated nationally to  universities, colleges, junior colleges, and high schools.   Extensive use of the modules in the preparation of elementary and  secondary teachers is planned.",
