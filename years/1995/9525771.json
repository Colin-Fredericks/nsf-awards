Organizers are Dr. David R. Marx, University  of Nebraska, Lincoln, and  Dr. Jorge Martinez, Universidad  Nacional de Colombia, Bogota.   This is a joint meeting of  three organizations: the Colombian National University, the  International Biometric Society for the Caribbean, Central  America, Colombia and Venezuela, and the Interamerican  Statistical Institute, with headquarters in Panama City,  Panama.   The conference's objectives will be to bring  together statisticians and biologists  from the Caribbean,  Central America, Colombia and Venezuela  to promote  scientific exchanges,  delimit common research areas, and to  stimulate relationships between universities and research  institutions in Latin America.    Applications of statistics to censuses and social sciences  are commonly used throughout Latin America.  Biometrical and  environmental applications are less well known.   The  existing serious environmental problems in the region call  for such applications and require well-designed  studies.  It is important for statisticians and mathematicians to work  jointly with biologists in developing statistical techniques  to solve these serious problems.  This meeting is designed  to bring these various groups together.      ***",
