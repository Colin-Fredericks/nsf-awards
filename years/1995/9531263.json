In recognition of this, MIT is planning to host a symposium on CHI issues, designed to be both a retrospective of the field, and a view toward the future of this field.  One aspect of this symposium will be a celebration of Vannevar Bush's landmark paper \"As We May Think,\" which 50 years ago foresaw a whole sequence of modern developments, including modern computer interfaces, hypermedia, laser printers, networking, knowledge repositories, and so on.  It is interesting to ask what factors lead to the success of \"far out\" ideas like these, and the complete failure of others whih seemed equally plausible at the time.  The other aspect of this symposium is a focus on the future; where will today's technologies lead, what can be said about the future of CHI research?  A distinguished set of speakers from the computer science and engineering communities will offer their views on the future of CHI, and on the most fruitful directions for future research.",
