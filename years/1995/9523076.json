The conference provides a forum for bridging basic and applied aspects in a variety of materials ranging from composites and nano-materials to amorphous and liquid semiconductors.   About 300 participants from academic, industrial and government laboratories are expected. The Conference takes place in Chicago, Illinois, from August 27  to September 1, 1995.  The conference highlights advances in liquid and  amorphous  metals,  encompassing noncrystalline semiconductors and molten salts and the conference  proceeding  will be  published.  The following topics will be covered in the conference:   liquid and amorphous metals and alloys; metal-nonmetal transitions; liquid and disordered semiconductors; clusters; composite materials; quasicrystals; metal/molten salt mixtures.  Atomic structure determined by x-ray, neutron and electron diffraction; dynamics, electrical transport and electronic, magnetic, optical and thermodynamic properties, are addressed, including theoretical and computational as well as experimental approaches.  Results  obtained from new techniques, taking full advantage of recently commissioned synchrotrons, pulsed neutron sources and high-flux reactors to explore domains and properties previously not accessible, are emphasized.   %%% Highlighted topics include new  structural materials and applications in energy conversion, electronics, optics/electro-optics, and waste storage. ***",
