 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Roanoke River Valley Consortium which consist of five  predominately minority school systems located in rural poverty-  stricken Northern North Carolina in partnership with North Carolina  Central University (HBCU) proposes to offer a comprehensive camp  program.  The goals are to create a cohort of students (150 eight  grade African Americans over three years) and provide them a  foundation for lifelong interest in science and mathematics and to  encourage them to consider Science/Mathematics/Engineering/  Technology (SMET) as possible career choices.  The strategies to be  employed consist of a four week residential camp and an innovative  academic year follow-up program.  The residential camp will focus  on: the physical science discipline infused with mathematics and  integrated with life and earth science; career exploration and  experiments in science laboratory with computer application.  Field  trips will reinforce classroom and lab work.  Innovative academic  year follow-up activities will consist of multi-year activities for  parents for their support and to increase students' confidence in  their academic abilities; camp-in field trip at North Carolina Life  and Science Museum; after school monthly meetings with master  teacher for career counseling and ongoing research; a series of six  Saturday Seminars with the mentor/assistant and master teacher  throughout the year for academic follow-up and assistance with  research; a mentorship program for \"mentee\" shadowing in the  workplace; the publication of biannual newsletter; and, the  establishment of R2VCS2C alumni group for continued career  counseling and involvement.  The significance of implementing  R2VCS2C will show students' increase in: the science and  mathematics \"pipeline\" of well-prepared minority high school  graduates continuation in school; choosing to study more math and  science; academic performance in the sciences and mathematics; and,  an increase in the \"pool\" of potential scientists and  mathematicians for th e workforce.  ***",
