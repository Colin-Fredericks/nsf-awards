The research has the goal to generate fundamental scientific and engineering understanding of low cost, low damage abrasive micro-machining for ceramics.  The aim is to conduct studies to improve the speed and efficiency of the abrasive micro-machining process and to increase the quality of the surface.  Well characterized high-tech ceramic materials are being subjected to grinding using several techniques.  The effects of maching characteristics, such as energy input and grinding rate are being determined.  The effects of grinding on the mechanical properties of the ceramics are being determined.  The effects of the grinding on the surface of the ceramic are being measured using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, laser Raman, fractography, and field emission scanning electron microscopy.",
