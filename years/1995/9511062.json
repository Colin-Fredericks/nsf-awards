 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: IBN-9511062  Principal Investigator:  Ramaswami, Mani    The brain is composed of over a billion individual nerve cells  connected to one another at complex structures called synapses.   Each cell receives input from a multitude of other cells in the  brain and may respond by signaling to the cells that receive its  outputs.  All complex behavior owes itself to signaling by  individual nerve cells and the reception of these signals by other  nerve and muscle cells.  The basic mechanism of signaling by nerve  cells is similar in all species.  It involves the release of  packets of neurotransmitter molecules by the nerve cell.  Because  the total number of packets available at any time to the nerve cell  is very limited, they need to be rapidly replenished for sustained  neural function.  A model is available which contains a genetic  defect in a protein called dynamin which iq unable to replenish  these packets.  Dynamin is highly conserved across species.  Dr.  Ramaswami will examine the role of dynamin in neuromuscular  communication using specialized genetic methods available, and by  novel microscopic techniques.  In this model synapses will be  altered in a controlled way using modern genetic techniques and  behavioral indices will be monitored.  In addition, using  microscopic methods, the localization of dynamin will be  investigated and how it is involved in normal neuronal function.   Examination of the role of dynamin at the neuromuscular junction is  a fundamental issue that will reveal unique information about  synapse function.  There is also great relevance of these studies  to understanding neuromuscular disorders associated with aberrant  signaling between cells.",
