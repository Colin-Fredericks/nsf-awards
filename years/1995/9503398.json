Carl Jockusch will work in computability theory (recursion theory)   and its connections with other areas.  In particular, he will   study degrees of unsolvability, both in their own right and  in connection with effective combinatorics, group theory, and   algebra.  L. van den Dries will investigate expansions of the   real field by quasi-analytic classes of functions that are   familiar from analysis.  The goal is to prove o-minimality and   polynomial boundedness of such expansions.  This is part of an   effort to create a framework for solving Hilbert's 16th problem   on limit cycles and similar problems.       Mathematical logic provides a precise framework for mathematical  assertions and deductive systems.  It also provides a precise concept of   computability by abstract computers, i.e. ones without limitations of   running time or memory space.  Jockusch will study the theory of  computability and its connections with other branches of mathematics.  Theoretical limitations on what can be computed and the possibility of  computing information given access to other information are of central  interest for this research.  In particular, he will analyze questions  related to computability in algebra and number theory.  Lou van den Dries  will work in analytic geometry, using tools from mathematical logic,  especially model theory.  These investigations are expected to shed new  light on questions about analytic vector fields.  Information gained in  current research on real numbers is presently being applied to many areas,  including robotics and neural networks.  ***",
