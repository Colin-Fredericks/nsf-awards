The  first area of research involves understanding the nature of helium  3 when it is in the form of films whose thickness is less than the  superfluid coherence length.  The Principals Investigators will  determine if these films will exhibit superfluidity when deposited  on helium 4 covered substrates.  The initial thrust of the program  is to develop tools to study surface waves on the film, so called  third sound.  These waves will be used as a probe of the films  properties.  The second area of activity will develop helium 3 dc  Josephson junctions.  These weak link structures should exhibit a  nonlinear current pressure characteristic.  These devices may  permit the detection of macroscopic quantum interference analogous  to the effects seen in dc superconducting quantum interference  devices.    % % %    The rare isotope helium 3 forms a superfluid state at temperatures  below 0.002 K.  The Principal Investigators will determine if very  thin films of this materials will continue to exhibit superfluid  properties as the thickness of the sample is made progressively  smaller.  To answer this question we will develop techniques  capable of detecting surface thickness waves.  These acoustical  techniques will provide insight into the properties of thin films.   The properties of the superfluid when it flows through very small  apertures will also be studied.  It is believed that the fluid  passing through submicron apertures will exhibit peculiar behavior  which may lead to the development of very sensitive superfluid  gyroscopes.  ***",
