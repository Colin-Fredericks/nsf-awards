 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds the purchase of state-of-the-art equipment for  archaeological field surveying.   The equipment is the type  referred to as a total station, which enhances considerably the  rate at which field data can be generated and recorded.   A  visual orientation replaces a plumb-bob, and an infrared beam  measures distance, features that both speed information retrieval  and improve accuracy.   Auxiliary equipment includes prisms for  the proper control of the infrared beam, a data collector for  temporary storage of information, and sundry poles and tripods  for field use of the major equipment.   The immediate need for  such equipment stems from field research in Chile, in which a  large data base is generated rapidly in surveying a dispersed and  segmented irrigation system.   Undergraduate students  participating in a field school in Chile are well served by the  new equipment since they can train on up-to-date technology and  can accomplish the task without data saturation.   In an  undergraduate science/social science environment, the equipment  can continue in use for future editions of the same or other  field schools in archaeology and can also be used by faculty and  students of the Geology Department.",
