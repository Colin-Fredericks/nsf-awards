 "awd_abstract_narration": "Santa Fe Community College, in Gainesville, Florida, in the rural  north central part of our state, will provide an intensive four  week Summer Science and Mathematics Camp (SSMC) and follow-up  activities during the academic year for 60 seventh grade African-  American students from the School Board of Alachua County School  District.  Students are expected to continue through ninth grade.    the goal of SSMC is to provide academic enrichment and career  exploration experiences to stimulate interest in science,  mathematics, engineering and related areas.  Students are actively  involved in doing experiments using the variables, length, area,  volume, mass, density, velocity, acceleration and force, and  probability and statistics.  Experiments provide problem solving to  facilitate understanding of the relationship between two variables,  functions and graphs, proportional reasoning, non-linear  relationships, measures of central tendency, and probability of the  occurrence of events.  Students are required to write about the  process and results of each experiment.  Additionally, students  develop four-year individual career plans to facilitate learning to  articulate career goals and choose educational paths to accomplish  these goals.  ***",
