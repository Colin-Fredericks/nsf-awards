 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424317  Kwei  The primary objective of the research is to elucidate the  influence of substituent groups on the solubility, gelation,  formation of staaked layer structure, side-chain  crystallization, and miscibility of rigid polymers.  Side  chain substitution of rigid polymers to improve solubility  is now a well-established strategy.  Past work on sulfonated  poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) resulted in a polymer  which was soluble in many solvents.  The solutions, however,  turned into gels upon standing.  The birefringent gels  showed nematic liquid crystalline structures and were  thermoreversible.  The polymer showed potential as a solid  polymer electrolyte for high-energy battery applications.  When crosslinked, the mechanochemical response to electrical  field stimulation was similar to the responses of flexible  polyelectrolyte gels.  %%%  The study consists of four parts.  The first part is  concerned with the kinetics of aggregation of sulfonated  aromatic polyamide in solution and the subsequent  transformation of the solution into a gel.  Dynamic light  scattering measurements will be used to monitor the  aggregation phenomenon.  In the second part,  the study on  metal-ion conducting solid-polymer polyelectrolytes and  electric-field stimulation will be continued.  The third  part of the study includes substituted poly(p-phenylenes)  having novel structures and molecular composites derived  from these polymers.  Investigation of  side chain  crystallization and stacked layer structures is an important  aspect of the work.  The fourth part of the study involves  the synthesis of substituted cellulose to test whether semi  flexible main chains having long alkyl side groups can self  assemble into stacked layer structures.  ***",
