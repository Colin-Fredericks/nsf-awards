 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520233  Roeder  Composite steel and concrete  infrastructures and buildings are  desirable for seismic design,  because they economically provide  both the strength and stiffness  needed to assure good performance  under adverse loading conditions.  However, composite action requires  a shear transfer between the steel  and the concrete.  The transfer  requirements are highly variable  depending upon the location of the  component in the structure.  Los of  this transfer through slip may  result in a dramatic loss of  strength and stiffness with very  little energy dissipation.  Shear  connectors may be used to transfer  shear force between elements but  they are costly, and engineers are  motivated to minimize their use.  At present, there are no guidelines  or specification provisions to help  them determine the best shear  connector placement in US practice.  This research will provide design  guidelines for establishing the  most economical shear connector  requirements in both encased steel  (SRC) and concrete filled tube  (CFT) construction, while assuring  good seismic performance.    This project will consist of a  thorough review of existing test  data to determine the shear  capacity that can be developed with  various CFT and SRC applications.  A series of experiments will be  performed to fill gaps in existing  knowledge and data.  Studies on  creep, shrinkage and the Poisson  effect represent potential problems  in using bond or adhesion for the  shear transfer mechanism, and  experiments will be performed.  The  experiments will establish a more  complete picture of  bond stress  and shear transfer capacity for  both CFT and SRC applications.  A  range of SRC and CFT prototype  structures based on the Theme  Structures established for this  research project will be analyzed  to determine the shear transfer  demand necessary to assure  satisfactory seismic performance.  The shear transfer capabilities  will be correlated to the demand to  develop design guidelines and  recommendati ons.    This is a project supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil  Infrastructure Systems (CIS),  solicitation NSF 94-154.  ***",
