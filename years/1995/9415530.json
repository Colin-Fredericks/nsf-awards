Network messages can be a mixture of voice, data, and  stream traffic, and the mobile platforms may have various  communications needs and mobility characteristics. With limited  communication resources to service large populations essentially  everywhere, the need to create suitable networking concepts along  with analytical models and methodology that permit theoretical  prediction of system performance, examination of parameter  trade-offs, and cohesive views of relevant issues is acute. The  physical complexity of potential systems and schemes sometimes  makes analytical tractability elusive and limits the perspective  and insight that is often gained from such models. The objective of  the research is to devise new techniques and schemes that are  suitable for mobile communications and to develop tractable models  for performance analysis and comparisons. Computer simulation will  be used as a validation and supporting tool.  Of particular  interest, from the viewpoint of networking, are techniques that  provide intelligent features in the sense that they enable mobile  networks to maintain performance levels by adjusting and adapting  to changes in the communications environment.  Dynamic control,  assignment, and management of communications resources in  consideration of traffic loading, interference, and topology will  be investigated for cellular and non-cellular configurations.   General areas to be investigated include: techniques for managing  hand-offs of communicating platforms; use of spatial  macro-diversity features; and dynamic control and assignment of  communications assets - including both borrowing and sharing of  channels and gateways. Procedures to accomplish this may involve  mixtures of central and distributed control. Specific topics are:  overall traffic pe rformance for cellular communication systems with  hand-off; cellular systems with mixed call and platform types;  hierarchically overlaid cellular architectures; combined channel  and gateway borrowing; and autonomous channel assignment schemes.  Appropriateness of the techniques in various access technologies   will be considered. The research will emphasize the creation of  analytically tractable models. This approach helps to establish a  foundation that provides fundamental insights and fosters the  invention of new and improved techniques of a particular genre. It  is expected that as a result of this investigation, new techniques  will be devised that will allow improved communications with large  numbers of mobile platforms over wide geographical areas. In  addition, the analytical models and approach will provide an  enhanced foundation for understanding and designing mobile  communications networks.  ***      *****************************************************************  ************  Aubrey M.
