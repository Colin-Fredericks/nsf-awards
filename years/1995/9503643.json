O. Holm-  Hansen, E. Helbling and V. Villafane, Scripps  Institute of  Oceanography, La Jolla, CA  to Ushuaia,  Argentina.  The objective of the research is to  determine the impact of the UVR on sub-Antarctic plankton  and to gain some insight into the possible  ecological impact of enhanced UV-B radiation on these  organisms.   The Argentine counterpart is Dr. L.  Orce, CIB, CONICET, Argentina    Seasonal ozone concentrations in the stratosphere over  Antarctica have been progressively decreasing  during September-November of each year for the past decade,  with the result  that the fluence of  the shorter UV-B  wavelengths (280-320 nm) is greatly enhanced.  The  biological impact of this increased ultraviolet radiation  (UVR) has been studied intensively in the Antarctic, but  little work has been devoted to this problem at lower  latitudes, such as the southern regions of  South America.  Although ozone depletion is greatest at very high latitudes,  increased UVR may pose significant problems for plant and  animal life in the southern regions of Argentina, due to the  ozone hole actually extending over  the South American  continent, and also to the fact that low-ozone air flows  from the Antarctic north over South America.    The marine environment at Ushuaia represents a prime  locality for studying the biological impact of  increased UVR on the marine food chain leading up to  harvestable marine resources.  These cooperative  UVR studies incorporate into one integrated field program  the biochemical expertise provided by Dr. Orce  and his colleagues in Argentina,  with the oceanographic and  experimental experience with UVR provided  by the U.S. investigators. The studies are specifically  designed to assess the effect of increased UVR on the  viability and metabolism of marine phytoplankton, with  emphasis being p laced on rates of primary  production, which constitutes the base of the marine food  web. The laboratory and field facilities for such  studies are excellent at Ushuaia. An essential component of  the work is the availability of recording  UV-  spectroradiometers and profiling spectroradiometers which  can be lowered to a 100m depth, installed by Dr. Orce under  an Interamerican Development  Bank (IDB)-CONICET grant.      ***",
