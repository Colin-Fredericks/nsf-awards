 "awd_abstract_narration": "The South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SC ATE)  Exemplary Faculty project addresses the issue of restructuring the  learning environment to prepare two-year technical college students  to compete in today's high performance global marketplace.  The  specific goal is to create a cadre of exemplary faculty teams for  the express purpose of implementing innovative research-based  advanced technological education practices across the SC Technical  College System.  The major objectives are to:  (1) Develop and  implement a comprehensive Faculty Development Program for ATE that  addresses faculty development needs in advanced technological  education content, effective pedagogy, and assessment of student  learning outcomes; (2) Develop, pilot test, and implement  research-based curricular reform in advanced engineering technology  programs; and (3) Evaluate implementation processes and materials  and disseminate successful processes and products at the local,  state, and national levels.  Methods include involving  interdisciplinary faculty teams from across the sixteen colleges in  intensive professional development activities; implementing a  system-wide electronic communications system based on the concept  of a physical conference room; and instituting project-based peer  teams to design and implement new curriculum materials and  instructional strategies.  The primary target audience is  mathematics, physical science, engineering technology and  communications faculty members.  Collaborative partners include  Clemson University and the National Dropout Prevention Center at  Clemson, the SC State Department of Education (SSI and Tech Prep  Programs), SC ETV, the Academy for Educational Development, and the  Virginia Community College System.  This project represents an  innovative approach to systemic reform in professional development  and seeks to coalesce the strengths of individual faculty members  into a unified effort to move the entire system forward in advanced  technolo gical education practices.",
