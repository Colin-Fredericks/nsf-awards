 "awd_abstract_narration": "A solution to an over determined linear system, where   there may  be  errors in both the data matrix and the target vector, is   required  in many  important applications in sciences and engineering.    Recently, a new technique  called Structured Total Least Norm  (STLN) has been developed   for obtaining the  solution that  preserves any affine structure, after the data   are perturbed to  account for the errors.  It also permits the error to be    minimized in various  norms.    The STLN algorithm is being investigated and   developed into an  efficient and practical solution method for many   applications.  Its  computational performance is being studied and a more   complete  convergence  theory is under development.  Significant algorithmic  and   improvements are being made in order to  efficiently handle   large-scale problems  and special structures.  A particular study is being   conducted to apply the STLN  method to  the model reduction by Hankel norm approximation   problem.  The  effect of different norms  are being explored.    The STLN   algorithm is being  extended to solve more general  problems where the structured   matrix is a  differentiable function  of parameters to be estimated, and   its performance is to  be  compared to other parameter estimation methods such as   Prony's  method.",
