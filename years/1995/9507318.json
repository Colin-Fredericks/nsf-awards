Using oocytes and synchronous cultures of early embryos from the surf clam, a functioning mevalonate biosynthetic pathway has been found to be required for the passage through discrete stages of the cell cycle.  This pathway is required for activation, when the quiescent oocyte re-enters the cell division cycle, and for passage through the metaphase/anaphase transition of meiotically dividing embryos.  In these embryos where the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway is non-functional, cyclin proteolysis, which normally occurs at the end of metaphase and is required for the exit from metaphase, is blocked.  The goals of the experiments that are proposed fall into two categories.  One set of experiments is focused on determining the specific metabolites from the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway that regulate cell cycle progression in clams at the time of activation and for passage through meiotic metaphase.  These studies will be done using cells as well as  extracts, which undergo meiosis in vitro.  The second set of experiments are focused on characterizing the contribution of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway to specific cellular processes known to be required for activation (the influx of Ca++ through voltage-gated channels) and those required for passage through metaphase of the cell cycle in early embryos (cyclin specific proteolysis). %%%  The results of these studies may provide insights regarding the role of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway in specific cellular processes necessary for cell division in all proliferative cells. ***                                                 Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Abstract                            Barbara Zain                        Barbara Zain                @    q ?'>                          @                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           @    q ?'>                                                                                                  @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      1                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                          e =       e                                                                               l       l   l       l       l       l       l                                                                       E   1                                                                                               #                   '       v   T       4   E                       l                                                                         E               l       l                                                                       l               l                                                       l       l       l       l                           8                                                                                                 Abstract Swenson 9507318      A growing body of evidence indicates  that cell cycle progression requires a functioning mevalonate biosynthetic pathway.
