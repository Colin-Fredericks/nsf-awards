The project is intended to provide  educational opportunities to students, as well as address  questions of scientific importance.  The initial experiments  will be focused on the behavior of methane adsorbed on a  magnesium oxide surface.  The methane will be probed via its  nuclear magnetism.  The nuclear magnetic resonance response  of carbon atoms in the methane molecule can report on the  surface motion of the methane, and also provide information  on the surface structure of the methane.  The experiments  will contribute to the basic understanding of the nature of  roughening of a surface, and the process of surface melting.  Undergraduates will be involved in this project.  They will  acquire valuable laboratory skills, and be exposed to topics  of current scientific and technological importance.  %%%  This is a Research at an Undergraduate Institution project  that will investigate the dynamics of rough or surface-  melted surfaces.
