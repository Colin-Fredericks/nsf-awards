 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational methods will be developed for the  determination, refinement and interpretation of  macromolecular structures by X-ray crystallography and  electron microscopy.  Crystallographic structure  determination involves the manual building of atomic model  into an electron density map, using interactive computer  programs, followed by automatic refinement of the model to  the diffraction amplitudes.  The crystallographic  applications will bridge the transition between model  building and automatic reciprocal-space refinement, a  transition that is a bottle-neck and a common source of  major errors in crystallographic structure determination.  Using new techniques of restrained real-space refinement,  the fit of the model to the electron density will be  optimized before the phases are abandoned for conventional  reciprocal-space refinement  Such local refinement, in turn  allows the phases and map to be improved, completing an  iterative cycle for a new method of model improvement that  is free from the feedback bias of omit-maps.  Thus the new  methods will have broad scientific impact since they will be  built for computer platforms common to the structural  biology laboratories.  The new methods will increase the  number of macromolecular structure determinations that can  be completed, improve the quality, decrease the chance of  errors, and decrease the resources that are required.  Thus,  this work will help further our understanding of the  function of individual macromolecules, and of their  interactions in the macromolecular assemblies that are  central to many cellular processes.  This award is supported  by the Computational Biology Activity and the Biophysics  programs.",
