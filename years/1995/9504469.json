 "awd_abstract_narration": "An adequate level of safety and reliability for embedded  systems can be guaranteed only through the use of computer  aided design and  analysis tools in the development process.  This research investigates several  key questions whose  solution is expected to increase the scope and decrease the  cost of symbolic analysis techniques for embedded systems.  Simultaneously, the  project is implementing the new  algorithms and strategies for the automatic  analysis of  embedded systems within the prototype tool HyTech that is  being  developed at Cornell.    Embedded systems are modeled as Hybrid Automata, which  combine discrete system transitions and continuous  environment activities.  Symbolic model checking and abstract  interpretation are used to automatically  compute the  conditions under which a hybrid automaton satisfies a  temporal-logic requirement. The method has been implemented  in HyTech, which  allows the automatic analysis of hybrid  automata with piecewise-linear  behavior. The purpose of this  work is, first, to improve the applicability and  the  efficiency of HyTech and, second, to investigate--through  theory,  implementation, and case studies--how far standard  program-analysis methods can  be generalized to permit the  direct analysis of continuous-time systems.",
