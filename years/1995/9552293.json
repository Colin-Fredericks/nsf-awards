 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds laboratory equipment that enhances the quality  of instruction in the areas of cell and molecular biology.    Electrophoresis and related techniques are widely used in many  areas of biology.   A firm understanding of these processes is  essential for all of the university's students, but especially  those who plan to go to graduate school in cell and molecular  biology; those who hope to get jobs in cell, molecular, or  physiology laboratories; or even those who plan on teaching  middle or high school.   The most effective instruction in the  sciences is in the laboratory, where students gain hands-on  experience and can learn to understand what is involved and  potential problems that can arise at more than a theoretical  level.   By incorporating gel electrophoresis exercises in the  Introduction to Genetics and Cell Biology courses, faculty can  ensure that all majors graduate with a solid understanding of how  proteins and nucleic acids can be isolated based on molecular  weight and electrical charge and how the variability in proteins  can be related to genetic differences for population studies.    Advanced laboratories involving polymerase chain reaction and  techniques such as Western blotting are being included in upper-  division courses such as Microbiology, Plant Physiology,  Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology and used in independent study  projects and faculty research.   In addition, the new equipment  is being used to demonstrate electrophoresis and DNA  fingerprinting in Introduction to Criminology for the Criminal  Justice minor offered by the Sociology Department and possibly in  a science and math summer enrichment program for minority  students and teachers.",
