 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) and its fellow  institutions in the NSF sponsored 'Foundation Coalition' (FC) are  at the forefront of innovations in engineering and science  education. RHIT has, for example, developed a pioneering  'integrated' freshman year curriculum utilizing symbolic algebra  and other powerful software. This curriculum now regularly  employs active learning through cooperative group work. Little  has been done, however, to carry innovations from programs like  the 'integrated' curriculum into the sophomore and succeeding  years. Technology is advancing ever more rapidly (in the fall of  1995 laptop computers will be required of all entering RHIT  freshman), making it imperative that education be abreast of  coming changes.    RHIT/FC physics faculty members will develop 'resource packets' for  basic and advanced physics courses which will galvanize the uptake of  freshman year innovations. Consortium for Upper-Level Physics Software  (CUPS) simulations and text will be available in 1995; they will be a  major and timely enhancement resource for the packets. Physics  instructors will have exercises and examples in the new methodologies  and technologies at their fingertips. Sophomores will find their  physics courses regularly featuring assignments which require a  continuation of the skills they learned as freshmen. The packets will  impact over 600 students per year at RHIT alone.    Assessment and revision will occur continuously throughout the project.  Vigorous dissemination efforts will include use of conferences,  professional journals, workshops, and electronic mail.",
