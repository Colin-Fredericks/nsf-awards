Up until recently, by far the majority of  sentence-processing research has used visual presentation of  stimuli, in part because this makes it possible to timelock the  input to the subject's response. But more recently, as computers  and speech editing software have increased in capacity and  reduced in price, researchers have begun to examine the role of  prosody during the processing of auditorily-presented sentences.  This new wave of research circumvents a common worry in  visually-presented stimuli: orthographic representations of  language do not adequately represent many of the non-segmental  properties of speech and, obviously, speech is the more natural  modality for human language. Intuitively, prosodic cues--changes  in the pitch, amplitude and duration of syllables and changes in  pause length--should be useful to listeners. Whether they  actually are is an empirical question which a number of  researchers are currently investigating.       The goal of this special session of the CUNY Sentence  Processing Conference is to bring together researchers who are  studying the on-line effects of prosody on sentence parsing to  present and synthesize recent results, and to raise points of  controversy. We intend to publish these papers as part of either  a special issue of the Journal of Psycholinguistic Research or a  book.",
