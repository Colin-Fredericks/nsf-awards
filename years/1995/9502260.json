 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to scale up the applicability of  planning   algorithms  developed  in  the  field  of   Artificial  Intelligence. The basic research component of the project  is  to  first   investigate  techniques  for  improving  scalability   of  planning  using  parallel  techniques, then  to  explore  machine  learning  techniques  for reusing and refining  generated  plans.  Industrial  applications  of  AI planning  algorithms  have  been  limited  largely by the computational complexity of the  planning  task. The significant speedup that can be obtained using parallel  hardware  and  machine learning techniques  can  bridge  the  gap  between  research and a wide variety of industrial  applications.  To  demonstrate the power of the techniques developed here,  they  will  not only be formally verified but will be applied  to  such  applications  as automated assembly and cooperative  planning  of  unmanned  ground  vehicles. The CAREER project will  also  impact  graduate and undergraduate education. Existing seminar courses in  Parallel  AI  and in Planning and Robotics will be  refined.   An  industrial  team will be formed to suggest topics and to  oversee  class  projects. All course materials developed for these classes  will be packaged and available for general dissemination over the  Internet.",
