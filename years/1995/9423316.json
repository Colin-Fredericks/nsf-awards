Certain levels and  rates   of   fertilization  may  negatively   affect   plant  productivity by increasing the amount of damage by  insects.  This  research  will examine the net impact  of  two  insect  herbivores   on  two  plant  species  grown  under   various  fertilization  regimes.   It  is  designed  specifically  to  understand  the  consequences of  fertilization  and  insect  herbivory   in  combination  on  plant  productivity.    Two  economically  and ecologically important tree  species  (oak  and cottonwood) with contrasting life history traits and two  economically  detrimental insect herbivore species  are  the  subjects.  Fertilization experiments will be carried out  in  both  a  planted field plot and, for control and  comparison  purposes,  in  a greenhouse.  Samples of each  tree  species  will be exposed to differing fertilization schedules in  the  presence  and absence of insect herbivores, and  effects  on  plant  growth,  tissue chemistry, and herbivore  performance  will  be measured.  The results of this study should improve  understanding  of  the  impact  on  plant  productivity   of  fertilization levels and rates of addition, in the  presence  and  absence  of  insect herbivores. They will  reveal  when  tradeoffs occur between positive effects of fertilization on  plant  growth and negative effects of fertilization  through  stimulation  of  insect feeding on plants.   The  long  term  result   may   include  the  formulation  of   fertilization  practices  that  optimize net productivity  of  plants,  yet  reduce fertilizer and pesticide requirements.",
