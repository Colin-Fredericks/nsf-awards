The specific systems to be studied include the Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins L7/L12 and L10, free and reconstituted into ribosomal subunits. Cysteine residues, specifically placed at appropriate locations along the peptide chain by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, will be labeled with various sulfhydryl specific fluorescence probes.  Neither L7/L12 nor L10 have intrinsic tryptophan residues and hence this intrinsic fluorophore can also be introduced at appropriate locations in these proteins.  Fluorescence methods, including time-resolved and energy transfer techniques, will then be utilized to elucidate flexibility and relative motion of different domains of L7/L12, free in solution, in its pentameric complex with L10 in the 50s ribosomal subunit and in the intact 70s ribosome.  Flexibility of various double mutants of L7/L12 with deletion of a putative hinge region will also be studied to ascertain the contribution of this stretch of amino acids to the protein's overall conformational dynamics.  Fluorescence energy transfer techniques will be utilized to elucidate distances between various sites on L7/L12 both free and in its complexes with L10 and reconstituted into the ribosomal subunits.  The energetics of subunit interactions between the L7/L12 monomers will be studied by polarization and energy transfer methods.  These studies will be aimed at elucidating the thermodynamic aspects of the dimer/monomer equilibrium of L7/12 as well as studying subunit exchange between L7/L12 free in solution and in its various complexes.  These biophysical approaches will afford a better understanding of subunit interactions and conformational dynamics of L7/L12, both isolated and associated with other ribosomal components.  This information will begin to provide a dynamic description of the ribosome which is ultimately necessary for detailed understanding of the coord inated chemical and physical processes involved in protein biosynthesis.  %%%  The goal is to study the structure and dynamics of ribosomal proteins using fluorescence techniques.  These biophysical approaches will provide a better understanding of subunit interactions and conformation dynamics of ribosomal components.  This information will begin to provide a dynamic description of the ribosome which is ultimately necessary for detailed understanding of the coordinated chemical and physical process involved in protein bi synthesis.  In addition to the knowledge this research program will provide on an important biological problem, it will also contribute to the infrastructure of science education in the United States by allowing the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.  ***  ??",
