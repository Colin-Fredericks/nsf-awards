 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417513  Betts    This award supports the participation of eight U.S. scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Clustering Phenomena in Nuclear and  Mesoscopic Systems, to be held at the East-West Conference Center,  Honolulu from December 14-16, 1995.  The co-organizers are Dr.  Russell Betts of the University of Illinois and Dr. Yasuhisa Abe of  Kyoto University. The seminar will explore recent advances in cluster  phenomena in nuclei and their connection to clustering in a more  general sense.  The current state of comparison between theory and  experiment will be covered in detail and the theoretical connection  between multi-center shell models and the deformed, single-center  shell model will be examined.  The relationship between the physics  of clustering in nuclear systems to more general aspects of cluster and  molecular physics will be discussed to develop a wider understanding  of their common features.    The seminar will foster the type of contact between Japanese and U.S.  scientists that can be expected to have significant influence on the  future course of the field.  The proposed participants and observers  have been selected for their past contributions and current activity in  the field and the meeting can be expected to produce concrete plans  for future cooperation and exchange.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
