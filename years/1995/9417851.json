 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to characterize Antarctic  meteorites by measuring natural thermoluminescense (TL) levels.  This work is part of the basic characterization program carried  out on all Antarctic meteorites and is used to determine future  research avenues on the Antarctic meteorites.  This program will  measure the natural TL levels in as many Antarctic meteorites as  possible and will make the data rapidly available to the  community.  The data will be used to determine pairing  (fragmentation), orbital distribution, estimate approximate  terrestrial ages of meteorites, and to identify meteorites with  unusual thermal and radiation histories or those that are  mineralogically unusual.  To enhance the value of these data,  studies are also conducted on natural TL profiles in other  extraterrestrial samples (large meteorites and lunar samples) and  comparisons are made between TL data and cosmogenic radionuclide  abundances.  Over the course of this award, the natural TL  laboratory will (1) continue systematic measurement of the  natural TL of all suitable Antarctic samples as part of their  preliminary screening, (2) examine pairing and natural TL  distributions for individual Antarctic sites, where several very  large pairing groups may exist, (3) continue the detailed  compilation of pairing data, and (4) perform theoretical and  experimental studies to use in the interpretation of TL data in  Antarctic meteorites, including additional studies of modern  falls, lunar samples, and of finds from other regions of the  world.",
