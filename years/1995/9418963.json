 "awd_abstract_narration": "Burger    Under the direction of Dr. Richard Burger, Mr. Thomas Zoubek will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological excavation at the site of Huaca El Gallo/Huaca La  Gallina which is located in the Viru Valley on the northern coast  of Peru. The site contains two large stone-faced platform mounds,  two sunken circular courts and extensive habitational remains. At  least one unlooted cemetery is associated with the mounds and  domestic structures. The site itself dates to the Formative  period, between 1800 and 50 BC and therefore documents the rise  of complex society in Peru. In the planned fieldwork, Mr. Zoubek  and his colleagues will construct a precise map of the site. They  will then excavate a representative sample of each type of  household and several domestic structures will be dug in their  entirety. Refuse areas will also be sought out for excavation in  order to establish stratigraphic sequences. Burials and  undisturbed tombs will also be examined. The cultural and  skeletal, as well as floral and faunal materials recovered  will  be analyzed.    The archaeological situation of the coast of Peru is interesting  for several reasons. First the Andes represents one of the few  regions of the world where highly complex stratified societies  appear to have independently evolved. During the Initial period  large ceremonial structures were built and maintained. Secondly,  the region is important because there are indications that, in  some parts of the Peruvian coast at least, this development took  place in a relatively egalitarian social context. Archaeologists  generally believe that political centralization as indicated in  monumental construction either results from or is intimately  related to the emergence of status inequality; the Peruvian case  however may disprove this hypothesis. Relatively little is known  about household organization at such sites since archaeological  work has concentrated on the more imposing monumental structures.  Mr.  Zoubek's work will focus on the former and provide direct  insight into social organization.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase  understanding of how complex societies develop and will also  contribute to the training of a promising young scientist.",
