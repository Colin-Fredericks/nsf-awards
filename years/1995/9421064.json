The focus of the  research is on the perceptual and memory abilities required for  the segmentation and extraction of words (or wordlength units)  from fluent maternal speech prior to the onset-age of vocal  production. A new familiarization-preference (F-Pref) technique  has been developed to assess infants' sensitivities to words.  This technique involves a brief familiarization period (30-45  seconds) during which infants are presented with target words (or  non-words) embedded in sentences and subsequently tested for  recognition of those words in isolation compared to non-familiar  words. Postfamiliarization recognition is revealed by longer  listening times to familiar over non-familiar words. This  technique will be used to explore further the conditions under  which 7 to 8 month old infants are able to extract words from  fluent speech when the surrounding acoustic, phonetic, and  language-specific contexts are varied, when speaking rate is  altered, and when the frequency of pauses is manipulated during  the familiarization period. In addition to these primary  questions, we will also attempt to extend the F-Pref technique to  infants in the first six months of postnatal development (using  simplified procedures), and to older infants in an attempt to  reveal the emergence of semantic priming in infancy. Because the  segmentation, extraction, and memory for words embedded in fluent  speech is a necessary precursor to the formation of a lexicon,  these experiments should reveal a fundamental capacity of infants  in the early stage of language acquisition when comprehension is  thought to be superior to production.",
