 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the great challenges facing today's software engineers  is the development of reliable systems, which are known to perform correctly in  all circumstances.  The most critical applications often involve concurrency and  real-time, which increase the difficulty of system development and validation.  Testing and debugging cannot prove a system is correct. However, they are  currently the most effective methods available for validating real applications.  This project investigates the use of oracles created from Graphical Interval  Logic (GIL) specifications in testing and debugging of real-time programs.  GIL is a visual logic for specifying  and reasoning about properties of real-time systems. The existing GIL tools  allow mechanical checking that system specifications guarantee critical  correctness requirements.  This project seeks to produce a method for relating  GIL specifications to real-time programs that permits deterministic finite-state  automata constructed from GIL specifications to be used in  verifying that  executions of a program are correct. When an execution violates a specification,  the associated oracle would construct a GIL formula describing a fault in the  execution. This formula would be displayed graphically, appropriately aligned  with an execution trace, to help the user see where in the trace the fault  occurred and the nature of the fault.    Formal methods must be automated if  software engineers are to use them in the development of real systems. The  implementation and experimental evaluation of prototypes is therefore an  important facet of this project, which combines analytical research on  formal methods with experimental research aimed at assessing the practical  utility of formal methods.",
