 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve the design, development, and  implementation of an introductory course on manufacturing systems  for non-engineering students. Innovative teaching and learning  styles suitable for teaching manufacturing concepts will be  identified and incorporated in the course to motivate students to  learn, understand, and appreciate the role of manufacturing in  today's society, its impact on the economy, and its career  potential. This course will build on the background and skills of  first- and second-year university students, to give them a better  understanding of the value of basic courses in mathematics,  physics, and chemistry, in learning engineering concepts. It will  also introduce non-engineering students, especially women and  underrepresented minorities, to manufacturing in a non-intimidating  manner. It is hoped that such an exposure will strengthen their  confidence, dispel their fear of technology, and motivate them to  choose an engineering career. A preliminary study conducted through  a pilot section of the course offered during spring 1994 to assess  the need for this course and its potential benefits has resulted in  positive outcomes and has given the impetus for developing this  course fully. The project methodology will involve the  identification of manufacturing life cycle concepts suitable for  this course and its target audience, and the design and development  of course activities, lesson plans, laboratory experiments, and  instructional aids that will accommodate different teaching and  learning styles so that the course material can be conveyed  effectively to a non-engineering student population. The progress  of the project and its outcomes will be evaluated by a team  consisting of members from academia and the manufacturing industry.  Course material that will be developed for this project, the  teaching and learning techniques that will be used in conveying the  material to students, and the results of this study will be of  great potential bene fit to educators everywhere interested in  offering similar courses to non-engineering students.",
