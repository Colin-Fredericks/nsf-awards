 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grotzinger  9506574   One year of funding is requested in order to support a pilot project designed to conduct quantitative tests of the scaling relationships of sediment gravity flow deposits.  The plan is to test the hypothesis that the statistical distribution of bed thicknesses of subaqueous sediment gravity flow deposits with minimal erosional truncation and amalgamation should obey the power law N(h) h-B where N(h) is the number of layers of thickness greater than h and B is the scaling exponent (as suggested by Rothman et al, 1994).  This indicates that, at least in some cases, sediment gravity flow deposition is scale invariant (fractal).  We will determine (or at least devise a strategy for future research) whether power-law scaling for sediment gravity flow deposits represents an intrinsic dynamical property of the depositional system itself (e.g. self-organized criticality), or whether it indirectly reflects the power-law scaling of external, causal mechanisms (e.g. earthquakes, floods).  Furthermore, if it can be demonstrated (regardless of its cause) that the sediment gravity flow triggering and deposition process is indeed scale invariant, then departures of bed thickness statistics from the predicted power law may possibly be interpreted as quantitative evidence of erosional and/or non-depositional processes that influence completeness of the stratigraphic record.   The research effort itself will consist of a close collaboration between the PI's whose backgrounds are widely divergent, and a graduate research assistant.  Several recently obtained data sets will be analyzed.  Additional data will be collected that pertains specifically to the temporal scaling of sediment gravity flow deposits.  Finally, data collection will proceed in parallel with development of new, physically-based theory that relates bed thickness, volume, and geometry.   The results of this research will be of broad interest to members of the physics as well as earth science communities. Additionally, the rese arch has clear relevance to the petroleum industry where there is growing evidence that thin-bedded turbidite reservoirs may be of great economic importance.",
