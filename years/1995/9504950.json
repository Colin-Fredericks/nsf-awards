 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sethian       The investigator and his colleague study the motion of  singularities in solutions of differential equations, in  particular, the motion of interfaces as described by level-set  methods and applied to problems in interface motion, and the  motion of vortices in three space dimensions, as described by  vortex methods and other Lagrangian techniques.  The interface  techniques exploit Hamilton-Jacobi methodology coupled to upwind  schemes for hyperbolic solvers; new work focuses on developing  fast methods, methods for multiple interfaces, and the  incorporation of effects of visibility, surface diffusion, and  reflection/re-emission in surface profile motion.  The vortex  motion through Lagrangian methods develops machinery from  renormalization methods and polymer analysis from statistical  physics applied to fluid phenomena through linkage with  Shenoy-Williams methodology, and Kosterlitz-Thouless formulations.       The investigators develop methods to follow the motion of  interfaces and vortices.  Such problems arise in flows of  materials, for instance, and whenever the places where objects or  materials meet or end change with time.  These are common  situations throughout science and engineering.  The work is applied  to a number of areas.  In etching, deposition, and lithography in  the manufacture of microelectronic components, the work is used to  analyze process steps leading to higher yield and efficiency of  electronic devices.  In image enhancement, segmentation, and  recognition applied to medical imaging, the work leads towards  automatic software for recognizing cardiac data in CT and MRI  scans.  In grid generation, the techniques are used to develop new  techniques for building grids around complex bodies, as required  in aircraft and engine design.  The Lagrangian and vortex particle  work focuses on generation of large turbulent structures in wakes,  motions of polymers in superfluids, and fundamentals of  superconductivity.",
