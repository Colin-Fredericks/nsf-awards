 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521013  Dobson   Understanding why some individuals in a population are more successful at raising offspring than others is central to gaining insight into evolution via natural selection.  Scientists have developed several explanations for the evolution of family size for species with extended parental care.  Since these hypotheses each make specific predictions about offspring and parental survival during and after reproduction, a properly designed field study can test these explanations.    This study will be the first field study to employ this technique in small mammals.  New- born flying squirrels will be moved among nests in order to study why mothers give birth to litters of a certain number of young.  The effects of altering a mother's litter size can be monitored throughout the rest of her reproductive life.  Young female squirrels settle near their mother so the effects of litter size on the offspring's' reproduction can also be monitored.    This study will lead to important insights into natural selection.   Additionally, the results  can have applications to the conservation of rare animals and may even shed light on how to an increase food production from the animal farming industries.  Understanding what factors set the upper limit to family size per reproductive event is the first step in searching for ways to increase production of young. Increasing reproduction in rare animals would have obvious applications towards saving animals from extinction, while increasing reproduction in an economically important animal may help increase the production of protein for an increasing human population.",
