 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern Mississippi at Hattiesburg, is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program for the renovation of research laboratories in the Walker Science Building.  Constructed in 1959, the basement was modified for use as laboratory space, including wetlab areas in 1971 for the Department of Biological Sciences.  However, due to deterioration, the space is unsuitable for research.  The prevalence of formalin, and problems with access, ventilation, lighting, and temperature control has led to the cessation of use of the facility as a wet laboratory.  Presently, wetlabs are dispersed in various buildings on campus, but almost invariably are located in spaces not originally designed for laboratory use, which limits the capabilities of the department-s aquatic research programs. Research and training efforts are directed towards marine and freshwater environments, and the renovation of the underutilized space is critical to the development of core departmental programs.  The laboratory modernization project will provide a centralized wetlab facility  adjacent to research and teaching areas.  The renovated facility will comprise of:  1) five separate wetlabs, each with independent temperature regulation; 2) one dry lab which will house electronic equipment and microscopes; 3) a zooplankton and phytoplankton culture facility; 4) one-walk-in freezer, work area, and a storage room.  In addition to providing space for present wetlab activities, the renovation will allow for additional research approaches that are not possible under the current conditions.  One laboratory will be equipped with a built in stream system that will facilitate researchers in their efforts to investigate the effect of physical and biotic factors on habitat used of native southeastern stream fishes.  The project will increase the department-s effectiveness in graduate training by facilitating an expanded program in laboratory studies on the ecology, behavior, and physiology of aquatic organisms.",
