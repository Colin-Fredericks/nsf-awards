 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506195  Gal  Proteins are the major structural and enzymatic component of  the cell.  The level of these essential compounds is  dependent not only on the level of synthesis, but also on  the level of breakdown by proteolytic enzymes.  Despite  their identification and study since early in this century,  proteases have been primarily analyzed only in vitro.  This  includes analysis of their substrate specificity, pH optimum  and inhibitor susceptibility.  But, the role of these  enzymes in plant physiology can at present only be  speculated from these studies.  Proteases have been  implicated in such processes as leaf senescence, organ  abscission, seed germination and resource reutilization, but  are likely to be involved at many other stages of plant  growth where protein degradation is important.  For example,  expression of a number of specific protein products is  hampered by their instability due to natural mechanisms of  protein degradation in some tissues.  Relatively little is  known about the mechanisms of proteolytic degradation in  plants, so this proposed work will identify the proteases in  Arabidopsis thaliana.  The goal is to determine the role of  the these enzymes in plants and which one(s) affect the  accumulation of desirable proteins.  Not only will this work  set the stage for understanding how proteolysis controls a  number of cellular processes, but may also lead to new  approaches in plant biotechnology where protein levels are  critical for maintenance of a desirable phenotype.    The State University of New York at Binghamton prides itself  on its excellence in teaching and research.  Dr. Gal's  educational objectives during this granting period would  support that role of the university and the department.  The  goal is to integrate teaching and research by bringing more  research into course teaching and by bringing a teaching  framework to the undergraduate and graduate students in the  laboratory and the department.  This would equip the  students with the cri tical thinking skills needed for a  lifetime of learning in biology.",
