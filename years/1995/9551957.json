 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to introduce all lower-division  chemistry students to the use of computers early in the curricula  and continue using them for data acquisition and analysis as well  as for computer assisted instruction (CAI).   Twelve Macintosh SE  computers are being removed from the existing department network  and used in the laboratory with Vernier Serial Box Interface kits  for data acquisition.   Twelve new Macintosh Quadra 630s are  replacing the SEs on the network.   Upgrading the network  provides students access to computers powerful enough to run new  statistical software to be used for data analysis and simulation  and to additional Internet services.   CAI software is also  available on the network.   The success of the project is being  measured by student and instructor evaluations comparing  interfaced versus non-interfaced laboratory exercises and by  student and instructor evaluations of the CAI and statistical  software.   In addition to publications and conference  presentations, the investigators are holding a series of  workshops on computer interfaced laboratory exercises for local  high school and middle school science teachers and also for  at-risk high school students.",
