 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416956  Talbot    This three-year award will support U.S.-France collaborative  research in chemical engineering between Julian Talbot of  Purdue University and Pascal Viot of the Laboratory for  Theoretical Physics of Liquids, the French National Center  for Scientific Research (CNRS). They will conduct  theoretical, analytical and computational studies of  irreversible adsorption of large molecules from solutions  onto solid surfaces.  The objective of their research is to  understand the kinetics of the adsorption, the structure of  the deposited films and their connection to equilibrium  processes.  Molecules of proteins, latex spheres and  bacteria will be used in their studies.    The U.S. investigator and his group will focus primarily on  numerical simulation of adsorption processes and the  application of the results to actual experimental data.  This is enhanced by French theoretical expertise.  The  collaboration balances complementary expertise in chemical  engineering (Purdue) and in theoretical physics and  chemistry (CNRS).  Theoretical understanding of surface  adsorption is a relatively new research area.  Past research  on surface adsorption focused on experimental studies.  This  research project will provide a much needed theory of  surface adsorption.  These processes underlie important  phenomena, including catalysis, cell function, and coating.  ***",
