Opening in the winter of 1994-95 The Networked Society museum  exhibit will :  1) educate a diverse public audience about the many  applications of computer networks; 2) teach principles of computing  science and technology; 3) examine topical issues involved in  computer network development and use; 4) help increase the number  of American citizens who are educated in the use of computer  networks; 5) help increas the number of young peopls who pursue  computer networking as a lifelong interest, skill, and career.  The  exhibit will impact 1.7 million people in three years and address  issues of technology access by educating a broad public audience  with diverse computer literacy backgrounds.    Diversification and increase of the the future workforce in  mathematics, science, and technology is a primary NSF education  objective.  The proposed science museum exhibit project will assist  this and other NSF objectives to address issues of technology  transfer and technology access too amont the American Public.",
