 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five year grant provides funds for travel by graduate students and independent scholars to attend the annual meetings of the History of Science Society, the Philosophy of Science Association, the Society for History of Technology and the Society for Social Studies of Science.  All four societies have long prided themselves on their reputation as open organizations, eager to embrace scholars from many fields of work who share an interest in historical, philosophical, and social scientific studies of science and technology.  This attitude of openness has also extended to the societies' efforts to involve junior scholars not only in the meetings as presenters but also in the governance of the societies and in the honors bestowed by the societies.  All four societies have prizes and awards that specifically target graduate students and junior scholars and include junior scholars as members of standing  committees.  The efforts underscore the commitment of the membership to maintain the vitality, openness, and inclusiveness of their organizations by passing  valued academic traditions to their younger colleagues.  The major obstacle in implementing these goals is the lack of travel funds to bring student and independent scholars to meetings.  With universities and colleges restricting travel funs and the job market constricting, the opportunity of the most junior members, graduate students, and independent scholars of the societies to obtain necessary funding to attend meetings of the societies also constricts.  These travel grants will go a long way to provide support for participation of these groups.",
