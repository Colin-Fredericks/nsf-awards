The primary immediate goal of the work is to understand the  relationships between the isotopic compositions of different  pedogenic minerals (especially clay minerals and oxides) and the  climate of the weathering environment.  A major long term goal of  the research is to apply those relationships in the reconstruction  of ancient continental climates from the isotopic compositions of  minerals in paleosols.  An additional goal is to obtain increased  insight into the processes involved in the formation and  modification of soil minerals.  The proposed study is unique in that it will relate measurements of  the isotopic composition of pedogenic minerals to the isotopic  composition of soil waters and precipitation.  Studies of soil  minerals begin with very careful field, petrologic and mineralogic  examination prior to separation of phases for isotopic analysis.   These studies will include an extension of completed work on the  oxygen isotopic compositions of Amazonian lateritic kaolinites.   Other soil minerals (especially gibbsite, titanium oxides, and iron  oxides) from the same pedogenic facies of the same profiles will   be  analyzed for   18O.  All hydrogen-containing phases will be  analyzed for   D.  Studies of soil minerals will also include  analysis of a variety of saprolites developed on igneous rocks in  the Virginia Piedmont and , in collaboration with colleagues at JPL  and Caltech, investigation of the stable isotope systematics of  soil minerals developed on basalt on the Kohala Peninsula (Hawaii)  along a climatic gradient (rainfall increasing with altitude from  20 cm to 150 cm per year.  The isotope geochemistry of soil water and, where possible,  precipitation, will be monitored over the course of a year at each  of the soil profiles which are studied (Brazil, Virginia Piedmont,  Hawaii).  Work on the isot ope geochemistry of soil water will focus  on the analysis of the liquid water phase (rather than total water  as in most previous studies) in the unsaturated zone.  This is  important distinction when the soil water isotopic data are  to be  related the isotopic compositions of pedogenic minerals.  The  analytical technique to be used was developed in the current grant  period.  It is a laboratory-based CO2 equilibration technique.   Additional work is planned on the development and verification of  an in situ technique based upon the analysis of soil CO2  and upon  the   isotopic fractionations that occur when soil water is partitioned  into a liquid phase and other components (e.g., adsorbed water).",
