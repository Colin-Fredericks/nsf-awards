The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Melissa J. Brown to work with Professor Dong  Luo of South-Central Nationalities College in the People's  Republic of China.    During this award, the PI will do ethnographic fieldwork on  cultural change among the Tujia, a state-designated ethnic  minority, in Fengyan Xian in western Hunan Province with the  collaboration of scholars at the Zhongnan Minzu Xueyuan  (South-Central Nationalities College), or Min Yuan, in  Wuhan. Little is known about Central China since no western  anthropologists have worked there and the Chinese scholars  located there have had neither contacts or funds to  disseminate the results of their research outside China.  Therefore the historical experience of the Tujia will  provide a means for examining cultural change in relation to  local structure since they changed first toward and then  away from a Han Chinese cultural model. ***",
