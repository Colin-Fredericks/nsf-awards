 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, in the SGER mode, explores how the formulation of a  system's motion affects the efficiency of synthesizing a plan to  bring the system to a desired state. In general, a system's motion  can be described in a variety of ways whose computational  properties may differ. An especially important computational  property is the decomposability of a theory of motion. A theory is  decomposable if it is expressible as the composition of a set of  subtheories. Decomposability is important because it implies that  global properties of the system can be derived from local  properties, thereby reducing the expense of computing these  properties. In particular, global plans can be built from local  plans. Decomposition is usually performed by the human designers of  the system, who have prior knowledge of the demands that will be  placed on the system, and engineer a representation whose  properties will aid the system in meeting these demands  efficiently. In robotics and artificial intelligence, the goal of  designing truly autonomous problem solving systems requires a  method for automatic decomposition. This research is built upon a  new method for reformulating and decomposing theories of motion.  Each representation of a theory is analyzed using the tools of  semigroup theory. Each distinct representation corresponds to an  abstract coordinate system, which then yields a matrix  representation that is used to transform and decompose the  representation into its irreducible invariants. Furthermore, this  decomposition is guaranteed to hold for all tasks in a class of  tasks inductively defined from the given task, permitting reuse of  the decomposition on all members of this class. The ultimate goal  of this research is to build systems that can automatically design  and modify their representations by deriving algorithms for  automatic reformulation of representations to improve their use in  synthesis. Previous research in robotics and AI has produced  powerful methods for searching task  spaces - spaces whose states  are configurations of the task domain. If successful, this research  should produce reformulation methods of sufficient power that the  search of the space of representations will be as automated as the  search of task spaces currently is.",
