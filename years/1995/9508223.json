These would be integrated with a  fileserver and highspeed networking to form a highspeed computing  cluster compatible with the existing departmental network. This  equipment will be dedicated to the support of research in the  mathematical sciences and will be used for research projects, including  in particular the following projects in pure and applied mathematics.       The projects from applied mathematics include the 3-D modeling of  flow in porous media, the numerical solution of 3-D time dependent PDEs  by the gradient-weighted moving element method, and the application of  wavelets to fast nonlinear image processing in 2-D and 3-D.       Projects in pure mathematics propose to implement numerically new  decompositions of classical kernel functions from complex variables, to  apply symbolic calculation techniques to problems from commutative  algebra, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. These projects  share the demand for high performance, since in most instances the  current test cases demand many hours or days on the available  equipment.",
