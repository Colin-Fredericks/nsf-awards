The target audience is children age 8 to 16, with a focus on the 10-14 year-old age group, along with their parents, teachers, and counselors.  A prototype version of the paper has been published locally and distributed through Safeway stores.     During the planning phase, the PI and staff will conduct the following activities:    o Conduct front-end evaluation of the target audience with particular emphasis being given to identifying ways to reach underserved and underrepresented groups.    o Work with science, technology, and graphics experts to improve the quality of the content and design.    o Explore traditional and new distribution mechanisms and cooperative arrangements.    o Create and test interdisciplinary procedures for evaluation.    o Establish a network of individual, community, corporate, and institutional supporters, including educators, community leaders, scientists, and engineers.    o Create linkages with schools and school programs.    o Explore funding sources and sponsorships.    o Continue building a Board of Advisors.",
