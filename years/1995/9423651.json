 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423651  Lomax  Plant responses to developmental and environmental signals  are controlled by a complex set of interactions between  plant hormones and other growth regulators.  The occurrence  and relative ratio of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin  coordinate plant growth and differentiation, as well as  environmental responses.  There is a long history of  research in this area, however, questions remain as to how  the ratio of the two hormones is detected by the plant, as  well as the molecular mechanisms of action of the hormones,  either singly or in combination.  Mutants can provide a  powerful toml for dissecting physiological, biochemical, and  molecular responses.  The diageotropica (dgt) mutant of  tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)  is a single gene,  recessive mutant previously characterized as auxin-  insensitive, as it neither grows nor produces ethylene in  response to applied auxin.  Although isolated on the basis  of its reduced gravitropic response, the dgt lesion results  in a complex pleiotropic phenotype involving many aspects of  plant form and function.  Many of these characteristics are  better associated with plants overexpressing cytokinin and  it has been shown that much of the dgt phenotype can be  mimicked in wild type tomato plants with exogenously-  supplied cytokinin.    The studies proposed here are designed to test that  hypothesis and to establish whether the apparent increase in  cytokinin sensitivity in dgt plants is the result of auxin  insensitivity, altered cytokinin homeostasis, or alteration  of some signal transduction component which controls or  integrates the response to both hormones.  Results from  these studies will shed light on the regulation of auxin  sensitivity as well as on cytokinin responsiveness in  plants.  The information gained will aid in our  understanding of hormonal regulation of plant function, as  well as in the elucidation of the molecular and cellular  mechanisms of action for cytokinin and auxin.",
