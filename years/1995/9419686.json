 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a study of volcanic rocks in the Ross Sea  area of Antarctica.  Existing strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and  lead (Pb) isotopic work on more than 80 basalts shows that a HIMU  (High U/Pb)-like isotopic signature (low 87/86Sr, high 206/204Pb)  is ubiquitous along some 4500 km of the West Antarctic Rift  System (WARS).  Three oceanic hotspots have been defined in the  region; Balleny and Scott Islands show the same HIMU-like  signatupe as the rift volcanics.  Peter I Island shows a hint of  this component, though these rocks indicate, in general, a more  enriched mantle hotspot source (refered to as an EM-2-like  hotspot).  Many of the WARS volcanics also show the presence of  an enriched component, but one which is derived from the  continental lithosphere (low Rb/Cs and Th/Pb).  In Victoria Land,  the presence or absence of the enriched component is directly  related to location with respect to the boundary between the Ross  Sea rift and the Transantarctic Mountain Front.  Its minimal  presence in Marie Byrd Land suggests a thinner and/or younger  crust, relative to the Transantarctic Mountain area.  The virtual  absence of enriched component in the rift proper suggests a  highly thinned crust, perhaps without significant underlying  lithosphere.    In this second phase of a longer term project, the work will  focus on geochemical study three WARS volcanoes (Sidley,  Overlord, Pleides) in detail, to constrain a crustal versus  mantle lithospheric source for the enriched component.  A number  of cognate and mantle xenoliths will be studied as a further aid  in this source discrimination issue.  The geographic extent of  the HIMU-WARS signature will be tested by analyzing Cenozoic  basalts from sub-Antarctic islands on the Campbell Plateau  (including cognate and mantle xenoliths).  In all of this work we  will, for the first time, employ osmium and oxygen isotopes in  combination as a tool to discriminate crustal versus mantle  lithosphere signatures.",
