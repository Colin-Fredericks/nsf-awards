 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an interdisciplinary study, titled Research  on Ocean-Atmosphere Variability and Ecosystem Response in  the Ross Sea (ROAVERRS), of atmospheric forcing, ocean  hydrography, sea ice dynamics, primary productivity, and  pelagic-benthic coupling in the southwestern Ross Sea,  Antarctica.  The primary goal is to examine how changes in  aspects of the polar climate system, in this case wind and  temperature, combine to influence marine productivity on a  large antarctic continental shelf.  In the Ross Sea,  katabatic winds and mesocyclones influence the spatial and  temporal distribution of sea ice as well as the upper ocean  mixed layer depth, and thus control primary production  within the sea ice as well as in the open water system.  The structure, standing stock and productivity of bottom-  dwelling biological communities are also linked to  meteorological processes through interseasonal and  interannual variations in horizontal and vertical fluxes of  organic carbon produced in the upper ocean.    Linkages among the atmospheric, oceanic, and biological  systems will be investigated during a three-year field  study of the southwestern Ross Sea ecosystem.  Direct  measurements will include regional wind and air  temperatures derived from automatic weather stations; ice  cover, ice movement, and sea surface temperatures derived  from a variety of satellite-based sensors; hydrographic  characteristics of the upper ocean and primary productivity  in the ice and in the water derived from research cruises  and satellite studies; vertical flux of organic material  and water movement derived from oceanographic moorings  containing sediment traps and current meters, and the  abundance, distribution, and respiration rates of  biological communities on the sea floor, derived from box  cores, benthic photographs and shipboard incubations.    Based on archived meteorological data, it is expected that  the atmospheric variability during the study period will be  such that changes in airflow pat terns and their influence  on oceanographic and biological patterns can be monitored,  and their direct and indirect linkages that are the focus  of the research can be deduced.  Results from this study  will contribute to our knowledge of atmospheric and oceanic  forcing of marine ecosystems, and lead to a better  understanding of marine ecosystem response to climatic  variations.  ***",
