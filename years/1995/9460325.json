 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary field tests by Plant Growth Development Corporation (PGDC) have established that dramatic increases in plant growth can be obtained by foliar treatments of plants with preparations of succinic acid derived from fermentation. Subsequent tests in the greenhouse have shown that fermentation succinic acid is much more active at stimulating plant growth than equivalent amounts of synthetic succinic acid. Analysis of other components in fermentation succinic acid preparations showed that gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is also an ingredient. Laboratory and greenhouse tests have shown that synthetic GABA stimulates plant growth, and that bioactivity is synergistically increased by combination with succinic acid. Although GABA is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, its function is unknown. Funding is being requested to establish the most effective way for using formulations containing GABA to increase plant growth and productivity, and to elucidate the mechanism of GABA bioactivity.",
