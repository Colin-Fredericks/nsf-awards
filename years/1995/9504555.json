The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad. Financial support for this award is from  the East Asia Pacific Program.    This award will partially support a fifteen month  postdoctoral research visit by David W. Akin to work with  John Laete'esafi, Organizer of the Kwaio Cultural Centre in  East Kwaio, Malaita, Solomon Islands.    This research is an anthropological study of how genderbased  inequality is being created and perpetuated in a situation  of rapid social change.  The PI will examine the  relationship between gender relations and change in belief  among the people of Kwaio in the Solomon Islands.  The  mountain Kwaio are the last major non-Christian group in the  Solomon Islands, and they continue to worship spirits of  their ancestors, that enforce a strict code of behavior.  However, the Kwaio have been steadily reinterpreting and  reshaping their beliefs to make them compatible with  changing social conditions.  Akin will test and refine a  hypothesis as to how particular aspects of this chanee are  taking place.  This is a study of the role of human agency  in processes of social transformation.  He will investigate  how incremental adjustments in belief and practice may, over  time, produce significant socio-structural change. ***",
