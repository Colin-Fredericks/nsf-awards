 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This study will attempt to determine the contributions of natural  and anthropogenic sources to particulate matter less than ten  microns (PM10) aerosol at McMurdo Station during the austral  summer.  The natural sources are expected to include geological  dust, much of what may be resuspended by activities at the  station, seasalt aerosol, and marine-biogenic sulfate.  The  contribution of Mt. Erebus is expected to be small.  The  principal anthropogenic sources of PM10 are expected to be  combustion-elated emissions from six diesel generators, diesel  heat furnaces, and diesel- and gasoline-powered support vehicles.  The emissions from each of the major sources will be sampled and  their trace element, ion, and elemental and organic carbon  composition characterized.  Concentrations of the chemical  components will also be determined in 48-hour duration PM10  aerosol samples collected continuously for two months in each of  two consecutive summers in central McMurdo and at one upwind site  (8-Site). The individual source contributions to PM10 will be  determined by Chemical Mass Balance receptor modeling using the  ambient sample concentrations and the source composition  profiles.  The results of this study will provide guidance for  emission reduction strategies at this and other Antarctic  research stations.",
