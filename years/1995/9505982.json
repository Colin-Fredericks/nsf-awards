 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505982  Ruiz  This proposal intends to evaluate the use of ICPMS and LA-ICPMS for the determination of trace elements, including rare earth elements (REE) in fluid inclusions.  Preliminary data shown in this proposal suggest that the bulk leachate analyses of well characterized samples are useful and also indicate that it is possible to analyze single fluid inclusions by LA-ICPMS.  perfecting these techniques may allow us to directly analyze fluids from various stages of hydrothermal systems which in turn will further our understanding of the transport of metals in ore-forming fluids.  We will accomplish three main goals during this study:  (1) fully develop the crush-leach ICPMS for analyzing bulk inclusions for REE and other petrologically and economically important trace metals, (2) evaluate the full potential of LA-ICPMS for the study of single fluid inclusions, (3) conduct a detailed ICPMS study on bulk fluid inclusions and LA-ICPMS study on single fluid inclusions from the Bingham, base metal porphyry system in order to determine which fluids carried the bulk of the metals in this system.  Bingham was chosen because it is very well studied and contains large inclusions in quartz.  Studies as the one proposed here are needed to constrain current debates on sources of metals in deposits associated with silicic magma systems.",
