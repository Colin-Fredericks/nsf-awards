 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421039  Rose  Sensory processing involves integration of timing from multiple  inputs converging on single cells, and production of precisely  timed outputs.  The structure of single neurons and the biophysical  properties of the cell membrane are fundamental features underlying  temporal mechanisms in neural circuits in the brain.  A valuable  system where these properties can be studied easily is in weakly  electric fish.  These small fish have an electric organ that they  discharge to produce an electric field around the animal; they  detect tiny electrical signals with sensitive electroreceptors all  over the body, and use this electrosense to detect objects in the  environment.  The electric organ can produce very precisely timed  repetitive discharges.  Within the midbrain is a remarkable  laminated structure called the torus semicircularis.  This  important center analyzes the spatial and temporal patterns of  electrosensory stimuli, and is involved in the behavioral response  of the animal to targets in the environment.  This project exploits  this unique system using sophisticated novel biophysical and  behavioral approaches to understand mechanisms of temporal  selectivity, the role of cellular morphology and laminated  assemblages in temporal filtering, the ways in which the same  central circuits contribute to different behavior in different  species, and how anticipatory behavior to repetitive stimuli can be  learned.  Results from this study will have an impact beyond simply  the interest in electrosense.  The temporal processing studies are  important for sensory and computational neuroscience, the  comparative discrimination studies for understanding the evolution  of neural circuits, the behavioral studies for understanding  sensorimotor control mechanisms, and the anticipatory behavior  study for understanding learning.",
