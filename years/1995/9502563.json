 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thrust of this proposal is on backward recovery schemes for  multicomputer and distributed systems.  The proposed research is  based on a two-level approach that uses a low overhead recovery  scheme to tolerate more probable failures, while the less probable  failures may be tolerated with a higher overhead.  By minimizing  the overhead for the more frequently occurring failure scenarios,  the proposed two-level approach will achieve lower average  performance overheads as compared to existing recovery schemes.   Objectives of the proposed research are 1) the design of efficient  two-level recovery schemes, 2) the development of optimization  techniques for two-level recovery schemes to determine various  parameters (e.g., checkpointing frequency) that willminimize the  average performance overhead fo the recovery scheme, 3) the  implementation of two level recovery schemes on a 64 processor  nCUBE-2 multicomputer and on a network of workstations, and 4) the  experimental evaluation of two-level recovery schemes to  demonstrate their ability to achieve better performance than the  existing recovery schemes.    The goal of the proposed education activities is to incorporate the  results of recent research into undergraduate and graduate  curriculum.  specific objectives fo the education plan are 1) the  development of an undergraduate introductory course on fault  tolerance and a graduate course on fault tolerance techniques for  parallel and distrubuted systems, 2) the development of an  associated undergraduate research effort, and 3) the development of  a software toolkit to facilitate experimetns in the proposed  courses.",
