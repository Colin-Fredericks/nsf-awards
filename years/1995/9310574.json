 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310574  Bender       As part of the U.S.JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study effort to  understand how physical forcing by the regional monsoons affects  marine primary production and the regional carbon budget, the PI  will carry out shipboard incubations of seawater samples to  estimate seasonal photosynthetic production rates of molecular  oxygen.  Because the oxygen and organic carbon produced during  photosynthesis are in a fixed proportion, these measurements will  provide indirect measurements of primary production by making  direct measurements of carbon.  Similar shipboard laboratory  studies will be carried out at different light levels to derive  quantitative relationships that would then permit the estimation  of in situ water column production rates from bio-optical data.  Additionally, in order to calculate how much of the oxygen  escapes to the atmosphere, the PI plans to make frequent  measurements of dissolved oxygen and argon (a non-reactive gas  that can be used as a mixing tracer) in the upper wind-mixed  water column along the cruise track.  The PI expects these  studies to provide major insights into the oxygen and carbon  dynamics of the Arabian Sea region and that these insights will  benefit our understanding of the global carbon cycle.  ***",
