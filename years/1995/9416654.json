This process of cell division is something which has fascinated scientists from the time that technological advancement permitted recognition of and viewing of, a cell.  For as long as cell division has been studied it has provide an intractable puzzle concerning the mechanism by which the cell precisely divides its cytoplasmic mass in two  Some experiments demonstrate that the cell cytoplasm acquires a memory as to where the site of cytoplasmic division will occur, where as other experiments demonstrate that by repositioning the machinery that divides the cell s genetic material (i.e., the DNA), the site of cytoplasmic division can be repositioned.  This study will reposition both the genetic components of the cell, as well as certain cytoplasmic components, employing tools of micromanipulation to make these minute adjustments.  In other cases, cells in the process of dividing will be subjected to centrifugal force to reposition the components within the ce ll.  These experiments will address whether the cell actually has a  memory  of the correct site for cytoplasmic division or whether that site can vary depending upon the position of other components within the cell. %%%  The proposal addresses the fundamental question as to how a cell divides.  One of the most central characteristic of life is that anything that is alive can reproduce.  This proposal examines the mechanisms of reproduction at the cellular level.  The proposed experiments will define the mechanisms that very precisely divide the mass of one cell into two daughter cells. ***                                                Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9416654                             Una Solomon                         Una Solomon                 @     i?                            @                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           @     i?                                                                                                    @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      1                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                          e 3       e                                                                               j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       =   1                                                                                                                           n   T       1   =                       j                                                                         =               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           7                                                                                                 9416654 Rappaport   The process by which one cell divides into two provides the basis for life of all unicellular and multicellular organisms.
