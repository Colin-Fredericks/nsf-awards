 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades, the look of state legislatures has changed dramatically.  Between 1975 and 1991 the number of women state legislatures more than doubled.  The number of African American state legislators increased by an even greater proportion.    This dissertation research seeks to examine the effects of the introduction of new groups on legislative behavior and outcomes. The general question to be addressed by this work:  What evidence is there that new groups change not only the way a state legislature looks but also the way a legislature acts?  Specifically, it focuses on the impact of black and women state legislators on legislative activities and products.  A 6 state database will be created and will contain information on the legislator, on bill content and disposition, and on legislative districts.  Specific research questions include:  Do females and racial minorities focus on different policy areas than do white male legislators?  Are they more supportive of certain policies than their counterparts?  Are they as successful in getting their bills passed?  Do blacks and women engage in coalition building to a greater or lesser extent?  Are particular stages of the legislative process a focus of activity by these newcomers?  What is the impact of constituency on the behavior of these legislators?",
