 "awd_abstract_narration": "Martin  9420651    New Heavy alkali and light alkaline earth thioborate glasses  will be prepared and characterized for the first time.  While having some similarity to the analogous oxide borates,  these glasses have striking differences, such as the  formation rate of six to eight tetrahedral borons per every  added sulfide anion compared to two tetrahedral borons for  the alkali oxide borate glasses.  This research will explore  the relationship between nanometer length scale effects of  intermediate-range order and physical properties of glass.  Raman, Nuclear Quad Resonance, and neutron scattering  spectroscopies will be used to probe longer range  structures.  Nanosecond time scale measurements (Giga hertz  frequencies) of the conductivity and of nuclear spin lattice  relaxation will be used to probe the relationship between  these properties that arise from cationhopping dynamics in  these fast ion conducting glasses.  An attempt will be made  to develop a new class of chemically robust fast ion  conducting glasses that push the suitability envelope for  these materials in elechochemical applications.  The  proposed research seeks to probe deeper into the structure  of glass, long length scales, and farther back into the  dynamics of cation motion, shorter time scales, than ever  before.  These chaecognide glasses provide a nearly perfect  template upon which these experiments can be staged.  %%%  New heavy alkali and light alkaline earth thioborate glasses  will be prepared and characterized.  The research will be  aimed to explore the relationship between nanometer length  scale effects and physical properties of glasses.  ***",
