The intent of this program is to encourage the early development  of academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The research  this investigator plans to conduct is directed toward determining  the effects of biologically produced polymers on the rate at  which aggregates form and settle from aqueous suspension.  He  plans on characterizing the aggregation process by comparing a  relatively clean system using polystyrene microspheres with one  involving exocellular polysaccharides produced by heterotrophic  bacteria.  The investigator's education plan centers on  modernizing the laboratory component of a core undergraduate  course on microbial processes and coordinating this with other  laboratory based courses in the environmental core involving  physical and chemical processes.    The research this investigator plans on conducting is expected to  be used in improving procedures used in the engineering design of  processes for removal of particles originally present in aqueous  suspension or produced during water and wastewater treatment  processes.  The goal of the educational component of this project  is to provide undergraduate engineering students illustrations of  the fundamental relationships that exist between chemical and  microbial systems used in environmental engineer practice.  ***",
