 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417963  Freidel    Rapid and extreme climatic fluctuations have occurred commonly  during the past 250 thousand years, although infrequently during  the Holocene.  Information regarding the mechanisms that controlled  past climatic fluctuations and the hydraulic response to such  events will aid in understanding possible future climate change.   This study will investigate the timing and climatic significance of  an oscillation in lake level of two paleolake sub-basins that  occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition of Lake  Chewaucan, south-central Oregon.  Two hypotheses will be tested  concerning possible causes of the lake-level oscillation:  (1)  The  oscillation was caused by increased precipitation during a brief  period when the mean position of the jet stream core was located  over the study area, as it migrated north following the rapidly  melting Pleistocene ice sheets, sometime after 13,800 yrs B.P.  (radiocarbon years before present) but before 11,000 yrs. B.P.  (2)  The oscillation was caused by cooler temperatures and increased  effective moisture associated with the Younger Dryas reversal in  deglaciation, after 11,000 yrs B.P. but before 10,000 yrs B.P.   Information to test these two hypotheses will be obtained by  excavating across a fan of sediment that was deposited along the  shore of one sub-basin lake when an adjacent sub-basin lake filled  and overflowed across the sill between the two Lakes.  Radiocarbon-  datable materials will be collected in the fan sediments, as well  as along the shorelines associated with the1 overflow in both sub-  basins.  This study is part of on-going research to investigate the  past climate of the Pacific Northwest during the Late Pleistocene  and Holocene, in order to learn more about the relationship between  climate, atmospheric circulation patterns, and surface hydrology  during a period of rapid climate change.",
