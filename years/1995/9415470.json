 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dunnell    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Dunnell, Mr. James Truncer will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct both  neutron Activation and electron microprobe analysis on a series  of steatite samples collected from a number of prehistoric  quarries in the U.S. Middle Atlantic States. He will also conduct  similar analyses on archaeological objects manufactured from this  material. Steatite is a soft rock which was widely used by  prehistoric peoples and was carved into cooking vessels and  nonutilitarian objects. Because steatite is fairly uncommon in  nature, because it is located in discrete outcrops which are  often widely separated and because chemical composition is  variable, Mr. Truncer hopes to develop a means to chemically and  mineralogically distinguish outcrops. This would allow steatite  artifacts recovered in archaeological sites to be linked to  source areas. Preliminary work he has conducted suggests that  such a goal is feasible.    Archaeologists have learned that even early hunter and gatherer  groups did not live in isolation but were linked into regional  networks. Just how these larger organizations functioned, how far  they extended and how they changed over time is unknown. The  study of trade networks provides direct insight into this process  and steatite, if it can be sourced, can be used for this purpose.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  information of interest to archaeologists who work in the U.S.  Mid-Atlantic states. It will help to develop a technique of  widespread potential use and it will assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.",
