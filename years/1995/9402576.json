 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to extend  logics  that combine constructive and classical reasoning in verifying  programs.  The long-term aim is to make type-theory-based systems  more  applicable to the kinds of programming used in large and  existing systems while  still maintaining the power and conceptual  unity of type theory.    The  proposed logic will combine a specification language with a  formal logic of  verified programs.  The logic will support a wide  spectrum of styles, including  higher-order functions, simple and  substructure assignment, and destructive  operations on  parameters.    To build the logic, previous work in  mixed-constructive  theories is extended, where an evidence-based (constructive) semantics  is  augmented by classical operations, as suppressed or oracle  computations.  The interactions of the constructive and classical  parts of a proof are limited  so that the constructive parts of  the proofs do not depend computationally on  the classical parts  of the proofs.  Our work in applicative and simple  imperative  versions of such logics show that such logics are natural and  robust.  The proposed project will advance the state of knowledge  in the field  by helping to generate methods for verification that  are better-integrated with  the activity of programming.",
