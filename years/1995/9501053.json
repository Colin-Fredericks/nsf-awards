 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aktosun DMS-9501053  It is proposed to investigate the inverse  scattering problems arising in quantum mechanics and wave  propagation by studying the Schroedinger equation when the  potential is independent of energy and when the potential is  proportional to energy. The inverse problem consists of the  determination of the potential when the scattering operator is  known. By formulating this as a Riemann-Hilbert problem in the  momentum space, it is proposed to study the solvability of the  Riemann-Hilbert problem, the characterization of the scattering  data, the role of the bound states, and the stability of the  inversion.  The solution of the inverse scattering problem with  energy-independent potentials corresponds to the determination of  molecular, atomic, and nuclear forces in terms of the scattering  data obtained in collision experiments; the determination of  these forces is not only important in quantum mechanics but it is  also one of the fundamental problems in physics. The inverse  scattering problem with energy-dependent potentials arises in  wave propagation in a nonhomogeneous medium, and it is equivalent  to determining the properties of the medium by analyzing the  waves scattered from the medium. This problem has many important  applications in acoustics, seismology, nondestructive testing,  oil exploration, atmospheric profile inversion, and other areas  where the measurements taken outside the medium are used to  predict the properties of the medium.",
