The developmentally regulated shuttle craft (stc)  gene encodes such a protein. The main objective of this proposal is  to determine the functional role of STC protein in egg chambers and  embryos using a combination of cell biological, molecular and  genetic approaches.   The PI in the course of this award will:  1) clone and sequence the two existing EMS-induced stc alleles and  the Drosophila virilis stc gene to identify essential and conserved  structural motifs, 2) use the new FLP-FRT recombination system to  generate marked mutant clones that have lost function, and 3).  determine whether stc protein is differentially processed.  The  human homologue to stc has recently been reported.  It is NF-X1, a  gamma interferon-inducible human transaription factor.  The  identification of this homolog will help the PI to distinguish  important structural motifs in the shuttle craft protein and  identify its targets.  The PI has also identified that one of his  stc mutants has CNS defects in late embryonic development that  appear to be defects in axonal guidance; this phenotype will aid  his experimental design.",
