 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated circuits, and the computers they drive, introduced a  new era in electronics. Each year faster, more powerful computers  are produced increasing the demand for a skilled work force and  an educated public. Increasing an awareness about manufacturing  processes in the semiconductor and computer industries is an  educational challenge_one which is hindered by the loss of visual  imagery due to the inaccessibility of industrial sites to  students, educators and the public.    The SILICON RUN two-part series addresses this educational  challenge by capturing the rich images of manufacturing on  film/video to provide a clear overview of semiconductor and  computer manufacturing. SILICON RUN I, produced in 1986, explores  crystal growth, the effects of doping, CMOS transistors, and the  design and fabrication of IC wafers. The recently completed  SILICON RUN II continues with testing, packaging, printed circuit  board and system assembly, and multi-chip module technology. The  series is being used for education and training; thousands of  students in universities, colleges and technical schools are  viewing these films/videos every year.    The many changes in technology since the completion of SILICON  RUN I make it necessary to update the first film with the  production of SILICON RUN I.2.  The goal of this project is to  re-film the industrial manufacturing footage so the series can  continue providing students with viable information about today's  manufacturing. Responses from recipients' surveys overwhelmingly  show that the series is an asset to undergraduate education.",
