 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401249  Hittle  The objective of this research project is to increase the  efficiency of control methods for energy systems in buildings.  IN meeting this objective, novel combinations of feedback  controllers and neural network learning algorithms will be  developed.    to achieve the objective, recent developments in reinforcement  learning methods for neural networks will be adapted to the HVAC  system control problem.  Neural networks will not be the sole  source of control decisions for such a complex system.  Adaptive  schemes are notorious for leading to instabilities.  to lessen  the possibility of introducing instability, adaptive schemes will  be integrated with existing, fixed controllers.  the adaptive  methods will only augment the control actions taken by the fixed  controllers and a limit will be enforced on the degree to which  the fixed controller's decision can be modified.  This will  result in a control system with an initial performance at the  level provided by the original control designer.  Then, with  experience, the learning mechanism will be able to increase the  performance of the controller beyond its initial ability.    Results will certainly be of interest to building engineers, but  will also advance the sate-of-the-art in neural networks for  control.  ***",
