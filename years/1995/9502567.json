 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502567  Strganac  This is a career award for young  engineering investigators.  A  program of  research and associated  education is undertaken which  examines the dynamic interaction of  fluids, structures, and control  systems are insufficient because  these systems inherently contain  structural and flow-induced  nonlinearities.  The nonlinearities  result from unsteady flow sources,  large strain-displacement  conditions, and partial loss of  structural or control integrity,  and, as a consequence, these  systems exhibit nonlinear dynamic  response characteristics such as  limit cycle oscillations, internal  resonances, and chaotic motions.    This project consists of both  theoretical and experimental  elements.  Research objectives  include the development of an  analytical model for the nonlinear  fluid-structure-control system, the  development of adaptive control  models for the fluid-structure-  control system with time-varying  distributed parameters, and the  supporting investigation through  several experiments developed to  substantiate and improve the  theoretical models.  Two analytical  models will be used as a basis for  the theoretical research: a  nonlinear aeroelastic system  constrained to finite modes of  motion, and is a structural system  exposed to fluid flow and  distributed damage of the control  system.  Experiments will be  carried out to investigate the  active control with distributed  actuators and the adaptive control  of time-varying control systems.  Innovative methods to measure and  identify system characteristics and  stability behavior will also be  explored.  ***",
