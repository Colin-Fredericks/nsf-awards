 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526497  Stiglich    This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a planning visit  by Dr. Jacob J. Stiglich of Materials Modification, Inc.  (MMI), Fairfax, Virginia, to go to Mexico to meet with Dr.  Lorenzo Martinez at the National Autonomous University of  Mexico in Cuernavaca.  They will define an international  cooperative research project between the two organizations  involving advanced wear and corrosion resistant coating  technology.  There are three areas which are of interest to  both sides.  They are: 1. Wear and corrosion resistant  coatings by pulsed electrode deposition; 2. Solid lubricant  materials; and 3. Nanoparticles which can be adapted to  photovoltaic uses. MMI has begun prototype coating  activities with emphasis on wear resistance provided by WC  and Cr carbides based coatings.  The Mexican institute will  significantly extend these testing and characterization  activities.  Because petrochemicals and mining are essential  components of Mexico's economic base, the two groups will be  able to work on the wear and corrosion problems which Mexico  faces in that environment.  MMI can then take the data and  results of this research to U.S. counterpart industries.  ***",
