 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507180  Baldwin  Leaf damage by herbivores in Nicotiana sylvestris  (Solanaceae) produces a damage signal which dramatically  increases de novo nicotine synthesis in the roots.  The  increased synthesis leads to increases in whole-plant  nicotine pools, which in turn make plants more resistant to  further herbivore attack.  Because signal production and the  response to the signal occur in widely separated tissues,  this whole-plant induced defense represents an ideal system  in which to study the signal transduction cascade and how  the biotic and abiotic environment influence this induced  defense.  It has been demonstrated that the damage signal  has the characteristics of a slow-moving phloem-transported  chemical cue and that jasmonic acid (JA), an octadecanoid-  derived cyclopentanone, is an important component of the  damage signal transduction pathway in this induced defense.  In this project Dr. Baldwin will critically examine the  hypothesis that wounding increases shoot JA pools which  either directly through transport or indirectly through a  systemin-like signal increase root JA pools, which, in turn  stimulate root nicotine synthesis and increase whole-plant  nicotine pools.  To achieve this objective Dr. Baldwin will  determine the chirality of the induced jasmonate pools in  shoot and roots, examine the plant's nicotine responses to  intermediates in the octadecanoid pathway and synthesize  jasmonates in the native stereoconfigurations.  By  understanding the processes responsible for signal  generation and transport it may be possible to understand  how herbivores consume plants \"stealthily\" and apparently  lessen the induced defenses activated by their feeding.",
