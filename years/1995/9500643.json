Other research to be performed involves   wavelets for trigonometric splines and for splines on triangulations, quasi-interpolation   by trigonometric splines, splines on quadrangulations, adaptive knot removal and   insertion for bivariate splines, and fitting of data in many variables.    In the past 30 years, spline functions have become a well-established computational tool,   and are now widely used by scientists and engineers. They are used for a variety of   purposes, including approximating complicated curves and surfaces, fitting data,   computer-aided geometric design (CAGD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM),   solution of differential equations, image processing, etc. The aim of this research is to   develop new spline tools, and to create algorithms for solving some specific applications   problems, especially problems arising in CAGD, CAM, geology, geophysics, and   meteorology.",
