 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421969  Celik-Bulter  The principal investigators will explore the non-superconducting phases of YBa2Cu3Ox thin films for uncooled infrared  detection applications.  The long term goal is to build thermal imaging arrays on micromachined silicon structures with high thermal isolation and therefore high responsivity.  This would enable the fabrication of integrated circuits where radiation detection and signal processing are performed on the same chip.  These infrared detectors will utilize the oxygen deficient phase of YBa2Cu3Ox(x=6) and will be operated at or near room temperature.  Two different thin film, thermal detector structures will be tried: semiconductor bolometers and pyroelectric capacitors.  The bolometers will be made of semiconducting YBa2Cu3Ox on SiO2 or Si3N4 and exhibit a high rate of resistance change with temperature dR/dT.       The significance of the proposed research lies in the fact that proposed detectors operators at room temperature without refrigeration.  They are relatively easy and inexpensive to fabricate and compatible with silicon technology since they can be deposited at ambient temperature by rf sputtering.  It is projected that the proposed research will lead to a better understanding of  the electronic properties of nonsuperconducting YBa2Cu3Ox and their dependence upon oxygen stoichiometry.  This proposal will be also be the first time where Yba2Cu3Ox IR detectors will be fabricated on air-gap bridge structures.  Since the proposed devices do not require cooling for operation and can be fabricated using inexpensive techniques and materials, it will be less costly for defense applications and more suitable for civilian needs such as night-time navigation, security or biomedical thermal imaging.  Their cryogenic counterparts, superconducting bolometers and HgCdTe photovoltaic or photoconductive devices are expensive to fabricate costly to operate.    The proposed research will be in collaboration with Texas Instruments Inc. and University of North Texas.  ***",
