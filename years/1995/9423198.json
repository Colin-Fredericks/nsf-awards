 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meltzer    The goal of this research is to conduct intensive archaeological  and geophysical survey and testing at Gibson Ranch which is located  near Earth, Texas. Dr. Meltzer will attempt to determine whether  archaeological materials of Altithermal age (ca 7,500 to 5,000  before the present) occur. The work will focus on a ca. 125,000  meter square area of the draw and use ground penetrating radar to  examine the buried Altithermal surface for traces of water wells  and other humanly produced features. Any detected features will be  checked in test trenches/excavations. A surface survey of the  surrounding dune fields and uplands will also be conducted to  search for associated habitation sites. The goal of the research is  to determine whether humans groups occupied the area during the  Altithermal and, if so, to map their extent of their archaeological  sites. Dr Meltzer will collect preliminary data on site age,  artifacts, paleoecological and sedimentary context.     Humans were clearly present in the New World by at least 12,000  years ago. Over the succeeding period climate changed dramatically  and has been marked by periods both warmer and cooler than today.  Archaeologists wish to understand how humans adapt to and make use  of their environment and the archaeological and geological records  which provide long term information on environmental change and  human response. They thus provide an excellent context to study  such questions. The Altithermal is a particularly interesting  period because it marks an extreme fluxuation. On the High Plains  of the U.S., temperatures peaked, evapotranspiration increased and  effective rainfall decreased. Where most pronounced, loss of soil  moisture and reduced vegetative cover triggered sediment  weathering, arroyo cutting, and dust and dune accumulation. In  areas hardest hit, lakes shrank or evaporated and aquifer recharge  failed to keep pace with discharge. There were also changes in  flora and fauna. This situation provides an excellent co ntext to  understand how human adapt in extreme conditions and such is the  goal of Dr. Meltzer's research.",
