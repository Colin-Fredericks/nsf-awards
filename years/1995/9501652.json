 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501652  Chong         The research aspect of this proposal deals with issues in  decision, control, and optimization problems for Discrete Event  Systems (DESs).  DESs are dynamical systems that are driven by  the occurrence of physical events, and arise in virtually all  manmade systems, including manufacturing systems, communication  networks, distributed computer systems, logistic systems, and  vehicular traffic.  The proposal considers performance oriented  DES models, and focuses on the problem decision and control for  performance optimization.  Methods for optimizing DESs have  received significant interest in recent years, and show  tremendous promise for the development of efficient ways to  optimize large-scale complex man-made systems.       The proposal focuses on parametric and nonparametric  decision and control problems.  An objective of the study is to  couple perturbation analysis methods with optimization  algorithms, both parametric and nonparametric, with the aim of  gaining further rigorous understanding into when and why they  work, and developing algorithms and tools that will be useful in  DES decision and control problems.  This work emphasizes  applications in manufacturing systems, communication networks,  and real-time computer systems.       The education component of this proposal focuses on three  efforts.  The first effort is to develop and promote a program of  undergraduate involvement in research, through individual or team  projects.  The second effort consists of developing a  comprehensive research program and curriculum in the area of  modern control, including laboratory facilities for  experimentation and computing. The third effort concerns the  principal investigator's ongoing work in the professional  development and training of engineering students, primarily in  his capacity of as the branch counselor and faculty advisor of  the Purdue IEEE student branch.  ***",
