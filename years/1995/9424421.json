 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves research in Ramsey Theory, the theory of compact left topological semigroups, and their interactions. Significant results in Ramsey Theory have been obtained by utilizing the algebraic structure of the space of all ultrafilters on a discrete semigroup. As a compact left topological semigroup, this space possesses an algebraic structure. This structure leads to strong combinatorial results. Conversely, combinatorial results have been applied to improve the understanding of this algebraic structure.     This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as thus occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. Ramsey Theory is the branch of discrete mathematics which deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any suitably large subset). It began as an applied subject and has continued to find applications to fields as diverse as logic, game theory and analysis.",
