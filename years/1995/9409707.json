 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409707  Newey    This project develops improved inference procedures for some  frequently used econometric methods.  The goal is to find  approximations that improve on the usual large sample approach,  and that are easy to implement.  The proposal includes two  specific projects and extensions.  The projects are:  bootstrapping for generalized methods of moments estimation and  selecting the number of instrumental variables.         Generalized method of moments estimation is widely applied  in econometrics, so that reliable inference methods are needed.   It is known that the usual large sample inferences do not work  well in some cases.  This project develops an improvement using  bootstrap methods.  The improvement will require a modification  of well known bootstrap methods.  It is based on sampling from a  distribution that imposes the same moment restrictions as the  estimator, which is different than the usual bootstrap.  The  usefulness of the proposed methods will be illustrated by  empirical and simulation examples.  The proposed research will  also consider extensions of the approach to other models such as  those where conditional moment restrictions are imposed.         The project also considers inference with instrumental  variables.  Instrumental variables estimators are one of the most  widely applied types of generalized method of moments estimators.   An important practical problem is the choice of the number of  instrumental variables to use in particular applications.  The  problem is of particular interest in the recent literature on  estimation of \"program evaluation\" models, where instrumental  variables are used to approximate the conditional probability of  being treated.  This research will use an asymptotic mean-square  error criteria to derive some simple rules for choosing the  number of instrumental variables.  The efficacy of the selection  rule will be considered in empirical and simulation examples.   Also this research will be extended to consider rules for   choosing the number of variables in other models, such as the  sample selection model that has been widely used in econometrics.",
