 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9422061  Givant  Mills College, in collaboration with Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges and The George Washington  University plans to develop and operate a consortium of three programs to increase the number  of women who pursue and obtain advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences, and who  become active members and leaders of the mathematical community.  Growing out of the efforts  of the Mills Summer Mathematics Institute (1991-94), the consortium is a unified effort to bring  undergraduate women into mathematics at the highest levels.  It is the first major effort of its  type.  It will directly involve 48 women students.  Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges jointly propose  a four-week summer program for 18 students at the freshman-sophomore level, with the focus on  conjecture and proof, as well as on the use of mathematical software for problem solving.  The  other two components of the consortium are aimed mainly at students at the end of their junior  year. The George Washington University proposes a four-week summer program in which 10  outstanding undergraduate women will be immersed in intensive short courses which will lead  them to interesting open problems.  Mills College will continue to develop and operate its  Summer Mathematics Institute, a six-week program for 20 excelling women math majors.   Students will take 2 or four seminars; each seminar will be led by a woman who is an active  research  mathematician.  Interactive, discovery learning and work on difficult problems will lead  to mathematical understanding.  All three programs will provide advice and information about  graduate school and careers in mathematics.  Among the most valuable aspects of the consortium  is the emphasis placed by each program on involving active women mathematicians as instructors,  TAs, and mentors.  The consortium will create a network of women mathematicians: faculty,  graduate students, and undergraduates, who will support and inspire each other to high  achievement.",
