 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455826  Amend  This grant supports preparation of a proposal for a major systemic  curriculum project that will place students at the center of their  learning experience, and will encourage both faculty and students  to (1) discuss and understand the importance of applied chemistry  in our society; (2) participate in activities that encourage  exploration and cooperative learning; (3) engage in a greater  diversity of instructional strategies; and (4) exploit the role of  new technologies as a means of implementing these approaches to  learning.  The curricular materials to be developed will be based  on a three-part balance between (1) the factual aspects of  chemistry (content), (2) the role of chemistry in our daily lives,  and (3) the process by which information is located and discovered,  and by which problems are solved. It is the intent of this project  to develop a wide variety of resources which will draw students  into all three of the above aspects of chemistry, and from which  faculty may select material that best serves their own students and  their interests and talents.  Proposal development will focus on  (a) content and concept sequencing, (b) appropriate use of  technology, (c) educational strategies, and (d) a structure for  dissemination, faculty workshops, presentations and publications.",
