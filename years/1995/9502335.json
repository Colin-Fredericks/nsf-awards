 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502335  Yang   Silicon Carbide (SiC)-reinforced Aluminum (Al) alloys are attracting considerable attentions from many industries including automotive and electronic industries.  However, their widespread applications are limited by their high cost.  The objective of this proposed research is to study a potentially low-cost fabrication method recently invented in the Principal Investigator's (PI) laboratory.  Using this method, a near-net-shape composite of SiC-Al-Si can be produced by simply dipping a porous SiC preform into an Al-Si alloy in an open-air atmosphere, without needing vacuum or external pressure.  To understand the infiltration mechanism, a systematic study of the infiltration conditions will be conducted.  These conditions include the infiltration temperature, alloy compositions, atmospheres inside the SiC preform and outside the aluminum alloy bath, the binders, and structures of the SiC preforms.  Specific experiments will be carried out to study the infiltration mechanisms.  The structures and properties of the composites and their relationships with the infiltration conditions will be studied.  Mathematical and computer modeling of the thermodynamics and kinetics of infiltration's will also be conducted.  Finally the infiltration conditions will be optimized.  Completion of this research project should provide valuable information for understanding this unique infiltration phenomenon.  It will also improve our understanding of the general phenomenon of pressureless infiltration of molten metals into porous ceramic preforms.  At the education front, one problem facing our classroom instruction is that the students are not offered enough opportunities to relate the basic theories from the textbooks to the real problems encountered in the industries.  To remedy this problem,  more real problems related to materials manufacturing and processing will be taken into the classrooms.  A cross-disciplinary course on materials manufacturing and processing for undergraduate students from  various engineering programs is the expected contribution to education innovation.   Integrating industrial problems into manufacturing education can prepare the students for a better understanding of the relevance of their basic science and engineering courses.  Consequently, these future manufacturing engineers gain the practical knowledge necessary to effectively contribute to engineering solutions to real world problems in their future jobs.  The research results of a simple, innovative process to infiltrate aluminum alloy into Silicon Carbide preform has the potential to bring down the manufacturing cost of this metal matrix composite significantly.  As a result, cast iron may be replaced by a stronger and lighter composite (especially important for transportation industry) heralding an era of a much broader application of composites.",
