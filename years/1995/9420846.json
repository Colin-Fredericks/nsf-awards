The ISI meeting includes the meetings of the Bernoulli Society, International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS), and the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE).  Thus it is an umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for thousands of Statisticians.  The travel grant will provide partial support to defray transportation costs for individuals selected from institutions and non-profit associations.  An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide the opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in the meeting.  ASA proposes to make twenty travel grants available, with the major emphasis on providing partial travel support to individuals who received their Ph.D. after 1984.  The grant recipients will be primarily engaged in the meeting activities as invited speakers, discussants, organizers, and presenters of contributed papers.  Examples of titles of some of the papers presented in 1993 include, \"Object Oriented Methods in Statistics - Graphical Construction and Editing of Plots\" \"The Strata of Random Mappings,\" \"Bayesian Analysis of Space-Time Evolution of Earthquakes,\" and \"Time Series Applications of Astronomy and Meteorology.\"     The American Statistical Association (ASA) requests a travel grant for 20 United States participants to attend the 50th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Beijing, China from August 21-29, 1995.
