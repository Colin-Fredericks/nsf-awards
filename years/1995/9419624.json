 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents a combined Instrument Development for  Biological Research and a Multi-User Biological Equipment and  Instrumentation Resources grant application focused on analytical  ultracentrifugation. This technique has a wide range of applications:  molecular weight analysis, the characterization of molecular shapes and  conformational changes, buoyant density separations and the evaluation  of association constants from both sedimentation equilibrium and  velocity data. Beckman Instruments has developed a new digitally  equipped \"state of the art\" XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. This  instrumentation coupled with the development of very powerful software  for data analysis has generated a renaissance in sedimentation  analysis. As the research demand for analytical ultracentrifuge  measurements increases, and institutions are faced with limited  resources for equipment, it becomes very important to consider  techniques that can increase the efficiency of instrument usage and  approaches that advance the analytical capabilities of sedimentation  analysis. The P.I. proposes to pursue the above objectives by using  gradient forming cells for the rapid establishment of sedimentation  equilbrium thereby increasing instrument efficiency enormously and by  developing computational software for the determination of diffusion  coefficents using band centrifugation. The following specific aims are  proposed for the developmental part of this grant application:  1. The fabrication and testing of a six step double sector gradient  forming centerpiece to achieve rapid sedimentation equilibrium.  Equilibrium times will be determined for molecular weight sets of  spherical proteins; DNA fragments and plasmids.  2. A simultaneous determination od the sedimentation coefficient and  diffusion coefficient would provide a rapid evaluation of the molecular  weight of a macromolecule. Computational programs will be developed to  test the Vinograd and Bruner (1) proposed band centrifugation moment  re lationships for the measurement of diffusion coefficents. The band  centrifugation analysis will be compared with other sedimentation  approaches for obtaining diffusion coefficients.          An XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge is essential to accomplish the above  specific aims. This instrumentation will also support the research  needs of six other investigators at UAB and their research proposals  represent the multi-user part of this application. The major users  consist of faculty from the Microbiology, Biochemistry, Cell Biology,  and the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics.    The Principal Investigator of the grant is Dr. Jacob Lebowitz who has  30 years experience in analytical ultracentrifugation. Most recently  the P.I. has spent a month at the National Analytical Ultracentrifuge  Facility gaining experience using the NON-LIN program for the analysis  of sedimentation equilibrium data for self-associating systems. In  addition the P.I. has gained experience in the van Holde-Weischet  method for the analysis of boundary sedimentation velocity data. The  P.I. is now in an excellent position to rapidly apply the XL-A and data  analysis for the research problems of the major users and believes that  all the projects proposed in the application can be very significantly  assisted by analytical ultracentrifugation. The P.I. believes that the  operation of the XL-A and the computational analysis of the data can  and should be part of the training of biological scientists working on  structure-function problems. The best resolution of research problems  rests with those research personnel who will be most directly in need  of the results from the sedimentation alalysis. The laboratories of the  major users of the XL-A will be required to enroll either a  postdoctoral associate or graduate student in a laboratory/lecture  course in analytical ultracentrifugation. This training will build a  network of investigators that can share knowledge and these individuals  can be called upon to assist new  users in the operation of the XL-A and  in data analysis. After 2 years long term maintenance of the XL-A will  be on cost sharing basis provided by the major users. The P.I. believes  that the above combination of training and cost sharing will insure the  long term use of the XL-A instrumentation. In summary this combined  development and multi-user application will provide new developments  for sedimentation analysis, assist important research programs and  develop in young scientists an expertise in analytical  ultracentrifugaton.",
