 "awd_abstract_narration": "EEC-9521645  Mahajan    CAMPmode (Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Packaging of  Microwave, Optical and Digital Electronics), is establishing an NSF  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) to conduct  interdisciplinary research in computer-aided designs, packaging and  manufacturing technologies needed for high quality, low cost  production of microwave/millimeter-wave, optical and digital  electronic systems.    The MIMICAD Center was established in 1988 at the University of  Colorado as an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research  (I/UCRC) to provide a knowledge base for microwave/millimeter-wave  integrated system design methodologies and CAD tools.  Working  cooperatively with a number of defense oriented companies and  government organizations, the Center has been successful in  fulfilling its stated purpose.  Over the last few years, however,  the Center has been undergoing a change, just as its sponsoring  companies have been.  There is a perceptible shift in the defense  industry from military to commercial applications.  As a result, a  predominantly defense oriented R&D base in microwave electronics  must evolve into one with more balance between commercial and  defense applications.  A significant growth is expected in the  commercial applications which would require a synergistic  interaction of microwave/millimeter-wave technologies with high  speed digital and optical electronics.  However, effectiveness in  gaining a market share in these markets depends on the ability to  produce not only cost effective designs but very importantly high  quality, low cost packaging and manufacture of these electronic  systems.  To meet these evolving needs, MIMICAD members have merged  with another industry consortium to form a new Center, CAMPmode.   This will facilitate closer cooperation between design, packaging  and manufacturing research.  This will broaden the expertise base  and provide enhanced value to customers in digital electronics,  optics and RF communica tion markets.    The Center will provide enhancements in curriculum through  development of cross-disciplinary courses, and provide students  valuable research training in this important technical area.    As part of the NSF-I/UCRC proposal, the Center requests support  from NSF towards a female undergraduate student in Electrical and  Computer Engineering.  The student will conduct research in the  computational electromagnetics research group.",
