 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program is directed at determining the global  geometry of the open magnetosphere and its connection to the  ionosphere.  The program will build on much of the proposing team's  prior work as well as related work of others.  Four programmatic  elements are:  1.  analyses of IMP 8 plasma and field data to  specify and document the open geometry of the tail; 2. comparisons  of these results with global MHD simulations to test simulation  applicability and to extend the description of the open geometry to  the full magnetosphere; 3. comparisons of both observational and  simulation results with appropriately constructed, multi-component  superposition models to elucidate the magnetic topology of the open  geometry at higher resolution than obtainable with the MHD model;  and 4. extend the LLBL-ionosphere coupling model of Siscoe, Lotko,  Sonnerup, and Maynard to incorporate the new geometry.  A focusing  objective for the stated program, to determine the global open  geometry of the magnetosphere, is to ascertain explicitly the 3-  dimensional geometry of the topological separatrices of the  magnetic field, of which there might be several sets of distinct  topological types.  This will be done for various orientations of  the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), including northward, which  perhaps poses the greatest challenge.  Locating these topological  features relative to the geometry of the main structural elements  of the magnetosphere will bear directly on answers to the following  questions:  Where are the sites of magnetic reconnection at the  magnetopause and in the tail?  How do they fit within the global  geometry?  What is the geometrical distribution of the open and  closed regions on the 3-D magnetospheric boundary:  The answer to  this last question bears directly on the question of the spatial  relationships between the dayside  cusp, the low-latitude boundary  layer (LLBL), and the plasma mantle, and on the question of whether  the LLBL is open or closed.",
