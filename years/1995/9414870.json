 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constructed almost seventy years ago and last renovated more than 40 years later, Chandler Laboratories on the Columbia University campus will undergo significant renovation with the support of NSF.  The project will renew the obsolete heating, ventilation/exhaust, electrical distribution, plumbing and fire protection systems and renovate research laboratories in the oldest research wing of the Chemical Science Center.  The facilities currently house the research activity of eight faculty whose work examines synthesis, physical organic chemistry, the chemistry of natural products, organic photochemistry, and structural theory, and whose research activity has been limited by deteriorating and obsolete systems.   The project will replace obsolete and defective steam radiators with a hydronic fan coil system, increase the capacity of air handling systems, boost fume hood exhaust capacity to assure appropriate safety measures, install a new electric distribution system, replace 67-year old plumbing for water, steam, gas and compressed air, build a corridor fire separation system, and remove all asbestos ceiling tiles.   Building renovations will substantially improve the research environment for 8 faculty, and the 53 post docs, 65 graduate students, and 13 undergraduates who work with them.  In addition, it will significantly enhance the department's effort to recruit new faculty to premier projects in computer-based visualization and computation, biotechnology, and advanced materials.  The facilities will strengthen research in these areas and research relationships with other academic institutions and with the pharmaceutical, computer and telecommunications industries.",
