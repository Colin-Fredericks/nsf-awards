This project funds a  dedicated computer laboratory for the purposes of teaching these  necessary and requisite research and statistics skills.   With a  teaching laboratory with 16 student and 1 faculty computer  stations, a facility is available to allow the implementation of  an integrated research curriculum centered around computer  applications.   This teaching laboratory is utilized by three  required and two optional undergraduate courses that have been  coordinated to lead students through a cumulative, integrated  research course sequence in such a way that they move from lack  of knowledge to ability to conduct research and data analyses  with minimal faculty supervision.",
