 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511941  Jones  The field of molecular analysis of the structure of arthropod venom  proteins has recently made rapid advances that appear to  interrelate what were previously isolated lines of research.  Up to  the present, there has never been an international format to bring  together international researchers and students investigating the  molecular structure of protein toxins in arthropod venoms.  The  objective of organizing such a gathering has now been accomplished  with the scheduled symposium of principle investigator speakers,  for which funding support has been identified.  It is highly  appropriate that this next generation of students observe, and  better yet, be involved with, the formulation of ideas for future  directions of the field that will come from the gestation of the  discussions of their mentoring principle investigators at this  first of its kind symposium.  However, full funding has not yet  been identified for a proposed graduate and postdoctoral poster  session in connection with the parent symposium.  The proposal  seeks the remaining partial support for the cost of participation  of graduate and postdoctoral students, including women and minority  students, that is necessary to enable the proposed poster session  to be established and attended by the students.  %%%    Predatory and parasitic arthropod inject a wide variety of venoms  and toxins into tissues of their prey or hosts.  These venom  proteins and toxins cause a range of physiological effects, but  their exact mechanisms of action are not well understood.  At the  1995 Pan American meeting of the International Society of  Toxinology, there will be a symposium that brings together for the  first time the major national and international researchers who are  studying the molecular structure and action of these proteins.   Toward the education of a next generation of researches in this  area, a companion poster session for students will be held, in part  under the sponsorship of the National Science Founda tion.  Through  their attendance of the symposium by their participation in this  poster session, the students will become exposed to the scientific  methods and results used by the major researchers in the field.  In  addition, the students will be exercised in the presentation of  research to colleagues in the field, and will also have the  opportunity to meet with the major researchers whose labs the  students may seek to join in higher postdoctoral training.  ***",
