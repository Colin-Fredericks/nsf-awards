 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554567  Flournoy    The Chemistry and Statistics  Departments of the American  University (TAU), located in the  nation's capital, plan to recruit  five doctoral students with  potential for superior  accomplishments to study chemistry  and statistics and develop an  interdisciplinary environmental  research program in the Fall of  1996. We propose to use the  flexibility that is available  within the existing requirements  for a PhD in Statistics effectively  to initiate a new interdisciplinary  PhD program. The proposed training  program focuses on several issues  that involve statistics and  chemistry. It is expected that the  students will pursue a career in  teaching or research with an  environmental emphasis in academia,  industry or government at the  completion of their program. The  students will be recruited  nationwide, through a special  brochure discussing the program,  with special attention to  recruiting talented students for  traditionally underrepresented  groups in chemistry - women and  minorities. In addition a focus of  the recruitment will be for  students with BS degrees who are  working at environmental  laboratories and remedial  contractors and who have been out  of school a few years to attract  them back to graduate school as  full-time students in an  interdisciplinary program focused  on Environmental Chemometrics.",
