 "awd_abstract_narration": "9524068  Future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will almost  certainly   be   at   least  twice  as   high   as   current  concentrations.   It  is crucial that research  address  how  such  a  dramatic change will affect ecosystems,  especially  those   needed  for  food  production.   The  vast  semiarid  grasslands  of the Great Plains has been grazed  extensively  for  thousands  of years, and is comprised of grass  species  that   have   \"normal\"   (C3)   and   water-efficient   (C4)  photosynthetic  pathways.   It is  not  known  how  elevated  atmospheric  carbon dioxide concentration  will  affect  the  shortgrass  steppe ecosystem of the western  United  States.  Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations will likely  impact  the  productivity  of arid and semiarid  ecosystems  through  increased  carbon,  nitrogen and water use  efficiencies  in  individual  plants  and may affect the  competitive  balance  between   C3  and  C4  plants  because  of  their  different  responses.  Changing patterns of growth, nutrient  use,  and  species  composition  may  alter soil  nitrogen  and  carbon  cycles  and affect the long term viability of the grassland.  This  research  couples the use of large, open-top  chambers  for  field carbon dioxide enrichment with studies  of  plant  physiology  and soil nutrient balance through soil  nitrogen  cycling  and trace gas flux measurements.  There  are  three  basic objectives in this research.  First, it will determine  the  impact  of  doubling carbon dioxide on  photosynthesis,  productivity, water and nitrogen use efficiency, plant water  relations, and allocation of carbon and nitrogen above-  and  below-ground in two dominant grass species, one a  C3  grass  and  the  other  a C4 grass.  Second, it will determine  the  impact of doubling carbon dioxide on soil water and nitrogen  dynamics.  The knowledge gained from these studies  will  be  incorporated  into  simulation models that  will  allow  for  realistic  extrapolation through  tim e  and  space  of  soil  moisture, nutrient cycling, plant productivity, and  overall  ecosystem response.  This program will provide insight  into  the  effect of elevated carbon dioxide on this ecosystem  to  help maintain long term viability of the shortgrass steppe.",
