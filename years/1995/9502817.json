The principal investigator will develop a regional model which is appropriate for  testing hypotheses concerning mechanisms governing the onset of the monsoon, the northward  propagation of the onset over the Indian subcontinent, monsoon break periods, and monsoon  withdrawal.  Towards this end, the principal investigator already has successfully linked the  National Meteorological Center's (NMC) eta model to the global general circulation model to  simulate monsoon behavior.  The eta model is used primarily for short-range predictions and  simulates a number of physical processes including the physics of the boundary layer, the diurnal  cycle, radiation interactions with clouds, and convection.  The surface physics module, currently  a simple slab energy and bucket hydrology model, will be replaced with a state-of-the-art  biosphere model.  This biosphere model should provide more realistic representations of the  hydrologic cycle as governed by soil moisture and vegetation.  Once implemented, the coupled  model's simulated surface fluxes will be compared with observations.  The coupled model will  then be used to simulate the monsoon from the beginning of May to the end of September.  To  assess the ability of the model to simulate the space-time variability of the monsoon, the time-  averaged fields as well as the transient characteristics produced will be compared with those  from observation.  Finally, the various hypotheses of monsoon behavior will be tested with the  coupled model.    ***",
