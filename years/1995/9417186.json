 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cassineli  9417186    Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have winds with very large mass-loss rates and fast terminal speeds. The  resultant wind momentum flux greatly exceeds that in the emergent radiation field.  In contrast  with the winds of O stars, the WR winds appear to accelerate rather slowly so that moderate  stellar rotation can lead to a significant enhancement of the density in the equatorial region of  the stars.  This research is to develop two-dimensional models of the winds and to investigate  the consequences of the structure for the observations of WR stars using the \"Wind Compression  Zone\" model.  It is based on the \"Wind Compression Disk\" model, which was developed for  rapidly rotating Be stars.  For stars rotating at about 10% to 20% critical, the wind compression  may explain a number of puzzling observational properties of WR stars, such as why only some  WR stars show polarization and why WR stars with  compact companions can have strong X-ray emission.    In addition, we will study the Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) using our 2-D WCZ model.   These objects are thought to be a precursor stage to the WR phase.  LBVs are observed to have  slow winds, and some appear to have axisymmetric structure (e.g. AG Carinae), which  indicates that these stars are also good candidates for the application of our rotating wind model.   There is also evidence of non-thermal radio emission from WR stars and that the winds might  be source of high energy particle production.  Because of these observations magnetic fields will  also be included in the WCZ picture.  This will allow us to re-interpret the observational  evidence, and also allow us to investigate the consequences of the fields on the wind dynamics.  ***",
