 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423620  McMASTER     This award will provide group travel support to up to 10 American cartographers to attend the bi-annual meetings of the International Cartographic Association, which will be held in Barcelona, Spain, in September 1995.  Scholars supported by this award will present papers and will participate in ICA Commissions and Working Groups.  In addition to a Proceedings volume of all papers, to be distributed at the meetings, papers given and work developed at the meetings will receive dissemination through several international, refereed journals.  Past experience of American involvement in these meetings and of NSF support for this involvement suggests that American scholars play a major role in these activities, and develop substantial international collaboration.  The areas of cartographic research in which Americans are particularly active in international arenas include process visualization, generalization of spatial data, spatial data standards, and the history of cartography.     Wide solicitation of potential participants has already occurred.  The PI will organize a blind review of papers accepted by the ICA organizers to help rank participants who are applying for the travel assistance enabled by this award.  In addition, all NSF travel funds for support of Americans attending the 1995 ICA Meetings will be reserved for either early-career scientists who earned their Ph.D. during or after 1989, or for more experienced investigators who had never previously attended an ICA meeting.",
