Escherichia coli RNA polymerase  holoenzyme (RNAP) is one of the most intensely studied enzymes  since its discovery.  This multimeric enzyme consists of a core  protein made up of  2  ' and complexes with the major sigma subunit  (sigma 70). This research will concentrate on the role and structure  of the   subunit of RNA polymerase, and specifically on the  carboxyterminal domain of  , ( -CTD).  This domain is known to bind  DNA and also to interact with CAP, the catabolite gene activator  protein.  Its small size makes it amenable to NMR solution studies  and it has been expressed in large amounts.  The solution structure  of the  -CTD will be determined by multidimensional NMR studies,  both free in solution and when complexed to DNA.  Dynamic studies  will probe the role of flexible regions in the protein and also in  the protein-DNA complex.  Based on the solved structure, we will  identify the topological surfaces involved in protein-protein and  in protein-DNA recognition, and use the structures to understand  the available biochemical and mutation data.  The  -CTD is an  independently folded domain and may be studied as a prototype of  the dual DNA-binding and protein-protein functions common to both  eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins.  %%%  Transcriptional regulation depends on the interaction between  transcription factors and their target DNA sequences.  Modulation  of the biological activity of these transcription factors via  protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions regulates processes  such as cell development, differentiation and oncogenesis.  One of  the best studied transcription systems is the bacterial RNA  polymerase and its interactions with diverse promoters.  This  research on fundamental issues of DNA-binding proteins and their  regulatory roles mediated by specific pro tein-protein and protein-  DNA associations will focus on the domain organization of the RNA-  polymerase   subunit from E. coli; it binds DNA and interacts with  the activating region of the Catabolite Gene Activator protein  (CAP) in the ternary complex of the lac promoter, RNAP and CAP.  It  is, therefore, a good model to study intermolecular interactions.  ***",
