 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    9528497  ROUNDS    This Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been established between  the NSF/OPP and NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Science Internet,  as a collaboration vehicle intended to capture data and related  telecommunications supported previously under a separate MOA with  NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.  The predecessor MOA was  established in support of collaboration between NASA and NSF for  developing jointly managed projects to explore the analog between  space exploration and research and Antarctic science and  research.    A continual growth in telecommunications and data networking  projects has occurred under the original MOA to the degree that  both agencies agreed to develop a new framework of interaction  tailored specifically for this function.    The accompanying Task Completion Summary represents the first  funding for specific tasks originated under the old MOA  framework:              (a)  Continuation of INTELSAT satellite            telecommunications services, Internet services, and on-            demand compressed video services for McMurdo Station                   $516,000              (b)  Provision of electronic news gathering microwave            transmission system and fiber optic video/audio            transmission cable system in support of the NSF-NASA            distance learning project, \"Live From Antarctica\"                   $48,000    These products and services have been provided by NASA on a cost  reimbursable basis by NSF.    The full requested amount of $562,000 is recommended for award to  NASA in reimbursement of FY95 funds expended in support of NSF  activities of the United States Antarctic Program.  ***",
