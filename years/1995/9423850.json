 "awd_abstract_narration": "McCarrey  94-23850  Abstract   In the embryo proper of eutherians X-chromosome inactivation is  random with respect to whether the maternally- or paternally-  derived chromosome becomes inactivated, whereas in marsupials it is  exclusively the paternal X chromosome. However, in eutherians X  chromosome inactivation is non-random in the extra-embryonic  membranes and occurs earlier than in the embryo proper. A second  difference is that whereas X chromosome inactivation is stable and  can remain so for over 100 years, reactivation of the previously  inactivated X chromosome occurs routinely with age in a tissue-  specific manner in marsupials. These differences predict that much  could be learned of the mechanism of X inactivation as well as the  mechanism of maintenance of inactivation if the gene(s) involved  could be compared in structure as well as function. A candidate  gene has been isolated and sequenced from humans and mice, the Xist  gene. Neither seems to encode a protein and both have high degrees  of homology in the non-codine regions. However, the homology  consist of tandem direct repeats which are not particularly useful  for isolating homologues from other species. An attempt will be  made to isolate the Xist homologue from the marsupial, Monodelphis  domestica using PCR and the small regions of homology. Although  this is not a routine cloning exercise and the risks are high, the  isolation of the Xist homologue from a marsupial would make  possible approaches leading to an understanding of one of the  fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic genetics.  %%%  The mouse Xist gene will be used in an attempt to isolate the  marsupial homologue. The successful cloning and characterization of  this gene will allow a comparative approach to understanding the  differences and similarities between X chromosome inactivation in  placental animals (eutharians) and non-placental animals   (metherians).  ***",
