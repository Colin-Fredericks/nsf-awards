 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support the acquisition of a Hitachi  H-7100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) and ancillary equipment.  This instrument will be critical for the research activities of the  Department and will play an essential role in education and human  resources development at all levels. The Hitachi H-7100 instrument has  excellent performance characteristics and flexibility in terms of  possible future upgrading. We propose to equip this instrument for the  collection and storage of digital images. We will be able to take  advantage of existing expertise and computational resources in the  Center for Light Microscope Imaging and Biotechnology (a N.S.F. Science  and Technology Center) and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to  assist in the processing, analysis, and 3-D reconstruction of digital  images. Both Centers are located in the Mellon Institute, where the  Department of Biological Sciences and its Electron Microscope Facility  are located. The single existing instrument in the Department of  Biological Sciences, a Philips 300 TEM, is more than 25 years old. It  is extremely limited in its capabilities because it is difficult or  impossible to equip with several kinds of modern peripheral components  and accessories, including video/digital imaging devices, goniometer or  cooled stages, and STEM-SEM or EDS systems. Moreover, the age of this  model raises concerns about the continued availability of parts and  even service contracts on the instrument. A new microscope with  expanded capabilities is therefore essential for the support of both  current and future research activities in the Department of Biological  Sciences.    Of 18 faculty members in the Department, 7 will be major users of the  instrument, and at least an additional 5 are anticipated to be minor  users. All 12 of these faculty members, representing two-thirds of the  faculty of the Department of Biological Sciences, use electron optical  methods as an essential tool in their research programs.  The requested  instrument will be used in research projects aimed at an understanding  of fundamental cell, developmental, neurobiological, and physiological  processes. Major-user projects will include: 1) Correlated electron  microscopic and light optical studies aimed at understanding cell  movements in culture and in living embryos (Ettensohn, Pollock,  Taylor); 2) Highresolution immunolocalization studies, focusing on  proteins with important functions in embryonic development (Ettensohn,  Pollock) and in critical cell biological processes such as protein  targeting (Jones), motility (Jarvik, Taylor), and energy metabolism  (Koretsky); 3) Ultrastructural analysis of mutant phenotypes; e.g., of  cells with altered organelle structure or function (Jarvik, Jones,  Koretsky), of normal and mutant visual systems in Drosophila (Pollock),  and of tissues in transgenic mice following molecular genetic switching  of enzyme isotypes (Koretsky); 4) Determination of the subcellular  distribution of mRNAs by electron microscopic in situ hybridization;  (Pollock); and 5) Structural studies of the motor protein kinesin,  including conformational changes in the protein under varying ionic  conditions and kinesin-microtubule interactions (Hackney). The  instrument will also have a major impact on education and human  resources development at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral  levels. A significant number of the Department's 60 graduate students,  165 undergraduate biology majors, and 20 postdoctoral fellows will be  expected to use the requested instrumentation either through an  existing, formal course in electron optical methods (Techniques in  Electron Microscopy, BSC 03~20) and/or in their independent research  projects.                                               3",
