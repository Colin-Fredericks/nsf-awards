 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Geographic Information System (GIS) laboratory is being  developed to demonstrate ecological principles and processes on  large spatial scales and promote interdisciplinary research by  undergraduate students.   GIS technology provides the means for  users to input, edit, overlay, analyze, and display any  information that has a spatial component (e.g., streams, roads,  vegetative cover types, animal movements and locations,  elevations).   As such, GIS is a powerful tool for studying  spatial patterns and relationships.   The new laboratory  complements existing laboratory and field studies in  environmental biology, but provides the technology to investigate  the influence of landscape and regional environments on local  biotic communities and functions.   The laboratory is being  equipped with eight Pentium-PC workstations, digitizing tablets,  scanner, color printer, digitized data sets, and requisite  software packages.   Multiple workstations provide access to GIS  technology for students enrolled in upper-division ecology and  natural resources management classes and for student research  teams testing hypotheses in landscape ecology.   The laboratory  is also being equipped with a mobile Global Positioning System  receiver and antenna, so that students can accurately record and  store the locations of study plots and boundaries for subsequent  entry into the GIS system.",
