Microfabrication was originally developed by the  microelectronics industry to batch-fabricate miniature integrated  circuits. Only recently has it been applied to other fields and  disciplines. The slow infiltration of microfabrication technology  into the non-electronic disciplines is due to the fact that  microelectronic fabrication techniques have traditionally only been  taught to graduate electrical engineering students or undergraduate  students specifically studying microelectronic devices.     In order for non-electronic interdisciplinary applications of  microfabrication to be developed, an appropriate transfer of this  technology to the interested audience needs to take place. The  laboratory course being developed serves as that missing link by  introducing this versatile and powerful technology to a broader  audience base. Microfabrication can do for the mechanical and  physical world what microelectronic fabrication did for the  electronic world.  The world of microfabrication has tremendous  potential, and numerous applications to a wide spectrum of  disciplines are possible. However, the majority of those  applications will never be realized unless microfabrication is  exposed to a broader audience and introduced earlier into the  academic curriculum.",
