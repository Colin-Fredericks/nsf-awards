 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414661  Dunham    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Scott Dunham of Boston University and Dr. Kenji Taniguchi from Osaka University in Osaka, Japan.  Project funding will enable Dr. Dunham to spend six months in Japan, resident at Osaka University, in order to conduct research on process and device modeling with Dr. Taniguchi and other Japanese electrical engineers.  This project comprises two major goals.  The first goal is to gain a greater understanding of process and device modeling research in Japan, as well as current and expected future directions in VLSI technology that will have a direct impact on future modeling needs.  The second goal is to develop collaborative research with Japanese workers, at both Osaka University as well as at industrial research laboratories.     This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries working in the area of technology computer-aided design.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and equipment at Osaka University and private sector Japanese laboratories.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
