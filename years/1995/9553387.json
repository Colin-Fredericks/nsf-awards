 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553387  Pedersen    This project is a joint effort of  the Department of Chemical and  Biochemical Engineering and the  School of Pharmacy at Rutgers  University to establish an  environmentally Friendly  Pharmaceutical Manufacturing  Training Program. Such a training  program will have a huge impact on  promoting the use of  environmentally friendly technology  in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  Such a program is needed because  pharmaceutical processes generate  large amounts of avoidable  pollution. Better designed and  controlled processes would decrease  the impact on the environment of  pharmaceutical processes, and would  also result in reduced cost of  drugs; more reliably produced drugs  and a more competitive US  pharmaceutical industry. The  objective of the program proposed  here is to train professional  capable of designing and  implementing successful pollution  prevention strategies in  pharmaceutical operation. These  professionals will require solid  knowledge of chemical engineering  fundamental; optimization  techniques; Current Good  Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)  guidelines; risk assessment  techniques, end-of-pipe treatment  strategies, FDA and EPA  regulations, and unit operations  employed in pharmaceutical  processes. Training in these areas  will be imparted through a number  of activities, including:  * an extended menu of courses from  several academic units,  * a new curriculum component  consisting of a year-round  seminar/discussion session  highlighting successful pollution  prevention scenarios  * a PhD dissertation  * another new curriculum component  consisting of a supervised teaching  experience  * a summer internship in industry  In addition to training students,  the program proposed here will lead  to the establishment of a cohesive  and self-sustaining research  program on environmentally friendly  pharmaceutical manufacturing. Such  a research program will generate  new technologies for preventing  pollution in manufacturing  processes, and ensure t he viability  of the proposed training program  beyond the period of NSF funding  allocated by the GRT program.  Dissertation topics will address  four problems that are of direct  interest to industry and that offer  high potential for pollution  prevention:  a) process failures in solid dosage  manufacturing due to inadequate  handling of solid blending and  compaction operations.  b) failure of large scale  bioreactive processes (due to  starvation, shear damage, or poor  mixing )  c) lack of schedule optimization in  batch processes, generating a large  amount of emissions from processing  steps such as loading, unloading,  venting, cleaning, etc.  d) inadequate abatement techniques  capable of preventing emission of  organic solvents in reactive and  purification processes.  An aggressive plan for minority  recruitment has been formulated.  Minority recruitment activities  include, among others, expansion of  an already established minority  undergraduate internship program,  which serves as an in situ source  of minority and female graduate  students, an extensive  advertisement campaign in college  newspapers with large populations  of minority students, and a mailing  campaign directed to every Chemical  Engineering department in the US.  As proof of Rutgers' commitment to  this project, the University will  provide three five-year fellowships  to match NSF's contribution (one of  these fellowships will be earmarked  for a minority student). Additional  matching resources will be obtained  from the Department of Chemical and  Biochemical Engineering and form  ongoing projects funded by other  federal agencies and by industry.  It is anticipated that these  matching resources will allow us to  significantly expand the number of  students supported by the proposed  training program.",
