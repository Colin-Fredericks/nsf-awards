There are now  undergraduate level textbooks and teaching materials for beginning  programming courses using the method called program derivation,  whereby correct programs are derived from their specifications by  calculation. The objective is to develop lecture notes and  programming assignments for an undergraduate data structures course  based on program derivation. The materials are based on those now  being used in the classroom, and will be evaluated by educators at  other universities for content and suitability for use in  undergraduate courses in data structures. By meeting the need for  instructional material based on the extensive research literature  on program derivation, this project directly benefits educators who  wish to teach scientifically based systematic methods of  programming. By providing material on par with textbooks for the  more traditional approach, this project helps to provide a basis  for meaningful comparison between curricula based on formal methods  and other curricula.",
