 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-E.C. cooperative research in concurrent programming, logic  programming, compilation, and implementation.  It involves cooperation between Saumya Debray of the  University of Arizona on the U.S. side, and on the European side, Manuel Hermenegildo of the  Polytechnic University of Madrid, Spain; Moreno Falaschi of the University of Padua, Italy; and  Giorgio Levi of the University of Pisa, Italy.  They propose collaboration on three main topics:  task  granularity analysis for parallel and distributed implementations of logic programs, development of  portable parallel implementations of such languages, and compile-time analysis of concurrent  constraint languages.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration experience and capability in  the target system, &-PROLOG, the underlying parallel implementation.  The Spanish investigator  contributes a prototype implementation, using the Caslog complexity analysis system, for task  granularity analysis.  The Spanish side has also been investigating compile-time analysis techniques  for Prolog programs with delay primitives.  The Italian researchers offer extensive experience with  the topics of semantics and of static analyses of concurrent logic and constraint programming  languages to the U.S. researcher's use of the &-Prolog system as an implementation and compiler for  parallel logic programming languages.  The results of the research will contribute to building  efficient parallel implementations of high-level, declarative programming languages, in particular,  logic and constraint programming languages.",
