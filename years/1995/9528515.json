This biennial meeting will take place in conjunction with the 5th World Congress of Chemical Engineering in San Diego, CA, July 14-18, 1996. This workshop will focus on the needs of particulate technology in various fields including environment, energy, food, agriculture, pharmaceutics, and biotechnology.  Technical sessions will cover  topics such as storage and conveying, particle formation, dispersion of powders in liquids and gases, classification and separation, mixing, size reduction, agglomeration, rheology and multiphase flow, and fluidization.  Both oral and poster presentations will  allow interactions between U.S.  scientists and  leading international experts from more than 25 countries.  The participants will have the opportunity to share recent results and discuss potential collaboration between industry, academia, professional societies  and government agencies.  The research opportunities in various areas of particulate technology will be documented in the conference proceedings.            Syed Qutubuddin",
