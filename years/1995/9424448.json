 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424448  Xu        Many industrial processes involve the electrical heating of a conductor.  A typical example is the electrical spot welding of metal sheets in the  manufacturing of such products as automobile bodies, tanks, and armored  vehicles. The mathematical modeling of such processes often leads to systems  of degenerate partial differential equations with diffusive and convective  couplings. The study of these systems leads to deep and intriguing questions  in nonlinear analysis. In these considerations, the presence of strong  nonlinearities and degeneracy gives rise to very rich structures of solutions.  Our recent research findings indicate that solutions of these systems display  new phenomena that cannot be incorporated into the classical variational  formulation, and a new notion of a capacity solution is, therefore, introduced  to study these systems. In this proposal, we propose to study the finer  properties of capacity solutions, such as regularity, partial regularity,  large time behavior, and other related questions.  The proposed research is  important from the point of view of industrial applications. The mathematical  results we wish to obtain can lead to a more efficient production line, a new  or better product. For example, in the welding of metal sheets, one of our  objectives is to find out how the welding time is related to the material  properties and the current applied. This information is critical to the  automation of the welding procedure.",
