 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college has recently upgraded its science, engineering, and  technology courses to offer students comprehensive Associate  Degree and certificate programs in advanced machine tool and  manufacturing technologies.   Because defense industry downsizing  is forcing manufacturing and machine tool firms into new markets  (e.g., biomed, biotech, electronics), CNC operators and CAD/CAM  technologists are needed who can use advanced technology to  design and produce small, complex parts.   To supply graduates  for these jobs, the college is developing its undergraduate  Machine Technology program into an Advanced CAD/CAM & CNC  Technology curriculum.   The college and an industry partner are  funding new CAD/CAM software delivering advanced surface modeling  capability to DOS and NT platforms; this project purchases  machine tool components needed to add 4th and 5th axis movement  to the College's 3-axis vertical machining center (VMC).    Corresponding improvement of Introductory/Advanced CAD/CAM  courses let students use the CAD/CAM software to model and verify  advanced CNC surface programs; in improved Introductory/Advanced  CNC Vertical Machining & EDM courses, they learn to set up and  operate the 5-axis VMC needed to machine their programs.   In a  new 200 series, Advanced VMC, students use the software and  5-axis VMC to design and execute sophisticated surface models for  applied research and industry applications.",
