 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galileo is an investigation into the implications of long  range  technology advances across the computer field.  While projections  of  narrow scope are difficult and risky because of the rapid  progress over a very  broad range of technology, it is possible to  extrapolate current trends and  make intelligent guesses about  future computer building blocks.  Extrapolating  current rates of  progress to as little as a decade hence suggesting that  incredibly powerful computer systems might not be only possible,  but even  affordable.  Current technology trends will undoubtedly  be affected by new  discoveries and by limitations long before  such performance levels are reached.  It is the goal of this  research to identify those development directions that  are likely  to come into conflict or otherwise be retarded, and to  investigate  the implications of these effects.  Future machines  will undoubtedly much lower  costs of all operations, but some  operations will become much cheaper than  others.  A major goal is  to identify the relative improvements on different  kinds of  operations, and to understand how these changes will affect  architecture, the programming environment, and the algorithms  used.    The  processor has long been the heart of a computer system, and  though much has  been written about other limitations, the CPU  still plays a central role in  today's architectures.  Increasingly the processor is becoming less effective,  limited  not by its peak processing power, but by the ability of the  system to  provide work to keep it busy.  While processing power  is rapidly becoming  cheaper, the effective use of memory and  communication is becoming the critical  challenge in achieving  higher performance.  Memory costs have declined rapidly  and  steadily for more than twenty years, and will continue to decline  in cost  per bit.  Access time has not improved dramatically,  however, and  high-bandwidth, low latency-memory will always be  relatively expensive.  Limitations in memory  access tile and  bandwidth are already posing difficult  design challenges, and  this will only be aggravated by technology trends.  This  research  is investigating how a system can get higher performance form its  memory system by applying cheap processing power wherever it can  be used  effectively.  In some sense, the system becomes a  collection of memory modules  with processing power distributed in  ways to maximize the effective use of  memory by minimizing  communications between memory modules.    Memory access  time and memory latency are intimately related.  Both are critical for a  high-performance system, and either can  be optimized at the expense of the  other.  Today memory latency  seems to be the more urgent problem, and much  current research is  devoted to reducing or tolerating memory latency.  Assuming  that  some of these techniques are successful, the more fundamental  problem of  memory bandwidth emerges.  While it may be possible to  build systems of  arbitrarily high bandwidth, it appears that one  of the most important emerging  challenges is to make the most  effective use of whatever bandwidth is available  between modules.    By today's standards, future systems will have enormous  processing power, huge amounts of memory, and incredible  communications  bandwidth.  Computer systems will be limited by  memory modules of insufficient  capacity and communication paths  of limited bandwidth, with processor  distributed generously  wherever needed to optimize the effectiveness of memory  and  communication bandwidth.  Galileo is investigating how the  architecture of  such systems should differ from systems of today.  Galileo is investigating how  the architecture of such systems  should differ from systems of today, and how  such systems should  be programmed.",
