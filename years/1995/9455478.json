 "awd_abstract_narration": "In traditional science and engineering degree programs,  computation is commonly treated as a problem-solving tool best  studied and applied in isolation from \"real\" science and engi  neering. Students are typically required to take a programming  class to learn how to program, and perhaps a numerical analysis  class to learn how to apply their programming skills. This  traditional approach ignores the fact that computation has  evolved into an essential way of illuminating scientific and  engineering principles. Researchers now choose among the theo  retical, experimental, and computational approaches to studying  scientific phenomena. It has become increasingly clear that  computation should be exploited in science and engineering  education for its descriptive and analytical powers. In the past  the barriers to using computational techniques were high. The  emergence of application programs such as Maple and Mathematica  has greatly lowered these barriers. The computational power made  available per unit of student effort is orders of magnitude  higher for these packages than it is for traditional programming  languages. We are developing a suite of computer-based  laboratories suitable to support a two-semester  freshman/sophomore-level computing course for science and  engineering majors. Each laboratory illustrates the computational  solution of a typical problem from a field of science or  engineering, builds upon freshman-level concepts from mathematics  and physics, and leads the student through the process of  learning the computing technology (including mathematics packages  and conventional languages) required to solve the problem. We  will conduct annual workshops to train undergraduate faculty in  the use of our course ware.",
