 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526809  Haldar  A comprehensive study will be  conducted on the inelastic seismic  response behavior of steel frames  with partially restrained (PR)  connections considering all major  sources of energy dissipation.  The  procedure considers as  realistically as possible the  geometric nonlinearity including  the P-delta effect due to drift in  the presence of  PR connections,  material  nonlinearity, loading and  reloading behavior at the PR  connections, and damping.  Uncertainty in the parameters will  be considered using a nonlinear  stochastic finite element  algorithm.  Reliability analysis  will be conducted to generalize the  observations made during the  experiments and deterministic  analyses, and for codification of  design.  Serviceability  requirements consistent with the  strength requirements will then be  formulated.  Several definitions of  local, interstory and global  ductility will be investigated,  particularly for the multiple  degree of freedom structures, and  the most appropriate definition  will be identified.  Commonly used  steel frames including moment-  residing frames, braced frames,  dual systems with concentric and  eccentric braces will be  investigated.  Design factors will  be re-evaluated and introduced for  the seismic design of steel frames  with PR connections.    The study will complement SAC's  Phase II study on seismic analysis  of steel framed structures which is  funded by FEMA.  The project will  involve industry trade and  associations such as the American  Institute of Steel Construction  (AISC) and the American Iron and  Steel Institute (AISI).  ***",
