 "awd_abstract_narration": "NCR-9502582  Konstantopoulos, Takis    This is a proposal about the development of a rigorous approach  toward network management and performance analysis for high-speed  networks considering local and global aspects of a network  management system.  Local aspects include the design of flow  controllers at the edges of the network that take into account the  provision of quality of service and the interaction between users  in a network switch.  The investigator will extend recently  developed techniques that are based on the so-called reflection  mapping, develop testing techniques and simulations, and compare  these to existing schemes.    The investigator will also study traffic modeling.   He will  develop rigorous methods for validating self-similar traffic  processes arising from the operation of an integrated services  high-speed networks and use such models in establishing performance  analysis methods.    Studying the global aspects of a management system involves using  a macroscopic picture of the network currently being developed by  the investigator.  The picture strips out the minutiae of the  operation of the network, while retaining its dynamic character (it  is not static).  The investigator proposes the use of such a  picture by a network management system in order to predict,  prevent, and correct undesirable behavior that might lead to  degradation of services across the network.",
