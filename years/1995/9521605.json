 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521605  Meixner    Mass loss has a profound effect on the final evolution of intermediate  mass stars.  Unfortunately, the physical mechanism driving the extreme  mass loss rates on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) is not understood.   Dr. Margaret Meixner of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,  will conduct an observational investigation of the nature of the mass  loss in evolved stars using imaging techniques in two wavebands:  millimeter wavelength (3 mm), and mid-IR wavelength (8-25 microns).   The carbon monoxide emission millimeter wavelength (transition J=1-0)  imaging project utilizes the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland millimeter  wavelength array (BIMA) and the NRAO 12m telescope for observations,  and a detailed radiative transfer software code for the analysis of the  data.  The expected results will include more accurate determination of  mass loss rates and characterization of the large scale halos (radii  about 70 arc seconds) which are found in all evolved stars; and compact  (less than 4 arc seconds) fast molecular gas regions, which are found  in transition objects such as proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) and hold a  clue to the AGB to planetary nebula (Pne) transition process.  The  mid-IR wavelength imaging project involves the analysis of high  resolution (less than 1 arc second) mid-IR wavelength images of 55  circumstellar dust shells (CDSs) surrounding AGB stars, PPNe and young  Pne, will be carried out using an axially symmetric radiative transfer  dust code.  Moreover, the mid-IR wavelength project includes further  observations of PPNe and extreme AGB stars at similar and longer  wavelengths and at high angular resolutions (about 0.1 arc seconds)  using two mid-IR wavelength array cameras (MIRAC and the Keck LWIRC).   The results from this mid-IR wavelength imaging project will provide  insight into the origin of axially symmetric morphological structures  commonly found in Pne and insight into the evolutionary stage at which  this axial symmetry arises.    Dr. Me ixner has three activities planned that will lay ground work for  the future research.  Firstly, an observing run is planned with the  MIRAC team in June 1995 to observe approximately one dozen PPNe.  Secondly, a new axially symmetric computer software dust code will be  used to model several mid-IR images of PPNe and Pne from the current  sample; thereby demonstrating the application of this code.  Finally,  carbon monoxide wavelength emission data cubes of three objects will be  constructed using a new interferometry technique called mosaicing;  thereby demonstrating the feasibility of this technique.",
