 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research  Station has supported research and education in biological  sciences since 1937.  Since then more than 300 scientists  have produced over 250 published papers, dissertations, and  theses based on work on the Preserve.  From 1988 to 1995, 40  Ph.D. level scientists and 32 graduate students and 275  teachers to practice hands-on environmental education.  The  Preserve's laboratory building can no longer accommodate the  researchers and students utilizing its resources.  The Huyck  Preserve's five year development plan calls for a three  phased effort to upgrade its facilities and this proposal  represents Phase 1.  The Preserve will construct and  addition to its laboratory building that will more than  double office, laboratory and teaching space.  The addition  will also include a library and collection room.  Additional  funds will come from Huyck Preserve operating budget, the  Huyck Foundation, previous researchers.  Also the Preserve  will finish the buildings' interior walls and doors.  Finally a data manager will help the Preserve develop GIS  capability using the software and hardware also purchased to  match this request.",
