 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David J. Burkey  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Burkey received his doctoral degree from   Vanderbilt University under the supervision of Professor Timothy Hanusa.    Dr. Burkey will continue research at the University of British Columbia   under the sponsorship of Professor Peter Legzdins.  His postdoctoral   research will target the investigation of organometallic transition-metal   complexes that contain nitrosyl ligands.  The research explores the   effect of having two different neutral ligands with different bonding   characteristics present in the complexes, as well as the influence of the   neutral ligands on stability.  The research will strengthen our   fundamental understanding of the observed stability and reactivity trends   of these complexes and will eventually lead to the development of useful   applications.   The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
