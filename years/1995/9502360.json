The Center was  founded in 1983 to do research on ceramic dielectric materials  that serve as the technological basis for vital components used  in electronic circuits.  The Center's aim is to improve the  fundamental understanding of the synthesis, processing, and  properties of dielectric materials used in electronic devices.   The Center derives financial support from industrial members who  use the results of the Center's research to guide their  industrial development of products of technological interest.  At  present there are fifteen corporate members.  The research  emphasizes the study of multilayer ceramic dielectrics to include  the problems of putting diverse materials together into a single  integrated ceramics package that contains capacitors,  interconnects, thick and thin films, sensors, and polymers.    The Center conducts research to improve basic scientific  understanding and techniques that will serve as the basis for  future generations of products, while industrial members develop  the generic advanced technologies used to manufacture and test  advanced dielectric devices.  These devices are critical to the  electronics, communications, and computer industries.    The Program Manager recommends Pennsylvania State University be  awarded $21,500 for one year.",
