 "awd_abstract_narration": "Performance index functions with integer parameters are  important in the evaluation and analysis of computer  systems, communication  networks and general distributed and  parallel processing systems. These  functions are often  difficult to evaluate for large integers.  On the other  hand, most of these performance functions have nice  properties such as  monotonicity, convexity, analyticity, as  well as obtainable asymptotic  behavior.  This research uses  such properties to extrapolate the performance  functions  based on their values at small integers.    The objective of this  research is to further establish the  theoretical foundation and to develop  guidelines, algorithms  and their software implementations that will be  applicable  to a wide array of systems.    The results of this research will  make it possible to  express the performance measure function in terms of the  system size of dimension as a low-degree rational function  for some general  classes of systems.  The successful  completion of this research will provide a  framework in  which various difficult modeling, control and optimization  issues  can be attacked.",
