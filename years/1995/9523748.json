 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523748  Huntley  Patchiness of zooplankton and micronekton is a feature of central  importance in marine ecosystems.  In the Southern Ocean,  aggregations of krill (Euphausia superba) are of particular  interest.  The distribution and dynamics of such aggregations are  critical to determining the transformation of organic matter  (e.g. carbon flux) and the fate of populations in the sea.  These  phenomena are especially important in the mesoscale and sub-  mesoscale domains, where patchiness is most strongly expressed.   If the means to predict patch dynamics is lacking, then so is the  means to adequately predict carbon flux and population dynamics  at these scales.    Traditional models of zooplankton patch dynamics generally treat  animals as Lagrangian particles whose aggregations are determined  solely by processes of advection and diffusion.  This approach  ignores behavior induced by biotic and abiotic forces and  manifested as purposeful motion - motion that clearly is not  governed by advection and diffusion.  Attempts to acknowledge  behavior in models of plankton motility have been successful at  the level of the individual animal, but even the most powerful  computers cannot run individual-based models to predict  aggregation dynamics of n individuals.    This proposal takes a new approach to modeling aggregation  dynamics, based on \"bio-continuum\" theory, and provides for model  verification against benchmark field data.  Rather than relying  on traditional advection-diffusion equations, which ignore  behavior, the bio-continuum theory recognizes behavioral forces in  the context of statistical mechanics.  Model output provides  information on animal behaviors, manifest as swimming velocities,  that are absent from other models of patch dynamics.  All key  model variables are measurable using common sampling techniques,  such as acoustic Doppler and multiple net systems.    The proposed research consists of studying both the internal and  external forces that act on aggregations of  Euphausia superba.  First, the internal forces of autocoherence (that act between  animals to maintain patch integrity) will be measured in krill  aggregations observed in the Gerlache Strait region in 1992.  Our  database consists of more than 20 such aggregations observed by  ADCP and MOCNESS.  Second, the effect of external physical  forcing on krill aggregations will be studied by embedding krill  swarms of typical scales in numerically modeled flow regimes that  are typical of the Gerlache Strait region (Zhou and Niiler 1995),  by combining the Princeton circulation model (e.g. Blumberg and  Mellor 1987) with our aggregation model.    This research provides a novel, dynamic theory of animal  aggregations in the sea.  A study of the fundamental theory,  coupled with model realizations that can be compared to observed  aggregations of Euphausia superba, may lead to more realistic  predictions of krill patch dynamics in the Southern Ocean.  Such  predictions are critical to more accurate measurements of carbon  flux and the population dynamics of krill.",
