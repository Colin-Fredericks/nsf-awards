 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Diana M. Watkins has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Watkins received her doctoral degree from   the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Professor   Marye Anne Fox.  Dr. Watkins  will continue research at Columbia   University under the sponsorship of Professor Nicholas Turro.  Her   postdoctoral research will focus on the investigation of host-guest   interactions between noncovalently bound donors and acceptors on a series   of dendrimer macromolecules.  The studies will examine rates of electron   transfer and binding affinities under a variety of conditions.  Transient   laser spectroscopy  will be used in the studies of the electron transfer   mechanisms and surface binding characteristics.  Knowledge of these   systems will contribute to the long-range goal of design of a   macromolecular system which can build up multiple long-lived charges on a   single array to catalyze multielectron reactions using light.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
