This is a difficult research topic, but one of great importance to the general field of micromolecular biosynthesis.  The proposal contains a very interesting series of experiments which should provide a reasonable amount of new data on mechanisms of sulfur insertion into biotin.  The panel expressed some concern about the intense competition in this field and the situation that the PI may find himself doing work already completed by others. Nevertheless, the research plan is sound and clearly presented.  The panel placed the proposal into the \"excellent\" category and strongly recommended funding.                                                                                                                                                                                         ....()()))()()                                                   <Z   :                                                       phoenix      @                                         S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Terry Lee McCrimmon                 Robert Uffen                @                                   @                                   @     $  \u0131                                                                                                  @     q                                     Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     e =       e               #                                                                                                                   D       D       D       D       D       \\       f       D           c   p       t       t       t       t       t       t       t                                           j   Z   j           E   T       3                                   t                 t       t                       t       t                t                       t                       p       t       t       t       t               t               t                               .       6                                       t               t       t                                                                                              Metabolic Biochemistry Panel Summary PRIVATE     Edward DeMoll  MCB 9418430    The PI has presented data from a series of excellent preliminary studies on the biosynthesis of biotin.
