 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453927  Hardwick    This three year project would develop a set of teacher instructional materials for getting more women interested in geography.  The materials will be based on a pilot program done earlier by the National Council for Geographic Education.    In the first year, 15 experienced teachers would be paired with 15 much less experienced teachers in the teaching  of gender equity in geography.  The first workshop would be held in the east(Temple University).   A second workshop with another set of 30 teachers would be held the second year in the west(San Diego State University). This workshop arrangement is to provide easy access to African American and Puerto Rican  women in the east at Temple, and Hispanic and Asian women in the west in California.  Each workshop will consist of three weeks of intensive work.  A one week intensive preworkshop will be held for those less well prepared teachers.  During each three week workshop will train teachers in instructional strategies that enhance the performance in geography of ALL students in secondary school geography and social studies classes, paying particular attention to the needs of female students of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds.  The first year will produce the instructional materials that integrate geographic content on gender and ethnic minority groups and exemplify appropriate teaching strategies.   These materials will be tested, revised and introduced to the teachers in the workshops  during the summer or years 1 and 2.  The cost share of this project is 20.5% of the support from the Foundation.",
