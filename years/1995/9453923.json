 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453923  Stafford    The Wisconsin Staff Development Initiative (WSDI) is a 5-year  project to effect comprehensive S/M/T reform through a program of  systematic, coordinated and continuous staff development  activities.  Each year Lead Teacher Institutes (LTI) will prepare  60 teachers in grades K-12 to be change agents in their schools and  to staff the Summer Academy, modeled after the CRAY Academy, at six  sites around the state of Wisconsin.  Several teams from nearest  neighbor states will pilot dissemination beyond Wisconsin in a  phased approach to national implementation.  The LTIs consist of  two 4-week sessions in each of two consecutive summers.  Teacher  Enhancement activities include:  Participation in 2-weeks of the  CRAY Academy, one week preparing to lead a Summer Academy and two  weeks of teaching in a Summer Academy with the aid of a mentor.    In the Summer Academy teachers pick a single topic, from 40 or more  S/M/T topics for each week of participation.  Topics include  Operation Physics topics, Graphing Calculators, Fast Plants, etc.   Over a three or four year period teachers participate in 3-4 such  sessions.  Participation in these Summer Academies usually includes  school teams as well as principals.  Each academy has a core series  of workshops plus others which reflect local needs.  Teachers earn  one-graduate credit for each Summer Academy they complete.    The LTIs are held in Chippewa Falls, WI the original CRAY Academy  site.  New sites will be phased in as follows:  Madison, LaCrosse,  Fennimore, Green Bay in 1994, Milwaukee in 1995, Racine & Hayward  in 1996, Rhinelander in 1997, Beloit and Stevens Point in 1998 and  Fond du Lac in 1999.  The project will use the existing educational  infrastructure to deliver services to teachers and effect  comprehensive change in local districts.",
