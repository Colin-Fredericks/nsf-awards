 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Northern Iowa (UNI), as part of its increased emphasis on undergraduate and graduate research in the sciences,  will join with NSF to fund the renovation of five research laboratories and a chemical stockroom in McCollum Science Hall.  McCollum was constructed in 1967 and has  not undergone any significant renovation in its 28 years of use.  The proposed renovation will address improvements in four general areas: the integrated environmental chemistry and biology research areas, chemistry research areas, the chemistry computer laboratory, and the chemical stockroom.  Renovations will include an upgrade of utilities, installation of new benches, and upgrades to the air handling system to address safety and fire code violations and to provide a modern research facility.   Undergraduate education is the primary mission of the University of Northern Iowa, and the Chemistry and Biology Departments which will benefit from this award represent two of the strongest undergraduate research departments on the university campus.  The Biology Department is a rapidly growing department with over 500 undergraduate majors with plans for careers in biotechnology, teaching and post-graduate studies in biology and health-related sciences.  The Chemistry Department has over 120 undergraduate majors and prepares students for advanced study in science and medicine, teaching, and work in government and industrial laboratories.  Both departments have recently established an environmental science emphasis in their respective B.S. degree programs and have jointly established an M.S. Environmental Science program.  The facilities award will directly benefit twenty-two students and nine faculty in research activities encompassing organic electrochemistry, environmental biotechnology, atmospheric assessment of fuel additives, synthesis of natural product antibiotics, and the effects of pesticides and industrial effluents in aquatic ecosystems.",
