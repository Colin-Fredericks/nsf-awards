 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502795  Osisanya  Wellbore instability in shale formations is a costly problem  in the oil and  gas industry and difficult to assess because it is time-  dependent.  One of  the keys to maintaining wellbore stability in shale  formations is the  ability to reduce mechanical aggravation of the shale which  can initiate  wellbore instability during the drilling operation.  There  are at present  no systematic means to monitor on-site the combined effects  of the  mechanical aggravation and drilling fluid rheology.  Wellbore stability  models currently applied in the industry cannot account for  the wide range  of shale compositions encountered while drilling, and they  do not account  for changes in the rheological parameters of the drilling  fluid caused by  the dispersion of shale cuttings.    The proposed research will develop a systematic approach for  solving  wellbore instability problems at the well site.  The  approach will be based  on correlating results from time-dependent well site shale  dispersion and  swelling tests under atmospheric conditions to similar  results developed in  the laboratory for various shales under simulated downhole  conditions.  The  correlations will be used to develop rheology/hydraulics  programs.  The  corresponding educational plan includes design curricula  including a  Socratic approach, and incorporating practical experience  into course  content and lectures.  ***",
