 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal documents an instrumental  improvement important in the dissertation           research of Andrew Bullen. This research examines  the conduction and integration of           electrophysiological signals in the dendrites of  cultured mamrr~ CNS neurons using fast           optical recording techniques. Andrew is a student  at the University of Pennsylvania School of           Medicine who is undertaking his doctoral research  at Baylor College of Medicine in order to           exploit the unique instrumental resources available  in the laboratory of Dr. Peter Saggau.                 The primary instrumental resource used in  these investigations is a novel High-Speed           Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscope previously  developed in Dr Saggau's lab. The           bandwidth of this system (200,000 points/second) is  considerably greater than existing scanning           microscopes. This bandwidth is achieved through the  incorporation of acoustic-optic deflectors as           its only scanning mechanism. This instrument was  previously used to record from brain slices           (Saggau et al., 1990).                 This microscope has been further developed  for simultaneous multisite recording from two           fluorescent indicators in the dendrites of  mammalian CNS neurons. These modifications have           allowed studies of neuronal integration within a  single cell and investigations of signaling between           cultured neurons (Bullen & Saggau, 1994). These  studies employed voltage-sensitive dyes and           calcium indicators, but other probes are planned  for future experiments.                 Notwithstanding its fast scanning rate and  large bandwidth, the current system has several           limitations that have been highlighted by these  recent experiments. These limitations include           modest spatial resolution, small scanning field  size and poor signal-to-noise ratio in fine neuronal           processes.                 A simple  improvement is proposed to overcome  these limitations and further enhance the           performance of this instrument. By replacing the  existing acousto-optic deflectors with equivalent           devices able to produce more spots (70 vs 10 spots)  over a larger initial deflection angle           (40 mrad. vs 5 mrad.), the scanning field size will  be significantly enlarged and the relative spatial           resolution improved. The absolute spatial  resolution will also be increased because the net spot           size will be smaller (2 ~m vs 10 llm). Furthermore,  the smaller spot size will enhance the signal-           to-noise ratio and allow events of smaller  magnitude to be resolved. These irnproved deflectors           will also provide homogenous illumination and  thereby facilitate a uniform signal-to-noise ratio           throughout the scanning field.                 The proposed change can be implemented  without compromising the existing bandwidth           of the system or any major structural alterations.                 In summary, a minor change to an existing  High-Speed Laser Scanning Fluorescence           Microscope is proposed. This modification will make  this instrument more sensitive and able to           sample a larger area with greater spatial  resolution. The impact of these features will allow           simultaneous mulitsite optical recordings of small  events from fine neuronal structures.           Measurements of this nature were not previously  possible and should significantly advance the           understanding of information processing in the  dendrites of mammalian CNS neurons.
