Temporal and spatial variability in the  processes that govern the upward rate of nutrient flux from  the deep-sea, and the drift of currents in the upper ocean,  determine the distribution of marine plankton  and set  limits for their production.  Pursuit of JGOFS objective  requires investigation into these physical-biological  linkages.  They influence the global rates of carbon  sequestration and release by the sea.  How balance between  these processes was regulated in the past, and how it is  regulated today is an important research component of US  national and international endeavors to understand and  predict responses to global change.         The monsoonal system of the Arabian Sea affords unique  opportunity for the pursuit of these studies.  Its intense  seasonal cycle in air-sea interaction allows for the  development and testing of models relating to the physical  climate-driven process linkages to biological responses and  consequent feedback via air-sea exchange of gases.  In  addition to the intensity of these processes, and hence  their strong seasonal signal in the Arabian Sea, the record  in marine fossil assemblages and isotopes in ocean  sediments, is valuable in the development and testing of  time varying models treating coupled physical and biological  aspects of the ocean climate system.         This study relates to one particular link in the  system: the regulation of primary planktonic production by  the supply rate of the limiting nutrient, nitrogen.  The  coarse seasonal pattern in Arabian Sea production is one of  the most intense, production being associated with the  summer SW monsoon.  Upwelling delivers a pulse of nutrients  to surface waters, which in turn stimulates a plankton  remain generally higher than those typical of oceanic waters  elsewher e.  In this study the availability of nitrogen, both  in the upwelled form of nitrate and in the recycled form of  ammonium, will be assessed regionally during the low  production NE winter monsoon and the two inter-monsoon  transition periods.  The interplay between dependence on the  \"new\" and \"regenerated\" forms of nitrogen determine what  fraction of total primary production is at any time  available for export to the deep-sea.         The techniques applied will permit the quantification  of new production and its regulation throughout the low  nutrient portion of the year.  Nutrient analyses sensitive  in the nanomolar range will be employed for quantifying the  abundance, and with 15N labeled substrates, the rates of  supply and utilization of nitrite, nitrate and ammonium in  the upper ocean.  This study will be conducted in  collaboration with investigators who are addressing other  aspects of the nitrogen cycle and biological  production.  New understanding resulting from these complementary  projects will contribute to the formulation and testing of  regional models that use remotely sensed information on  biological and physical features and processes to better  predict how production processes in the Arabian Sea will  respond to future climate change.",
