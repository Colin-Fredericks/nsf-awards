 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop and test \"smart\" balloons whose  altitude can be controlled to provide the capability to follow  isentropic, constant pressure surfaces or other chosen strategies.   In addition to providing track information through Global  Positioning System (GPS) derived position data, the smart balloons  will carry pressure, temperature and humidity sensors, and these  data will be transmitted along with the position data.  By  including pressure and temperature sensors and a pressure pump, the  smart balloon can be programmed to track along isentropic, moist  isentropic, isopycnic or constant pressure surfaces.  The  ballasting of the smart balloon will be achieved using an helium  filled, expandable balloon inside an air-filled constant-volume,  pressurized balloon.  If a higher altitude is required during an  experiment, air is released from the pressurized outer balloon.   This action allows the helium-filled inner balloon to expand and  take the place of the heavier released air.  If a lower altitude is  desired, outside air is pumped into the outer balloon, which  increases its density and causes the balloon package to decrease in  altitude.  The virtue in development of this capability is that the  instrumented smart balloons can be utilized in a number of  observational applications including:  Lagrangian observational  strategies, or in prescribed sounding strategies, without the  threat of balloon loss through groundings.         Smart balloons capitalize on recent technological advances to  provide a cost-effective, new data gathering capability for the  atmospheric sciences research community.  Such balloons, or  tetroons, can be deployed during field experiments directed at  investigation a variety of research problems ranging from storm  structure to atmospheric chemistry in the troposphere and  stratosphere.  In situ observational data for the previous seven  hours are transmitted at five minute intervals on UHF along with  GPS position of the tetroon.  These da ta can then be intercepted by  receivers on-board research platforms within approximately one  hundred miles of the tetroon.",
