 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bonner Hall, constructed in 1965, is one of the major buildings that houses the Biology Department at the University of California, San Diego.  It is also one of the oldest buildings on campus and is overdue for major renovations required for the modernization of research laboratories for future decades. Current research space does not comply with new Federal and State health, safety, and ADA standards; is poorly configured, and the mechanical and electrical systems have reached their service potential and are in need of replacement or refurbishment. To accomplish these goals, funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, combined with resources from the State of California, will be used to carry out a comprehensive renovation of Bonner Hall.  Specifically, NSF funds will be used to modernize and upgrade all research laboratories and support facilities in the building to enhance functional interactions between laboratories designated for Developmental Biology, Mammalian Development and Differentiation, and Mammalian and Eukaryotic Molecular Genetics.  Antiquated autoclaves, fume hoods, dishwashers, and other items of major fixed equipment, will be replaced and located in common rooms accessible to all users.  The vivarium will be upgraded to conform with regulatory mandates for animal care, and laboratories currently dispersed in other buildings will be consolidated, creating an interactive environment for faculty and students. Modern facilities are needed for scientists who use tools of molecular genetics to unravel the more complex processes of life, such as embryogenesis and differentiation.  Approximately 14 faculty members, 110 post-doctoral students, 80 graduate students, 60 undergraduate students and 35 staff researchers will benefit from the renovation. The project will also serve as a recruitment tool in the department's effort to increase the number of faculty representing minority groups.",
