 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511509  Remmer    By focusing upon the relationship between institutional  arrangements and regime sustainability, this project is designed  to bridge the gap separating older macrosocial understanding of  political democracy from more contemporary work stressing  indeterminacy, conjunctural conditions, and contingent choice.   This study reevaluates the conventional wisdom concerning the  dependence of democratic stability upon economic performance and  test a theoretical alternative that takes into account the  differential strengths and weaknesses of political democracy and  authoritarianism as well as institutional variations among  democratic regimes.  The overarching conception is that  institutions matter as contextual determinants of behavior  mediating between systemic and structural forces, on the one  hand, and individual political actors on the other.    The project involves three major components.  First the research  entails the development and analysis of a data base on political  institutions, electoral outcomes, and economic performance in  Latin America for the period 1945-1994, which will be shared with  other interested researchers.  Second, the study elaborates and  tests a set of cross-sectional regression models linking regime  durability with three major sets of variables:  international  political context, domestic economic performance, and political  institutions.  The models will address outstanding questions  regarding the relative fragility of authoritarian and democratic  political orders and establish a basis for estimating the  relative contribution of economic and institutional forces to the  sustainability of political democracy.  Third, the research  utilizes survival analysis to explore the ways in which  fluctuation in international conditions, economic performance,  and changes in the rules of the political game over the lifetimes  of individual regimes have shaped the risk of regime breakdown.    The results of this research address the long-standing  theo retical debate over the breakdown and consolidation of  political democracy as well as issues of relevance to the policy  community concerned with the contemporary political dynamics of  Eastern Europe and Latin America.  ***",
