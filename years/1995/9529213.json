Natural system changes can have direct impacts on human  physiology, and they can have indirect affects by altering the  development and transmission of disease.  At the request of the  Committee on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) of the  National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and the White  House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the  Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council will  convene a two-day symposium in Washington in September 1995 to  address the complex interactions between human health and global  environmental change.  More than 300 scientists, health  professionals, and key decision makers from the public and  private sectors will participate in discussions designed to  identify aspects of human health-natural systems interaction that  require more research in the future.  A published proceedings  will help disseminate results of those discussions to a much  broader audience.  Support for the planning and conduct of the  symposium is being shared by a number of CENR agencies.  This  award effectively provides support from NSF ($15,000), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($25,000), and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ($15,000).       This symposium will be an important gathering that brings  together leaders from a number of different communities whose  interests intersect because of the complex dynamics that link  human health and global change.  The symposium will provide  valuable insights into important problems, and it will provide  guidance to federal agencies participating in the U.S. Global  Change Research Program and other CENR-related activities.",
