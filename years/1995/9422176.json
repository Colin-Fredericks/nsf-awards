 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422176  WIEGANDT       The complex, wide-ranging nature of global change research  requires international collaboration among scientists from many  different disciplines.  To facilitate this collaboration, three  major international programs have been established.  Two of  these, the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and  the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), have been in  existence for some time.  A third program, the Human Dimensions  of Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP) was established in  1990 under the sponsorship of the International Social Science  Council (ISSC).  This award will use funds gathered from agencies  participating in the Subcommittee for Global Change Research of  the U.S. Committee on Environment and Natural Resources  (CENR/SGCR) to facilitate development of a more detailed science  plan for the HDP through the conduct of meetings of the HDP  Steering Committee and working groups that are developing focused  research programs.  Most funds will go to pay participant support  costs for meetings of the HDP Steering Committee and for meetings  of working groups planning new core research projects.  Topics  for which core research projects are being planned include the  production and consumption of energy, environmental security and  sustainable development, perception and assessment of global  environmental change, and industrial growth.  One working group  also is engaged in planning for a global omnibus environmental  survey.  In addition to travel reimbursement, some funds will be  used for communication and staffing needed for successful  operation of these groups.  Scientific and technical reports of  the work of these groups will be prepared and distributed.  Funds  for this award have been provided by the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration as part of its contribution to distributed-  cost activities of the U.S. Global Change Research Program.       The outcomes of these planning activities will be core  international, coll aborate research projects that will provide  input into the analysis, modeling, and interpretation of global  change.  HDP core research projects also should assist policy  makers in the U.S. and other nations in exploring options for  adapting to and mitigating global change.",
