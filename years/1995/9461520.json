 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed SBIR Phase I project will develop a software design tool that will be used in advanced materials processing to predict the grain structure of materials. This is a very important tool with wide commercial and technical value. Grain structure is a primary factor in materials properties and must be carefully considered in almost all materials processing applications. The advent of easy access to advanced computing power such as engineering workstations has made it possible to use computer simulation in engineering design. The design of materials through computer simulation is now at hand. The proposed research will use a coupled heat flow and Monte Carlo simulation of fine grain, superalloy, investment casting to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach to materials processing design. The simulation program will be developed from work previously supported by the NSF and reported in the literature. Commercialization of the research will seek application to a wide range of materials processes where grain structure is of critical importance. The successful completion of this project will make US industry more productive and competitive in the area of advanced materials processing. A representative of the advanced materials processing industry, Howmet Corporation, is participating in this project.",
