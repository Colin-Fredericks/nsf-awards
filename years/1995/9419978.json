 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global mission of the \"Developmental Resource for  Biophysical Imaging and Opto-electronics\" consists of the creation,  development, facilitation and application of new instrumentation  technologies for the visualization and measurement of dynamic cellular  and molecular processes with the ultimate objective of solving  fundamental problems in biological research. A renaissance in light  microscopy, driven by advances in laser physics, nonlinear optics,  microelectronics and computer technology has engendered powerful new  optical and microprobe technologies.                  Instrumentation research and development has recently produced  nonlinear laser microscopy based on two photon excitation (TPE) which  occurs by simultaneous molecular absorption of two low energy photons  to create a high energy excitation that generates fluorescence or  photochemistry. This Resource invention was motivated by a need for  instantaneous spatially resolved photochemistry as well as three  dimensionally resolved, background-free fluorescence microscopy. Much  of this research program aims to realize the potential of this  invention and to establish its methodology and utility through  exploratory biophysical applications. We propose developments aimed  particularly at dynamical measurements in living nervous system  preparations such as neurotransmitter micropharmacology by point  photolysis of caged molecules, fast (video rate) ratiometric calcium  imaging, and optimization of methods for thick, highly scattering  biological specimens.                  Resource developments include nanometer spatial displacement  measurements, nanometer scale tracking of individual molecules, and  most recently a picoNewton-sensitivity optical force probe whose  operation in a scanning mode provides surface mapping by Optical Force  Microscopy (OFM). These instruments are enabling new Resource  biophysics research on cell surface receptor dynamics, sensory  transduction, cell motility mechanisms, and second messen ger signalling  mechanisms. Resource development of multiplexed instrumentation that  accommodates cmmbinations of these probes, atomic force microscopy (for  larger forces) and fluorescence imaging and molecular tracking on  living cells is proposed. Using these novel technologies, research  objectives are the in vivo measurement and mapping of picoNewton  interaction forces, dynamics of ligand-receptor pairs, cell surface  compliances and individual intermolecular forces.    Specific Research Objectives:  (1) Technology of two photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) --  Design and develop TPLSM research workstations capable of fluorescence  decay time imaging, video rate ratiometric imaging, programmable caged  neurotransmitter release and single particle tracking.    (2) Exploratory applications of laser microscopy and two photon  excitation -- Develop new instrumentation techniques to exploit the  advantages of TPLSM, in particular (a) techniques for thick, strongly  scattering, living preparations, (b) localized fast cage activation for  micropharmacology, (c) specific applications to nervous system  preparations, and (d) specific applications to plant tissue.    (3) Photochemistry and photophysics -- laser excitation in the cellular  environment -- Determine mechanisms and controls of photochemical  processes that ultimately limit the effectiveness of both one and two  photon fluorescence microscopy in living cells. Understand operative  mechanisms of one and two photon photobleaching, cellular photodamage,  photoablation and the kinetics of cage activation. Apply photoablation  and cage activation to biological systems.    (4) Nonlinear laser microscopy measurements of molecular mobility --  Develop instrumentation and techniques for 3-d resolved molecular  mobility measurements using two photon excited fluorescence  photobleaching recovery (FPR), Fluorescence Activation Redistribution  (FAR), and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). Apply to  photoregulation of second messenger  responses, receptor-secretion  coupling, and neurotransmitter release.    (5) Measurement of Protein Dynamics and Folding by Fluorescence  Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) -- Apply FCS aided by spatially  localized two photon excitation as a new fast probe of protein folding  and dynamics.    (6) Nanometer microscopy and picoNewton forces -- Develop multimode  nanometer instrumentation and techniques for scanning cell surface  receptor interactions and for practical measurements of force-velocity  relations down to the picoNewton level. Combine Optical Force  Microscopy (OFM) with optical tweezers manipulation, nanometer  molecular tracking, fluorescence imaging, atomic force microscopy AFM),  and possible near field fluorescence excitation.",
