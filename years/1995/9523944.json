 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523944  Ellis      This proposal requests support of a third and final year of  a postdoctoral research fellowship in biosciences related to  the environment.  The first two years were funded under DEB  9303261.  The project, entitled \"Nitrogen Cycling and  Ecological Sustainability in Agroecosystems\" relates  nutrient cycling to long term productivity of agroecosystems  by comparing nutrient cycles found in contemporary and  traditional villages of the region.  The project aims to  investigate the ecological basis for long-sustained  productivity of agriculture in the lake Tai region of China,  with a goal of developing quantitative tools for appraising  ecological sustainability in agroecosystems.  Work during  the two years of the original award has yielded interesting  results, indicating that natural nitrogen inputs were  important to sustaining productivity in the traditional  system, but contemporary inputs of chemical nitrogen appear  far higher than needed, and may cause pollution.  An  additional year of support will allow the PI to complete the  dataset for two annual cycles of agroecosystem management  and to process the dataset and derive nitrogen cycling  indices.",
