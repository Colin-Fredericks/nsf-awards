 "awd_abstract_narration": "All undergraduate lab courses in the Department of Planetary  Science are being completely revised, and new lab courses  created, to deliver relevant science education to liberal arts  majors satisfying their science requirement, science majors in  other disciplines requiring a planetary perspective, and  education majors preparing to teach science.   Experiments  coordinate the treatment of measurements--the traditional  hands-on activity that distinguishes laboratory exercises from  homework problems--and the models that scientists use to  interpret data and explain how systems work.   Students use  realistic scientific tools to generate data and image-processing  techniques to examine special collections of data.   Students  performing image-processing exercises use the same data and tools  and make the same measurements and discoveries that scientists  have made, thus reinforcing concepts far more effectively than  would passive examination of the same material.   The exercises  are designed to give students the opportunity to explore a  fundamental concept or process in depth and to discover its  connections to other knowledge and experience.   Most lab  exercises use computers in the expectation that science and  computer literacy levels reinforce each other.   One immediate  product of the project is an undergraduate lab manual, allowing  experiments to be adapted at other institutions.",
