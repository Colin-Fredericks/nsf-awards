 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417866  The objectives of the proposed research are to probe the energies  and lifetimes of the adsorbate and substrate excited states and  to understand the connection between the excited state relaxation  processes and the observed photochemical products.  Two-photon  photoemission in the pump-probe configuration with a tunable  laser will be used to measure the energies and lifetimes of the  excited states.  A mass spectrometer and a high-resolution  electron energy loss spectrometer provide chemical information on  the photochemical products.  The uniquely low work function of  Lanthanum hexaboride(100) serves as a model metal substrate on  which molecules with different electron affinities are adsorbed.   The effects of a band gap on the relaxation processes will be  investigated on clean and K-preadsorbed gallium nitride thin films.   Studies on the photochemistry of oxygen coadsorbed with carbon  monoxide on platinum and the photodesorption of carbon monoxide  from silicon will be pursued.  %%%%  Surface photochemistry is intimately connected to the relaxation  of excited states at the surface.  Information on the excited  states at surfaces is very scarce, despite their importance in  surface photochemistry.  The subsequent microscopic steps  following absorption of photons are largely unknown and at best  conjectured from the distribution of end products.  It has been  firmly established that the two most important and widespread  mechanisms of surface photochemistry are:  1. direct electronic  excitation of the adsorbed molecules, and 2. substrate excitation  followed by interactions of photogenerated hot carriers with the  adsorbed molecules.  The objectives of the proposed research are  to probe the energies and lifetimes of the adsorbate and  substrate excited states and to understand the connection between  the excited state relaxation processes and the observed  photochemical products.",
