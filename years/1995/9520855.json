 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dillehay    Under the direction of Dr. Tom Dillehay, Ms. A. Gwynn Henderson  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Her research  focuses on prehistoric sites located in central Kentucky and  attributed to the Fort Ancient tradition, which flourished  between 1200 and 1400 AD. Ms. Henderson has extensive prior  experience in the region. The project consists of three phases.  First, literature will be reviewed to locate recorded site  information and to note related environmental data such as water  availability and soil fertility. Over 100 sites have been  recorded in the region to date. Secondly, intensive  archaeological survey will be conducted, both to verify recorded  information and to locate new sites. At each site, the surface  distribution of materials will be mapped and a controlled  collection made. In sites with poor visibility a combination of  screened shovel probes and soil cores will be used to collect  information the size and internal organization of the site. At  newly documented occurrences, larger test units will be  excavated. Finally the material collected will be subjected to a  number of analyses. Site sizes, distributions and ecological  associations will be examined. Ceramics and other items of  material culture will be studied to determine both chronology and  relations between sites. On this basis it should be possible to  reconstruct the social and political organization of Fort Ancient  groups and to gain insight into how they interact with their  environment.    The American midwest is of great interest to archaeologists  because of the large hierarchically organized societies which  emerged there. Impressive monumental architecture exists at sites  such as Cahokia and Moundsville and scientists wish to understand  the processes through which such complexity arose. The Fort  Ancient area is of interest because its inhabitants participated  in this general cultural tradition, yet for no clearcut reason  remained at a smaller scale level of organization. M s. Henderson  believes that through careful study of this negative case, new  understanding can be gained of broader societal processes.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on the development of social complexity and assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
