 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Roseanne J. Sension of the Chemistry Department of the   University of Michigan will investigate the redistribution of energy in   condensed phase reactions of small polyene molecules, and the influence   of solvent parameters on this redistribution.  Simple diene and triene   species which serve as prototypes of complex bioorganic molecules will be   investigated .  Specifically, femtosecond absorption spectroscopy will be   used to investigate the cis-trans isomerization reactions of   1,3,5-hexatriene, 2,4-hexadiene, 1,3-butadiene, and the electrocyclic   ring opening reaction of cyclohexadiene.  The detailed mechanism of chemical transformation in fluid environments   remains among the most important unresolved problems in chemistry.  While   much attention has been given to chemical reaction dynamics of isolated   molecules in low pressure gas phase systems, the majority of interesting   reactions from a biological, environmental,, or engineering perspective,   occur in fluid condensed phase environments.  The research done in this   project will attack some of these problems in order to meet two goals.    1) To develop a detailed understanding of the role that the electronic   structure of polyenes plays in their photochemistry, and 2) to develop a   detailed understanding of the role that energy redistribution plays in   controlling polyene reactions since this is the ultimate factor in most,   if not all, chemical reactions, be they in condensed phases or in   isolated molecules.  The principles deduced from the studies carried out   in this research on prototype molecules  will have application to general   condensed phase reaction dynamics.",
