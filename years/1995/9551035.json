 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami is a dynamic, multicultural city at the gateway of the  United States, Europe, and Latin America, a characteristic that  has created the largest manufacturing region in Florida.  The  school, one of the nation's three Carnegie II doctoral-granting  universities with more than 50 percent minority students, is  continuously updating its curriculum to teach the constantly  changing knowledge base of modern engineering.   In addition, the  school graduates more Hispanic engineers than any other  institution in the nation, and more than 60 percent of its  engineering graduates continue on to graduate programs.        This project enhances the current curriculum with signal  processing applications in mechanical engineering to introduce  conventional mechanical engineering students to system  identification, failure prediction, and nondestructive testing.    These areas enhance the instrumentation and electromechanical  system design skills of our students.   Eleven new experiments  have been added to the curriculum to open one new course and to  improve six existing courses.   Students use state-of-the-art  precise measurement equipment in laboratories to learn the basics  of monitoring and analysis techniques.       The experiments were  prepared with the assistance of a select group of students.    Equipment purchased for this project is used for various  contracts (with local industry and federal agencies) as part of  undergraduate research projects.   These undergraduate student  activities generate funding to support maintenance expenses and  future enhancement.   The student activities associated with this  project are targeted towards juniors and seniors.",
