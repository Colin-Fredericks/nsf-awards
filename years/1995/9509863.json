 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509863  Bleil    The primary interest of Dr. Bleil's laboratory is analysis of  mammalian fertilization at the molecular level, combining  techniques of cell biology, biochemistry and molecular genetics. He  has identified a mouse sperm protein, a lectin called sp56, which  has many properties expected of the protein responsible for sperm  recognition of the mouse egg's zona pellucida. He has recently  isolated and cloned the cDNA encoding sp56. Amino acid sequence  derived from this cDNA indicates that: 1) the protein is translated  on the endoplasmic reticulum, 2) has no transmembrane domain, and  3) is a member of a superfamily of extracellular protein receptors.  Probes directed against sp56 and its mRNA reveal that transcription  of the sp56 gene and translation of its mRNA occur exclusively in  spermatogenic cells of the mouse. The long term goals to be  addressed by studies described here are: 1) to genetically prove or  disprove the hypothesis that sp56 is the sperm protein which  recognizes the mouse egg zona pellucida, mediating sperm binding to  the egg's zona pellucida, and 2) to determine the molecular  structure of the sp56/ZP3 complex. In order to attain these goals,  the gene encoding sp56 must be identified and isolated. The  specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: 1) To use cDNA  encoding sp56, currently available in this laboratory, to screen a  mouse genomic library. Genomic DNA clones, including sequence  upstream of the translated region, will be purified and sequenced;  2) To analyze the sequence of the sp56 gene in order to identify  regulatory sequences which might encode specific expression in  testes. Comparison with other, previously identified genes which  are expressed in testes may reveal common regulatory sequences.  ***",
