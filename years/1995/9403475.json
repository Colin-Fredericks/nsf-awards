 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal technical review (FTR) encompasses a range of  structured,  collaborative methods employing technical personnel to improve  the  quality of a software development artifact.  Research shows  that FTR, when  appropriately practiced, provides significant  benefits. However, research also  shows that FTR introduces  substantial new overhead, and that its  cost-effectiveness is  easily compromised by a variety of group process  obstacles.  In  addition, current FTR practice is difficult and costly to  investigate effectively, and thus many important questions about  its nature and  comparative effectiveness remain unanswered.    This project uses CSRS, a  client-server, instrumented,  collaborative software review system to  investigate issues in  research and practice of FTR. Using CSRS, controlled  empirical  studies provide insight into factors (such as the presence or  absence of meetings) influencing the cost-effectiveness of  review.  The project  is also enhancing CSRS to support its public  release and use in case-study  research in industrial settings.  These efforts provide insight into technology  transfer issues  arising in the shift from manual to computer-supported software  review.  They also support evaluation of novel forms of FTR made  possible by  computer support, such as software review involving  20 or more participants,  and software review where participants  are geographically distributed.",
