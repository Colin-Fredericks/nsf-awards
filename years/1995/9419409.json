 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UC Santa Cruz Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry requests  funds to purchase a 500 MHz- 11.75 Tesla Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  spectrometer. The central instrumentation lab in our Department of  Chemistry and Biochemistry provides analytical support for the  researchers of the UCSC chemistry and biochemistry community. It is  managed by a full-time staff person who provides maintenance, training  and advisory services. One 250 MHz NMR spectrometer and one 300 MHz NMR  spectrometer are housed in this laboratory and these instruments are  used on a round-the-clock basis. While our department does not have a  500 MHz instrument, a triple channel 500 MHz spectrometer, purchased  from a Markey Foundation grant, is housed in the UCSC Center for the  Molecular Biology of RNA. Unfortunately, essentially no time is  available on it for general chemistry use.    In this application we outline the benefit that will be derived from  the acquisition of an NMR spectrometer with state-of-the art  capabilities. Overall, this equipment will support the education and  training of more than 10 postdoctorals, 33 graduate student researchers  and 10 undergraduates who are involved in the programs of six core  research groups. A comparable number of postdoctoral and student  researchers are affiliated with the programs of another six secondary  user research groups. The six projects of the primary users include:  Structural Characterizations of Exotic Marine Sponge Natural Products  (Organic Chemistry Prof. Crews), Structural Studies of Partially-Folded  Intermediate States of Proteins (Biochemistry Prof. Fink), Synthesis of  Complex Molecules (Organic Chemistry Prof. Konopelski), Designed  Analogues of Metallobleomycins (Inorganic Chemistry Prof. Mascharak),  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance of Peptide Helix Conformations (Physical  Biochemistry Prof. Millhauser), and NMR Studies of Lense Transparency  (Physical Biochemistry Prof. Schleich).The secondary user research  groups include those involved in the follo wing subject areas: three  organic, one bioinorganic, one marine chemical toxicology, and one  biological NMR.    Our faculty has continued to keep abreast of developments in NMR  technology. Two of the investigators of this proposal (Crews and  Schleich) have extensively obtained and used 500 MHz data in their  research. Three others (Konopelski, Millhauser, and Mascharak) each  include examples of actual 500 or 600 MHz data in their research  descriptions. We desperately need to have a more rapid turn-around time  for two-dimensional (2D) experiments.. Neither of the two instruments  in the central lab can satisfy the desire to carry out contemporary 2D  NMR experiments. These two instruments have very limited INVERSE  detection capabilities because both lack the necessary probes and  associated hardware for such detection. In addition, the reduced  sensitivity at both 250 MHz and 300 MHz make the inverse detection  method much more difficult to satisfactorily implement. We need access  to rotating frame experiments. As will be noted in the proposal, many  important 2D-NMR rotating frame experiments such as TOCSY, ROESY,  HMQC-TOCSY or T-ROESY are not available to our researchers. Overall,  such a limited capacity does not allow us to rapidly obtain  sophisticated NMR data which is a must in structure studies of complex  organic, biochemical, and bioinorganic compounds. The additional  obvious major problem is that signals can not be resolved when large  clusters of protons overlap for the increasingly complex molecules  being studied by our researchers.    In summary, the instrument we seek will make it possible for our  student and faculty researchers to increase their productivity. The use  of this new instrument will be overseen by James Loo, who has been the  Chemistry NMR lab manager since 1980.",
