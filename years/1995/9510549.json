This conference is focused on recent advances in understanding the fundamentals of oxidation/corrosion of oxidation-resistant alloys and ceramics, with emphasis on their role in high-temperature applications.  Individual sessions are:  corrosion aspects of solid oxide fuel cells; catastrophic corrosion at intermediate temperatures; stress effects in oxidation; integrity of the scale/metal interface; thermal barrier coatings:  applications and degradation resistance; oxidation of multiphase alloys; design of laboratory experiments for industrial applications; and contrasting aspects of silica-forming materials.  NSF support is directed toward young scientists and students.  ***This conference has values to the application of materials used at high temperatures such as gas turbines and reactors.  Discussions on protection of corrosion with carbon-containing gasses, sulphur- and chlorine- containing gases at intermediate temperatures, and  the ceramic coating that is influenced by high temperature will be very useful in the industry.  The fundamental principle of growth and relief of stress on scale, scale-metal interface, oxidation of multiphase alloys, and protection of silicon and silicon carbide ceramics will be very important in understanding the phenomena of the developing technology in corrosion protection.***",
