 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in operations research and production systems between Ioannis Minis of the University of Maryland and  Jean-Marie Proth of INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics) in Lorraine, France.  The objective is to develop a system that facilitates effective and efficient production planning for complex manufacturing systems.  The investigators will study a multi-product production planning problem.  The  problem addresses a way to determine the number of products to be manufactured over  many time periods in order to minimize the cost function. The investigators propose to use a parameterized hierarchical production management system to deal with the numerous variables and account for random events that disrupt production.  In this approach they will aggregate the time units, the machines, and the part types in order to reduce the size of the problem.  After computing a solution for the aggregated problem, they propose to solve the subproblems corresponding to each group of machines in  order to achieve a near-optimal detailed production plan.  The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration considerable expertise in optimization and  perturbation analysis, production hierarchy, and aggregation schemes.  This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in production planning and scheduling, parallel computing, and his practical experience in manufacturing.",
