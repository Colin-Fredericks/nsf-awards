 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina State U.  This CAREER award is made in the Organic  Dynamics Program in support of   the research and teaching activities of Dr. David Schultz.  The research   will focus on the design, synthesis,  and characterization of molecular   magnetic materials based on  tetraarylporphyrins. The porphyrin nucleus   will provide sites for attaching organic free radical groups as well as   binding sites for metals, allowing for the preparation of extended   materials including charge transfer complexes and coordination polymers   through complexation with multidentate ligands. Specifically, metal   tetraarylporphyrin units  with four free radical substituents will be   oxidized to give  pentaradical systems which can undergo high spin   coupling. Characterization will be by EPR, crystallographic structure   determination and magnetometer measurements. Magnetization measurements   will be complemented by molecular modeling of intramolecular spin-spin   interactions.  Dr. Schultz'  teaching plan will focus on the development   of  animation  software for three dimensional  visualization of organic   chemistry structures and reactions. A salient feature will be   incorporating the animations into the organic chemistry courses at North   Carolina State and making them available to the chemistry community via   the Mosaic World-Wide-Web.  Metal porphyrin-based organic magnetic materials are of inherent interest   both for a fundamental  understanding of the molecular basis of magnetism   and their possible application to magnetic coatings and composites and   radical probes in biological systems. The involvement of both graduate   and undergraduate students in the implementation of the research will   have a significant educational value.",
