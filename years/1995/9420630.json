The topics to be covered include:  medical studies and clinical trials;  epidemiological studies; environmental studies;  genetics and biotechnology; and population  studies\".  The emphasis will be on the  relevance of statistical methodology in the  scientific investigations in these areas.   particular attention will be paid to the  prospective and retrospective picture relevant  to third world countries along with their vast  cultural and ethnic diversities.  Tutorial  presentations by international authorities, as  well as contributed papers, will be included.   A conference volume will be published for  international distribution.     Scope:  This project will enable six U.S.  scientists to participate in this important  meeting and to interact with scientists from  Egypt and other countries in the region in a  field where advanced mathematical and  statistical tools may be applied to real-life  problems of concern to these countries, and  consequently, to other developed countries.   The meeting is organized and supported in Egypt  by Dr. A.E. Sarhan, President of the Egyptian  Statistical Society, and professor , Institute  of Statistics, Cairo University.  The published  proceedings will serve as a reference for  future use by students and researchers.  It is  expected that contacts will lead to increased  interest in collaborative research by U.S. and  Egyptian scientists.  ***",
