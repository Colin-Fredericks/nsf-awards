 "awd_abstract_narration": "If one is to posit that virtual reality will be used to train humans in critical performance tasks,  the key becomes finding what sort of training is transferable between the virtual and physical worlds.  Experiments performed thus far in the CAVE Virtual Environment  showed significant performance  improvement in virtual reality-trained subjects compared to the untrained population for the same  task.  Further experiments will quantitatively assess what may be perhaps the most important aspect of  virtual reality research--the relationship between the technology and the training task which would  result in a maximum transfer of training.  Early results  indicate that latency is a severe problem  and that restricting virtual reality solely to the visual domain limits its training application.  This work will extend the study of latency measurement to wide area networks using CAVE-to-CAVE  experiments over the vBNS national network as the model.  The results are expected to have broad  applicability in the National Challenge areas, particularly in manufacturing and education  If one is to posit that virtual reality will be used to train humans in critical performance tasks,  the key becomes finding what sort of training is transferable between the virtual and physical worlds.
