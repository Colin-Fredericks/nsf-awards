The system of guanidine salts involves the  simultaneous interactions of proteins with the Gua+ ions and the  salt anions.  This brings into play the phenomena of additivity  and compensation between the ions, as well as the expected  compensation between Gua ions interacting with different loci on  the protein surface.  Measurements of the thermodynamic  (preferential) binding of guanidine salts with proteins in the  intact and unfolded disulfide cleaved states will be carried out  over a broad concentration range (0.5 to 7.0 M GuaHC1) at several  solvent pHs.  From these, free energies of interaction isotherms  will be generated over the entire denaturant concentration range  for both the native and unfolded states of the protein.   Experiments as a function of temperature will give enthalpies and  entropies of interaction.  The preferential binding values will be  compared then with site occupancy data on the protein, which will  permit to decompose the water molecules in contact with the protein  surface into those that are exchangeable with co-solvent molecules  and of those at loci from which the Gua+ salts  are totally  excluded. The establishment of this balance will permit to define  the role of weakly interacting water in the stabilization of  protein structure.  Comparison between the Gua salts (from sulfate,  a stabilizer to thiocyanate, a strong denaturant) will permit to  define the role of the guanidinium ion in the destabilization  process.  The preferential interactions will be measured by  dialysis equilibrium coupled with high precision densimetry at  various temperature; various spectroscopic techniques will be used  to define protein transitions.  %%%  The research addresses the issue of the stabilization of proteins  by various added materials.  In the expression and processing of  newly synthesized proteins by recombinant techniques, such as used  in biotechnology, it is frequently necessary to dissolve them out  of large aggregates (inclusion bodies) formed in the cells and then  to fold them into an active structure, and to maintain that active  material intact.  The solubilization and refolding processes are  frequently done in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride which,  at high concentrations, is a destabilizing agent.  On the other  hand, the related salt, guanidine sulfate is a good stabilizing  agent,but a poor solubilizer.  At present the uses of such agents  are mostly empirical.  The rules that govern the actions of these  agents will be established by detailed physical chemical studies of  their interactions with proteins and the role played by water in  these actions will be established.  Such a rational development of  the rules of additivity and compensation between these, and other  additives to the solvent medium will permit, in turn, the rational  formulation of complex solvent mixtures of strong and weak  stabilizers and destabilizers to use systematically in the  extraction and folding of newly synthesized proteins, as well as in  their long range storage in active form.  ***",
