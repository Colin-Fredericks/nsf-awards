 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sequential  decision  tasks appear in  many  real-world  domains,  including  control, resource allocation, routing, and scheduling.  The  objective  of this project is to develop a new  approach  to  sequential decision making based on symbiotic evolution of neural  networks.   In symbiotic evolution, a population of  neurons  are  evolved   with   genetic  algorithms  to   cooperate   and   form  decision-making  networks.   Diversity  is  maintained   in   the  population  as  part  of the task and the system  can  find  good  solutions  efficiently  even  in  difficult  tasks  with   sparse  reinforcement. In the proposed project, symbiotic evolution  will  be  analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, the algorithm  will  be  further  developed and applied  to  complex  real-world  domains  such as local-area network management, and  a  practical  high-level  interface  will be developed that  will  allow  rapid  application  of  the method to new domains.  The main  scientific  contributions of the research are expected to be:  (1)  a  novel,  powerful  method  for  extracting and  encoding  problem-specific  knowledge automatically for sequential decision making, and (2) a  thorough  understanding of the role of diversity and  cooperation  in   genetic   algorithms.   The  development  of   the   general  application interface should also benefit many practical  fields,  including  control engineering, military science, and  operations  management.   The main hypotheses to be tested are: (1)   Pattern  recognition  and  generalization capabilities of neural  networks  can be used to implement effective and robust sequential decision  making  strategies;(2) Genetic algorithms can  discover  powepful  problem-specific  decision-making strategies  even  under  sparse  reinforcement;  3)  By making population diversity  an  essential  part  of  the task, symbiotic evolution can develop solutions  to  harder  problems and do it more efficiently than standard genetic  algorithms.",
