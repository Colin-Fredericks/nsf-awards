 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506736  Nanni  The objective of this project is to provide the engineering  science necessary for the implementation of externally bonded FRP  reinforcement for the repair of concrete structures, except for  the case of members subjected to compression where enhancement of  strength and ductility is the result of lateral confinement of  concrete.  The material forms of interest are highly flexible  sheets made of dry fibers or prepregs that can be adhered to a  concrete surface after minimum surface preparation by means of a  polymeric resin.  The fibers are high-strength and high-modulus  such as carbon and aramid.  The methodology of the project  consists of an experimental and analytical study based primarily  on tensile reinforced concrete specimens.  Tests are conducted  under quasi-static conditions after mechanical conditioning  (repeated and sustained loading) and environmental conditioning  (thermal cycling and exposure to aggressive environments).  The  experimental program is necessary to quantify the effects of  externally bonded FRP reinforcement on concrete resistance to  cracking and to assess long-term strengthening performance.  A  part of the durability study is to determine whether the presence  of FRP reinforcement promotes/inhibits degradation of steel  reinforcement in concrete (i.e., galvanic corrosion when FRP is  made of conductive fibers).  Various material forms, conditions  at time of repair and preparation conditions are investigated.  Primary measurements include load, strain, interfacial  delamination, crack opening, and electrical  conductivity.    The project is conducted with the collaboration of the  manufacturing and construction industry in the intent of securing  suitable materials and of using field applications as a test bed  for laboratory findings and verification of modeling.  ***",
