The  progress of seismology  has been hampered by the lack of low cost, high performance,  portable,  rugged, easy to install, broad frequency band  instruments.  This project is aimed at filling this  void.  In Phase  I, problems encountered by previous researchers, including these  investigators, have  been overcome, and conceptual prototypes were  built.  Field tests showed very close correlation with  STS-s  seismometers in recording remote earthquakes.  Phase II theoretical  and experimental effort  will be focused on the optimization of all  major seismometer characteristics:  transfer function,  self-noise,  transducer coefficient, temperature stability, as well as  manufacturability, while  maintaining the low cost.  Every prototype  will be subjected to extensive laboratory and field  testing at  various locations in the U.S.  The ultimate goal is the  implementation of three  seismometer versions:  Basic (noise 200-400  nm/s, 0.03-5 Hz band); Limited Band Advanced (20-40 nm/s,  0.3-25  Hz); Broad Band Advanced (less than 75 nm/s, 0.016-5 Hz).  Special attention  will be devoted to the  development of an expanded temperature range  instrument for field applications.  A built-in  magnetohydrodynamic  calibrator will be developed for the advanced seismometer versions.   An optional  PC-based multichannel programmable Seismic Data  Acquisition system will be developed with on-board  real-time  keeping and anti-aliasing filtering.  In order to facilitate and  expedite the evaluation  of newly developed transducers and  seismometers, an inexpensive calibration platform will be built.",
