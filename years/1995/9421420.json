 "awd_abstract_narration": "94221420  Howe  Daylength, or photoperiod, is one of the most important  environmental cues controlling the onset of dormancy in  perennial plants.  Short days induce growth-cessation, the  initiation of cold-acclimation, and the formation of a  terminal bud.  By responding to daylength, the initiation of  dormancy can be closely synchronized with the end of the  growing season and plants can begin acclimating prior to the  onset of low temperatures in the fall.  Because the length  of the growing season varies latitudinally, photoperiodic  ecotypes have evolved in species with large latitudinal  distributions.  In the northern hemisphere, for example,  trees from nothrern locations respond to longer photoperiods  and initiate dormancy earlier in the season than do southern  genotypes.  Differences in response occur even when the  ecotypes are grown in common-garden tests under the same  photoperiodic regime, demonstrating that photoperiodism is  under strong genetic control.  The long-term goals of this  project are to determine the genetic basis of photoperiodic  ecotypes in perennial plants and to characterize the early  events in short-day induced bud set, using black cottonwood  as a model species.    This research will integrate information on photoperiodism  at the populational, whole-plant , and molecular genetic  levels in order to understand the evolutionary processes  leading to ecotypic variation in plants.  Because both the  timing of bud set and plant architecture are important  determinants of plant productivity, this research has  important implications for plant breeding.  This research  will also add to our understanding of the ecological role of  phytochrome in plants.",
