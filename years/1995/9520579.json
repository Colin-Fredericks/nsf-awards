Title: Variability of the Climate System    The project consists of a series of numerical experiments designed  to increase understanding of the natural variability of the climate  system.  It is necessary to have accurate estimates of the natural  variability to identify climate signals produced by external  forcing and to evaluate climate predictions.  This research is  relevant to the goals of TOGA and CLIVAR/GOALS and is expected to  contribute to IPCC/USGCRP.  The proposed research will define and  carry out an experimental procedure to isolate and estimate the  contributions to natural climatic variability from atmospheric,  land and oceanic processes.  Specific processes that will be  examined are atmospheric chaos, stochastic forcing of the land  surface, stochastic forcing of the ocean mixed layer, coupled  ocean/atmosphere chaos, the annual cycle of solar forcing.  Results  will be obtained by analysis of several multi-decade to century  long numerical integrations made with variants of a numerical  climate model.  The basic version of the model will include global  atmosphere and ocean general circulation submodels, land surface  processes including effects due to vegetation, and sea ice.    First, the errors of the fully interactive coupled model in  simulating the observed annual mean and annual cycle of sea surface  temperature will be ascertained.  Modifications to the model will  be made to reduce the magnitude of these errors.  A control  integration without flux corrections will be carried out to  determine the equilibrium climate.  In subsequent integrations the  interactions between the component submodels will be restricted in  order to either eliminate or reduce atmosphere/land and  atmosphere/ocean coupling.  The changes, which will be introduced  in various combinations, include replacement of the dynamical ocean  with a specified climatological sea surface temp erature or by mixed  layer ocean, specification of climatological soil mixture and snow  cover, and elimination of the annual cycle.  The climatology for  the restricted model simulations will be that of the control  integration.  Intercomparsion of the results and Nature will  provide estimates of the contributions of the atmosphere/land and  atmosphere/ocean interactions to the modeled and actual climate  variability.    Related experiments will also be done to study the influence of  flux correction and oceanic initial conditions in climate  simulation and prediction.  Changes in natural variability  introduced by the flux correction procedure will be evaluated using  an equilibrium simulation in which the full climate model before  improvement is flux corrected to produce the same climatology as  the control integration.  An experiment will be done to estimate  the departure of the current climate from equilibrium due to the  changing greenhouse forcing.",
