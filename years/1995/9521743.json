Participants will be selected from the attendees at the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE MODELING AND SIMULATION organized by the \"International Association of Science and Technology for Development\" (IASTED) to be held in Columbo, Sri Lanka from July 26-28, 1995 and he students whose research interests overlap the novel semiconductor Neural Network Device/Sensor areas.  IASTED is an organization whose main purpose is to further economic development by promoting science and technology, with emphasis on interdisciplinary areas.  This effort of promoting interdisciplinary technological conferences will help the new generation of scientists and engineers who need to broaden their expertise beyond their training in a highly focused area.  In addition to participants, scientists and engineers in Sri-Lanka, a developing country, will also profit from this particular meeting, due to the exposure to the new research ideas and developments in the western world.  ***",
