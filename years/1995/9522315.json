The  Internet CERT coordination center is located at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering  Institute and has been active since November 18, 1988. CERT is chartered to work with the Internet  community in detecting and resolving computer security incidents.    Since its inception, CERT has responded to continuous stream of security incidents. The incident rate  and impact on Internet sites has grown steadily as the Internet user population has grown. As the  incident rate has grown, so has the sophistication of the intruders. Where intruders once focused on  exploitation of weak passwords and widely known vulnerabilities, they have now progressed to  examining source files for new security flaws, exploiting protocol flaws, and using tool kits to  automate their attacks and increase their impact.    CERT is expanding its program to increase its emphasis on incident prevention through a combination  of technology improvement, security awareness and training, and security assessment activities. This  expanded program includes two areas where CERT can provide special help that will facilitate the  orderly, secure progression to the next stage in the Internet evolution:         1. Collaboration with router manufacturers              2. Collaboration with network service Providers",
