T., University of Houston    This research is a three-year comprehensive study to be  completed as a  collective effort of scientists (political, social, and  natural) and  engineers from the University of Houston, officials from the  City of  Houston, and pipeline contractors which will develop new  technologies for  the physical renewal of the Greater Houston Wastewater  System and produce a  paradigm of policy formulation regarding the sharing of  responsibilities  between public and private sectors.    The project will study mechanisms of microbially-induced  corrosion, and  quantify the rate of deterioration of concrete pipes,  plastic pipes,  plastic linings and coatings.  New methods of corrosion  assessment will be  developed based on electromagnetic wave technology.  The  research will  identify new evaluation methods for the viability of new  coating materials  and plastic linings for pipe rehabilitation and new material  mixes to be  used as bedding and backfill in placing new pipes.  Physical  and computer  models will also be developed to address the problem of air-  hammer in  pipelines that results in environmental hazard.    The research will also develop and apply a process which a  low-income,  minority, inner-city community can follow to renew its  wastewater lines.  The final task is to develop an integrated system and  decision-making  methodology for intelligent renewal of wastewater systems.  The technical  and non-technical findings of the study, as well as the  methodology for  decision-making concerning community responsibilities, will  serve as new  paradigms not only for future works in Houston, but also for  similar  programs in other urban communities throughout the U.S.",
