 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506237  Perrimon    A detailed analysis of genes critical for early events in cellular  determination is one of the best approaches to the understanding of  the mechanics of early development. Embryonic development in  Drosophila requires both maternal and zygotic gene products. To  identify genes that control specific embryonic patterning events,  maternal functions have been detected via mutations isolated from  screens for female sterility, while zygotic functions which are  masked by the maternally stored gene product and loci with specific  maternal effect lethal phenotypes which are associated with pre-  imaginal lethality cannot be identified using these two approaches.  To characterize the function of such loci Dr. Perrimon has  previously successfully used germline mosaic techniques. These  analyses, which were limited to the X-chromosome for technical  reasons, identified a large number of new genes that play critical  roles during embryonic development. The goal of this proposal is to  conduct near saturation screens for all zygotic lethal mutations  located on the second and third chromosomes (80% of the genome)  that are associated with specific maternal effect lethal  phenotypes. These experiments will provide a complete description  of the kinds of processes controlled by the maternal activity of  essential genes. In addition, they will provide the foundation for  further detailed analyses of various patterning systems that  operate during embryogenesis. Dr. Perrimon's laboratory will focus  on the characterization of new terminal class genes. In addition,  since these screens will generate a large collection of additional  mutations with interesting phenotypes, the collection of mutants  will be made available to the fly community. The wealth of  information generated from these studies will contribute to our  general understanding of the mechanisms underlying embryonic  pattern formation in Drosophila and will identify the genetic  functions encoded by the Drosophila genome .  ***",
