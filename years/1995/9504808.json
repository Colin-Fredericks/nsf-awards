 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAR-9504808  Durek, Joseph J.    The goal of this project is to characterize the three-dimensional anelastic structure of the earthOs mantle in order to constrain models of temperature and viscosity variations in the mantle.  This is a notable challenge because it is difficult to separate the effects of attenuation from elastic focusing of energy.  The immediate objective, therefore, is to characterize focusing better in order to remove this contribution to attenuation.  A relatively new array of 13 broadband seismometers administered by U.C. Berkeley can provide critical data for resolution of this problem.  The Fellow will examine anomalies in surface wave signals received by this array from clusters of sources in order to determine the anelastic structure along specific corridors.  Because the potential sources of the anomalies have are sensitive to different components of the velocity structure, it is possible to better quantify elastic focusing along parallel ray paths, or OcorridorsO without associating them with a specific global 3-D elastic model.  Applying similar techniques to other arrays and clusters of earthquakes will lead to improved attenuation modeling along other corridors, and ultimately, at a global scale.",
