 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452881  Oregon State University  Information transfer is often a serious problem for students with  disabilities in most academic disciplines, but it is particularly  severe in science, engineering, math (SEM) and other technical  subjects.  Students with visual impairments and learning  disabilities are frequently overwhelmed by the difficulties of  learning, using, and/or presenting equations, graphs, schematic  and conceptual drawings, and other non-textual information  encountered in SEM.  The objectives of SEED are to develop  inexpensive easy-to-use computer-based methods and devices to  reduce or eliminate the problem with SEM information flow with  the eventual result that significantly more students with  disabilities can be recruited and retained in SEM education and  careers.    The initial focus is development of the Audio System for  Scientific Reading (ASTER) into a flexible tool for use by people  with visual and learning disabilities to read, write, manipulate,  and understand SEM literature.  ASTER developments are considered  to be critical for making SEM materials accessible to students  who are visually impaired or who have learning disabilities.  The  ASTER program currently runs on a Unix workstation using a  Dectalk voice synthesizer.  ASTER's internal representation of a  document is a hierarchical tree that allows the reader to easily  change the style in which the document is read aloud and also  allows very fine control over where the reading begins and ends.   These two controls make audio reading of technical material much  easier to comprehend for these students.  ASTER will be rewritten  in a common version of Lisp (such as CLisp) that run under DOS,  OS/2, Linux, and some versions of Unix.  Subsequently, ASTER will  be rewritten in C++ to make it possible to port ASTER to other  platforms.  SEED also will collaborate on the development and  evaluation of tactile tablets on which raised images (comprised  of Dotsplus and figures) can be used to display complex  sc ientific equations with each term expandable in audio by ASTER.    SEED will recruit talented, motivated university students with  disabilities to serve as SEED research assistants in projects.   They will be highly visible role models for other students with  disabilities; and their successes should increase the confidence  of teachers, counselors, parents, and potential employers in the  ability of students with disabilities to succeed in SEM.***",
