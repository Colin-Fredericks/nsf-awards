 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424061  Eisenberg   The REU Site will provide mentored research experiences for ten undergraduate interns within the context of ongoing research programs in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University.  These ongoing projects span a wide range of research activities representative of Biomedical Engineering and include both modeling/simulation and experimental work.  The REU intern will work on their individual projects as members of research teams in the laboratories of the participating investigators.  All interns will be exposed to the entire spectrum of research activities included in this proposal through joint weekly meetings in which the interns discuss their work with each other.  These sessions will also be used to provide a forum for presentations and group discussions about a variety of topics intended to supplement the research experiences and encourage the interns to pursue graduate training in Biomedical Engineering.  An orientation at the beginning of the program will introduce the interns to the undergraduate research experiences and help familiarize the participants with the process of initiating independent inquiry in which there are a number of degrees of freedom in the methods chosen and the outcomes obtained.  Oral and written technical communication skills will also be introduced.  The goal of the REU Site program in Biomedical Engineering is to create an environment and culture to encourage the undergraduate participants to pursue research careers in Biomedical Engineering by exposing them to the intellectual challenge and excitements of independent inquiry.  ***",
