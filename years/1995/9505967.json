This workshop is meant to address issues that face those parties that have interest in the research, development and implementation of agile manufacturing concepts and technology within industry.  The specific emphasis is to help agility management, researchers and other stakeholders define and determine the process of development, planning, acquisition, and use of benchmarks, with a discussion on needs, lessons learned, effort and utility of various benchmarking processes and techniques.   This workshop is to be composed  of  speakers and participants from academia, government and industry.   The experiences of these individuals and results of this workshop will help those involved with agility programs, including the NSF/ARPA sponsored agile manufacturing research institutes, the agility forum (AMEF), TEAM, interested agile pilots representatives, and various government agencies.  This workshop is also intended to increase the awareness and definition of agility and its related performance measures.",
