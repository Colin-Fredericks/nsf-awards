 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports basic characterization of calcareous  nannofossils as part of the development of the biostratigraphic  framework for drill core recovered by the Cape Roberts Project  (CRP).  This is a major program within the international  Antarctic earth science community, designed to sample the  stratigraphic record that spans the time interval 30 to 100  million years ago, by drilling four sites on the flank of the  Victoria Land basin. This award is to support the drilling  program by providing rapid age and paleoenvironmental information  through the study of calcareous nannofossils.  This research will  systematically sample the recovered sedimentary cores and analyze  their calcareous nannofossil content at the Crary Science and  Engineering Center (CSEC) at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The  preparation of an Initial Reports volume at the end of each of  the two drilling seasons will include the results of this work as  part of the initial characterization of the cores.    The calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic record spans the  entire interval to be cored by the CRP. Recent work on calcareous  nannofossils from ocean drilling sites around Antarctica has  yielded a refined zonation for the Paleogene and Upper Cretaceous  of the Southern Ocean that will provide a high-resolution  biostratigraphic framework for hemipelagic and pelagic sediments  recovered by Cape Roberts drilling. This research, when combined  with data from other fossil groups, magnetostratigraphic data,  and other age-dating methods, will provide integrated age control  that is essential for other geological investigations. In  addition, calcareous nannofossils are excellent  paleoenvironmental indicators for surface water temperature and  productivity.  Statistical analysis of quantitative population  census data will be used to infer paleoenvironmental variations  during the Paleogene and Cretaceous.  These data, in combination  with data from other fossil groups and sedimentological studies,  will be useful f or assessing climatic change through the critical  period of 30-100 million years before present.",
