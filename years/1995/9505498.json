 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports cooperation between Drs. Paul Bishop, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Harry Mark, Department of Chemistry, at the University of Cincinnati, and Dr. Ahmed G. Abdo, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Cairo.  The target of the proposed work will be the analytical applications of conducting polymers as anion and biological molecule sensors in a 3-electrode set-up and in flow systems, as well as ion selective electrodes and preconcentration devices.  Typical examples of these applications are in the fields of anion determination for water quality and pollution control and the determination of some biological molecules of biomedical and industrial interest.  Conducting polymers and functionalized polymers prepared by chemical and electrochemical synthesis will be used.  It is hoped to develop novel analytical techniques in the fields of anion, cation and molecular analyses where novel detectors are needed for aqueous environmental and biomedical samples, which are of primary concern in the U.S. and in Egypt.  Conducting polymer micro-electrodes will also be designed for effective in vivo analysis in human body fluids and inter- or intra-cellular examinations.  The latter application has not been extensively exploited and productive efforts are anticipated.      Scope:  This project will allow a cooperative activity between Dr. Mark who has expertise in electrochemistry and organic polymers; Dr. Bishop whose expertise is in biodegradation of toxic organics and transport in biofilms, and Dr. Abdo who is a recent Ph.D. (from U. Cincinnati) with expertise in analytical applications of polymers and chemical sensors, as well as electrochemistry. The project involves a visit by Dr. Abdo to Cincinnati for two months, and one visit by a US participant to Cairo in each of three years.  The results of the research could have some profound applications, and could lead to economic and environmental benefits, for both countries.    The project meets the objectives of the Division of International Programs in linking US scientists with foreign scientists when the expertise and capabilities are complementary, and where the project could lead to long term collaboration and to mutually beneficial results.",
