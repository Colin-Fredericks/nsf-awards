Although the STM was used originally only as a  high-resolution, low-speed electronic imaging device, recent  generation STM's have seen a wider variety of applications,  including the picosecond resolution of tunneling and  excitation processes and the control of nonlinear optical  processes such as frequency mixing and harmonic generation.  One long-time goal has been the ability to use the STM to  construct and characterize new nanoscale structures, formed  atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule.  Although elusive,  this capability promises the investigation of quantum size  effects, atomic interactions, and novel electronic circuit  elements.    This award will find the construction of the next-generation  STM, designed specifically to assemble and characterize  nanoscale structures with unusual electronic properties.  This machine will uniquely combine materials synthesis,  manipulation, and high-resolution characterization  capabilities, including operation at low temperature in  ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) under high magnetic field, with  atomic resolution and with unsurpassed high-speed data  processing. Several outstanding problems in condensed matter  physics necessitate such a machine and provide the initial  motivation for its construction:  (1) studies of metallic  and superconducting clusters; (2) spectroscopy of one-and  two-dimensional materials; and (3) fabrication of networks  and quantum confined structures.  ***",
