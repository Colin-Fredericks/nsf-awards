 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constraint logic programming is a declarative programming  paradigm which has proven to be expressive for  computationally difficult  problems such as scheduling, air  traffic flow management, simulation of dynamic  physical  systems, solution of differential equations, and options  trading  analysis.  However, while CLP languages are  expressive, their execution is not  always efficient enough  for the problems to which they apply.  The goal of this  research is to develop strategies for fast execution of  constraint logic  programs, particularly in the domain of  real or rational arithmetic  constraints.  To this end,  incremental Gaussian elimination-based and  simplex-based  constraint satisfaction algorithms are compared for their  efficiency in the context of CLP; the feasibility of  intelligent backtracking  and independent and-parallelism is  investigated; work on asynchronous parallel  execution of the  inference engine and solver is continued; and parallel  incremental algorithms for constraint solving are being  developed.   The   research program has strong  undergraduate involvement and  research components. Students  are involved in the design, implementation,  and testing  of algorithms, and are exposed to concepts from the  theory of  computation, programming language design, the  linear programming problem, AI  search and backtracking  strategies, and parallel computation.",
