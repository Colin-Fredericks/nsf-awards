 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the Inductive Plasma Centrifuge (IPC) concept, a novel, high throughput approach for separating elements of different atomic weights. Mass based separation, ranging from the separation of heavy metal contaminated wastes to medical isotopes, is an important problem encountered in environmental remediation activities and in industry. A cost effective, high mass throughput separation method is needed. Vacuum arc centrifuges, studied for medical isotope separation, are limited by low mass throughput and high energy consumption, while gas centrifuges have limited rotation velocities and small separative powers. The objective of the proposed effort is to determine the feasibility of the IPC concept to overcome these limitations. This objective will be addressed in Phase I by performing three tasks: (1) design and assemble a small-scale IPC experiment; (2) perform preliminary feasibility experiments at pressures of up to 1 torr in order to demonstrate rotation frequencies of at least 105 radians/sec, and (3) develop the conceptual design for a Phase II IPC laboratory prototype device. If successful, this work will form a firm basis for comprehensive feasibility demonstrations of the IPC concept in Phase II. This project is responsive to the 1994 Solicitation emphasis on National Critical Technologies in the areas of Materials Synthesis and Processing, and Pollution Minimization and Remediation.",
