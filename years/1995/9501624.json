 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compile-time type information is believed to be very valuable in efficient   compilation of functional languages such as Standard ML. But little is known   on how to support type-directed compilation in real compilers and how much   performance gain one can get from various type-based optimizations. The goal   of this research is to design and identify important type-directed compilation  techniques that can significantly improve the performance of ML programs.   These new compilation techniques are expected to lead to the following nice   results: (1) data objects (including recursive data structures) in ML programs  will be able to use unboxed data representations that are as efficient as   those in C programs; (2) polymorphic functions and parametrized modules will   be implemented efficiently through cross-module type specialization and   inlining expansion; (3) type information propagated into the compiler back end  will be used to assist program analysis such as closure analysis and   instruction scheduling.  The educational component of this CAREER award seeks two  objectives: the construction of a new compiler lab kit (based on the   above type-based ML compiler) and the incorporation of state-of-the-art   compiler technology into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum.",
