 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project upgrades the existing Computer Cartography/GIS  laboratory at the university.   The upgrade facilitates the  further integration of computer applications into the  Environmental Science, GIS, Cartography and Regional Planning  curriculum in the Department of Geography and Geology.   This  laboratory accommodates approximately 40 majors in the department  plus students from Environmental Science/Biology and the teacher  training programs who must complete coursework in Geography.    The project specifically funds Pentium computers, a flat-bed  scanner, and software.        The new Pentium computers and the  increased number of software licenses more than double the  capacity of the existing computer laboratory.   The increased  number of seats allows the department to introduce more computer  applications in the introductory courses, freeing time in the  upper-level courses for more advanced topics.   The processing  power of the Pentiums permits more demanding applications in the  courses.   This new curriculum better prepares our students for  graduate programs and for jobs in the planning agencies and GIS  concerns who look to the university to supply their personnel  needs.",
