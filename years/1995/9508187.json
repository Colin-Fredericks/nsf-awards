The equipment will be used for  several research projects including:   (1)  Statistical Analysis of High-Dimensional Data in  Regression and Discrimination Problems  (2) Robustness in Random Effects Models  (3) University Statistical Consulting  (4) Multilevel Models for Hierarchically Nested Event  Histories  (5) Observational Economy in Ecological and Environmental  Investigations       These projects involve five faculty members in the  department including the Statistical Consulting Center, the  Center for Statistical Ecology and Environmental Statistics  and the Center for Multivariate Analysis.       The research projects all involve the development of  fundamental statistical methodology and also have the  potential for immediate applications to the problems of  society. All of these projects involve highly  computationally intensive methods and all expect to make  these methods more efficient; all require high resolution  color graphics or ability to handle large amounts of data;  and all require high-speed transparent networking to make  optimal use of our computing resources and  facilitate  interaction between researchers.",
