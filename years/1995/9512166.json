 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to purchase transient kinetic equipment to be  employed in research projects from eleven different laboratories at  C)region State University. The users represent four departments:  Biochemistry and Biophysics, Agricultural Chemistry, the College of  Pharmacy and the Department of Food Science and Technology. The  equipment will allow the users to pursue new approaches to their  respective research problems in the areas of protein folding,  protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, DNA and protein  structure, protein- and receptorligand interactions, kinetic studies of  enzymes, the coupling of receptors to ion channels and the relationship  between mitochondrial integrity, oxidative stress and Ca2+ overload.    The availability of this equipment should serve to attract other  researchers at Oregon State University interested in mechanistic  studies and will therefore serve as an important resource for faculty,  postdoctorals, graduate students and undergraduates pursuing these  research areas. Since the equipment is novel to Oregon, it may also  attract users from other institutions within the state. One major  feature of the instrumentation is the ease of data collection and  analysis. This should facilitate user training and increase the  enthusiasm of users in applying kinetic, mechanistic approaches in  their research.    The principal investigator is Dr. Michael Schimerlik. The PI received  his Ph.D. in enzyme kinetics with Professor W.W. Cleland at Wisconsin  and training in transient kinetics while a postdoctoral at The  California Institute of Technology with Professor M.A. Raftery where he  conducted stopped-flow studies of ligand interactions with the  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Since coming to Oregon State, the PI  has published manuscripts concerning transient kinetic studies in the  areas of protein-protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms and is  capable of analysis of kinetic mechanisms by fitting data to  analytically derived rate equations or, i n more complicated instances,  using computer simulations to examine mechanistic models. Several other  investigators (Drs. Penner, van Holde, Ho, Anderson and Hsu) also  possess expertise in transient kinetic theory.    Transient kinetic equipment existing at Oregon State is about fifteen  years old, and no longer supported by the manufacturer. No facilities  are available for quench flow experiments for use in combination with  state of the art facilities at the institution in mass spectrometry or  NMR for studies of protein folding. No facilities are available for  rapid acquisition of circular dichroism spectra to examine structural  changes that occur in protein folding, ligand binding, DNA and protein  structural transitions, or macromolecular assembly or dissociation  reactions. The abilities to acquire fluorescence or absorbance spectra  as a function of time, or to measure time-dependent changes in  fluorescence polarization are also lacking. These techniques provide  additional sensitivity and enhance the analysis of complicated  mechanisms. Most importantly, the software for data acquisition and  analysis is far superior to that currently available.    In summary, the proposed kinetic equipment will add important new  capabilities in transient kinetics not currently available at Oregon  State University. In addition it will provide greatly enhanced  capabilities over that of our currently available, outdated equipment  both in the type of data acquired and in its analysis. This will not  only expand the research horizons of laboratories doing kinetic studies  but, also because of its \"user-friendliness\", serve to attract  postdoctorals, graduate students and undergraduates so that these  individuals will receive training in transient kinetic methods.",
