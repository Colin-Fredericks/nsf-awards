 "awd_abstract_narration": "Centre College, a private undergraduate institution in Kentucky, is the recipient of ARI funds to remodel research and research training space in Young Hall for the departments of Psychology and Psychobiology.  This project is the third and final phase of the College's master plan to modernize the science and mathematics facilities.  Research topics, investigated by researchers span from animal behavior, and psychophysiological research to cognitive science. Currently, five faculty members and student researchers share four rooms to conduct research. The renovation will comprise of replacing chemistry workbenches with a flexible physical environment required to accommodate psychological research.  Three of the rooms will be partitioned to produce a total of seven smaller rooms, providing visual and auditory isolation for experimentation.  The modernization will also include the renovation of an animal facility,  located in the basement of the building, to allow for the maintenance of a variety of animal species.  As a result, the departments will have improved space conducive for the undertaking of research activities.   The impact of the renovation will extend beyond the institution.  Presently two-thirds of the majors are women and 15% are minorities; thus such additional improvements will successfully advance these groups, traditionally under-represented in the sciences.  Of the 74% of the students who pursue advanced studies, over half pursue graduate programs in neuroscience, mathematical psychology, biophysics and biochemistry.  The renovated facilities will increase more research opportunities for student researchers and faculty, and enhance the prospects of majors seeking admission to quality graduate programs in science.",
