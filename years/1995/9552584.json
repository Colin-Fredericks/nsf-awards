 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553584  Hein    Under the Small Grants For Exploratory Research guidelines, Dr.  George Hein will carry out basic research in informal learning in  a museum setting.  Dr. Hein will examine the literature and provide  a summary of 1) what is known about the motivations of museums  visitors, how they learn and how they react to the intellectual,  social, and physical context of museums and 2) what is known about  the theory and methods of visito research in museums.  These  results will then be linked to a detailed discussion of  constructivist learning theory and he will explore how that theory  can be used to explain visitor behavior and how it can be used as   a guide to research in learning in museums.  Research will be  carried out in England and the United States and will include a  thorough review of the relevant literature written in English and  extensive consultations with other professionals working on the  theory of informal learning in museum settings.  The research will  result in a monograph that will be broadly disseminated.  Although  focused particularly on learning in a museum setting, the monograph  will be of interest to all those interested in the informal  learning process which includes museum professionals, formal  educators, executives of community-based programs, and media  producers.",
