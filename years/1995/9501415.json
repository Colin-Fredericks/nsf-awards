 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501415  Nesin       Nesin's work concerns the classification of simple groups of finite  Morley rank.  Morley rank, a 30-year-old concept due to Michael Morley,   measures in some sense the complexity of the structure.  In a structure of   finite Morley rank, certain subsets (the so-called definable subsets) are   endowed with a natural number, and these natural numbers behave like the  \"dimension\" of the set to which they are attached.  For example, every  variety over an algebraically closed field is a structure of finite Morley  rank. In particular, every algebraic group over an algebraically closed field  is a group of finite Morley rank.  The Cherlin-Zil'ber conjecture states a   partial converse: A simple group of finite Morley rank is an algebraic   group over an algebraically closed field.  If true, the conjecture will show   that the concept of algebraic group is independent of the base field when   the latter is known to be algebraically closed: just a concept of dimension   satisfying certain simple axioms is enough to insure that a simple group is   an algebraic group, i.e., a geometric object.  Apart from its use in model   theory, this almost philosophical (even metaphysical!) consequence of the   conjecture suffices to make the subject worthwhile.  If the conjecture is   false, it will give rise to new groups that are not algebraic but that  look very much like both infinite algebraic and finite groups.  Nesin's   research is a fundamental part of the program of showing the   Cherlin-Zil'ber conjecture.       The primary purpose of mathematics is the understanding of  geometry and natural numbers.  Algebra was invented to understand better the   nature of geometry and numbers.  The concept of dimension is, of course, very   important in geometry; in general, any geometric object has dimension.  One   can ask the reverse problem: suppose each object in a class has a   dimension and that these dimensions behave well, i.e. they satisfy some   natural axioms.  Is it then true that th ese objects are geometric?  The work   of Nesin concerns this problem in a particular setting.  His objects are   groups.  His research is part of a large project whose goal is to show that   groups on which a certain concept of dimension is defined are groups of   transformations of a geometric object.  ***",
