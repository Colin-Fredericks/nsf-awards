 "awd_abstract_narration": "Farr Hall of Science, constructed  in 1960,  is home to the departments of biology, chemistry, and physics on the campus of Ripon College located in Wisconsin.  The facility will be remodeled to alleviate several major problems that inhibit research and research training and detracts from the overall quality of the college's science programs.  As  part of a larger  comprehensive renovation and expansion effort,  the NSF's Academic Research Infrastructure Program, in partnership with Ripon College, will provide funds to modernize existing space dedicated to research activities.  Renovations will include: replacement of air circulation and ventilation systems, installation of fume hoods where volatile substances are used, reconfiguration of laboratories to provide more efficient space for student research activities, provision of adequate space for instrumentation and computers, upgrading electrical and mechanical systems, and ensuring research spaces are made fully accessible to physically challenged persons.   Once completed, the renovated science facility will provide modern research and research training space and will create a safe and healthy environment.  As a result, an improved research climate will contribute to Ripon's recruitment of outstanding students and faculty and in maintenance of strong educational  and  undergraduate research programs.",
