 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a three-year plan to develop a new classroom model  in mathematics education.  It will be focussed at the 11th and 12th  grade levels and at the community college level for engineering  technology students preparing to enter the manufacturing workforce.   Students will be taught the same powerful problem-solving  strategies that are used in the manufacturing industry and will  solve these problems by developing critical thinking skills and  using multimedia and interactive technology in networked  collaborative learning environments.  Students will learn to  develop solutions to real problems in a high technology virtual  workplace-the classroom.  Through partnerships with industry,  universities, community colleges, and high schools, new models of  apprenticeships and internships combining the classroom with the  workplace will be developed using full motion video conferencing.   Colleges of Education at universities in cooperation with the  manufacturing industry and non-profit technology institutions in  North Carolina will provide both in-service and pre-service  professional development and technical support to high school and  community college faculty.  To encourage alliances around the  nation in restructuring technician education, we will develop a  national discourse on innovative instruction in engineering  technology.  In this new model for technician education, the  classroom will become a virtual workplace for students to gain  experience and confidence in solving real problems facing  engineering technicians in manufacturing, and share experiences on  problem-solving strategies used in manufacturing.",
