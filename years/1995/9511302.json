 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wing    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Elizabeth Wing will  enter information on a series of archaeological assemblages into  a Paradox data management system. Approximately 25 specimens are  included in a \"catalogued lot\", and 19,526 of these lots will be  entered into the Florida Museum of Natural History computer  system. The materials themselves consist of faunal remains from:  archaeological sites from Historic period Florida and  southeastern Georgia; prehistoric Florida and Georgia; and from  coastal and highland Ecuador and Peru. The Florida faunal remains  trace changing human-environmental interaction over thousands of  years and indicate how human subsistence responded to changing  environmental conditions at differing levels of cultural and  technological complexity. The South American collections permit  scientists to chart the origin and spread of domestic animals in  the Andean region and therefore gain insight into perhaps the  most significant change in human subsistence technology.    Museums such as the Florida State Museum of Natural History  contain collections which, in theory, will allow scientists to  address many significant questions. However often such materials  are difficult to use because they are poorly catalogued and the  information which may be available is difficult to recover. Dr.  Wing curates one of the most important archaeological faunal  collections in the United States and with National Science  Foundation support, these remains will be made available online  to a very wide group of potential users.",
