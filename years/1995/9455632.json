 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455632  Hanson  The project 1) actively involves faculty, global change scholars,  and people with expertise in pedagogy in the development of  introductory-level, activity-based course modules on the human  dimensions of global environmental change, and 2) establishes a  process within the Association of American Geographers (AAG) for  the development, evaluation, and dissemination of these and other  active-learning modules of introductory courses. The first goal  addresses the needs to a) infuse recent global change scholarship  into the introductory undergraduate curriculum and b) actively  involve students in the learning process. The second goal seeks to  address the current absence of any formal mechanism within the  discipline of geography for the sharing of teaching and learning  resources among undergraduate instructors.  The principal expected  outcomes are modules that speak to the three broad components of  global environmental change: 1) the human and physical causes or  driving forces of change; 2) the environmental consequences  produced by these forces; and 3) the human responses to these  environmental consequences. Central to these modules are the  concepts of a) how human causes, environmental impacts, and human  response vary by location (geographic area), and b) how the  relationships among components are affected by the spatial and  temporal scales of analysis (local, regional, global; decadal,  centennial, millennial respectively).  The project also establishes  a clearinghouse within the AAG to disseminate the modules for use  in introductory courses nationwide. The modules will be available  to all instructors of some 500,000 students who are enrolled in  introductory geography courses annually. Once this project is  completed, the AAG clearinghouse will continue to develop and  disseminate activity-based undergraduate learning materials.",
