The goal is to develop further the geometric   techniques that he used with Schmid in solving the Barbasch-Vogan   conjecture on the one hand and on the other hand the techniques in his   joint work with Mirkovic on modular and integral representations of   algebraic groups.       One typical type of a problem in mathematics is to discover and   understand connections beteen things that from the outset seem unrelated.    One of the deepest and most mysterious types of such connections has been   suggested by Langlands and is now generally called a Langlands   correspondence.  A main feature of the investigator's work is to   develop geometric techniques to discover and establish such connections.  The situation is indeed the most interesting when the two things to be   related are not geometric but the connection between them is established   by geometry.  This is the nature of the investigator's joint work with   Schmid that proved the Barbasch-Vogan conjecture.  His other work   involves the Langlands correspondence alluded to above.  In his work with   Mirkovic he managed to get quite far in understanding one aspect of   Langlands duality by developing new geometric techniques.    ***",
