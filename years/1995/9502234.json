This fellowship  opportunity will enable Dr. Agah to begin a collaborative  research effort with Dr. Kazuo Tanie, the director of the  Biorobotics Division of Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.  The investigators plan to study multi-robot systems,  biologically-inspired robotics, autonomous robots,  applications of virtual reality and multi-media to robotics,  and computer simulation of intelligent robots.  The proposed  project will help develop a scientific collaboration with a  leading robotics researcher in Japan.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Agah will have the opportunity  to become familiar with the research projects, both in  theoretical and engineering terms, at Mechanical Engineering  Laboratory, while contributing to the overall research  effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
