Three types of plant vacuolar sorting signals have been  identified, based on their location within proteins.  Signals within the propeptide regions at the C-terminus  (CTPPs) and N-terminus (NTPPs) have been characterized as  well as signals within the body of mature proteins.  Among  the different types of signals, there does not appear to be  a common sequence motif responsible for vacuolar sorting,  and a distinct receptor is implicated in the recognition of  each signal.  We have characterized the CTPP signals in  plant secretory proteins and identified specific mutations  that cause secretion of vacuolar proteins.  There is no  homology between different CTPPs, and various mutations and  deletions in CTPP are tolerated by the sorting machinery.  Although vacuolar sorting signals and most likely receptors  that recognize these signals are unique, the components  involved in vesicle transport are common among eukaryotic  cells.  To this end we have isolated a functional homolog of  yeast Pepl2p from Arabidopsis thaliana, an integral protein  thought to be involved in the specific recognition of  vesicles destined to the vacuole. We plan to characterize  the A. thaliana Pepl2p and use it as a tool to isolate other  components of the machinery, including the receptors that  recognize vacuolar sorting signals.  To compliment our  molecular and biochemical approaches we have isolated  several putative A. thaliana mutants with Altered Vacuolar  Sorting (AVS).  Based on this the following objectives are  proposed: 1) Completely sequence the aPEP12 cDNA clone,  raise antibodies against aPepl2p, and use them to determine  the subcellular location, by organellar fractionation and  electron microscopy.  2) Study the function of aPepl2p in  plant cells by transforming aPEP12 in the antisense  orientation in to A. thaliana plants expressing  independently barley l ectin, sporamin, or  phytohemagglutinin, and analyze the effect of altered levels  of aPepl2p on sorting of either one or all three different  soluble vacuolar proteins by pulse-chase labeling followed  by immunoprecipitation and organellar fractionation.  3)  Identify components that interact with aPepl2p by gradient  centrifugation and purify them by co-immunoprecipitation  using aPepl 2p antibodies.  Additional approaches will  include affinity chromatography or chemical cross-linking.  Corresponding genes will eventually be cloned.  4) Isolate  avs mutants of Arabidopsis.  We shall continue to screen for  additional mutants that secrete CTPP-containing proteins and  set up a similar screen to isolate mutants that secrete NTPP-  containing proteins.  Priority will be placed on the  isolation of transacting mutations.  5) Characterize avs  mutants of Arabidopsis.  The mutants isolated for secretion  of CTPP containing proteins will be tested for secretion or  vacuolar sorting of NTPP-containing proteins (and vice  versa) by pulse-chase analysis and organellar purification.  Mutantsspecific for either the CTPP or the NTPP pathways  will be of particular interest because these have the  highest potential to identify components unique to plant  vacuolar sorting.  However, mutants that affect both  pathways could also help us to identify important common  components.  The research should provide important insights  into the fundamental processes of the vacuolar sorting  machinery that may be unique to plants or of broad  significance.  Beyond its contribution to basic knowledge,  this work could improve the success rate of sorting novel  gene products to desired parts of the cell which might lead  to crop improvement.  %%%  The vacuole is the site of storage of protein and sugars  within the plant cell.  It is also the site at which many of  these storage proteins and sugars are broken down.  With  regard to this latter function, the vacuole is somewhat  similar to the animal cell lysosome.  Over  the past five  years, there has been rapid progress in identifying some of  the cellular machinery by which material is trafficked to  the iysosome in mammalian cells and yeast.  In this study,  this machinery is described in plants.  The plant machinery  is explored starting with a plant protein involved in  vacuole traffic which can also work to allow traffic to the  yeast vacuole.  This protein and the protein and membranes  with which it interacts in the plant cell are described.  Other proteins and genes important in correctly targeting  proteins to plant vacuoles are discovered through generating  mutants defective in correct targeting of soluble vacuolar  proteins.  This enhances our understanding of how traffic to  the plant vacuole is regulated.  There are many eventual  applications of this work, including altering the components  of the targeting machinery in order to get more efficient  storage and transport of novel proteins to the plant vacuole  for the production of enhanced grain and seed crops.  ***",
