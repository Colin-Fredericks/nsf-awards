 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today, most community colleges are not offering a broadly  accepted portable associate degree in manufacturing.  This project  will develop instructional modules that can be infused into  existing curricula and, thereby, create the foundation for such a  degree.  Students will be brought to 22 generic standards developed  by a national panel of educators and employers in 1994.  The  standards are based primarily on the competencies defined by the  Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS).   Multidisciplinary teams of mathematics, science, and technology  faculty will design a series of CD-ROMs and print materials for 16  instructional modules and design a 17th work-based module.  The  materials will be produced by the Educational Film Center The  design teams will come from five Lead Colleges representing five  consortia of community colleges, which include over 130 colleges.  The Lead Colleges will implement the revised curriculum and  disseminate the results to consortia members.  Two consortia are  state systems -- California and New Hampshire, two are  industry-based -- Boeing and the Alliance (of AT&T and its unions),  and the last is the Consortium for Manufacturing Competitiveness.   Affiliate Colleges will also implement the instructional modules  and, already, 25 colleges have been nominated or have indicated  that they want to participate.  National boards, which include  representatives of the American Association of Community Colleges,  the National Association of Manufacturers, the five consortia, IBM,  Ford, the Public Broadcasting System, and institutions at the  forefront of related efforts such as Sinclair Community College,  will guide the design and implementation activities and help  disseminate the results to community colleges and employers across  the nation.  A formative and summative evaluation will be  undertaken by the American Institutes for Research.  A successful  project will have a significant impact on technical education and  on the comp etitiveness of American manufacturing.",
