 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506167  Santer  Ribosomes are complex ribonucleoprotein organelles which are  the sites of one of the most complex of biological  processes, protein synthesis. It has been recognized for a  number of years that the primary structure of rRNA plays a  crucial role in the reactions of protein synthesis.The  discovery of the catalytic capabilities of a number of RNA  molecules including rRNA has refocused attention on the  functional capabilities of RNA. However, even in the most  completely described ribosome, that of the procaryote E.  coli ,the relationship between structure and function is  still incompletely understood. Genetic and biochemical  methods are used here to study the relationship between the  primary structure and function in the 30S subunit of the  ribosomes of E. coli. The focus is on bases which are  involved in a number of reactions which assure the accuracy  of protein synthesis: those in the 530 and 980 loop regions  and positions 1492 and 1493 of 16S rRNA of 30S ribosomes.  The mutated region of rDNA is cloned into plasmids  containing the rRNA operon under the control of constitutive  or inducible promoters to permit the study of any type of  mutation, including those which are lethal to the cell. To  study the effects of these mutations, in vivo studies have  been carried out to determine the effect of mutant 30S  ribosomes on cell viability and the ability of these  ribosomes to synthesize proteins and accurately translate  mRNA coding for b-galactosidase. These studies have  demonstrated, for the first time, that position 981 is  essential for translation.  It is now proposed to try to  define the steps in protein synthesis in which each of the  mutated bases are essential. To determine the accuracy and  extent of translation, a linked transcription-translation  system will be used to study the translation of mRNA  transcribed from a plasmid coding for a small molecular  weight protein of known sequence employing an extract of  cells containing mutant ribosomes. Addition al in vitro  experiments will be carried out to assemble a homogeneous  population of mutant 30S ribosomes to study many of the  partial reactions of protein synthesis. \"Suppressors\" of  lethal mutations will be selected to identify bases, distant  on the primary structure of rRNA, which affect a common  function. Selection of \"suppressor\" mutations which may be  involved in translational initiation can help us to identify  bases in rRNA which are specifically involved in initiation  of protein synthesis. These studies should help ultimately  to genetically identify the components involved at each step  of protein synthesis.  %%%  All cellular proteins are synthesized by complex organelles  called ribosomes. which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)  and protein. However, even in the most completely described  ribosome, that of the procaryote E. coli, the relationship  between structure and function is incompletely understood.  The discovery of the catalytic capabilities of a number of  RNA molecules has refocused attention on the functional  capabilities of rRNA. Our studies use genetic and  biochemical methods to study this relationship. A rRNA gene  can be mutated at a specific, crucial position and  introduced into the cell on a special vector which permits  the study of lethal changes. The focus is on specific  positions which are involved in assuring the accuracy of  protein synthesis. We propose to define the steps in protein  synthesis which are affected by each of the mutated  positions.  It is important to thoroughly study this process  since it is essential for cell growth and development, and  the basis of much production biotechnology. These studies  will involve undergraduate students in every phase and  constitute a major part of their biology training. These  students will thus be learning first hand the importance and  excitement of molecu1ar biology in solving fundamental  biological questions.  ***",
