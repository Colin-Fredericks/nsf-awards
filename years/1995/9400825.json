 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400825  Soare       In this project Robert Soare will study recursion theory,  namely the theory of computability on sets of integers,  particularly relative computability of one set from another.  The  fundamental aim is to deepen our understanding of computability  and its relation to algebraic structures and to models of various  first order theories.  The approach is to apply algebraic and  model theoretic methods to assemble apparently unrelated and  often chaotic individual results in recursion theory into a  unified theory and to point the way toward future research.  A  recent example is the Slaman-Soare result where a simple  algebraic criterion was discovered which unified many results and  methods on the r.e. degrees over the last 30 years and solved the  long standing problem on extension of embeddings.  In another  area Harrington and Soare have developed a method for generating  automorphisms of the r.e. sets on the one hand and for producing  definable properties on the other, which show that other  automorphisms cannot exist.  In addition, Lachlan and Soare have  applied certain forcing methods to study models of arithmetic and  will develop these further.       The aim is to study computability of sets of integers.  The  first objective is to study computability in terms of the  recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets, namely those which can be  listed by a computable procedure, and to relate their algebraic  structure to the degree of information they encode and to the  speed with which they can be enumerated with respect to some  measure of the complexity of computation.  The second objective  is to study the relationship of computability to other  mathematical objects, for example to certain models, and to  certain algebraic structures.  For algebraic structures, the  general problem is to determine exactly what information can be  coded into a particular type of that structure.  This will give  new information about how information can be coded between sets  and how it can be co ded into an algebraic structure.  ***",
