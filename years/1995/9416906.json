The proposed  work will include investigations of the quantum and statistical  mechanics of various quantum phases of matter including, electronic  Fermi liquids, integer and fractional quantum Hall systems,  mesoscopic devices, superfluid films and fractal structures, and  both high-temperature and conventional superconductors.  Interest  is in how the properties of materials can be modified by the  presence of disorder or by the imposition of artificial structures,  and by the application of high magnetic fields.  Analytical methods  of quantum field theory and many-body theory, as well as numerical  quantum Monte Carlo techniques will be applied to the study of  these phenomena.  %%%  The objective of this project is to enhance the understanding of  the properties of electrons in various materials such as metals and  semiconductors.  The proposed work will include investigations of  metals in the superconducting state and investigations of ultra-  small eletronic devices in which quantum mechanics plays an  important role.  Interest is in how the properties of materials can  be modified by the presence of disorder or by the imposition of  artificial structures, and by the application of both analytical  mathematical methods and numerical computational techniques which  have proved valuable in this field of science.",
