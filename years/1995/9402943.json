This project introduces a one semester course on Materials  Physics as a yearly offering into our curriculum.  This four credit  lecture/laboratory course will address topics in four broad  materials categories: (1) metals, (2) ceramics, (3) semiconductors  and (4) polymers.  Approximately ten experiments per semester will  be performed which will give an overview of the important  properties of each material type.  Modern techniques and equipment  will be employed and a computer interface utilized where  appropriate.  The experience resulting from this course will  prepare the student to be competitive in the research/industrial  workplace in a wide range of subdisciplines.  In addition, students  planning to pursue advanced degrees will be prepared to move into  Materials Science, Ceramic Engineering, Electrical Engineering,  Polymer Science and other areas in addition to the traditional  Physics graduate programs.  Such breadth of experience provides  students greater flexibility in choosing a career and will help in  making the physics degree more marketable.",
