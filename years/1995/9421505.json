This chemical communication (synaptic transmission) involves  packaging of the neurotransmitter into vesicles that are  released when the neuron is activated.  The goal of this  project is to understand the molecular and genetic bases of  release of these vesicles.  Synaptic transmission is being  studied in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where  the investigator has identified new proteins involved in the  neurotransmitter vesicular release through the isolation of  mutations in the genes that encode these proteins.  Animals  with mutations in these gene have defects in synaptic  transmission mediated by the chemical neurotransmitters  acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid.  These studies  will give important insights into the regulation of  vesicular release from neurons and also vesicle-mediated  exocytosis in other cell types.",
