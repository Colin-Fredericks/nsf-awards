 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work represents continuation of an ongoing research  program concerned with some of the physical processes and  structures that occur in thin electrical current sheets and plasma  boundary layers in the Earth's magnetosphere, with special emphasis  on the magnetopause.  This current sheet forms the outer boundary  of the magnetosphere and separates it from the rapidly streaming  solar wind.  The proposed research is concerned with five related  problem areas:  o    Construction, from spacecraft data, of magnetic field    \"transects\" describing the draping of magnetic field inside or     outside the magnetopause over elongated bulges moving in a  transverse sense along that layer.  The result will be a robust and  thoroughly bench-marked data analysis tool that can be used by  other researchers.  Applications include, not just traveling bulges  and waves on the magnetopause, but other moving current filaments,  e.g., in the low latitude boundary layer or in the geomagnetic  tail.  o    Construction of similar transects describing mesoscale   magnetic structures, such as tearing mode islands, in the  magnetopause itself.  Again, the goal is to develop and test a  robust data analysis tool that is expected to be of utility and  importance for study of two-dimensional structures in the  magnetopause.  o    Theoretical study of weakly nonlinear wave pulses propagating  on the magnetopause and their relation to observed bulges moving  along that year.  o    Theoretical study of strong nonlinearities in steady, two-  dimensional, field-aligned MHD flows, including transitions between  elliptic and hyperbolic states.  Search for, and  analysis of,  illustrative events in spacecraft data.  o    Theoretical study of MHD flow in two-dimensional reconnection  layers.  In each area, the research will start with analytical and  associated numerical work, including, where appropriate, the  generation of synthetic spacecraft data for bench marking of the  data analysis techniques; this phase will  be followed by  identificaion of sample events and by testing of the new techniques  on spacecraft data, initially from AMPTE/IRM, but later in the  project, from the CLUSTER mission.",
