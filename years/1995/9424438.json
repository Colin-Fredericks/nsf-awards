Berg  University of Washington  CTS-9424438    The Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington proposes herein in acquisition of a scanning probe microscopy facility, including the capability of atomic force microscopy (AFM).  It would be used primarily for obtaining direct measurements of colloidal forces between particles and fluid interfaces as a function of the distance of approach, particle and interface composition, etc.  This is not a routine application of the instrumentation, and detailed measurements of this kind have not yet been reported in the literature.  They are nonetheless vital to ongoing investigations in the author's laboratory, including flotation and oil-assisted agglomeration processes for the successful recycling of toner-printed papers and the design of water-based coating.  The facility would also be used in new investigations contributing to fundamental understanding of the \"hydrophobic interaction\" and the interaction of colloid particles within a fluid surface.  Finally, the facility would find exhaustive use in the examination of solid particle and extended-surface morphology and composition, critical not only to much of the work in the author's laboratory, but also to the work of other investigators at the author's laboratory, but also to the work of other investigators at the author's institution.",
