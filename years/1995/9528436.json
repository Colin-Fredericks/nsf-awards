The main  goal of this workshop, with approximately 50 participants is to  organize how the Biosystems Analysis and Control (BAC) Initiative  might be expanded from its current form in a way so as to address  the challenges and uses of new technological and conceptual tools  for biological systems over a range of scales:  from molecules to  eco-systems.  The format of the workshop is to have some invited  presentations, with smaller break out groups to generate ideas  and reports on the first two days.  On day three, we will discuss  the reports to arrive at a consensus of how biology and  engineering can cross-fertilize each other in the area of  \"Architectures for Control and Learning\".  We hope to be able to  collate the material into a report by March 1996.  Sastry and  Full will act as co-chairpersons of this workshop.  They will  also act as the organizing committee in concert with the program  appropriate program directors of programs in the Biology and  Engineering Directorates of NSF.   ***",
