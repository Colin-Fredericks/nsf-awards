 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott       The investigator and his colleagues organize the Third  International Conference On Spectral And High Order Methods  (ICOSAHOM), held at the University of Houston, Houston, Texas,  June 5 - 9, 1995.  The development of high performance computers  has made spectral and high order methods one of the most important  techniques in modern scientific and engineering computation.  Presentation of recent research concerning high order methods has  an increasingly important role in scientific computing.  Applications are being made in a variety of fields, including chip  design, fluid dynamics and others.  The first ICOSAHOM was held in  1989 in Italy, and the second ICOSAHOM was in June 1992 in  Montpelier, France.  With a long periodicity of 3 years, ICOSAHOM  plays the role of an \"international congress\" for the subject and  provides an opportunity to coordinate and stimulate research in  spectral and high order methods.       This conference focuses on numerical methods for the accurate  solution of partial differential equations.  Such equations arise  in simulating manufacturing processes and designing new products,  from automobiles and airplanes to computer chips.  Highly accurate  solutions are needed because current design and processes have  reached a refined state that requires extremely accurate and  efficient simulations to remain competitive.  This need has driven  the development and use of high-performance computers themselves,  as well as of specific algorithms for them.  The aim of this  conference is to bring together leading researchers, both  established and younger scientists, in this increasingly active  and highly interdisciplinary field to survey and review the  current state of research.",
