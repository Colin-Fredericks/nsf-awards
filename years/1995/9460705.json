 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a Photogrammetric Laser System (PLS) to significantly reduce the cost of rapidly measuring three-dimensional surfaces for civil engineering purposes; to monitor potential landslides, seismological measurements, and other ground failures; to rapidly assess the results of disasters; and other similar surface measurement applications. The reduction in costs is achieved through an integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices with an approach of performing automated stereoscopic measurements using conventional terrestrial photogrammetric methods. The unique characteristic of this system is the use of a laser to illuminate a small area on the surface being measured to form a target. The laser is programmed to scan the surface in a variety of patterns, depending upon the type and density of surface information desired. The position of the target is automatically determined by the modified stereo cameras and recorded simultaneously with a digital image of the scene. The PLS produces data that are directly compatible with most three-dimensional data processing systems such as: Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and others. This system greatly increases the speed and accuracy of remotely measuring surface data, reduces costs through automatic measurements, and does not deviate from conventional photogrammetric processes.",
