 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  Unlike Europe, where the demographic transition went along with rapid industrialization, demographic shifts in Latin America appear as the result of public health care programs.  Yet there is considerable variation among population groups in their use of primary health care programs and this study will examine the factors affecting these differences.  The study tests demographic theories and social epidemiological theories of health and disease.  Three Latin American countries will be compared using existing data sources, primarily from demographic and health surveys.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of population changes  and the social factors affecting the adoption of public health measures at the household level.  Findings will be of use to policy-makers concerned with improving public health among households at high risk for disease and early mortality.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
