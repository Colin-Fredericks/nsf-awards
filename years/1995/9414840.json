 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414840  Mihaly  This award supports Professor Laszlo Mihaly and a graduate  student of the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony  Brook, joined by Dr. Gwyn Williams of Brookhaven National  Laboratory, to collaborate in solid state physics with  Professor Laszlo Forro of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de  Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.  They will explore electron  states in selected superconducting materials by measuring the  optical conductivity from the far infrared to the visible  range.  The participants bring to the collaboration a unique  combination of facilities and expertise for the study of the  infrared transmission properties of thin crystalline films.  In  particular, Dr. Forro at EPFL has developed a special sample  preparation method for extremely thin single crystals which  permits optical analyses of a variety of anisotropic materials.  He will investigate the magnetic and electronic transport  properties of the samples.  Most of the optical spectroscopy  work will be carried out at Stony Brook, while low frequency  infrared measurements will be made at the National Synchrotron  Light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory.    Superconductivity, spin density waves and charge density waves  are all manifestations of electron correlations.  While the  interaction between the electrons and the nature of the  electronic ground state are profoundly different for these  three phenomena, there are also important similarities among  them.  This U.S.-Swiss collaborative research will  experimentally analyze three model materials each of which  exhibits one of these phenomena, in order to improve  understanding of the electron correlations which cause these  interesting and potentially useful phenomena.  The results  should be of particular interest to condensed matter physicists  working in the area of high temperature superconductivity.  ***",
