In  addition, there remain basic scientific  questions,  most  especially concerning the nature of instantaneous correlations between  different  points  in the interface, and the correlation  between  the  interfacial position at different times. These fundamental issues will  be  addressed in the proposed research. Specifically, studies  of  the  equilibrium properties of crystal surfaces will be made to investigate  equilibrium surface morphology. In addition, the kinetics  of  changes  in  surface morphology following rapid temperature changes, and during  growth,  will be investigated. This research will lead to an  improved  understanding   of  what  determines  surface  morphology.   Such   an  understanding  may  eventually allow for the  introduction  of  simple  processing  strategies  for  tailoring  surface  morphology  to   suit  technological  needs.  The experimental technique  employed  in  these  studies   is   high-resolution  synchrotron   x-ray   scattering,   in  conjunction   with   a  proven,  state-of-the-art  ultra-high   vacuum  apparatus.  %%%  The  form and structure of solid surfaces are the keys to a number  of  technologically important processes, including for example,  corrsion,  catalysis,  and  the growth of one crystalline solid  on  another.  In  addition,  there are basic scientific questions, especially concerning  the  nature of instantaneous correlations between different points  in  an  interface  (as when a crystal surface grows) and  the  correlation  between the interfacial position at different times. To address  these  issues, studies of the equilibrium properties of crystal surfaces will  be  made  to  investigate the equilibrium form and  structure  of  the  surface. The rate at which changes in surface form and structure occur  following rapid temperature changes, and during gro wth, will  also  be  investigated. This research will lead to an improved understanding  of  what  determines  the form and structure of a solid surface,  and  may  eventually  allow for the introducton of simple processing  strategies  for  tailoring surface form and structure to suit technological needs.
