 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355832  Foss    A computer-aided modeling environment is to be developed and  integrated into the educational scope of the core undergraduate  chemical engineering curriculum.  Through this environment, a  structured set of steps, needed by students learning how to model  physical and chemical process behavior, is coordinated with an  interactive modeling language that is designed to provide  instantaneous feedback to the students on the consistency,  completeness, and reasonableness of their model.  The modeling  language coordinates the terms describing the physical and chemical  phenomena, declared by the student as important to the content of  the model, and composes the mathematical relationships that form  the expression of the resulting model.  Numerical algorithms are  then employed to produce through interactive simulation the static  or/and dynamic solution of the mathematical model, and thus allow  students to familiarize themselves with the behavior of the modeled  process, as well as compare it to the expected behavior of the  real-world system.    A structured approach to guiding the student through the often  torturous path of modeling is to be developed in collaboration with  the course instructors.  The approach is to bring to the students  an awareness and practice in (i) rationalizing the need for a  model, (ii) setting objectives for the model within a problem's  context, (iii) perceiving the cause-effect relationships, (iv)  articulating the physics of the process, (v) stating  representations of the phenomena, (vi) observing the behavioral  characteristics of the model built, and (vii) using these  characteristics for the resolution of the given problem.  Such  structured guidance is to be coordinated with the use of the  modeling language and integrated within the scope of undergraduate  core chemical engineering courses in such a way that the modeling  task for the student is embedded within a problem needing solution,  so that the problem's context and objectives are ma de clear.   Significant components of the proposed work involve developing the  individual modeling projects for use in the modeling language and  redesign and translation of a prototype version of the modeling  language for use on personal computers.    It is expected that the completion of the proposed project will  have a significant impact on the undergraduates' education since,  (a) the student will be free to experiment and thus learn from  immediate feedback of their errors, and (b) the understanding of  the \"foundation phenomena\" will be reenforced through the  contextual solution of non-trivial engineering problems.  ***",
