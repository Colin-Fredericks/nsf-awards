 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9422762  RAAD  SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY    The proposed research seeks to develop an experimentally verified, three-dimensional, finite volume method to simulate fluid flows whose free surface is undergoing severe deformations. The computational effort will be complemented by experimental work using an open channel flow apparatus and a high speed video camera to experimentally determine the shape of the free surface during transient and steady-state flows in an open channel containing obstructions. Simulations of water sloshing and waves breaking in a tank will be used to investigate the important mechanisms of the decay of turbulent vorticity on a very active surface and the penetration of turbulence into the main body of water below breaking and spilling waves. To complement the qualitative data obtained by use of the high speed camera, a digital particle imaging velocimeter will be used to obtain quantitative velocity data.  The proposed simulation method will represent a significant advance in free surface fluid dynamics. From a practical standpoint, the extension to three dimensions is most important, since the simulation must be three-dimensional to enable it to realize its potential as a manufacturing productivity tool in, say, die casting, or as a realistic simulator of violent fluid interactions such as in water rushing over and around dikes and bridge pillars.",
