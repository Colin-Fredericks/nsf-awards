 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns two topics in numerical linear   algebra:  the  numerical treatment of Markov chains and  regularization   of  ill-posed  linear systems.  The topics share common features:  singular   or nearly singular  matrices; use of iterative methods  for large-scale problems;   problems in matrix  perturbation; and connections with   infinite dimensional  problems.    The computation of the steady-state vector of a   Markov chain as  well as other important quantities are being investigated.    In  particular,  algorithms are being developed and analyzed for  calculating   mean first passage  times and for computing the  recurrence matrix of M/G/1 type   queues.  In  addition aggregation  methods with overlapping blocks and the   behavior of chains  with  sluggish transients are being considered.    When   ill-posed problems are  discretized they result in  ill-conditioned linear systems   which must be  regularized to yield  accurate solutions.  There are three   main goals in this  work.  The first is to prove the folk theorem that if the   components of  the  data vector with respect to the singular vectors decay    sufficiently fast then  the conjugate gradient iteration will  produce a regularizing   set of solutions.  The second is to treat  problems with errors in the matrix by   a regularized  total-least-squares approach. The third is to further   preconditioning strategies for iterative solution methods.",
