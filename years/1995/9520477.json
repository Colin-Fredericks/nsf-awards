 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520477  Wu  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements will be carried out  to  identify  and characterize atomic motion with an  anomalously  low  activation  energy in quasicrystals. Such measurements  will  also  be  used  to  improve the crystallinity  of  noninteracting  semiconducting  nanoparticles and to detect the melting  of  such  nanocrystals. The NMR technique will also be used to characterize  quantum   confinement   and  interband  optical   excitation   in  noninteracting semiconducting nanocrystals.  %%%  Quasicrystals are known for possessing a new type of  long  range  order  that  differs  from that of  perfectly ordered  structures  like common salt. A new type of atom motion is predicted to occur  in  quasicrystals -- but has not yet been observed.  The  current  measurements using magnetic resonance techniques will attempt  to  investigate  this  phenomenon. In addition,  ultrasmall  particle  called nanocrystals will be investigate with special focus on the  changes  occurring  in physical properties due  in  part  to  the  effect  of the small size of the particles. One effect that  will  be   investigated   is  the  change  in  the  melting   of   such  crystallites.  ***",
