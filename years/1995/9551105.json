 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is creating a modern parallel computing laboratory  and a course on computational science.   The course introduces  undergraduates to the use of a high-speed parallel computer for  solving computationally intensive scientific problems and  introduces computer science students to scientific applications of  computing.   This new system enables the university to introduce  parallel computing into several other courses in the computer  science curriculum, e.g., graphics, algorithms, programming  languages, and operating systems.   The project director is  developing teaching materials, which will be disseminated to other  colleges and universities.  The laboratory consists of a 12-node  distributed memory parallel computer with a workstation as a host  machine.   Each node includes a powerful compute processor and is  combined with a T805 transputer as a communications processor.    The computer is accessible from the university's network of  workstations, for simultaneous use.",
