In   these   spectroscopes   the  interaction of photon with the electrons is used to determine the  spectrum  of  ionization and affinity energies of the  electrons.  The  experiments are performed both in a home laboratory  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  and  at various  national  synchrotron  facilities. The experimental data area analyzed by comparison  to  theories which treat the Coulomb interactions in different  ways,  and  which  provide a link between the spectra and the electrical  or  magnetic  properties.  Thereby the various  theories  can  be  tested,  with the possibility for discovering new phenomena.  The  program  relies  on strong collaborations with other  groups  for  providing  well characterized sample to measure, and  for  expert  theoretical advice and advanced calculations.  %%%  The  electronic structures of rare-earth and actinide metals with  puzzling electrical and magnetic properties are measured  by  the  techniques    of    photoemission   and   inverse   photoemission  spectroscopies.
