Wiest                    DUE 9551935  WV Wesleyan College                FY1995 $ 17,655  Buckhannon, WV  26201              ILI - Instrumentation                                      Project:                                      Physics         Title: Improving the Senior Research Experience in Physics at West  Virginia Wesleyan College:  Laser/Atomic   Spectroscopy         To support its senior research requirement for physics majors,  newly expanded from a one semester course to a full year, Wesleyan  will purchase research-grade equipment in laser/atomic  spectroscopy.  The college will purchase an external grating  tunable diode laser, a wavemeter, a lock-in amplifier, and an  optical chopper with controller.  This equipment will supplement  instrumentation which is of teaching but not research grade for  undergraduates.  Instruments were selected to provide flexibility  in the choice of research topics for seniors over the next five  years.  The instrumentation will permit senior students to do  experimental studies in Doppler-free saturated absorption  spectroscopy, optogalvanic spectroscopy, wave mixing, the Zeemann  Effect, and frequency doubling.  Students will be able to collect  accurate data with very high resolution, to do mathematical  calculations with the data, and to compare results with physical  models.  Project objectives are to teach students to use current  research equipment, to teach current methods of research, and to  teach proper methods of data analysis.  The project will  demonstrate a new research technique for advanced undergraduate  students: that the external grating tunable diode laser and  associated equipment enable research-grade studies in atomic  physics.",
