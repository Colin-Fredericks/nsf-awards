 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David L. Patrick  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Patrick received his doctoral degree from   the University of Utah under the supervision of Professor Thomas Beebe,   Jr.  Dr. Patrick will continue research at Cambridge University in   Cambridge, England, under the sponsorship of Professor Ian McDonald and   additionally Professor Ruth Lynden-Bell of Queen's University in Belfast.    His postdoctoral research will target modelling of chemically-specific   atomic force microscopy investigations of monolayer films.  The research   involves a set of computer-based simulation studies designed to improve   our understanding of the interactions of a chemically-modified probe tip   with adsorbed molecules.  The goal is to understand, using molecular   dynamics simulations, the respective roles of adsorbate chemical   functionality, solvent type, and the chemical structure of a probe tip on   the forces measured in atomic force microscopy experiments.  The   theoretical studies will be augmented by collaboration with   experimentalists conducting atomic force microscopy-based studies on   mixed monolayer systems.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
