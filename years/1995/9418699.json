GS is essential for introducing ammonium ions into the mainstream of nitrogen metabolism.  In B. subtilis, regulation of GS occurs primarily at the level of transcription, and control appears to be unique among the numerous bacterial regulatory systems studied to date.  It has been established that GS itself is involved in control, but the role the enzyme plays in this capacity is unknown.  In addition, GS expression is negatively affected by a transcriptional regulatory protein called GlnR.  Encoded by glnR, which precedes the GS structural gene, glnA in a dicistronic operon, GlnR inhibits transcription by binding to two operators adjacent to and within the glnRA promoter; how GlnR activity is regulated is not known.  The proposed research will determine the mechanisms involved in regulating transcription from the glnRA promoter and including the following objectives: (a) since GlnR appears to be affected by glutamate and several (-keto acids,  experiments will be per formed to characterize these interactions both biochemically and physiologically; (b) the relationship between GS and GlnR will be examined; (c) mutant phenotypes in GS and GlnR will be also characterized both biochemically in in vitro, as well as in in vivo studies. %%% This is an award to continue studies on the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in Bacillus subtilis, which is a spore-forming bacterium important to the biotechnology industry.  Work has focused on the pathway involved in ammonia assimilation and experiments have been performed to characterize the factors involved in controlling synthesis of glutamine synthetase (GS).  GS is a critical enzyme in metabolism since it operated to support the incorporation of ammonia by GS into the cell.  This results in the production of glutamine, an amino acid central to metabolism.  In addition to providing nitrogen for approximately 80% of the nitrogen-containing compounds in the cell, glutamine bridges carbon and nitrogen metabolism through a variety of pathways.  Because B. subtilis is also able to reverse this process and change many nitrogen-containing compounds back to ammonia and simple non-nitrogenous carbon components, the route of ammonia assimilation and release is important in understanding how the organism grows.  Studies have shown that the control of GS production in B. subtilis occurs in a manner unique among bacteria.  The enzyme appears to act in concert with a regulatory protein called GlnR to influence its own formation.  Nothing is known about how GS and GlnR interact or about the nature of the signals that they respond to.  Consequently, experiments will be designed to focus on these issues. ***                                       Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Schreier, Harold J.
