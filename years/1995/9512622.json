 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aim of this proposal is to obtain funding to upgrade  two NMR instruments, General Electric GN-500 (500 MHz) and Bruker  WM-250 (250 MHz) spectrometers, in the NMR facility of the Department  of Chemistry through the replacement of The GN-500 console with a new  state-of-the-art console (Varian Unity plus 500 MHz console) and the  purchase of a new 300 MHz spectrometer (Varian GEMINI 2000) to replace  the WM-250 instrument. The proposed UNITY plus 500 console and  accessories, with existing 500 MHz superconducting magnet, has the  capability for conducting state-of-the-are NMR experiments on liquid  and solid state samples. The complete GEMINI 2000 300 MHz spectrometer  with accessories is equipped for conducting modern NMR experiments for  the characterization of molecules by researchers in the various  sub-disciplines of chemistry on a routine basis. The justification for  this application rests first on the need for modern NMR instrumentation  to carry out the large amount of NMR research done by departmental  faculty. Five faculty will be the major users on the 500 MHz  spectrometer. Three members do biochemical studies which require modern  500 MHz capability. One is examining the structures of  metallobleomycins bound to DNA oligomers, which relate to the prototype  chemical nuclease iron bleomycin. Another is involved with  environmentally relevant work on the structure of lobster cadmium  metallothionein and its relationship to mammalian metallothioneins. The  third studies structure-reactivity relations in iron-sulfur proteins. A  physical chemist does solid state NMR studies of industrially important  catalytic surfaces and requires 500 MHz capability for solid state NMR  studies. The fifth faculty member uses NMR spectroscopy extensively to  characterize complex synthetic organic molecules. Additional faculty  require routine NMR spectroscopy from the facility, primarily to  determine the structures of newly synthesized moleculeq. In addition,  it will be used by se veral research chemists from industries in the  Milwaukee area for QC and structural analysis. In this context, the  present instruments acquired in 1981 and 1986, respectively, are badly  out of date and can not adequately serve current needs for  state-of-the-art multidimensional NMR experimentation as well as high  quality routine 2D NMR work. Thus, it is necessary to upgrade both  instruments so that sufficient NMR time is available on each  spectrometer to service faculty needs.          It is also important to have a modern 500 MHz instrument so that  the department can attract a faculty member in biological NMR  spectroscopy to replace a professor in this area who resigned in 1994  because of the lack of such instrumentation, moving to another  institution where such equipment is available. Finally, with the  coordinated purchase of the new console and a 300 MHz spectrometer, it  will be possible to train students routinely in the basic elements of  experimental multidimensional NMR spectroscopy on the new 300 MHz  spectrometer without the need to crowd the schedule of the 500 MHz  instrument with this essential task. In so doing, the department's  graduate course in pulsed NMR can be coordinated with a much needed  laboratory for the enrolled students.          Modern NMR spectroscopy is a central tool for chemists. Faculty  research and recruitment and student training in the Department of  Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has been  increasingly inhibited by the inadequacies of its NMR instrumentation.  The present proposal is submitted to remedy these fundamental problems.",
