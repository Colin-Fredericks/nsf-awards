 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in Cognitive Science at Carlton College.  The project provides for a ten week summer research experience for eight undergraduates.  Students will work individually with faculty collaborators designing and executing different research projects.  Weekly seminars will involve discussion of broader issues relevant to the research projects and to cognitive science more generally.  Issues of ethics in research design will be stressed.  The common theme of the project is `Acquiring, Organizing, and Using Knowledge.`  Individual projects include an investigation of self-verification processes, the application of PROLOG programming in knowledge representation, a study of real-life decision making, an investigation of the processes used in racial stereotyping, and a survey of how students acquire full understanding of biological principals.    This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
