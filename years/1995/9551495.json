 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds improvements in the anthropology curriculum by  adding a methodological component to the curriculum through a new  class on field methods.   Although the new class can be directed  toward field methods of any of the four subdisciplines of  anthropology, here an archaeological perspective is used.   This  course increases the methodological content of the anthropology  program and offers the students an opportunity to develop the  skills necessary for doing fieldwork.   The course helps students  combine their knowledge of theoretical issues learned in the  classrooms with the realities of fieldwork.   The project funds  high technological equipment such as surveying equipment,  computers, a printer, and software packages.   The main aim of  the research is to study the development of social complexity and  its effect on prehistoric households in the archaeological site  of Tibes, Puerto Rico.   The research strategy has been designed  in stages starting with a pilot stage where the site is probed  and mapped.   The results of this initial stage are used to  refine the methodology, to decide the location of future  excavations, and to make the adjustments necessary to improve the  format of the course.   The second stage consists of more  extensive excavations in the areas selected the previous year.",
