 "awd_abstract_narration": "Willet  9417766  Relative convergende between lithospheric plates cannot be described by the simple kinetic rules of plane tectonics.  Convergence leads inevitably to deformation of one or both plates.  In the case of continental collision, convergence produces dramatic deformation with attendant uplift, erosion, mountain building and high relief.  This most spectacular of the Earth's tectonic processes is the cause of much of the Earth's conctinental geology throught eh formation fo continents by successive collisions and mechanical accretion, but also important are the impacts of cllisional orogenesis on the ancient and modern atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere.  Mountain building processes affect global atmospheric circulation patterns and hence global climate, but climate also affects mountain building through its effeciency in eroding excess topography.  Understanding and modeling the coupling and feedback between the lithospheric and atmospheric systems is one of the goals of the Earth Systems Evolution program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research of which this project is a part.  This project focuses on the lithospheric mechanical process component of the Earth system by numerical modeling of lithosoheric deformation and comparison to geological (surface) and geophysical (subsurface) observations in orogenic belts.  ****",
