 "awd_abstract_narration": "A differential algebraic equation  (DAE) is composed of both differential  and algebraic relationships.   Many physical problems are most naturally initially described by a DAE.  DAEs arise in a variety of  physical problems including flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and contact or  constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition, DAEs occur in the solution of partial differential  equations by the method of lines and in many circuit models. Computer generated mathematical models  for physical processes are often DAEs.  Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require special  problem structure and do not handle many problems of interest.  In addition, many of these methods  require the  potential user not only to recognize the mathematical structure of the problem, but also  to explicitly exploit this structure.   This restricts both the number of users and the complexity of  the problems  that can be solved. This project will develop numerical methods for general  nonlinear  DAEs. Theoretical analysis, computational   implementation, and applications will all be  considered.  The long range goal of the proposed research is for scientists and engineers to be able to work  directly with the original implicit model thus reducing design and simulation time as well as  facilitating the consideration of more complex problems.  The building of physical prototypes is  time  consuming, expensive, and restricts the number of ideas that can be tried out.  Computer simulation is  becoming increasingly essential for both design and evaluation.  In  many areas of technology, the  equations that the computer must solve are most easily set up as a mixture of differential and  algebraic equations or a DAE.  DAEs are not the kinds of equations that classical numerical methods  and mathematical theory were designed for.  Converting a DAE into another type of mathematical problem is often difficult and time consuming.  Sometimes this conversion requires considering a simpler  mathematical equation which does not do as good a job of predicting what the real physical system will  do.  This has led to a world wide effort to develop numerical methods for solving DAEs.  There have  been notable successes and some of this effort has resulted in software, such as DASSL, that is used  in many industries and laboratories.  However, many important classes of DAEs are still difficult, or  impossible, to solve directly with existing software.  This project will develop numerical methods  that can be used to solve important additional types of DAEs.  While DAEs arise in many areas, this  project will focus on constrained mechanical systems including the simulation and control of robotic  manipulators, simulation and control of vehicular systems, and the simulation, control, and optimization of chemical manufacturing processes.",
