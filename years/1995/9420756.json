R. Thompson,  IBN-9420756    Summary:        William  James  (1890/1981) observed  that,   this  sense  of  sameness is the very keel and background of our thinking,  vol 1, p  434).  The  fundamental importance of understanding the  perception  and  use  of  same/different relations continues to  be  recognized  today  by  researchers in both human and non-human cognition.  Only  humans beyond infancy and adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)  with  a  history of language-training can explicitly judge that a pair of  shoes  is  the  same as a pair of say, teacups. That is,  they  can  judge  that the relationship between the shoes (i.e., identity)  is  the  same as the relationship between the teacups. This ability  to  judge  abstract relations between relations is fundamental  to  the  ability to reason analogically.    Recent  studies by the present investigators suggest  that  adult  rhesus  monkeys  (Macaca  mulatta) do  not  even  perceive  these  abstract relations of identity and nonidentity and therefore they  apparently  lack  the  fundamental  cognitive  pre-requisite  for  judging  relations between relations. These initial results  were  obtained  using  the same noninvasive behavioral tasks  as  those  used with human infants and chimpanzees. These findings point  to  a  fundamental disparity in the ability of humans and apes on the  one  hand,  and  monkeys on the other, to perceive and  represent  abstract  properties  of  the  world.  The  present  research  is  designed  to  confirm  and extend these  initial  findings  using  standard behavioral procedures including \"paired-comparison\"  and  \"habituation/ dishabituation\" preference-for-novelty  tasks.  Ten  adult macaque monkeys will be presented with pairs of objects  or  video-images  of  biologically   relevant  objects   and   events.  Sensitivity   to  abstract  relations  will  be   inferred   from  differences in the time the animals spend voluntarily  inspecting  the stimulus materials.    The  primary goal in all of the proposed research is not to  show  that one species can or cannot perform any given task. Rather  it  is  to clarify the conditions under which the cited disparity  is  or is not manifested. Comparisons between closely related species  like  human, ape and monkey can also be informative with  respect  to  understanding  the  evolution  and  function  of  fundamental  cognitive processes.",
