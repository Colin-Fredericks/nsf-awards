 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the critical substrate issue in the development of ZnSSe blue-green LEDs and Lasers. Recently, there has been much interest in the research and development of blue-green LEDs and laser diodes due to the tremendous market potential for their applications in displays, electronics, communications and information storage. Among all the semiconductors, ZnSe based semiconductors are one of the prime candidates for the fabrication of blue-green lasers. Although ZnSe based LEDs and laser diodes have recently been produced, their lifetime has been a critical issue. One of the major causes of the insufficient lifetime is the lack of device quality ZnSe substrates. After analyzing past and current ZnSe crystal growth techniques and II-V1 semiconductor compound defect chemistry, Fermionics Corporation  proposes an innovative method to grow ZnSe crystals at low temperatures. They plan to not only grow ZnSe single crystals, but also produce crystals with the lowest crystalline defects. In addition, they will study the feasibility of producing high conductivity p-type ZnSe by in situ impurity doping. In Phase I, the feasibility of growing high quality ZnSe single crystal will be demonstrated. In Phase II, large ZnSe crystals will be produced, and ZnSSe LEDs and laser diodes will be fabricated. Finally, in Phase III, these products will be commercialized.",
