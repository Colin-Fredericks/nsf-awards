 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453078  Forbus    The goal of this project is to develop articulate virtual  laboratories (AVLs) that teach science and engineering principles  by scaffolding and coaching students in conceptual design tasks.   The educational conjecture we are testing is that articulate  virtual laboratories will enable students to (a) learn fundamental  principles radically be better than they would otherwise be unable  to perform.  To test these conjectures, our prototype laboratories  will be used by engineering undergraduates from Northwestern  University and Oxford University as part of their course work, and  by high school students from Evanston Township High School.    We believe that articulate virtual laboratories could dramatically  improve engineering and science education. Design experience is  essential to engineering education, and provides a powerful  motivating context for learning fundamental physical principles:  One cannot design a jet engine, refrigerator, or power plant  without using a broad range of physical principles. Design  environments that scaffold students, allowing them to focus on  fundamentals, could prove invaluable for instruction in basic  science as well as engineering, and could better motivate interest  in science learning. Design experiences are difficult to provide in  typical classroom settings, because many interesting physical  artifacts (such as power plants, jet engines, and refrigerators)  are expensive or dangerous to build and experiment with. Articulate  virtual laboratories will address these problems by enabling  students to design, analyze, and test artifacts in a simulated  environment, cheaply and safely. They will provide coaching for  students, in order to help them understand fundamental principles,  to help them practice the skills needed to model, analyze, and  design physical systems, and to provide the kind of supervision  that a good laboratory assistant provides by way of minimizing  unenlightening aspects of student explorations.    Creating art iculate virtual laboratories requires synthesizing  advances involving several AI technologies. Qualitative physics  provides formal representations for the tacit knowledge of  scientists and engineers that connects their professional knowledge  to their experience-based intuitions, enabling software to use  methods and concepts similar to those deemed natural by domain  experts.  Compositional modeling provides representations and  reasoning techniques for computer-assisted modeling (e.g., how to  apply professional knowledge of a domain to modeling real-world  situations so that they can be formally analyzed). Truth-  maintenance systems provide reasoning services and the raw material  for constructing explanations of the system's results and reasoning  in terms that help students understand the domain of study.  Symbolic algebra and constraint propagation provide mathematical  solutions. Analogical processing techniques provide the ability to  retrieve and apply results from libraries of worked out designs and  examples to notel situations, in order to coach students.    We are developing two prototype articulate virtual laboratories, in  collaboration with engineering faculty at Northwestern University  and at Oxford University who are willing to use them with their  students. The first concerns thermodynamic cycles, an idealization  used in the conceptual design of power plants, propulsion systems,  refrigeration systems, and heat pumps. To master the design and  analysis of thermodynamic cycles requires a deep understanding of  a substantial body of thermodynamic. The second concerns feedback  controllers. The concepts of feedback and control theory permeate  modern science and engineering.  While mathematical analyses are  required to design optimal controllers, we believe that many of the  important concepts of feedback could be grasped by high school  students, given appropriate scaffolding.  ***",
