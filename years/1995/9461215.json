 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a thin film solid-host dye laser pumped by energetic electrons. Solid host dye lasers are of interest because they offer tunability and a choice of wavelength range, pulse width and repetition rate without the need for solvent/dye circulation and disposal; solid hosts may improve dye lifetime and performance, as well. Recently, Jet Process Corporation (JPC) used its Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD) thin film technique to successfully make bulk solid host dye laser media; these were based on JVD `organic guest-inorganic host` films in which Rhodamine 6G molecules were trapped at high concentration in films such as silicon dioxide. Pumping by green light from a YAG laser stimulated laser emission from the trapped Rhodamine 6G molecules. In Phase I JPC proposes to investigate pumping by energetic electrons in the solid as an alternative to optical pumping by a laser or flashlamp. If successful, this strategy would lead to a portable dye laser pumped by a small power supply or batteries. In addition, thin film electron pumped dye lasers could easily be incorporated into novel integrated optical electronic circuits. These devices would be entirely fabricated by low cost JVD techniques, and many applications and markets in medicine and industry would become possible. In order to test this idea in Phase I, JPC will use JVD host-guest techniques to trap Rhodamine 6G molecules in transparent conducting indium oxide films, construct a diode, and look for light emission as a function of applied voltage and current flow. Success in Phase I would confirm a new approach to dye laser operation; in Phase II JPC will optimize laser power and efficiency, make a portable low cost dye laser, and integrate thin film dye lasers into microelectronic circuits and devices.",
