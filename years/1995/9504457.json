 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504457  Orlik       This work applies tools developed in the theory of  arrangements to several problems arising from the theory of  Aomoto-Gelfand hypergeometric functions.  A twisted de Rham complex  is of special interest.  It is particularly important to compute  the dimension of the top cohomology group and to find an explicit  basis for it, because this cohomology group may be identified with  the space of hypergeometric functions.  The present approach is by  using similar complexes with different and simpler coboundary maps.   In particular, a complex of logarithmic forms and the Orlik-Solomon  algebras are studied.  The calculation of the cohomology of these  complexes is usually easier than the twisted de Rham complex  itself.  The aim is to prove that under certain conditions these  cohomology groups are isomorphic to the twisted de Rham cohomology  groups.  Another goal is to use Morse theory to find twisted cycles  that give a basis for the twisted de Rham homology.       The study of arrangements of hyperplanes is a new branch of  mathematics on the interface between topology, algebra, algebraic  geometry, combinatorics, and analysis.  Applications include coding  theory, computer science, spline functions, and physics.  The  present work is related to hypergeometric functions,  representations of Lie groups, Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations,  and conformal field theory.  These last topics are of great  interest to mathematicians and theoretical physicists.  ***",
