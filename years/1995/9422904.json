 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a U.S.-France workshop on Operads and Homotopical Algebra to take place in Luminy, France, May 29 - June 2, 1995.  The organizers of the workshop are James D. Stasheff of the University of North Carolina and Jean-Louis Loday of the Institute for Research in Advanced Mathematics, Strasbourg, France.    The objective of the workshop is to bring together American, French and other Western European mathematicians for discussions on new research directions on operad and its applications.  An operad is a mathematical device which models many kinds of algebras  There is renewed interest in the topic due to discovery of its relationships to other fields in mathematics (e.g., representation theory, graph cohomology, moduli spaces) and its application in statistical mechanics, theoretical physics and string theory.  The workshop takes advantage of the interests and  varied expertise of U.S. and Western European researchers.  It will enhance interactions among the researchers and lead to future collaborations.",
