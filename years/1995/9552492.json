Current technology hold the promise of  helping us to achieve this long-sought goal, which has eluded  earlier generations of school reformers.  Students and teachers now  can have access to tools that communicate, work with data, model,  visualize data, and retrieve information; to multimedia composition  tools that enable them to express themselves creatively; and to  intelligent tutors and content-focused software that assist them in  efficiently mastering certain skills and information.     Telecommunications networks have the potential to break down the  traditional classroom limits and provide access to peers, experts,  and information locally and globally.    The potential for the technology to impact on the process of  teaching and learning is immense, and the DoDDS proposal offers a  well-designed situation to demonstrate this potential.  The  barriers to effective implementation of technology will be  systemically addressed; access, technical support, and  institutional commitment are part of the environment that DoDDS and  the NSF are establishing.  TERC proposes to address the issues of  technology selection and professional development by mobilizing a  partnership of TERC and national experts-leaders who have  successfully introduced technology in schools similar to the DoDD  schools-with DoDDS district staff and school staff.  We will  address technology selection through tapping the experience of this  partnership to select the most appropriate technologies and  specific applications.  We will address professional development by  designing and implementing a program that focuses on teachers  learning new models to organize teaching and learning using  technology.    The goal of the project is to implement a range of technologies and  pedagogies towards the goal of high student achievement in  mathematics and science.  To reach this goal ove r the three years,  we will:       *    Mobilize a partnership of TERC, national experts and            leaders in the field, and DoDDS       *    Develop effective Implementation Teams at each school       *    Select technology to support inquiry-based learning       *    Create and implement a plan of professional development            for each school, coordinated across schools       *    Measure and monitor progress towards the goal of using            technology to improve mathematics and science education  The outcome of our work will be innovative models for excellence in  mathematics and science education and effective strategies for the  use of technology to implement these models.  The example of the  three Demonstration schools in developing and demonstrating these  models will give us the research basis to understand better the  role of technology in school reform, and options for DoDDS in  scaling these changes to the full DoDDS system.  ***",
