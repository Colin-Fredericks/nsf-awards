It includes:  (i)  realization of a novel Bragg structure in semiconductor waveguides  to achieve ultra-broadband reflection (equal to or greater than 20%  of the optical bandwidth); (ii) experimental demonstration and  study of a new type of optical solitary wave called Bragg soliton  that exists in Bragg structures with third order optical  nonlinearities; (iii) realization of novel microcavity  semiconductor laser structures and studies of quantum effects in  such structures.    The PI's education plan includes:  (i) The introduction of a new  design course for undergraduate students in the area of optical  communications to enable the students to have hands-on experience  with optical communication system; (ii) The creation of  opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in  research; (iii) The development of a course and textbook on  \"Introduction to Quantum Electronics\" for senior  undergraduate/graduate students.  The PI takes a new approach where  the importance of classical mechanics to the foundation of quantum  mechanics is emphasized.  ***",
