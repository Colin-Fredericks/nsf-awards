 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding geographic information systems (GIS) and techniques  of environmental simulation is important to professional urban  planners, especially in settings where physical planning  projects, large and small, are an issue of public importance.    Planners are often expected by both public officials and  community groups to assess critically GIS analyses and  computer-generated simulations offered in support of and in  opposition to proposed projects.   Understanding how primary  spatial data are collected for proposals at all scale levels is  an increasingly important professional skill.   Through this  project, the School of Planning purchases a differential global  positioning system (DGPS) and digital electronic transit to  provide direct instruction to its undergraduate planning students  in primary spatial data collection in courses on planning design,  site planning, GIS, and environmental simulation.   The purpose  of this instruction is to prepare the school's graduates with a  technological skill that is important in both professional and  public policy terms.",
