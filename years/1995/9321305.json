 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321305  Nye  Scientists, among the most highly educated citizens in any  society, have often seen that they carry a special responsibility  to address the problems of the world around them.  Professional  societies such as the AAAS and APS give special awards to those  scientists who make significant contributions to humanity.   Professor Nye is examining how our views of the social  responsibility of scientists have developed in the contemporary  Anglo-American world.    During the 1930's British scientists and intellectuals debated  economic, social, political, and philosophical issues, as never  before, among themselves and before the public.  Because their  scientific work was taken to exemplify reason, objectivity and  progress, many British scientists wondered whether they had a  special responsibility to turn their talents directly to the  troublesome dilemmas of their time.  The essential questions  which they debated focused on what came to be called the \"social  responsibility of science\" and included concerns about the social  determination of science, the nature of scientific method, the  applicability of scientific theories to social problems, the  organization and control of science, and the role of scientists  in political corridors of power.    It may safely be said that these questions remains controversial  ones.  As in the historical past, individual men and women  continue to respond to these questions indifferent, and sometimes  equally convincing, ways.  Dr. Nye is reexamining and reanalyzing  these questions about scientific practice and scientific  responsibility through a detailed study of two scientists who  answered social questions in radically different ways whose  responses carried considerable weight among scientific,  philosophical and political circles in England.    As close personal friends, faculty colleagues during 1937-53, and  directors of scientific laboratories, the physicist P.M.S.  Blackett and the physical chemist Michael Polanyi were leading  scienti sts in Great Britain in the decades from the 1930's to the  1950's.  A close study of their scientific work, their social and  philosophical epistemologies, and their political lives is a  means to better understanding the complicated relationships among  scientific practice, knowledge of the natural world, and  improvement of the human condition.  ***",
