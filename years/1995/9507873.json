 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507873  Rosenbaum  The  physics of the metal-insulator transition is intimately tied  to  the  unusual  ground  state properties  of  highly-correlated  metals,  including  the  heavy fermions  compounds,  the  high-Tc  superconductors, and the Mott-Hubbard systems V2O3 and Ni(S,Se)2.  An  important, unresolved issue is the nature of the interplay of  the  itinerant  magnetism with the Coulomb interactions  and  the  disorder.  This research project focuses on the transition  metal  oxides and sulfides. It aims to deconvolute the influences of the  spin  and  charge  degrees of freedom in the  barely-delocalized,  disordered  metal  through  a program  of  electrical  transport,  magnetic  susceptibility, specific heat, neutron scattering,  and  optical  measurements.  Temperature  capabilities  down  to   the  milliKelvin  regime provide new diagnostics of  localization  and  electron   interaction  effects  as  well  as   simplifying   the  theoretical  description  of  the  problem.  Moreover,   possible  deviations  from the usual Fermi-liquid behavior, with  different  forms  posited for the quantum and classical regimes,  should  be  revealed by high-resolution pressure studies of the transport and  calorimetric response.  %%%  A  sharp  change from a state where electrons can flow freely  to  one  where  they  are unable to move lies at the  heart  of  many  device  applications. This \"metal-Insulator\"  transition  can  be  driven  by  a  number  of  external  parameters,  including   the  application  of pressure, the introduction of disorder,  and  the  manipulation  of material characteristics. The research  proposed  here seeks to explore the interaction between disorder, found  in  all  real  materials,  and control parameters  such  as  changing  electron  density and internal chemical pressure at the  boundary  between  metal  and insulator. Of prime interest  are  transition  metal  oxides and sulfides, classes of materials whose electronic  and magnetic responses are acutely sen sitive to small changes  in  the  control parameters. Depending on the particular material and  the  nature  of  its  preparation, it may have  potential  as  an  electronic  switch,  a  magnetic  storage  device,  or  a   high-  temperature superconductor.  ***",
