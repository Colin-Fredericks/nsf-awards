 "awd_abstract_narration": "The foci of this research are fourfold.  New aromatic substrates will be   screened for oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida 39/D to broaden the   applicability of this method.  Potassium permanganate oxidation of dienes   will be investigated as an alternative to ozonolysis.  Syntheses of   sugars, cyclitols, sphingolipids and alkaloids will demonstrate the   efficiency of the biocatalytic strategy and fourth, mass balance of   reagents and waste output will be assessed for each preparation in order   to minimize organic byproducts produced during manufacture.  With this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and Processing award,   the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Dr. Tomas   Hudlicky of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida.    Professor Hudlicky, collaborating with Genencor International, will focus   his work on developing new strategy for the reduction of pollution at its   source.  The strategy rests on the assumption that, instead of   incineration or other means of disposal, homogeneous waste or solvents   would be subjected to microbial oxidation by Pseudomonas Putida 39/D to   produce arene cis-diols which are ideally suited for short and   environmentally benign conversions to useful organic compounds",
