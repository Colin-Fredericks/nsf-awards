 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jack R. Pladziewicz, Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin -   Eau Claire, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate   electron transfer processes. In this investigation rate constants will be   measured  for the single electron transfer reactions of a series of   hydrazines and their radical cations. The data  will then be used to   evaluate the extent to which these reactions fit current theories for   outer-sphere electron transfer. In particular the inner-shell   reorganization energies for the alkyl hydrazine and the extent to which   inner-shell reorganization contributes to the activation free energy for   electron transfer reactions will be determined. By use of cross-reaction   rate constants the self-exchange electron transfer will be estimated for   hydrazines with slow exchange rates or with properties that make them   otherwise unamenable  to study.   Many chemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one   molecule to a second. One factor which influences the rate of these   processes and which is not well understood is the reorganization which a   molecule undergoes upon the transfer of an electron to or from it. This   project is designed to determine the energies of these reorganizations   for a series of nitrogen containing organic molecules and to assess how   well current theories are able to account for the influence of the   reorganization on the electron transfer rate.",
