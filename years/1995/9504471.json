 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504471  Kauffman       This project investigates invariants of knots, 3-manifolds and  higher dimensional manifolds that arise from state summation  models, quantum groups and topological quantum field theory.  This  includes work on the structure of the Jones polynomial, on  Vassiliev invariants, and on connections with quantum field theory  and molecular biology, as well as techniques and conjectures about  the use of functional integration in topology.       In the last decade, knot theory has encountered an awakening  through the infusion of a remarkable collection of techniques from  mathematical physics and a series of interrelationships with  molecular biology, chemistry, and theoretical physics.  The  principal investigator is one of the key figures in the inception  of this relationship with physics (statistical mechanics) via his  introduction of the use of state summation models for polynomial  invariants of knots and links.  In a state summation model the knot  is regarded as a miniature physical system, and topological  properties of the knot are seen as averages of physical  interactions.  These models have grown to encompass techniques from  quantum field theory and have been useful in topology and its  applications to the study of molecular interactions in biology and  chemistry.  In topology these techniques apply to the structure of  three- and four-dimensional spaces as well as to knots.  This means  that these techniques are essential to the architecture of three-  dimensional structures - from molecules to networks of  communication, from atoms to galaxies.  All fields of science are  based on the structure of space.  What is particular to this  project's topological study is that it articulates the topological  components in large networks of which knots are the principal  example.  Such networks are the basis of significant structures  such as RNA and DNA, where topology is the key to interaction.       In fact, the introduction of topology in these subjects is,  from the  viewpoint of this principal investigator, just the  beginning of a larger interplay, where topology is seen as the  basis for studying the recursive and circular architectures of  complex systems.  A galaxy, a society, an organism and a physical  system all have in common the stability that arises through closed  systems of circular interactions.  Such interactions have  traditionally been treated via cybernetics and computer modeling.   These topological investigations add a new dimension to cybernetics  and complex systems, providing new questions and a host of new  problems.  All these issues are treated in the new book \"Knots and  Applications,\" edited and contributed to by the principal  investigator.  ***",
