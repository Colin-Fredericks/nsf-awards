 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553354  Tewksbury  Within the last few years, it has become obvious that a profound  and far-ranging paradigm shift in the practice of (and  computer-aided design - CAD - tools for) the design of  competitive electronic system modules has occurred. Earlier,  designers worked with relatively simple ICs performing specific  logic functions to create an innovative and novel system  realization. Packaged integrated circuits (ICs) had a limited  number (14 - 64) of external connections (I/O) and were readily  hand soldered onto thru-hole printed circuit boards or connected  using standard wire-wrap prototyping techniques. This general  approach for circuit boards remained largely unchanged for over  two decades and provided the necessary capabilities until a few  years ago. During that period, the complexity of digital ICs was  doubling approximately every 18 months, with the simple quad  gates per IC evolving into today's ICs with hundreds of thousands  of gates per IC. Present high-density VLSI ICs routinely require  several hundred I/O pins and industry projections suggesting  several thousand I/O pins per IC within a little more than a  decade.  Over much of the last 20 years, the clock rate of  digital systems remained surprisingly constant, in the range 10  to 25 MHz. However, the last few years also has seen a remarkably  fast progression to higher clock rates extending well above 100  MHz. This progression to higher clock rates also impacts system  prototyping dramatically, requiring special techniques to handle  not only the fast signal transitions but also the large number of  interconnections and I/O lines operating at high speed.    The project will obtain (i) for equipment to fabricate prototype,  multilayer, surface mount, printed circuit boards (PCBs) and to  mount advanced VLSI components on those boards and (ii) for  initial research related to image processing accelerators,  intelligent sensor systems, and advanced  packaging/interconnection technologies. These capabilities  provid e a foundation for a broad, experimental program in high  performance, embedded microelectronic systems, supplementing  existing capabilities for advanced packaging and interconnection  technologies presently available.    The project will result in a strong experimental microelectronic  systems research program designed to provide (i) innovations in  microelectronic systems education (undergraduate and graduate),  (ii) outreach to companies in WV both for continuing education  and for R&D support, (iii) development of high performance  modules in support of interdisciplinary research within the  academic research community of WV, and (iv) development of a more  competitive position for research in the area of high performance  microelectronic systems.",
