 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Emory University in   the purchase of a parallel computational facility.  This equipment will   enhance research in a number of areas including the following:  A.    Potential Energy Surfaces, Reaction Rates and Mechanisms, and Dynamics of   Combustion Related Reactions and Other Reactions.  B.  Combined `ab   initio Molecular Orbital + Molecular Mechanics` Studies of Reactions of   Complicated `Real` Molecular Systems.  C.  Ab initio theoretical studies   of elementary reactions involving excited states of molecules.  D.  Ab   initio theoretical studies of structures and reactions of transition   metal atoms, ions, complexes and cluster complexes.  E.  Simulation and   Computational Approach to Condensed Matter Chemistry.  F.  Theory and   Computation of the Dynamics and Vibrations of Molecules.  G.  The   collision dynamics of radicals.    Multi-processor computers with parallel capability are being used more,   with the advent of parallel computing codes and are being integrated into   existing workstation clusters.  The most important feature of a network   is that it can simultaneously satisfy departmental computing needs, serve   as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,   provide state of the art graphics and visualization facilities, and   support research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing   for the entire department.",
