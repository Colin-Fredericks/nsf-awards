 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lindley  The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences shares with its sister campus, the  University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, a major responsibility for life sciences and  university-based biotechnology research and development performed for the state of  Arkansas.  Built in 1957, the Shorey Building, a nine story structure, recently housed  all the basic science departments and most of the research laboratories and support  facilities.  The  research space is sub-standard for many aspects of modern cellular  and molecular neurobiology, in spite of the fact that they represent essentially the  only significant university-based capacity in the state for neurobiology research.   Certain core facilities requisite to modern cellular molecular neurobiology, such as  adequate darkrooms, tissue culture capabilities and space to house large equipment,  are not available.  Inadequate infrastructure is a hindrance for the application of  contemporary cellular and molecular biology and biophysics to neurobiological  problems.  The laboratories are a critical success factor for continued development of  Arkansas efforts in biotechnology.  They also provide research training opportunities  for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  ARI funds will be used to support various renovations including:  asbestos abatement,  upgrading HVAC and electrical power systems,  installing new benches and lab  islands, modernizing cell and tissue culture and darkroom facilities, and providing a  central autoclave and glassware washing facility.  Provisions for computer network  access and data analysis space will also be included.  Once completed, the basic  biological research conducted in the renovated facilities will build on and be  synergistic with the research program launched by the NSF EPSCoR Arkansas  Neurobiology Center.  Modernized facilities will enhance the research programs of  investigators who contribute to biotechnology linkages and improved scientific training  for undergraduates in partn ership with Arkansas institutions, including the historically  black colleges, Philander Smith College and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.",
