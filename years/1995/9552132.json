 "awd_abstract_narration": "Creativity in the design of laboratory experiments requires  access to appropriate techniques for the analysis of the results.    When students are given responsibility for the design of  experiments to explain phenomena, the need for advanced  instrumentation is even greater.   This project incorporates a  GC-MS into the organic teaching laboratories.   This instrument  enhances the instrumental analytical capabilities for use in the  Analytical Chemistry courses.   A GC/MS, and a GC with a  capillary column and an FID detector for method development,  allows Organic Chemistry students greater creativity in their  experimental design as they investigate competitive reactions and  equilibrium environments.   Analytical Chemistry students can  gain a strong working knowledge of this essential  instrumentation.   The instrumentation can also be used for  undergraduate student research.   This project serves to enhance  the education of women scientists and encourage them to pursue  further scientific studies.   If student participation is  encouraged in the design of their experiments, a greater  intellectual involvement and a greater willingness to adopt  experimental methodologies to solve problems are promoted.   The  enthusiasm and intellectual growth engendered by these processes  results in the production of better students and positively  influences their decisions to pursue graduate study and  scientific careers.",
