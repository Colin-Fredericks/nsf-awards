 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417414  Moore    Studies of arc-continent collisions provide valuable insights into  orogenic processes and continental accretion. The Taiwan orogenic  belt provides a modern example of this process, which has served as  an important model for studying ancient orogens now exposed on  land. Uplift rates measured along the collision suture in  southeastern Taiwan are among the fastest in the world, yet little  is known about the crustal structure beneath this region or the  mechanisms responsible for uplift at the critical transition from  subduction to collision located in the offshore to the south of  Taiwan.    The present project  will provide detailed new information with  which to examine Taiwan crustal structure and the collision  process. Data to be acquired include multi-channel seismic  reflection and seismic refraction data from the offshore region, as  well as simultaneous crustal refraction measurements on land. A  major advantage to undertaking such a study in Taiwan is that  progressively younger stages of the propagating collision can be  viewed by moving southward along the collision zone. Thus, the  detailed aspects of the collision process can be examined from an  evolutionary perspective. Results from the project will be critical  in planning drilling by the Ocean Drilling Program. This is a  cooperative project supported by scientists at four U.S.  institutions and the Institute of Oceanography of the National  Taiwan University.  ***",
