 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500404  Adham  Seismic response and seismic evaluation of masonry buildings have  been of significant concern in the U.S. since the 1933 Long Beach  earthquake.   Similar concerns were expressed in Egypt  following  the  October  1992 Dahshour earthquake.  As a result,  the  First  Cairo Earthquake Engineering Symposium on Seismic Risk Assessment  will  be  held in Cairo on December 3-5, 1994.  The symposium  is  arranged by the Egyptian Society of Earthquake Engineering and co-  sponsored  by  UNESCO  and the faculty of  engineering  at  Cairo  University.  A training course on Seismic Evaluation  of  Masonry  Buildings  will be held on November 28-December 1, 1994,  a  week  before  the  symposium.   This international  travel  award  will  enable  the principal investigator to make presentations at  both  of  these  meetings  and  advance cooperation  between  U.S.  and  Egyptian researchers in the field of earthquake engineering.  ***",
