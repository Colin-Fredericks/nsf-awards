 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project in syntactic theory, the branch of linguistics  which studies the properties of grammatical systems, and aims to  construct a forrnal model of grammar which is common to and  accurate for all natural languages. The focus of this particular  project is on a class of constraints on syntactic rules, a set of  conditions which limit the contexts in which certain rules may  apply.  On the basis of the relevant literature and their own prior  research, the investigators have developed a hypothesis which  relates a constraint on the applicability of certain \"extraction\"  rules, i.e. grammatical rules which move a constituent from one  part of a sentence structure to another, to patterns of  constituent structure in the locus from which the constituent is  to be extracted. The structures which block an extraction are  called \"selective islands\". The blockage is illustrated by pairs  of example sentences like:  Who was Bill sorry they hired?  *Who was Bill sorry hired them?  The first sentence is ordinary; the second one clearly has  something wrong with it (which is indicated by the asterisk  preceding it).  These principles apply across a wide variety of grammatical  constructions, which indicates that they have a role in the basic  theory of grammar. The project will explore and elucidate that  role. Preliminary investigations suggest that the principles to  be studied may have an impact on some major issues in syntactic  theory. At the conclusion of the project, the investigators will  prepare a monograph describing their findings.",
