 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scientific Visualization and Virtual Design Environment  Laboratory enhances undergraduate courses in science, mathematics,  and engineering.   It also improves the preparation of  undergraduates who plan to pursue a career in teaching science and  mathematics.   This project funds six Silicon Graphics INDIGO  workstations, CrystalEyes VR, and software packages by Alias  Research Incorporated and Sense8 Corporation.   This laboratory is  being used by undergraduates to develop maintainable graphics  programs and to visualize scientific data.   Students learn about  using visualization as a tool for discovering and understanding  complex phenomena.   In addition, students use the proposed  laboratory to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate potential design  solutions.   Students easily develop virtual worlds, animate them  with realistic properties, and experience them in partially  immersive mode.   Finally, the new laboratory provides students  with hands-on experience of software packages that are widely used  in the field.   This project injects a component into our  curriculum that heretofore has not been widely applied in the  science and engineering disciplines.",
