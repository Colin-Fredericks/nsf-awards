 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: IBN-9511895  Principal Investigator:  DeBold, Joseph F.      Progesterone is an important steroid hormone for regulating many  aspects of physiology and behavior.  According to the classical  approach, steroid hormones exert their effects by entering cells,  binding with a receptor inside the cell, and then the  steroid-receptor complex acts on  specific sites on the chromosomes  to change which proteins that cell is producing.  This mechanism of  action has been described in virtually every cell that responds to  steroid hormones.  However, it appears to be absent in the ventral  midbrain.  Dr. DeBold's previous studies have shown that a form of  progesterone that cannot enter neurons is effective in altering  behavior when administered in the midbrain but not in other steroid  sensitive areas.  Therefore, the primary focus of the proposed  studies is to determine how progesterone is acting on neurons to  influence behavior and the connectivity of these neurons.  Dr.  DeBold will identify the neurons containing these unique  characteristics by labeling progesterone with a fluorescent tag and  identifying the cell to which it binds and then using neurochemical  procedures, characterize the type of cells containing these novel  receptors.  Using selective pharmacological agents, the role of  other neurotransmitters in mediating progesterone actions will be  established.  These studies investigate novel effects of steroid  hormones and will be extremely beneficial in understanding the  physiology and pathophysiology of these essential molecules.",
