 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite predictions after World War II that Yiddish would  disappear, Yiddish has thrived alongside English and Hebrew in  many New York Hasidic communities, including the Bobover Hasidim  of Boro Park, Brooklyn. Yiddish is critical to Bobover ethnic  identity. The cultural meanings of Yiddish, however, are  established in contrast to patterns of English use. These  patterns of language choice - Yiddish and English - are gendered.  In this project I use the language socialization research  paradigm to investigate activities through which young children  become competent members of a groups whose identity is enacted  through gendered language practices and other self and community  defining activities. My research will be based on the analysis of  audiotaped natural speech between caregivers and four focal  children in contexts of home and school as well as analysis of  English and Yiddish children's literature published by the  community. To date, there has been no research which focuses on  Hasidic children and multilingual acquisition and practices. The  Bobover provide a particularly illuminating case study for  language socialization because language maintenance (especially  Yiddish) and the reproduction of social identity are so tightly  linked in this community. This study will be relevant more  broadly for understandings of gender and religious  fundamentalism, processes of social reproduction and change, as  well as the relationship between Jewish ethnic identities and  languages.",
