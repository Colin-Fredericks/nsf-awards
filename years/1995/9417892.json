 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417892  Callender  Over the past year or so, a laser-induced temperature jump  apparatus (T-jump) was developed which can rapidly, within 100 ps  or even faster, raise the temperature of a protein solution 30  C  or more.  Since proteins unfold usually over a temperature range  smaller than this, it is now possible to study the dynamics of  protein unfolding with a resolution some 107 times faster than  previously possible .  We will study the unfolding/folding dynamics  of small peptide systems and proteins using this new laser induced   T-jump apparatus to initiate the process and time-resolved infrared  spectroscopy to follow the time course of these reactions.  In  addition, static IR and very sensitive novel Raman difference  spectroscopies will be employed to characterize the structures of  the peptide and protein systems and their changes upon reversible  temperature induced unfolding/folding.  Vibrational measurements as  structure-specific probes of proteins and peptides are well  established and, moreover, can follow the kinetics of chemical  dynamics down to femtoseconds.  For our first measurements, we will  study the unfolding steps of ribonuclease A in depth.  RNase A is  a small monomeric enzyme of 124 residues, consisting of an N-  terminal alpha-helix (the S-peptide region) and two shorter helices  packed against a central antiparallel  -sheet.  The S-peptide may  be cleaved and isolated from and regenerated with the rest of the  protein.  In solution, the S-peptide forms considerable helical  structure.  Since it is possible to selectively isotopically label  individual atoms of peptides during peptide synthesis using labeled  peptides, it is feasible to 'tag' the peptide and so obtain  structural information and follow the dynamics down to the level of  individual bonds with our vibrational techniques.  The helix is a  key structural motif of proteins.  For the RNase system, it will  thus be possible to examine selectively the structure and dynamics  of the helix to individua l bonds in solution and bound to protein  and to contrast these dynamics with those occurring elsewhere in  the rest of the protein during the unfolding process.  We will also  study the structure and fast dynamics of other short de novo  peptides as models of helixes; these include the FS peptide,  previously characterized in Peter Kim's laboratory, and the XA4-  peptide, which has been extensively characterized by other means in  Neville Kallenbach's laboratory.  In addition, we will investigate  alpha-lactalbumin because it forms a stable 'molten-globule' state  and these states are believed to be very early steps on the kinetic  pathway of protein folding.  %%%  It is known that the shape, or three dimensional structure, of a  protein must be just right so that it may carry out its biochemical  task.  It is also believed that this shape is determined uniquely  by the sequence of the protein's amino acid building blocks.  It is  therefore very important to understand how the sequence of residues  determines the pathway by which the protein folds from a very large  number of possible disordered shapes into highly ordered just  correct one if it is to become possible to design proteins from  scratch.  Rationally designed protein may be made to perform any  number of desired biochemical functions, i.e. act as drugs.  At  present, kinetic measurements of protein folding, or the reverse  situation of protein unfolding, are performed by using stopped-flow  techniques which are too slow to determine early key steps.  Over  the past year or so, preliminary research has developed equipment  to initiate the folding steps and follow them with a resolution of  100 picoseconds, some 107 times faster than previously possible.   This unique instrumentation involves a laser induced temperature  jump apparatus (T-jump) which can rapidly raise the temperature of  a protein solution 30  C or more.  Since proteins unfold over a  temperature range smaller than this, it is now feasible to study  the kinetic steps  of protein unfolding.  The work will study the  unfolding dynamics of small peptide systems and proteins using this  new laser induced T-jump apparatus to initiate the process and  time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to follow the time course of  these reactions.  In addition, static infrared and very sensitive  novel Raman difference spectroscopies will be employed to  characterize the structures of the peptide and protein systems and  their changes upon reversible temperature induced  unfolding/folding.  ***",
