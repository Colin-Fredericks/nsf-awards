The CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year program under the direction of a multi institutional team of researchers from the University of Missouri Rolla, University of Arkansas, and Kansas State University will design two new courses to provide students with a firm grasp of the fundamentals in distribution and transmission systems and to introduce the students to advanced topics in the control aspects of these systems.  Novel features of this program include multi institutional cooperation, student consulting teams, virtual classrooms and interactive computer exercises and design.  The faculty involved in this CRCD program will cultivate and disseminate the expertise of the researchers to enhance each school's power engineering program.  In addition, this project will lay the groundwork for schools to enhance the educational experience of their students by relying not only on the experience of on site faculty, but also on the experience of researchers at other institutions.",
