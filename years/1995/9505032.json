 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Donald   Setser of Kansas State University will study state-resolved dynamics and   kinetics of phase species important in combustion and atmospheric   chemistry.  Various spectroscopic methods will be used to prepare   reactants and observe product state distributions.  Infrared   chemiluminescence will be used to study products from  atom-radical and   radical-radical reactions,  identify mechanisms, and determine overall   rate constants.  Electronic emission and laser induced fluorescence will   be used to study the mechanism and state distributions of rare gas halide   molecules produced by two-photon laser assisted reactions. These studies   will compare the state distributions of products resulting from   collisions in dilute gas mixtures with those obtained from reactions   within a prepared van der Waals molecule.  The results of these   investigations will be interpreted in terms of dynamical models which   have been developed for certain types of gas phase reactions and the   insights obtained will be used to understand more complex reactive   systems.   Radicals are highly reactive, usually unstable molecules which are   present in high concentration in energetic chemical reactors such as   combustion systems.  Reactions of radicals are also important in the   mechanisms responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer and global   warming.  Professor Setser's investigations will provide information   about the elementary reactions involved in these mechanisms, and the   nature and energy content of the species produced by these reactions.",
