Much of the literature on the  presidency suggests that presidents cannot make substantive  policy without congressional cooperation.  Executive orders that  are issued under the president's statutory or constitutional  powers as chief executive are, according to this framework, an  insignificant source of presidential power.  At the same time,  however, presidents have on a number of occasions issued  unilateral orders with profound political and social  consequences, and policy makers themselves recognize the  potential for independent presidential action.  The issue of how  much independent authority presidents have remains a basic  empirical question that is not adequately addressed in the  presidency literature.    The starting point of the study is that if presidents use orders  and directives for strategic purposes, then their use should vary  predictably according to a president's strategic situation and  political context.  To investigate this phenomenon, the project  analyzes three separate types of data on executive orders and  administrative directives:  1) a time series analysis of all  executive orders and administrative directives issued since 1935,  with the goal of uncovering statistical patterns in how, and  under what circumstances, orders are issued; 2) a random sample  drawn from the universe of orders and directives.  This sample is  coded to identify those orders which have substantive policy or  political significance (a result that, by inference, may be  applied to the entire population of orders).  This subsample of  important orders is in turn subjected to analysis to determine  what aspects of a presidents strategic situation and political  context affect their use; 3) case studies of approximately 10 of  the most important executive orders.    The project sill substantially enhance the un derstanding of  executive authority and the balance of policy making power  between the Presidency and Congress.  It also advances the state  of presidency research, by moving beyond a \"president\"-centered  focus to a more general conception of presidential behavior that  cuts across administrations.  ***",
