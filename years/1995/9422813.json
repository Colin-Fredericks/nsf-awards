 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines how the economic value of risk is  affected by alternative reduction strategies and two  different elicitation mechanisms-experimental auction  markets and contingent valuation surveys.  The results will  help clarify fundamental methodological issues in valuation  which is central to environmental policy.  The approach is  illustrated through the specific example of the value of  reduced risk from Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella  from beef consumption, a particularly salient commodity  given risk can be reduced privately by home preparation or  collectively with irradiation treatments or improved  production methods. The project employs a four phase design:  (1) mental models interviews to determine how subjects  assess the risk of food-borne pathogens and how best to  communicate food safety risks, and to guide the design of  the valuation studies; (2) a contingent valuation survey  that includes both in-person and mail interviews; (3)  experimental auction markets that use real food, real money  and repeat market experience; and (4) an internal and  external validation procedure where the internal check will  use cooked meat samples, and the external check will use  survey results from a commercial store that sells irradiated  products.  The project will explore:  (a) how to best  communicate risks of food-borne illness; (b) whether people  have general preferences for food safety rather than  pathogen-specific preferences; how preferences for risk  reduction vary with the severity of the risk; how \"who\" is  at risk-children vs. adults-influences preferences; (c)  relative preferences for alternative combinations of  collective action (safe handling labels, irradiation, Hazard  Analysis at Critical Control Points (HACCP)) and private  protection (home preparation-rare, medium, and well-done  hamburgers); (d) and if there is a systematic difference in  revealed values from the hypothetical contingent valuation  survey and the non-hypothetical contingent valuation  survey  and the non-hypothetical experimental auction markets.  This  research is supported under the Joint NSF/Private Sector  Research Initiative and the cooperating organization is the  American Meat Institute.",
