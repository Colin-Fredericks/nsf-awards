 "awd_abstract_narration": "History offers two contrasting lessons on the linkage between democratic continuity and the advocacy of racist ideology.  First, the general defense of democracy requires that democratic governments embrace strong,  effective, legal means to confine the contagion of racism.  Second, the surest means for the survival of democracy is through the vigorous defense of the principle of free expression.     Which of these lessons is the truest account of the resiliency of democracy to racist ideologies?  To date there has been no scientific analysis of the comparative effectiveness of different legal standards in terms of their ability to diminish discriminatory behavior and to secure an appropriate range of democratic rights for individuals and groups.  This research compares the responses of French and United States citizens to hateful speech, and to the legal conditions that would permit or prohibit such expression.  Survey based experiments as well as focus groups will be conducted in these two countries.",
