 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422589  Gordon  The purpose of this research is to analyze the role the corporate  income tax plays in the overall tax system.  The first part of  the project explores the possibility that the primary role of the  corporate tax is to provide a backstop to personal taxes on labor  income.  The basic idea is that individuals can arrange to  receive their labor income not only in the form of cash wages,  but also as capital gains on shares they own in the firm.  Qualified stock options provide this opportunity, for example, in  publicly traded corporations. Similarly, employees of closely  held firms can be issued shares at a book value below market  value instead of being paid cash wages.  This project will  examine carefully the various incentives involved, and then make  use of recent variation in corporate vs. personal tax rates in  the U.S. to measure the responsiveness of behavior to incentives  using both aggregate income data and panel data on individual  taxpayers.    The second project will reexamine the appropriate tax treatment  of foreign subsidiaries in a setting where information flows  between countries occur primarily because of the activity of such  subsidiaries.  Not only may foreign firms acquire knowledge of  domestic technology by acquiring a domestic firm that uses this  technology, but domestic firms may acquire information through  observation of the production process of foreign subsidiaries  located nearby.  While the original domestic owner of the  technology would likely use the technology primarily in the  domestic economy, a foreign acquirer of the information in  contrast would likely make use of it primarily within its own  country. As a result, a foreign acquisition may have long term  implications for future economic activity. The project will  attempt to model carefully the equilibrium role of foreign  subsidiaries, given the possibility of such information flows.  The project will then examine the implications of the model for  the corporate tax treatment of bo th capital exports and capital  imports.  ***",
