 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9501062  PI:  Constantin    It is proposed to work on variational bounds for bulk dissipation  in boundary driven Navier-Stokes turbulence, with particular  attention to Rayleigh-Benard convection.  It is proposed to  investigate analytically properties of invariant measures for  Navier-Stokes turbulence, with the aim of studying scaling of  structure functions and making connection with aspects of the  Kolmogorov phenomenology at the dissipative and inertial scales.   It is also proposed to investigate inviscid blow-up in the Euler  equations and active scalars, with emphasis on the quasi-  geostrophic model of atmospheric flow.  The aim is to understand  inertial super-exponential generation of energetic small scales.    The present proposal is aimed at the understanding of  incompressible turbulence.  This most common class of physical  phenomena at the human scale is important for a large number of  scientific and industrial activities, from weather prediction to  computer technology.  This proposal is aimed at the mathematical  aspect of an interactive effort:  the PI collaborates with  theoretical physicists, experimental physicists, engineers and  computational scientists, working on the same specific  experimental situations and investigating the same theoretical  issues.",
