David  University of California, Los Angeles  Title: Studies in Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction    This research aims to contribute to understanding climate phenomena  that arise by interaction between ocean and atmosphere, and the  mechanisms that produce them.  Methods developed under the previous  NSF grant will be applied but with a change in emphasis in several  areas:         1) A new approach will be used for the tropical atmospheric  modeling component, based on a method designed to parlay  theoretical developments from the previous grant into a new type of  nonlinear model.  Analytical results for vertical structure that  apply under certain convective conditions are used as a basis for  numerical models that are valid more generally, but retain high  accuracy for low cost near convection regions.  This is combined  with an efficient treatment of long-wave radiation.  More  importantly, the models are easy to analyze for insight into the  atmospheric side of three-dimensional ocean-atmosphere feedbacks.          2) Investigations into the role of ocean-atmosphere  interaction in maintaining the tropical climatology were begun  under the previous grant leading to the \"climatological version of  the Bjerknes hypothesis\".  This suggest that three-dimensional  feedback between trade winds, ocean circulation and gradients of  sea surface temperature (SST) are important to the climatological  configuration of warm and cold SST regions.  The PI will expand  this work and attempt to bridge the gap between this hypothesis  involving relative SST values and work by other investigators on  the processes regulating absolute SST values.         3) Work on modes of tropical interannual variability was a  mainstay of the previous grant.  The theoretical component of this  continues but with less emphasis relative to the above topics.   Instead method applied previously to the tropics are to be adapted  for midlatitude coupled variability, with the aim of providing a  the oretical counterpart for numerical modeling efforts underway by  other investigators.    This work is important because it seeks new knowledge relevant to  our ability to model and predict climate.",
