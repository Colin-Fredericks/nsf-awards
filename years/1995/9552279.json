 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conduction in multilayer materials is currently of great  interest, but is neither well understood nor has it been  exhaustively investigated.   Measurement of conduction processes  is fundamental in material science, and because it is relatively  straightforward it is ideal for upper-level students at  undergraduate institutions.   In this project, a low-temperature  cryostat is integrated into an existing resistivity and Hall  effect apparatus and used to study the temperature dependence of  the electronic transport properties of multilayer materials.    The apparatus has been under development and is now used in a  junior- level advanced laboratory course to study metal and  semiconductor systems.   The cryostat greatly increases the  experimental capabilities in the junior-level laboratory course  and in independent study and senior-level thesis projects.   New  projects focus on the temperature, magnetic field, current  direction, and layer spacing dependencies of the  magnetoresistance and Hall voltage in multilayer systems.   Low-  temperature capabilities allow the transport properties to be  characterized over a temperature range broad enough to study the  nature of the electronic scattering mechanisms.   Initial systems  of study are C/Ge and W/Si multilayers, with layer thicknesses  ranging from 5 to 50 Angstroms.   Fabrication and structural  studies of these multilayers are performed in collaboration with  another research group.   This project should increase the  presence of material science education and research at  undergraduate institutions.",
