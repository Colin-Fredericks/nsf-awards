 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504832  Rudolph       Recent research on manifolds of dimension 3 and 4 both draws  upon, and has striking consequences for, the theory of complex  curves in complex surfaces.  Topologically, complex curves in the  unit ball in complex 2-space are simply represented as  quasipositive surfaces, which are combinatorially defined and  readily manipulable.  Earlier, Dr. Rudolph combined quasipositivity  with results from gauge theory to obtain estimates showing that  many knots are much more complicated (in certain specific senses)  than classical knot invariants can detect; he is now working to  extend such estimates (using results from monopole theory).  Other  work in progress includes development of skein theory for  Legendrian knots, an attack on a question of Harer about fibered  links (are they all stably Hopf-plumbed?), and (with Michel  Boileau) a study of Stein-fillable 3-manifolds.       Knots and links are superficially simple objects which turn up  in contexts as diverse as physics, theoretical meteorology, and  biology.  Mathematically, a rich source of knots is the theory of  equations in a small number of variables (the simplest mathematical  link, which looks like two rings in a piece of chain, comes from  the simple equation xy = 0).  Knot theory--the study of aspects of  the geometry of knots and links which are insensitive to continuous  deformations--has always had a lot to give to, and take from, the  qualitative side of the theory of equations.  Quasipositive knot  theory takes advantage of extra structure in certain equations to  obtain stronger results about their associated knots; potential  applications range from quantum gravity to unraveling the molecular  structure of DNA.  ***",
