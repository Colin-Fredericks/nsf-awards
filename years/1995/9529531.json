The purpose of this symposium is to critically review the  current status of advanced oxidation processes being used and  considered for use in environmental engineering practice as a  step toward defining further research needs.  Session topics will  include ozonation, photolysis and photocatalysis, non-thermal  plasmas, electron beam radiation, electrohydraulic cavitation and  sonolysis, supercritical oxidation, and combined processes.    This symposium is cosponsored by the Electric Power Research  Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Results are  expected to provide guidance for current use of advanced  oxidation technologies in environmental engineering practice and  to identify further research needed to provide the basis for  engineering design of systems utilizing these processes for  abatement of pollution and in remediation of contaminated  environmental resources.",
