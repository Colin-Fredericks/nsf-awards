 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment that will build  upon and enhance existing research capabilities in the area of  molecular microbial biology in the Department of Microbiology. The  funds requested will not only provide state-of-the-art equipment to  enhance the department's research programs, but will also strengthen  the department's capabilities for training graduate and undergraduate  students in the most modern techniques in molecular microbial biology.  The P.I. (Mary E. Woodworth), and the Co-P.I.s (Luis A. Actis, J.K.  Bhattacharjee, Joseph M.Carlin, and Gary R. Janssen) have  well-developed research programs in molecular microbial biology. In  addition, the five other faculty members in the Department of  Microbiology have active research programs that will benefit from the  use of this equipment. The focus of the research to be conducted  within the scope of this proposal is broad in that it will encompass  research projects on regulatory mechanisms of viral DNA replication,  genetic and molecular analysis of iron acquisition systems in  bacteria, the molecular genetics of Iysine biosynthesis in yeast, the  molecular mechanisms of regulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase  (IDO) and the translation of leaderless mRNAs in bacteria. The  training of undergraduate and graduate students in the department's  teaching and research laboratories will become more sophisticated and  appropriate to today's special need for first-rate graduates in  science and for scientifically literate citizens. The laboratory  course in Microbial and Molecular Genetics for undergraduate and  graduate students will be described as an example of how the requested  equipment will accomplish these goals.",
