 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521752  HOLSINGER   Amphipod Crustacea are a very diverse group of invertebrate animals with both freshwater and marine members.  In both aquatic environments, these animals, often present in large population numbers, are important elements of food webs.  Yet, as with many invertebrate groups, the amphipods include many undescribed species, are in need of revisionary or monographic systematic analysis, and have few systematic specialists capable of conducting such research.  Dr. John Holsinger is a recognized taxonomic authority for amphipods.  With this award he will address monographic systematic revisions of groups in two families of amphipods.  The award will also support the training of  graduate students in the systematics of Crustacea.   Databases will be developed for the specimens examined as well as interactive electronic identification keys.  These keys will be of value to people concerned with environmental quality because the amphipods that are the focus of this study inhabit subterranean waters and can serve as indicators of groundwater quality for the aquifers they inhabit.   The results of this research will contribute to our knowledge of an important element of Crustacean biodiversity.  New practicing systematists will be trained to assume research with these organisms in the future and practical electronic keys to species will be produced that should be of utility to researchers and managers concerned with monitoring water quality.",
