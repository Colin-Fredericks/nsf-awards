 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organization for Tropical Studies, Inc. (OTS) has three  biological field stations in Costa Rica that are used by a  broad spectrum of the international scientific community; La  Selva (wet lowland rainforest) is developed and well along  the way to achieving its training and research potential;  Palo Verde (seasonally dry lowland forest) is a diamond is  the rough with primitive facilities that have been stressed  beyond capabilities to service the demand -- so upgrading  activities are underway here; and Las Cruces (we mid-  elevation premontane rainforest) did lie somewhere between  the above two stations in terms of infrastructure, but  suffered a disastrous loss of buildings, equipment and  supplies when fire struck on the evening of November 23,  1994.    This loss has come at a particularly critical time in the  development of the Las Cruces station as it struggles to  accommodate the demand by courses and researchers,  particularly those interested in highly diverse mid-  elevation ecosystems that are most heavily preferred and  used by human populations.  The recent surge in activity by  conversation biologists, foresters, and agroecologists has  added a sustainable development dimension to the traditional  by systematists and ecologists.  Because of the importance  of this station on the regional, national, and international  scene, plans are underway to streamline and rebuild the  station.    This project will support activities to: 1) remodel an  existing house to replace some of the capacity that was lost  for accommodating groups of students and researchers; 2)  refurbish the general-purpose laboratory that survived the  fire; 3) construct a number of spatially separated buildings  to replace the balance of what was lost in the fire (viz.  long-term researcher housing, research laboratory, and a  general services building that will house the kitchen,  dining room, office, supply room and laundry); and 4)  replace the lost equipment and supplies.    Like the rise of the phoe nix from the ashes, Las Cruces has  taken this calamity as a challenge and is making the most of  a sad situation to develop a sound and frugal plan for its  resurrection.  OTS is seizing on this opportunity to tailor  the new facilities to the user's needs.",
