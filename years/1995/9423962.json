 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423962  Michaelson    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the  Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. David  Michaelson of the University of California in Los Angeles.  This fellowship opportunity will facilitate a collaborative  effort between Dr. Michaelson and the laboratory of Dr.  Yanagida of Kyoto University to explore a possible link  between the control of the yeast cell cycle and  intracellular signaling mechanisms. The purpose of this is  to understand how cell division is affected by the external  environment.    Dr. Yanagida's laboratory is well established in the field  of cell-cycle regulation. This provides Dr. Michaelson with  an ideal opportunity to study both cell-cycle regulation and  fission yeast genetics in one of the leading labs in the  field.  Furthermore, this collaboration provides a rare  opportunity to study the interaction between intracellular  signaling mechanisms and cell-cycle regulation. Since such  mechanisms also function to control cell proliferation and  differentiation in animals, this collaboration combines  Dr. Yanagida's expertise in yeast cell-cycle regulation with  Dr. Michaelson's interest in the regulation of proliferation  and differentiation of animal cells.  ***",
