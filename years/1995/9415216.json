 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thomas Keyes of Boston University is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on   normal mode analysis of the dynamical properties of supercooled liquids.    Normal mode analysis will be used to calculate the effect of internal   vibrations on self diffusion in carbon disulfide and in small alkanes,   vibrational dynamics and lifetimes of model diatomics in liquids, and   torsional barrier crossing rates in n-butane.  This methodology will also   be used to interpret the temperature dependence of vibrational lifetimes.      Keyes plans to develop a theory for femtosecond spectroscopy and   solvation dynamics.  Theoretical results will be compared with molecular   simulations and with experiment.  There are excellent theoretical models which explain the behavior and   properties of gas phase systems where the motion is chaotic, collisions   infrequent, and interactions are weak.  Theoretical models for the solid   state are also quite well developed since periodic order in crystalline   systems provides the necessary simplifications to lead to tractable   solutions.  The properties of liquids and supercooled liquids or glasses   still present quite a challenge to theoretical interpretation.  Keyes is   one of several theoretical chemists who is making significant headway on   developing a molecular interpretation of the physical and chemical   properties of liquids.  The long range impact of this work could be   significant in helping to understand chemistry in condensed phases.",
