The seminar  organizers are Steven Harrell, University of Washington, and Wu  Jingzhong, Sichuan Provincial Research Institute for Minority  Affairs.  The topic is the relationship between the Yi peoples of  Southwest China, a group numbering over six million, but little  known in the West, and their Han, Tibetan, and other neighbors.   Five Chinese, one American, and one Australian scholar have been  invited to prepare papers, which will be distributed in advance  and discussed at the seminar, which will be held on the  University of Washington campus from March 19-22, 1995.   In  addition to making scholarship on the Yi accessible to the  Western anthropological community, this seminar will also serve  to intensify the dialogue between Western anthropology and  Chinese ethnology, disciplines with a similar substantive focus  but widely differing methodological assumptions.  After the  seminar, revised  versions of the papers are expected to be  published in English in the U.S. and in Chinese in China.",
