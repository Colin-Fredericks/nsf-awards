 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9501022 Fehrlbach  Molten carbonate fuel cells are promising  as clean and efficient  sources of electricity---they have no  moving parts, make no noise  and produce no fumes. But the models  used to describe them are  deficient in certain aspects. The aim  of this research is to develop  and study improved mathematical  models for electrochemical fuel  cells, particularly molten  carbonate fuel cells.  The proposed work begins with the  formulation of phenomenological  models in terms of  electrochemical potentials derived  thermodynamically from the  various reaction mechanisms on the  microscale (the scale of the  electrode pore structure). These  microscale potential models  will be analyzed numerically and  analytically to determine what  results can be achieved on this small  scale. The equations will  also be used to derive consistent models in  terms of species  concentration. Both types of models will be averaged  to obtain  macroscale models which can be fit to experimental data. A   variety of averaging techniques will be considered in formulating   three- phase homogenized models to obtain a broad prospective on   the relationship between the microscale and the macroscale. An   important part of the work will be addressing questions of  interest to  the fuel cell research community and comparing the  models to  experimental results.",
