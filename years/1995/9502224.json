 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502224  Murray  This CAREER award emphasizes the use of two-degree-of-  freedom design techniques for generating nonlinear  controllers for mechanical systems performing motion control  tasks. Typical applications include high performance control  of piloted aircrafts using vectored thrust propulsion,  navigation and control of unmanned flight vehicles  performing surveillance and other tasks, motion control and  stabilization of underwater vehicles , and control of land  based robotic locomotion systems. The nonlinear controller  synthesis problem is initially separated into the design of  a feasible trajectory for the nominal model of the system,  followed by regulation around that trajectory using  controllers that have guaranteed performance in presence of  uncertainties. New methods are devised for quickly  generating suboptimal trajectories that accomplish a desired  control objective. Educational activities include  development of innovative curriculum in control and  dynamical systems, setting up experimental laboratories for  graduate and undergraduate teaching, and involving  undergraduate students in independent research-oriented  projects.***",
