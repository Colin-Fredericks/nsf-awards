 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program funds for three years the portion of the new  Distinguished Speakers Program of the National Association of  Geology Teachers (NAGT) aimed at enhancing the abilities of faculty  to teach undergraduate geology effectively and innovatively at both  introductory and upper levels.  While many visiting speaker  programs focus on research, the NAGT Distinguished Speakers Program  focuses on geoscience teaching and learning.  A visit by a NAGT  speaker will give faculty members in the host department an  opportunity to learn first-hand from an exemplary and enthusiastic  geoscience educator about innovative curricula and techniques that  work in the classroom, laboratory, and field.  Grant funds will  partially underwrite these faculty enhancement visits.  They  involve application to the NAGT Speakers Bureau (c/o Barbara  Tewksbury) outlining a list of desired speakers and the reasons for  interest in the host department.  If specific agreement is reached,  a visit of roughly two days including lectures, workshops, and  discussions is set up, and followup activities aimed at  facilitating the desired change are scheduled.  The program covers  most costs of the speaker; costs of local transportation, food,  lodging, and materials are borne by the host institution.",
