 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454375  Jaeger    This project is for ten years with a request for funding from NSF  for five of those years.  The project is a long term, collaborative  commitment to the schooling of a generation of people and  communities facing complex issues of human impact upon the  environment:  logging and forest health problems, rangeland  management decisions, endangered species restoration, regional  economic difficulties, and aesthetic and recreational needs of  public lands.  Designed to reach teachers of elementary and middle  school youth in the eastern region of Oregon, the enhancement grant  will provide institutes, extended studies, telecommunications, and  ongoing resources for educators as they study these issues and as  they provide analogous opportunities for their own students to  become problem solvers.    This project is designed to give 200 teachers and administrators in  eastern Oregon the background, practice and ongoing support to help  become classroom facilitators of Ecosystems Management problem  solving.  The first year will focus on Multimedia development,  recruitment, organization and arrangement for field sites, creation  of resources, and training of faculty and staff.  After the project  is in place, there will be summer institutes, year long follow-ups,  mini-sessions, evaluations, and research projects.     The project requested $1,249,325 from NSF with  institutions/agencies and school districts providing 27% in cost  sharing.",
