 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hierarchical persuasive messages advocate two strategies for coping with a stated problem, the primary recommendation touted as the best strategy and a secondary recommendation advocated as a contingency (\"Don't have sex -- but if you do, use a condom\"). Despite their increasing popularity in public health campaigns, little is known of the actual persuasive or behavioral impact of  hierarchical messages.  The specific aims of the proposed experiments are to assess the shortterm and longterm processing,   persuasive, judgmental, and behavioral intention consequences of hierarchical compared to simple (containing only one recommendation) persuasive messages.  The impact of receiving hierarchical and simple messages will be assessed as regards the general issue (for example, preventing sun-induced skin cancer), as well as the primary and secondary recommendations made, with particular concern for whether heirarchical messages strengthen or weaken the persuasive effetciveness of the primary (most effective) recommendation.       The spiraling cost of health care in this country is an issue of  both social and economic concern.  One simple fact is widely agreed upon: preventive behavioral change (changes that people make to increase the healthiness of their lifestyles) probably constitutes the most effective cost-cutting measure available. Behavioral scientists contribute to increases in preventive care by evaluating the effectiveness of health-related persuasive techniques designed to improve the general population's mental and physical health.  This program of research evaluates the effectiveness of hierarchical persuasive messages, which advocate two strategies for coping with a stated problem, the primary recommendation (touted as the best strategy) and a secondary recommendation (advocated as a contingency if the best strategy can't be achieved.  For example, the hierarchical message \"The best way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid exposing your skin to the sun.  If you must go out in the s un, use sunblock\" offers two solutions to avoidng skin cancer.  Despite their increasing popularity in public health campaigns, little is known of the actual persuasive or behavioral effectiveness of hierarchical messages.  The specific aims of the proposed experiments are to assess the shortterm and longterm persuasive impact of hierarchical messages on health-related attitudes and behavior, with particular concern for whether heirarchical messages strengthen or weaken the persuasive effectiveness of the primary (most effective) recommendation and thus unwittingly undermine public health.",
