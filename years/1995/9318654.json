 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) is a technology with  promising prospects for increasing the capacity of Wireless  Communications Networks (WCN's).  By employing low-cost arrays of  antennas and sophisticated signal processing techniques, SDMA  provides directional radio transmission and reception capabilities  which dramatically increase the number of simultaneous links that  can be supported on a single frequency channel.    The basic SDMA components - emitter location estimation, spatially  selective transmission and spatially selective reception - were  validated during the Phase I research effort by a series of half-  duplex receive-only and transmit-only experiments.  The proposed  Phase II effort is to build a fully functional,full-duplex, SDMA  prototype for analog cellular telephones (AMPS protocol).  This  prototype will be used for SDMA algorithm refinement and  development, and will serve as a data collection platform for SDMA  radio-frequency environment studies.  The Phase III effort will be  to conduct operational tests with the assistance of a cellular  service provider.    The market potential for a system that provides increased capacity  in wireless information/communication networks is immense.  Over  200 million domestic and foreign subscribers are predicted by the  year 2000 in a $100 billion annual market.  Current systems are at  or near capacity in a market which is one-fifth as large, so  techniques for increasing capacity are vital to the industry.",
