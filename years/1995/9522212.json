 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522212  WEISS   Anthropologists around the world possess in their laboratories small amounts of human tissue collected in surveys of human populations over the past several decades.  Widespread interest exists in a worldwide assessment of human variation, its amount, patterning and origins; an effort to collect data for this purpose, called the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) has been proposed.  For any such project, it will be important to have open-ended amounts of genomic DNA from worldwide samples, so that many investigators can analyze them extensively.   The purpose of this project is to address the need for amplifying an open-ended supply of representative genomic DNA from field-collected or archival samples at a low cost, that can be  undertaken by laboratories around the world.   The investigators propose to do systematic developmental work on an exploratory method for amplifying small amounts of  DNA.  The method (Adapter Attachment and Amplification-AAA) involves cutting genomic DNA in usefully long fragments and amplifying those fragments in a specific way so that the result is a mix containing as much of the original genome as possible.   If this method can be developed effectively, large quantities of DNA can be generated that are easy and inexpensive to work with and store.  This approach, if successful, can have a transforming effect on the sample design of the HGDP as well as other large-scale genetic surveys.",
