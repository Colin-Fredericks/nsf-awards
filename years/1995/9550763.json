 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines one community's efforts to reform local  education in light of the business critique of public schools.  the  research draws upon three distinct bodies of scholarship and  theory: the nature and process of school reform, the relationship  between workforce skills and economic productivity, and student  resistance to schooling.  Extending the principal investigator's  previous NSF funded study of these topics in one community,  Charlotte, North Carolina.  The study has three main goals: (1) to  identify the local labor force needs and to assess to what extent  the available workforce, especially noncollege-bound entry-level  workers, currently meets these needs; (2) to identify and describe  the actual reforms enacted in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school  District since the late 1980s and to evaluate the effects of the  reforms with particular attention to the business critique of  schooling vis-a-vis workforce preparation, any overall improvement  in educational quality, and the educational equity effects of the  reforms for diverse populations of students in the district; and  (3) to assess adolescents' awareness of the labor force  opportunities which await them and to model ho these perceptions  shape their high school performance.  the significance of this  research lies in its uniqueness.  since the 1980s, the vocal and  active business community has articulated its concerns that schools  remedy this situation.  since then the Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Schools have undergone massive restructuring  No other study of  business-inspired school reform has holistically examined  restructuring, through the reform process, to an assessment of the  outcomes of the reforms.  Moreover, rarely does any analysis of  reforms as to their view of the relationship between schooling and  work and the role these perceptions play in their high school  performance.  thus, Charlotte can serve as a strategic site or a  critical case study for an exploration of these issues.",
