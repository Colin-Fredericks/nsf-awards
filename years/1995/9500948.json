 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS_9500948 Strogatz  The proposal is to study the nonlinear  dynamics of oscillator arrays, using mathematical methods of  dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, and perturbation  theory, along with numerical simulation. One project concerns  arrays of superconducting Josephson junctions, and will be  carried out in collaboration with an experimental group at MIT.  This work is aimed at understanding the phase-locking properties  of series arrays; the propagation and instabilities of kinks in  one-dimensional parallel arrays; and the behavior of vortices and  row-switched states in two-dimensional arrays. A second project  (in collaboration with an experimental group at Georgia Tech)  will address the dynamics of laser arrays. Areas of investigation  will include phase-locking in slightly detuned laser arrays;  controlling chaos in laser arrays; and mutual synchronization of  chaotic lasers, with possible applications to private  communication.  The Principal Investigator and his experimental  collaborators will study the dynamics of superconducting  Josephson arrays and laser arrays. Josephson arrays can be used  as very sensitive detectors of magnetic fields (with biomedical  and astronomical applications), voltage standards, power  generators at submillimeter wavelengths (a part of the spectrum  that is difficult to access by other technologies), and as  ultrafast switching devices and transmission lines. All of these  technologies would benefit from a deeper mathematical  understanding of synchronization and vortex propagation in  Josephson arrays. The goals of the laser array project are to  find methods for improving the phase-locking characteristics of  laser arrays (to increase their power output), and to develop  novel encryption schemes for private communications, based on  mutual synchronization of chaotic lasers.",
