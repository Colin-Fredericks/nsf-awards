 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501099  Bao       The goal of this proposal is to develop analytic techniques  and computational methods for solving inverse and optimal design  problems in diffractive optics and wave propagation. The main  topics of the proposed work are as follows: stability analysis  for inverse scattering problems in diffractive optics, optimal  surface design problems, direct modeling of scattering and  diffraction in complicated nonlinear optical materials, study of  surface enhanced nonlinear optical effects, and regularity  analysis of inverse problems in several dimensional wave  propagation.       Diffractive optics is an emerging technology with many  applications. The practical applications of diffractive optics  technology have driven the need for both rigorous mathematical  models and numerical algorithms to describe the diffraction of  complicated grating structures, to compute the electromagnetic  vector fields and to predict the performance of any given  structure, and to carry out optimal design of new structures. The  theory and algorithms help, for example, with the design and  fabrication of new and efficient gratings and optical lenses. The  work concerning inverse problems in wave propagation can be used  to deduce the interior mechanical properties of the earth from  the measured boundary data generated by an energy source. This  problem arises naturally from reflection seismology, oil and gas  exploration, ground-penetrating radar, and many other physical  problems.",
