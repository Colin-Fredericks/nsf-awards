 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of electronic telecommunications has experienced  explosive growth in the past ten years, both in terms of its  commercial importance and in terms of the research effort devoted  to it in academic and industrial laboratories.  It appears likely  that radio-based digital communications will play a much larger  role than might have been anticipated, complementing data  communications on wire pairs with fiber media coming into increased  use for data communications backbones.    As in the past, the utilization of VLSI technology to reduce the  cost of electronics associated with such systems will be critical.   This research is directed at exploring new ways to use silicon  integrated circuit technology to improve the performance, reduce  the power dissipation, and reduce the cost of components for  communication systems of various kinds, with primary emphasis on  data communications and Personal Communications Systems (PCS) using  radio and free-space optical media.  Particular emphasis is placed  on circuit techniques applicable to implementation of RF, IF and  baseband mixed signal communications circuits with low power and  low operating voltage.    The primary goal of this research is to discover, optimize, and  demonstrate new circuit approaches which allow the implementation  of such systems with levels of power dissipation and performance  which more closely approach the fundamental limits imposed by the  basic technology being used than current approaches.  The general  area of interest if RF transceivers for RF LANs ald personal  communications devices, and transceivers for fiber-optic systems  and wire-based systems.  Specific topics for investigation are  limits-to-phase noise performance in power-optimized monolithic  voltage-controlled oscillators, investigation of new parallel-  architecture sampling demodulators, limits-to-distortion  performance in MOS sampling demodulators, the use of passive-  sampling FIR switched capacitor filters for low-power, high-  frequency filte ring and CDMA despreading, optimization of the  sensitivity in fiber optic communication receivers, the application  of BiCMOS technology for the particular needs of high-speed  communications, and modeling of active and passive IC components  for RF design.",
