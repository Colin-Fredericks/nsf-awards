The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  tisit by Dr. Beryl A. Hoffman to work with Dr. Elisabet  Engdahl at the Centre for Cognitive Science in Edinburgh,  Scotland.    This project will involve the investigation of the use of  prosody and word order variation as strategies to express  the information structure of a sentence that describes how a  sentence relates to its context.  The PI will concentrate on  modelling the data in Turkish and investigate the cross-  linguistic generalizations that can be made in other  relatively free word order languages such as German and in  fixed word order languages such as English.  She will  include implementations that can be integrated into a  Turkish/English machine translation system.  The proper use  of prosody and word order variation is of considerable  importance in developing practical applications in machine  translation and speech generation.  Machine translation  systems, especially those including spoken language  generation are a very active area of research in Europe,  such as the recent ESPRIT POLYGLOT project. ***",
