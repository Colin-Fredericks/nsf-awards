 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peckham       A periodically forced oscillator is a prototypical example of  a nonlinear mathematical model that is used to explain past  behavior and predict future behavior of physical, chemical, and  ecological systems.  The investigator continues studies of  two-parameter families of maps of the plane that are generated by  periodically forced oscillator systems.  The broad goal is to  understand the qualitative behavior of these systems and how that  behavior changes, or \"bifurcates,\" as parameters in the models are  varied.  The project focuses on discrete dynamical systems rather  than differential equations.  It aims to explain parameter space  phenomena as projections of \"more natural\" objects in the  cartesian product of the phase and parameter spaces.  The project  includes further development of tools for \"local\" bifurcation  phenomena, such as the birth of periodic orbits, but concentrates  mostly on extending existing tools and results for local phenomena  to analogous tools and results for \"global\" phenomena, such as the  birth of homoclinic orbits.  Study involves software development,  numerical simulation, and analysis of both the numerics and the  mathematics of global bifurcations.  The project enables a more  complete understanding of a wide variety of bifurcation problems,  including periodically forced oscillators.  It also provides tools  for a more automatic bifurcation study of other families of  discrete dynamical systems.       The investigator continues studying a prototypical class of  systems that is used to model a variety of physical, chemical, and  ecological systems.  The goal of the project is to study changes,  or \"bifurcations,\" in the qualitative behavior of these systems as  parameters are changed.  For example, the number of hunting  licenses issued could be a parameter in a mathematical model of an  ecosystem.  There might be a critical number of licenses below  which deer would survive, and above which the deer would die out.  This critical number would  be called a bifurcation value of the  parameter.  An incredibly complex scenario of bifurcations is  possible, even for models that are described by very simple  mathematical formulas.  Hence, some level of numerical  investigation is absolutely necessary.  The project includes  software development, numerical simulation, and analysis of both  the numerics and the mathematics of the bifurcations involved.  The  project enables a more complete understanding of a wide variety of  models.  This leads to a better understanding the past and a better  chance of predicting the future of systems behaving like these  models, as well as for many other seemingly unrelated systems.",
