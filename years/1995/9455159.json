 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) will operate a coordinated series of  workshops for undergraduate faculty in the sciences and mathematics  during each year 1995 and 1996.  These workshops on Program that  Work, each involving approximately 20 three-person institutional  participant teams, will emphasize classroom and laboratory  enhancements in undergraduate science and mathematics.      The objectives for these PKAL Workshops are 1) to disseminate  information on current reform efforts in teaching undergraduate  science and mathematics, reforms that have created systemic change  within an institution and as well as improved one course; 2) to  encourage regional and national networks of faculty concerned with  curriculum reform; 3) to foster a national environment which  supports improvements in undergraduate science and mathematics.    The Workshops will focus on eight issues:  Revitalizing  Introductory Courses in 1) Biology, 2) Chemistry, 3) Mathematics  and 4) Physics; 5) Science as a Liberal Art; 6) Interdisciplinary  Programs; 7) The Research-based Curriculum, and 8) Programs for  Minority Student Success.  Each issue, to be presented in a series  of workshops, will be coordinated by a Workshop Advisory Board and  issues Task Forces, individuals selected on the basis of their  leadership in PKAL, their involvement with a PKAL Program that  Works, and the recognition of their work by the community.",
