 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507539  Newton  The Tenth International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation will  be held in St. Petersburg, Russia from May 28 to June 3,  1995.  Nitrogen fixation is one of the most important  subject areas relating to the support of life on Earth and  encompasses concerns related to natural resource  conservation, particularly fossil fuels, plant-microbe  signalling and interaction, regulatory mechanisms,  nutrition, food production, etc.  This Congress is the  single most important meeting for the scientific field.  Participants from over 30 different countries are expected  to attend.  The topics to be discussed will include  virtually all aspects of biological and non-biological  nitrogen fixation, including the following major symposia:    I    Chemistry and Biochemistry of Nitrogenase  II   Genetics and Regulation of Nitrogen Fixation  III  Signalling Processes in Plant-Microbe Interactions  IV  Structure and Evolution of the Nodule Bacterial Genome  V   Plant Response in Symbiosis  VI  Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Metabolism  VII Agricultural and Ecological Aspect of Nitrogen Fixation    Of the 77 scientists who have been invited to participate in  the Congress, 20 are from the United States.  The award will  support travel for approximately 10 graduate students who  are the recipient of the Russian grants to cover in-Russia  expenses.  It will also be used to support the travel of  younger U.S. scientists, women and minorities who attend the  Congress.",
