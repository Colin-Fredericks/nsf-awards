 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a request for core DNA sequencing instrumentation to  serve a group of active, federally-funded research faculty  and several training programs.  The instrumentation will  include a DNA sequencer and several supporting items,  including an oligonucleotide synthesizer, thermal cyclers, a  plasmid preparation device, a fluorometer, and networked  computer equipment and software for DNA sequence analysis.  The facility will serve several laboratories where DNA  sequencing is an integral part of active research projects,  and will also serve as a site for genomic study through  automated RFLP analysis.  An additional utility of the  facility will be its proximity to a biotechnology teaching  laboratory, where undergraduate and graduate level classes  will have the opportunity to train on the equipment.  This  teaching laboratory is also the site of our NSF summer  program in biotechnology for college faculty, who would  likewise benefit from the training opportunity.    The Newark campus of Rutgers University is a unique research  center combing a small but focused research community with a  strong commitment to undergraduate, graduate and  particularly minority education.  We have added over 25 new  research faculty to the campus in the last 10 years.  These  new faculty have all successfully competed for federal  funding of their research and have also worked together to  improve the educational opportunities on campus.  This is  demonstrated by our extensive grant-funded educational  programs, including:  NIH Minority Biomedical Research  Support, NIH Bridges to Baccalaureate Program Award, NSF  Computers in Education, NSF Summer Programs, and the Howard  Hughes Medical Institute Initiative for Undergraduate  Science Program.    The addition of this core DNA sequencing facility will  significantly enhance our faculty's ability to compete for  future funding both in research and education.  It will  facilitate our simple sequencing needs and help us to  attract proposed new faculty in the  filed of molecular  evolution.",
