 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522200  Winick  The current trend in optical communication systems is towards  higher bit rates and longer distances, where fiber chromatic  dispersion becomes a performance limiting factor.  For example at  1.55 micron with a 20 ps gaussian pulse will expand to 60 ps after  propagating through only 17 km of fiber.  Recently passive optical  components have been fabricated to compensate for these pulse  spreading effects.  The design and fabrication of more complex,  grating-based, waveguide filters remains an area of active  research.    As part of this proposal, new classes of planar optical waveguide  devices will be developed in glass and lithium niobate.  Both  active and passive devices will be considered.  These will include  miniature, erbium-ytterbium co-doped, single frequency lasers,  chromium-based vibronic, lithium niobate waveguide lasers, and  grating-based, waveguide filters, such as dispersion compensators.   The research on chromium-doped vibronic lasers is particularly  significant, since it offers the possibility of producing  integrated, broadly tunable (or ultrashort pulsed) sources.   Related technologies such as dual frequency, distributed Bragg  reflector lasers, second harmonic generation in poled fused silica  waveguides, and the elimination of spatial hole burning effects in  rare earth-doped glasses will also be explored.  ***",
