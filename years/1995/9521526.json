 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521526  Petersen   Among the thousands of species of fungi worldwide, the larger basidiomycetes with often conspicuous fruiting bodies, the mushrooms and puffballs for example, are comparatively well known.  Still, their classification rests upon geographically constrained treatments (by region or by political entity), frequently with consequent duplication of scientific names, and with reliance often placed upon morphological features that are subject to environmental modification and hence prove unstable.  Dr. Ronald Petersen at the University of Tennessee has assembled a team of colleagues and contributors to study several groups of fungi in the orders Agaricales and Aphyllophorales from a worldwide perspective, and by employing several lines of evidence for taxonomic resolution and phylogenetic analysis.  These are to include traditional morphological characters (with contributions from such colleagues as Dr. Scott Redhead in Canada and Dr. Egon Horak in Switzerland); new molecular tools in protein electrophoresis and DNA sequencing (with colleague Dr. Karen Hughes); laboratory culturing and mating trials, to assess compatibility reactions among closely related species; and all these to be pursued through the use of existing herbarium collections and new collections assembled from extensive field collecting in various regions.  Primary emphasis will be given to monographic treatments of the genera Clavicorona, Flammulina, and Lentinellus.   Training of graduate and postdoctoral students entails courses and seminars, extensive laboratory and museum work, and field collecting in the U.S. and usually abroad as well.  Computerization of many aspects of the monographic endeavor, including specimen databasing, morphological and molecular evaluations, and construction of identification keys, will enhance the dissemination of results through the University's World Wide Web server.",
