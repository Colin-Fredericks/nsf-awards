 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics Department is standardizing its departmental  efforts around the computer algebra system MATHEMATICA and  extending use of its computer laboratory to courses in  differential equations, linear algebra, mathematical modeling,  and other appropriate offerings.  The objective of the project is  that mathematics majors be thoughtful and creative users of  MATHEMATICA both to enhance their course learning and to promote  effective application of technology throughout their scientific  careers.       To achieve this goal the univeristy plans to use, refine,  and test existing laboratory materials and to continue the  development of its own course module materials.  The university  anticipates that these materials will have wide national  circulation.  Equipment needs include (1) 15 Power Macintosh  computers for mathematics computer laboratories, (2) 3 Power  Macintosh computers for the Mathematics Resource Center, (3)  computing and display equipment in two classrooms for class  demonstrations, and (4) compatible computing equipment in three  faculty offices to facilitate one-on-one interaction between  faculty and students.  This equipment is networked to provide a  maximally supportive environment for development and use of  materials in appropriate mathematics courses.",
