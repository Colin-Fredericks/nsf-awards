Take the special case  where the variety with action is a representation.  It is still  an open question whether there are non-trivial equivariant vector  bundles over representations.  The answer depends on the group,  and there are many groups for which the answer is unknown.  The  project will extend the list of groups where the answer is known  and, when non-trivial vector bundles exist, it is intended to  develop a conceptual lower bound for the isomorphism classes of  bundles with base a representation.  Such results will have  applications for algebraic actions on affine space.  The other  object of study is the Abyhankar-Moh Problem: Let f be a  polynomial in n complex variables for which f=1 is isomorphic to  complex (n-1)-space.  Is there an automorphism of affine n-space  which when composed with f, is a linear function?  The answer is  known for n=2 and unknown for higher n.       Here is a little motivation and a layman's description of  one of the above problems, the Abyhankar-Moh Problem.  It fits  into one of the main problem areas of pure and applied  mathematics.  Given two functions of n variables, when can one be  transformed into the other by a change of variables (automorphism  of n-space)? To explain what this means and motivate the problem,  consider the two functions of two variables x and y: f(x,y)=x and  h(x,y)=x+yy.  The set of points where f(x,y)=1, i.e. x=1, and the  set of points where h(x,y)=1, i.e. x+yy=1, both represent an  infinite wire in the x,y-plane.  The first is a line, and the  second is the parabola x+yy=1.  The fact that each of these two  sets represents an infinite wire in the plane is expressed  mathematically by the fact that there is a change of coordinates  in the plane which transforms f into h.   The change of  coordinates x'=x+yy, y'=y transforms f to h, as one sees  from f(x',y')=f(x+yy,y)=x+yy=h(x,y).  An electrician who had to  sever a connection by cutting the wires would in each case have  one wire to cut.  Contrast that to the set defined by  g(x,y)=xx=1.  That set consists of two infinite wires represented  by the lines x=1 and x=-1.  In this case an electrician wishing  to sever the connection represented by the set g(x,y)=1 would  have to cut two wires; so the situations are not physically the  same.  This is explained mathematically by the fact that there is  no change of coordinates of two-space which transforms f (or h)  to g.  The Abyhankar-Moh Problem fits into this setting.  In  these terms the problem is expressed as: Given two functions f  and h of n variables with the property that the sets f=1 and h=1  are ``isomorphic'' to (n-1)-space, is there a change of  coordinates of n-space which transforms f to h?  The above  discussion illustrates the case n=2, and the answer is known to  be \"yes\" in that case, but it is unknown for other values of n.  ***",
