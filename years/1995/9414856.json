The reason for this is that  scientists and engineers usually solve nonlinear problems by  reducing them to a sequence of linear problems.  Thus  considerable attention has been devoted to the development  of efficient methods for solving problems in linear algebra  on computers.     Within the last ten years, the advent of parallel  processing has resulted in enormous additional growth in  research into numerical linear algebra, since many of the  methods used on conventional computers are inefficient when  used on parallel machines. As a consequence of this growth  in research, it is extremely difficult for researchers and  students to keep abreast of the state of the art. Thus there  is a great need for someone to provide a comprehensive view  of the current state of the art and anticipated future  developments.  This comprehensive view is especially important now because  there is a fairly clear consensus about architectures for  parallel machines and an emerging consensus about many  issues related to software.     In order to provide such a comprehensive view of parallel  numerical linear algebra and to stimulate further research  into the field, an NSF/CBMS Regional Conference will be held  at the University of San Francisco during the week of June  12, 1995, with Professor James W. Demmel as the principal  lecturer.     Professor Demmel will begin by discussing parallel  architectures and parallel software. He will continue with a  discussion of parallel algorithms for dense matrices. This  will include a discussion of parallel algorithms for matrix  multiplication, Gaussian elimination, the solution of least  squares problems and the calculation of eigenvalues and  eigenvectors. He will also lecture on parallel algorithms  for sparse ma trices. These lectures will cover direct and  iterative methods; they will discuss algorithms for  partitioning  sparse matrices, Cholesky factorization, GMRES, QMR, and the  Lanczos  and Arnoldi methods.     Professor Demmel's lectures will be supplemented by  lectures by several other specialists in the field. These  supplementary lectures will cover multifrontal methods for  matrix factorization, domain decomposition methods, parallel  finite elements, graph partitioning, and applications.",
