 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455570  Chapman  The UCLA Science Challenge began in 1991 as a five-year program  with a mission to bring innovative, research-level instruction to  undergraduates, particularly lower division students in order to  retain lower-division science majors, recruit new science majors,  attract more minority students to science, and to improve student  attitudes toward science. The goal is to infuse every lower  division course in the physical sciences with new material and to  create new interdisciplinary courses that reflect the breadth and  overlap of the physical and life science disciplines. As we enter  the fourth year of the program, we are on target to meet our  charge.  During the first half of the project, we primarily  attacked both the largest general education classes in the  division, the Astronomy and Atmospheric Science courses, which  collectively enroll 8000 non-science majors each year, and also  courses for the physical science majors in Chemistry and Physics.  Our major focus now will be on the Physics course for Life  Science majors. Our minor focus, for the enormous General  Chemistry course that all Life Science and Physical Science  majors must take, will concentrate on modules that allow students  to visualize 3-dimensional molecular and crystalline structures.  We will keep a small presence in the Earth and Space Science  department, in Astronomy, and in Atmospheric Science in order to  maintain the coherence of the renovation of the Physical Sciences  at UCLA and to fulfill our commitment to complete the modules  which these departments have begun.",
