 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554504  Barstow    Over the past two decades, technology has dramatically advanced the  ability of scientists to use geographic visualizations to explore,  learn and communicate about the geosciences. These advances include  the vast amounts of data and images derived from remote-sensing  instruments on satellites, the direct observations and photographs  taken by astronauts, and the development of new computer-based  tools to display, manipulate and analyze the data and images. These  developments have truly revolutionized how scientists investigate  Earth.     We believe that these rich resources of data, images and software  tools have a similar potential to revolutionize Earth science  education, by enabling students to directly observe, explore,  investigate and visualize fundamental concepts in Earth science in  ways that have never before been possible in a school environment.  These dynamic visualizations will enable students to gain a deeper  understanding of key concepts in Earth science, and will enable  Earth science educators to reach a broader range of students,  including those who are not currently inclined towards science.    Capitalizing on this power depends upon developing a deeper  understanding of the ways in which students make sense of  geographic images in technology-rich learning environments. In this  project, we will develop the knowledge base through research and  development in three areas:       *Technology -- reviewing the vast array of data sources to  identify those with the greatest potential for educational use, and  adapting software tools for accessing, displaying and manipulating  the data, to make them easy and inexpensive enough for school use.       *Cognitive Research -- better understanding how geographic  visualizations can help students learn, how technology impacts  these visualizations, and how students differ in their development  of the underlying skills of spatial, logical and symbolic thinking       *Curriculum Models -- developing sample curr icula, and  exploring instructional approaches and learning environments to  better understand how to help students tap into the learning power  of these resources.    Three research projects which will provide a context for the  integration of this technology development, cognitive research, and  exploration of curriculum models:       #1 -- \"My State From Space\" -- an introductory unit on  satellites, remote-sensing and geographic visualizations, which  will help us explore students' initial responses to these tools and  resources, with a special focus on the students' local environment.       #2 -- \"Visualizing Weather\" -- providing students will access  to current weather data and images for them to interpret and make  forecasts; with a cognitive research focus on how students  integrate multiple representations and how this can be used to  develop higher order thinking skills.         #3 -- \"Engines of Change -- Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plate  Tectonics\" -- an investigation into how best to convey concepts of  plate tectonics, with a cognitive research focus on understanding  the development of increasingly complex visualization skills, and  a technology focus on advanced tools of data overlaying and 3-  dimensional rotations.    This work will be done as a collaboration among four organizations:  TERC (Daniel Barstow, Principal Investigator) with expertise in  technology and curriculum development; UCSD (Dr. Sally Ride and Dr.  Randall Souviney, Co-Investigators) with expertise in remote-  sensing and Earth Science Education; SDSU (Dr. Eric Frost, Co-  Investigator) with expertise in geographic visualizations; and Penn  State (Dr. Lynn Liben, Co-Investigator) with expertise in cognitive  development and geographic information systems.     This result of this research will be a better understanding of how  these rich resources of geographic data, images and software tools  can be most effectively used in education, a deeper understanding  of the related cognitive issues, and a set of sof tware tools and  prototype curricula which demonstrate the educational power of  technology-enhanced geographic visualizations.  ****",
