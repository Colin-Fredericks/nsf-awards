 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for a Packard InstantImager Electronic  Autoradiography System which electronically locates and measures  radioactivity directly on gels, blots, thin layer chromatography,  tissue slices, or any other flat samples up to 20 X 24 cm2. This  instrument will directly measure in real time disintegrations  eliminating the need for either X-ray film or storage phosphor screens.    The Boston University biochemistry department is a large multifaceted  teaching and research department. Most members perform basic research  in molecular and/or cellular biochemistry. Usually this research  requires radiolabeling techniques in order to detect small amounts of  biologically relevant molecules. Radiolabeled proteins, RNA, DNA and  lipids are often separated by gel electrophoresis or thin layer  chromatography and visualized by autoradiography using X-ray film.  X-ray film autoradiography has distinct disadvantages such as low  sensitivity and small linear range making quantitative analysis  difficult and laborious. Typically, samples need to be exposed  overnight or longer. Often multiple exposures are necessary in order to  detect both high and low abundant molecules on the same gel. Most  researchers, when quantitation is critical, remove radiolabeled  material from solid supports in order to measure disintegration using a  scintillation counter after visualization by X-ray film. Recent  advances in technology are making alternate instruments available to  locate and directly measure radioactivity on flat samples with more  sensitivity in far less time. The instrument will help research efforts  and will be used in several courses as an instrument to teach  essentials regarding radioactivity measurements.",
