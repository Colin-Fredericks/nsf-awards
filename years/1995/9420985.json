The research proposed  here will develop the first invertebrate model of a  biparental organism for studying the behavioral and hormonal  mechanisms that regulate reproductive behavior.  Blood  levels of juvenile hormone will be determined and correlated  with detailed changes in parental behavior.  Topical  application of juvenile hormone will be used to test the  hypothesis that increased male parental effort will increase  the rate of larval development and lead to a decrease in  parental effort by the male's partner.  Hormone levels will  also be measured during competitive interactions between two  females to test the hypothesis that contests for the  breeding resource result in elevated levels of juvenile  hormone.  Furthermore, Juvenile hormone will be administered  to subordinate females during competition for resources to  examine hormonal influences on dominance, reproductive  output and parental contributions to broods of mixed  parentage.  This study will be based on an already thorough  understanding of behavioral variation in the animals in a  natural ecological context.  The ability to integrate  behavioral and physiological analyses in a group amenable to  experimental manipulation will contribute to a broader  understanding of the flexibility of reproductive behavior.  The proposed project promises to advance our understanding  of how complex sequences of behavior are organized, and how  behavioral flexibility contributes to effective parental  care.",
