The arctic shelves are critical areas for the  flux of water and ice that modulate the global climate and those  fluxes are controlled partly by the freshwater runoff into the  Arctic Ocean.  A workshop of U.S. scientists will be convened to  write a science plan for implementation of a global change research  program addressing human adaptions and land-shelf biogeochemical  fluxes in the Russian arctic.  The science plan will be presented  at a second workshop in Russia in order to achieve a consensus with  Russian scientists on the research priorities that may be achieved  in a collaborative, international research program.  The  collaborative research program resulting from these workshops will  facilitate access for U.S. scientists to a vast part of the  circumarctic that has previously been inaccessible to western  researchers studying global change processes.",
