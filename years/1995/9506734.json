Furuya, Seismology and Volcanology  Research Department, Japan Meteorological Research  Institute. Project funding will enable Dr. Linde to spend  twelve months in Japan, resident at the Japan Meteorological  Research Institute, in order to study crustal deformation  data recorded by a network of borehole strainmeters  operating in south-east Honshu, Japan. Close collaboration  with scientists at the Japan Meteorological Research  Institute will allow combined studies of these unique data  sets for several different tectonically active regions. Such  studies are expected to yield new insights into these major  tectonic processes.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of volcanic eruptions and  earthquakes. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to  become familiar with research techniques, data, equipment,  and facilities at the Japan Meteorological Research  Institute while contributing to the overall research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international collaboration.  ***",
