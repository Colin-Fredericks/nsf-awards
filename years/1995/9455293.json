 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing an introductory astronomy course  whose  primary goals will be (1) to develop quantitative reasoning  skills and independence in problem solving; (2) to expose  students to the scientific use of computers; (3) to  inculcate an  understanding of the power and limitations of experimental  data;  (4) to develop critical thinking through scientific writing;  and  (5) to build on the appeal of astronomy to attract and  retain  more science majors. The approach emphasizes hands-on  problem  solving experience gained by working on projects built  around a  few themes, rather than the more passive learning inherent  in  delivery of a comprehensive body of material by a single  professor in a traditional lecture setting. Students will be  active participants in the classroom both collectively,  through  critical discussions of project goals, experimental  techniques  and analysis, and individually, through use of interactive  software packages.    The project makes extensive use of the MOSAIC hypermedia  environment in developing software modules for the course,  and  eventually these modules will be available to colleagues at  other  institutions via the Internet. The course materials are  being  developed by a team of senior faculty and graduate students.  The  team approach benefits not only the undergraduates who are  enrolled in the class, but also the graduate students who  are  provided with a mentored experience in designing courses and  curricular materials, and thus a valuable introduction to  teaching. An introductory course based on these goals and  following this format will prove more successful than  traditional  classroom techniques in sustaining student interest in  science  and providing them with the basic skills they will need to  understand, address, and solve technically complex problems  throughout their lifetimes.",
