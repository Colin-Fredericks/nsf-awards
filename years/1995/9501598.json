 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, John Fourkas of   Boston College will use ultrafast nonlinear optical techniques to probe   intermolecular interactions in pure liquids and solutions subjected to   confinement in microporous glasses or maintained in a non-equilibrium   state of sustained tension.  Transient Grating Optical Kerr Effect   studies will probe the reorientational diffusion rates  in these systems,   providing information on the local structure of the liquid.  This   structure will be sensitive to attractive forces such as hydrogen bonding   and hydrophobic forces such as those caused by ionic solutes.  These   forces are involved in a wide variety of processes including protein   folding and bubble coalescence.  The educational component of this   program involves designing an outreach program to provide science   demonstrations at schools and seminars for grade school teachers,   designing undergraduate chemistry experiments involving contemporary   research problems, and developing courses in communications skills in the   graduate curriculum.  The local organization of molecules in liquids, water in particular, is   responsible for many solution phase properties.  Forces such as hydrogen   bonding have a large impact on the way molecules behave when dissolved in   water.  Professor Fourkas will study the nature of these forces and the   effects that dissolved molecules have on this local order.  These studies   will provide information which can be applied to  areas such as   understanding protein folding and the binding of molecules to enzymes.",
