 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501148  Auchmuty    This project will involve the investigation of a number of  problems in   classical field theories, quantum chemistry, and the theory of  rotating self-  gravitating fluids.  Each of these problems involves non-standard    variational principles and it is intended to develop the  requisite variational   analysis and in some cases also look at numerical problems  involved in the   simulation of solutions.  These problems often are non-convex and  special   efforts will be devoted to studying certain duality theories and  dual   problems for these principles.    Under this project, the investigator plans to develop new methods  for   describing fields in various classical continuum theories.  This  will answer   some foundational questions in fluid mechanics, electromagnetic  field   theory and some areas of materials science.  It is also planned  to investigate   the theory of Hartree-Fock models which are basic models in  quantum   chemistry and also some hydrodynamical models of planets and  stars.  For   these problems, the major interest is in developing good  numerical   algorithms for simulating solutions.  The proposed algorithms are  based on   control theoretic ideas and appear to be both more stable and  much more   efficient than the methods currently being used for simulation of  these   problems.",
