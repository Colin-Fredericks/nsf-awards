 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424079  As host institution, Lehigh University will offer ten  undergraduates a summer research experience in freshwater  ecology at the Lacawac Sanctuary in NE Pennsylvania.  Students will be recruited broadly from many institutions,  with special effort to include minority students.  The  program will be an expansion and intensification of an  existing internship program offered since 1988 through  Lehigh's Pocono Comparative Lakes Program.  Financial  support will go mainly to student stipends and housing  costs.  The program will involve a complete research  experience--including independent study at the student's  home institution--to consist of proposal development,  research design, summer research, data analysis and database  documentation, and oral and written reports.  Research  topics will closely tie-in to projects of a series of  designated potential summer mentors, who have on-going  studies at the field site.  This will ensure that students  are exposed to current issues in ecological research, and to  modern techniques and equipment. Particular emphasis will be  paid to instructing students in effective standards for  recording and documenting data and in ethical issues  encountered in scientific research, such as questions of  ownership of data from publicly funded research and ultimate  authorship of publications.  Through weekly meetings with  mentors, research seminars, recreational opportunities, and  the natural history and conservation program of the Lacawac  Sanctuary itself, interns will receive a broad appreciation  of the role of scientific research in the broader scheme of  environmental conservation.",
