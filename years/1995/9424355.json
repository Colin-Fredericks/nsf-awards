 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424355  Wu    In  this  research we investigate statistical properties of a  passive  scalar  coupled to a two-dimensional (2D) fluctuating velocity  field.  The  experimental object is a free-standing soap film which is  driven  by  a  2D Couette cell.  The 2D Couette cell, which has recently  been  developed  in  our laboratory, allows precise control of  hydrodynamic  flow  and  characterization of various flow instabilities.  Our  early  experiments  have  shown  that  a driven  soap  film  exhibits  strong  spatiotemporal  fluctuations in its thickness.  A  simple  calculation  suggests  that  these fluctuations can be treated as a passive  scalar  and  that the viscous-\"diffusion\" subrange is extensive due to a sharp  cutoff  at  small  length scales.  We intend to measure  the  spectral  density of the fluctuations as a function of wavenumber using a  real-  space imaging technique.  In addition, the spatiotemporal fluctuations  of  the  velocity  field will be measured using a novel  fiber-optical  velocimeter.   We wish to establish correlations between the  spectral  densities  of  the velocity field and the passive thickness  field  in  flows with different degrees of stochastic components.  %%%  Two-dimensional  (2D)  hydrodynamics and  instabilities  have  largely  remained domains for theoretical and computational analysis.  However,  the subject has great importance for meteorology, oceanography, and  a  variety of laboratory experiments.  This research is geared toward  an  understanding  of  a  passive scalar, such  as  dyes  or  temperature,  convected  by  an  imposed fluctuating velocity  distribution  in  two  dimensions.   Our previous experiments have shown that a free-standing  soap  film  behaves  like  a 2D fluid, and the  fluctuations  in  film  thickness  are  influenced  by  the  spatiotemporal  behavior  of  the  velocity  distribution.  A simple theoretical analysis indicates  that  if  the  fluctuations in the thickness are much less than the  average  thickn ess,  then the fluctuations can be treated as a  passive  scalar  quantity.    We  will  use  a  video  imaging  technique  to   extract  statistical  properties of the film thickness in space  and  time  and  correlate  them  with  the  imposed 2D  velocity  distribution.   This  research   will  enrich  our  general  knowledge  about   hydrodynamic  fluctuations in two dimensions and help to refine theoretical models.  ***",
