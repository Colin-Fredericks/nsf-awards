 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to establish a Biomolecular NMR Center in  Cornell's Biotechnology Building  through acquisition of a state-of-the-art 600 MHz high  resolution multinuclear NMR spectrometer, to be dedicated  for research and training in structural biology. The  interdisciplinary biophysics program at Cornell is highly  committed to studies of macromolecular structure. This group  has established internationally recognized facilities and  faculty for X-ray crystallography, theoretical/computational  studies of acromolecular structure and dynamics, and  biochemical and molecular genetic studies of protein  function. The proposed 600 MHz NMR spectrometer will  complement existing resources by        providing  capabilities for solution studies of structure and dynamics.  A single 500 MHz NMR spectrometer which is not equipped with  the latest technological advances (e.g. fourth radio  frequency channel, XYZ pulsed field gradient amplifiers and  probes, 10 mm triple resonance probe and enhanced room  temperature shims) is housed in Cornell's Chemistry NMR  Facility. This machine is routinely booked to full capacity  with an extensive user base composed of both \"small  molecule\" and  \"macromolecule\" users. Past progress in  solution NMR studies of proteins at Cornell has occurred  largely through utilization of outside resources either in  the laboratories of collaborators or at public facilities.  Over the past decade, triple- and quadruple-resonance  multidimensional NMR spectroscopy has become a critical  component of modern structural biology. In order to keep  pace in this accelerating field of  research, and to prepare  our undergraduate and graduate students for careers in one  of the fastest growing areas of science, this technology  must be brought to Cornell.    The Director of the Biomolecular NMR Center will be  Professor Linda Nicholson who joined the Cornell faculty  last fall. Professor Nicholson brings up-to-date expertise  in the application of multi-dimensional NMR to dynamical and  stru ctural studies of proteins, as evidenced by her recent  work on the HIV-l protease performed at the NIH. She brings  knowledge of the latest double-, triple- and quadruple-  resonance techniques for application to biological  macromolecules. This expertise is highly complemented at  Cornell by the long-established programs of Harold Scheraga  and Robert Oswald  that extensively utilize multi-dimensional NMR for  structural studies of proteins. progress in these research  groups has been made only Day to day direction of the  facility will be provided by a staff scientists who will  assist and train users, provide technical support and  facilitate collaborative interactions. External review of  the NMR facility will be provided by the visiting committee  described in section 5d. Allocation of resources will be  decided by a committee that consists of the director, the  staff scientist, one major user and one other user.  Scheduling of spectrometer time will be the responsibility  of the staff scientist. Cost sharing for this project will  be provided by funds from the College of Arts and Sciences  and from the Program in Molecular Structure.    Nicholson, Oswald and Scheraga comprise the \"critical mass\"  of major users that will launch the first structural and  dynamics studies in the proposed Biomolecular NMR Center.  Several additional faculty members, including Begley,  Jelinski, Rodriguez, and Feigenson, have a demonstrated  expertise in solution NMR spectroscopy, and will comprise a  strong core of additional users. Research activities  encompass investigation of two ubiquitous biophysical  switching mechanisms (protein  phosphorylation and GTP  binding, Nicholson and Oswald), protein folding and protein-  protein interactions (Scheraga), the basic forces that hold  proteins together (observing the effects of pressure on  protein flexibility, Ealick), basic forces governing lipid  behavior (Feigenson), the role of structure and dynamics in  mechanisms of enzyme catalysis (Begley), and the bi ophysical  basis of regulation of gene transcription (Lis and Tye), the  biophysical basis of high-performance biopolymers  (Jelinski), and interactions between bioactive natural  products and DNA (Rodriguez). Methodologies include gradient-  enhanced multidimensional experiments to obtain sequential  assignments, distance restraints and dihedral angle  restraints for structure determination and relaxation  parameters for protein dynamics. Studies of larger and less  soluble systems will also be possible with the requested  instrumentation. In addition to scientific research, the NMR  facility will provided educational opportunities through  formal courses and training sessions, through graduate and  post-graduate research projects and through independent  studies and field trips for undergraduate students.",
