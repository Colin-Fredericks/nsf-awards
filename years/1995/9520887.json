Medical imaging diagnosis and surgical intervention systems are  common technologies for doctors.  Today, there is no integrated  imaging technologies that can present both the bone and soft tissue  structure in three dimensions.  Medical industries have shown a  great interests in the development of intelligent imaging systems  that can provide more realistic, three-dimensional presentations of  organs, segments of organs or groups of organs.  In a typical  plastic surgery, doctors normally perform the operations manually.   When a skin graft or flap is necessary for reconstruction of a  damaged area, the surgeon must estimate the contour, area, and  volume of the tissue required to ensure success of the  reconstruction.   CAD/CAM and Robotics technologies developed by  engineers and scientists are very useful tools to develop the next  generation surgical intervention system.  CAD/CAM technology based  on geometric reasoning that can be employed to estimate precise  dimensions of damaged areas and match skin and tissue portions to  be extracted from another part of the body.  Robotics technology  can be integrated in controlling and sensing the surgical  operations adaptively.    Research projects proposed for industrial members consideration for  the envisioned Center are;  1) a Surgical Virtual Reality Machine,  2) A Sensor Equipment Scalpel, 3) Computer Aided Medical Imager  (CAM Imager), 4) Spine Curvature Analyzer Using Laser, 5) Automated  Burn Debridement, 6) Automated Congential Birthmark Treatment, 7)  Recreation of Exact Duplicate Tissue Defects, 8) Automation Tissue  Expansion, 9) Planner for Burn Reconstruction, 10) Tissue  Engineering, 11) Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) application in Small -  Field Digital Mammography, 12) Radiologist's Diagnostic Aid in  Detection of Microcalcification Precursors of Breast Cancer, 13)  Digital Mammographic Cassette, 14) Digital Breast Specimen  Radiography for Improved Biopsy, and 15) Prototype of a  Stereoscopic Mammography System.    The Principal Investigator/Center Director is a recognized  authority in his field and has assembled an interdisciplinary  research team of researchers from the University of Massachusetts  at Amherst and the Brigham and Woman's Hospital (a teaching  affiliate of Harvard Medical School).    A planning meeting with interested companies was held on   January 20, 1995.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Massachusetts at  Amherst be awarded $10,000 for one year to conduct a planning  activity.",
