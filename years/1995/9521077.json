Renjifo and his advisor, Dr. Bette A. Loiselle, to study the  impact of forest fragmentation and the composition of the  surrounding landscape matrix on populations of forest bird  species.    The primary objectives are to address the following major  hypotheses:  1) the landscape matrix in which forests are  embedded affect bird species composition of small, otherwise  similar, forest areas; and 2) bird subgroups differ in their  numerical responses to distinct surrounding landscape  matrices.  An experimental approach will be followed to test  these hypotheses, taking advantage of current landscape  conditions created by different land uses.  Sampling units  will be forest fragments within anthropogenic matrices and  plots within continuous forests.  A third objective will be  to examine the historical change of bird assemblages in the  study area following fragmentation.  This will be done by  comparing current species composition of the region's forest  to species composition in the region prior to fragmentation,  and with the non-fragmented area of study. ***",
