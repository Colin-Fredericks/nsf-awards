 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421604  Miesfeld    Steroid hormones control cell function by turning on and turning off specific sets of genes.  The genes controlled by testosterone and other androgenic hormones are androgen-dependent tissue.  To better understand how androgens control the expression of specific genes in the rat ventral prostate, Dr. Miesfeld has developed an in vitro model system using a novel rat prostate cell line that was isolated during the course of NSF support.  One of the paradoxical observations that he has been studying is how similar steroid hormones elicit such distinct cellular responses in vivo given that the steroid receptor proteins are capable of binding to the same gene sequences when studied in vitro.  He has proposed that prostate cells contain special androgen receptor \"adaptor\" proteins which aid in discriminating between androgen action and that of glucocorticoids which bind to a related steroid receptor.  By understanding more about these cell-specific steroid responses, it should be possible to uncover the molecular basis of gene-selective transcription.  In this proposed research, Dr. Miesfeld  intends to focus his efforts on three specific aims.  First, he will use two model androgen regulated genes, and either liver cells or prostate cells, to map promoter- and cell-specific requirements for androgen receptor sequences that may interact with putative adaptor proteins.  These proteins may act as \"activators\" in prostate cells or as \"inhibitors\" in liver cells based on earlier observations that androgen receptors function 10-20 times better in prostate cells.  Second, he will use yeast cells to set up a genetic screen to identify new mutations in the androgen receptor that affect these promoter- and cell-specific responses.  One prediction from the hypothesis is that different proteins will interact with the modulatory domain of the androgen receptor in distinct ways such that mutations should be able to distinguish between them.  Third, he will use biochemical techniques to physica l isolate proteins from prostate cells that specifically interact with the androgen receptor modulatory domain.  The characterization of these proteins should provide new information regarding mechanisms of steroid-regulated gene expression.  ***",
