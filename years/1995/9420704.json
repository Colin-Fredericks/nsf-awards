 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nelson    Under the direction of Dr. Ben Nelson, Ms. Nicola Strazicich will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will travel to  Mexico and collect pottery samples from archaeological sites for  both petrographic and chemical analysis. The ceramics derive from  two regions in Northern Mexico - Alta Vista and La Quemada. Each  has been studied extensively by archaeologists and each is  characterized by a different degree of political centralization.  The site of La Quemada contains artifically constructed terraces  situated on a bluff above the Malpaso Valley floor. The central  precinct of the site houses monumental architecture including a  hall of columns, votive pyramid and a massive masonry staircase.  Architecturally, the site represents significant labor investment  and planning. However the region lacks evidence for either economic  diversification or the manipulation of prestige goods which  indicate a highly stratified and centrally managed society. At Alta  Vista, in addition to large-scale architecture, extensive mining  and quarrying activities were carried out. Minerals extracted  included iron, malachite, hematite, chert and blue-green gem  stones. Evidence here argues for a more complex and centralized  form of social organization. Ms. Strazicich wishes to understand  differences in ceramic production within this comparative context.  She will conduct both elemental and petrographic analysis to  determine the extent of intrasite variability of both clay matrix  and production technique. She hypothesizes that the more complex  Alta Vista site will show a higher level of standardization.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies emerge and  are maintained. Many have focussed on the economic aspects of this  process and want to know when and how standardization in production  emerges. The assumption is that as societies grow more complex and  centralized management emerges, manufacturing activities such as  pottery production will come under central contr ol and will be  carried out by specialists. The resulting wares will become more  standardized. While such a scenario may appear sensible from a  theoretical perspective, very little empirical work has been done  to either verify or disconfirm this idea. The two sites chosen by  Ms. Strazicich provide an excellent context within which to address  this issue.    This research is important because it addresses a topic of interest  to many archaeologists. It will help to develop a technique with  potential applicability in many situations and will assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
