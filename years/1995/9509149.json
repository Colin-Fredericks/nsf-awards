 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims at demonstrating that visual motion analysis can  be improved (1) by replacing the analysis of optical flow (the  motion of image points) with that of image deformations (their  motion relative to each other) and (2) by spanning a wider field of  view. The advantages of image deformations are akin to those of  differential amplifiers for the detection of weak signals in a  noisy background: if noise affects both inputs equally, it is  canceled by taking their difference. In the analogy, image motion  caused by camera rotation is the noise, and that caused by  translation is the useful signal. As to the field of view, the  literature shows that a viewing angle of 60 degrees or more leads  almost to a quantum improvement in the conditioning of the  reconstruction problem. This lead is being pursued by a theoretical  and empirical investigation of shape reconstruction from the  deformations of wide-angle images induced by camera motion. The two  ideas of image deformations and a wide field of view, already  proven successful in preliminary studies, are being investigated  theoretically and experimentally. The final contribution will be a  multiframe shape and motion reconstruction method that works  reliably and for perspective images.",
