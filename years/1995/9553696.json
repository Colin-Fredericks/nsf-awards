 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project INVEST (Integrating New Visions in Environmental  Sciences and Technology year comprehensive ATE project encompassing  curriculum development, faculty enhancement and instrumentation and  laboratory improvement.  This project provides an opportunity to  address two different, but equally important postsecondary  education issues.  The first is the lack of educational  opportunities available to environmental technicians in advanced  technologies.  A second, but equally important issue, is the lack  of environmental education available to students at the secondary  and postsecondary level of studies.  Curriculum activities will  include development of:  (1) a curriculum course in X-Ray  Fluorescence Analysis of Lead Based Paint and Building Materials;  (2) stand-alone laboratory experiments in analysis of lead in  drinking water, GIS applications in environmental assessment and  remediation, and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer sugar analysis  identification of viable airborne organisms; and (3) environmental  applications for integration into math, science, and technology.   Opportunities for faculty enhancement will be provided through  internships with industrial partners, as well as participation in  conferences and workshops.  A curriculum work group, composed of  project part (industry, secondary and postsecondary educators) will  facilitate a comprehensive approach to materials development and  sharing of expertise.  A one-week faculty training institute will  be held in the second year of the project to disseminate course  materials and train instructor technologies.  A variety of  activities designed to increase career awareness in secondary and  postsecondary minority student populations are planned for both  years of the grant.",
