 "awd_abstract_narration": "An informal study revealed that new graduates in  materials-related fields had problems relating fundamental  engineering principles to manufacturing.   At present, the study  of ceramic machining is virtually unavailable nationwide to  undergraduates in manufacturing as well as ceramic engineering  and must be learned on the job at the employer's expense.   With  machining contributing 30%-60% and sometimes up to 90% of the  total production cost of a finished part, the Manufacturing  Engineer should be familiar with the intricacies of machining  ceramics.  The objective of this project, Machining of Ceramics,  is to show undergraduates the relationship between material  properties and machinability.   Machining exercises are performed  using a surface grinder and ultrasonic drill.  Variables, such as  feed rate, grit size, type of grinding wheel, as well as material  characteristics, are investigated.   Students learn how material  characteristics and machine performance interact to produce  different surface finishes and what variables are responsible for  diminishing the structural integrity of the machined ceramic.",
