 "awd_abstract_narration": "Demarest    Under the direction of Dr. Arthur Demarest, Mr. Oswaldo  Chinchillia will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  Building on previous work he will conduct a settlement survey in  the piedmont area of the Pacific coast of Guatemala. This region  is well known for the classic period (500-1000 AD) sites ascribed  to the Cotzumalguapa culture and for the elaborate sculptures and  writing system associated with it. Although attention has been  drawn to this area since the nineteenth century, current  knowledge is restricted to chronology, architecture and  sculpture. Little effort has been devoted to understanding social  and political organization. Mr. Chinchillia will conduct a  systematic regional survey in the immediate environs of the three  largest known sites. He will locate and record data from smaller  centers, map their position and qize, and based on the resultant  distributions reconstruct both settlement and social systems. He  will also conduct limited excavations in order to compare surface  and subsurface materials. Through this process, he will determine  how accurately suface distributions mirror buried materials and  what potential bias surface data might contain.    Middle America is famous for the complex societies which  developed in an often inhospitable tropical environment.  Archaeologists wish to understand the processes which led to the  emergence and development of these complex entities and which  ultimately resulted in their downfall. Very little systematic  work has been done in the piedmont of Guatemala even though the  complex and elaborate nature of archaeological remains indicates  that such attention is merited. Mr. Chinchillia's research will  shed new light on the rise of complex society. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
