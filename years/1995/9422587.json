 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores how indigenous Maya Indians in Yucatan, Mexico, local immigrants and non-governmental organizations manage forest resource systems.  The project focuses on the roles of information and communication in the use and governance of common-pool resources.   Three questions will be studied:  What is the structure and content of local ecological knowledge that enables successful commons management?  What is the character of the communications networks that make possible assimilation, distribution and implementation of this information? and to what extent is loss of local knowledge and disruption of communication networks related to a breakdown of the commons?   The general background issues are what lessons do micro-level approaches to increasingly threatened commons systems hold for the future of global commons such as the earth's forests, ranges, water and air?  Methods will include ethnographic fieldwork in Campeche, Yucatan, Mexico.    Field researchers will interview individuals for their cognitive models of resources using intensive open-ended interviews as well as close-ended questionnaires and psychological tests to study mental models, social networks, and the social distribution of ecological knowledge.  Consensus analysis will be performed on local communities to study the distribution and patterning of ecological knowledge.  In addition the range of biotic resources available to the community will be surveyed as a form of `ground-truthing`.    This research is important because systematic analysis of local community-based knowledge and beliefs and the linkages between this knowledge and practices will help societies plan to conserve natural resources.  This is the human dimension of both local and global change in the preservation or breakdown of common property resources.",
