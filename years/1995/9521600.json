 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521600  Harris    This Minority Research Planning Grant seeks to explore the  concept of racial group consciousness as a source of collective  action in three western-style democracies.  It seeks to examine  how racial exclusion and inequality in the United States, United  Kingdom, and South Africa are and have been resisted by racially  excluded groups through organized efforts.  A comparative  perspective on black political mobilization will also illuminate  the strategies and tactics racially excluded groups adopt to  resist systems of domination in their societies.  In doing so, it  will explore how citizenship and the notion of \"race\" have been  historically formulated and contested by both dominated groups  and state actors.  By drawing on empirical data collected from  opinion surveys, interviews, and methods of ethnography and  participant observation, this approach to black political  mobilization will provide a broader understanding of the  political formation of racial group consciousness than existing  research.  A comparative perspective on race, state, and  democracy will also inform researchers on how liberal democracies  and their citizens respond to racial conflict and inequalities.  ***",
