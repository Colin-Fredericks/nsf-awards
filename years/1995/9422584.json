 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422584  Romer  This project investigates a variety of aspects of monetary policy  in the postwar United States.  The first part investigates why  contractionary open-market operations typically raise long-term  interest rates.  The research uses the Federal Reserve's internal  inflation forecast and private forecasts to test the hypothesis  that contractionary policy actions raise the long-term rates  because market participants infer from the actions that the  Federal Reserve has unfavorable information about future  inflation.  The research tests whether the Federal Reserve has  useful information about inflation beyond what is known to market  participants, whether it tends to tighten when its forecasts of  inflation are higher than private forecasts, and whether private  forecasts of inflation are revised upward when the Federal  Reserve tightens.  The research also tests whether changes in  Federal Reserve policy are associated with changes in the premia  for holding securities of different maturities.    A second part of the project uses the evidence provided by times  when the Federal Reserve interfered with banks' ability to obtain  funds at prevailing interest rates to investigate the  macroeconomic importance of credit market imperfections.  Many  theories assign an important role to such imperfections in the  behavior of economic aggregates.  But the fact most measures of  the functioning of credit markets may be affected by other  factors that influence aggregate activity makes these theories  difficult to test.  Since the Federal Reserve's direct credit  actions were aimed specifically at credit markets, however, it is  unlikely that they could have affected the economy through any  channel other than through these markets.  The research will  therefore use the evidence provided by these actions to examine  the effects of credit market disruptions on aggregate pricing  behavior, investment, inventory accumulation, and other  variables.    Additional portions of the research will in vestigate the response  of monetary policy to inflation and whether there are measures of  inflation that provide prompt evidence of changes in the  underlying inflation rate.",
