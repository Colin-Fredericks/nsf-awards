 "awd_abstract_narration": "9461103  Argade    Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) power sources utilizing hydrogen and oxygel can be used for many applications. So far, most of the fuel-cell power plants are based on alkaline or phosphoric acid fuel cells. Conventional polymeric proton exchange membrane fuel cells offer a number of advantages, but require water management to maintain good performance. If proton exchange membranes are available which can operate near 200 degrees Celsius, it will lead to a significant technological breakthrough in terms of reliability, improved energy efficiency, and lower cost. Reduced platinum catalyst loading or use of non-precious metal catalysts, and most importantly alleviation of water management problems, will lead to a compact, lower weight fuel cell system using high-temperature PEMs. Thermal management of the system will also be easier due to the higher operating temperature, an important consideration for many applications. The proposed Phase I program will focus on novel inorganic proton exchange materials with stable crystal structures to very high temperatures and demonstration of the feasibility of a water/oxygen fuel cell based on a membrane made from these materials. The Phase II program is projected to concentrate on scale up of the processes of membrane preparation, methanol/air fuel cell development, system considerations and long term performance evaluation. Successful development of this technology will be most useful for improvement of energy recovery from coal via the methanol route.",
