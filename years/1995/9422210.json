 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kenneth D. Jordan at the Department of Chemistry, University of   Pittsburgh, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for studies related to the   electronic and geometric structure of molecular systems. His work under   this grant is, primarily, in three areas. The first research area   concerns the thermodynamic properties of modest size clusters. This work   involves accurate quantum chemical determination of the total interaction   energy for various cluster geometries followed by simulation of the   dynamics of motion on the energy surfaces. The second area concerns the   study of reactions on a Si surface. For this work, finite clusters are   being used to model the motion and reaction of adsorbates on and with the   surface. Finally, research is being carried out to validate and to extend   various theoretical methods which are used for the study of larger   molecules and clusters.   Theoretical electronic structure methods have been firmly established and   are regularly applied at two extremes; at one extreme are small systems   composed of only a few atoms and at the other extreme are crystalline   solids. The work under this grant deals with the intermediate case of   clusters which are being studied for two scientific purposes. The first   reason is to examine the properties of matter in the intermediate state   between the extremes; this state is especially important because it has   properties which are fundamentally different from those at the extremes.   The work under this grant is helping to explore these fascinating and   potentially useful cluster properties. The second reason is to study the   properties of the surfaces of solids with suitable cluster models. Such   models are especially useful to elucidate surface chemistry because they   enable theory which explains and predicts chemistry in molecules to be   applied to processes which occur at the surfaces of condensed matter.",
