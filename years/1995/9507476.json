 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two topics will be investigated in this research project.  First, to gain a physical insight of Einstein's general  relativity (in strong gravitational fields) Professor  Esteban will study the bending of light, periastron shift,  and time delays near millisecond pulsars and rotating black  holes.  To this purpose an alternative procedure to the  standard methods found in the literature will be developed.  Neither spacetime curvature nor relativistic rotational  effects will be neglected.  Secondly, he will investigate  the physical implications of Weyl gravity's linear term in  the gravitational potentials of self-gravitating ellipsoids  and disks.  This is important because in astrophysics,  ellipsoids often have been considered as models of galactic  bars.  To confront Weyl gravity with observations and  experiments he will study light bending and time delays by  using an exact exterior solution for a static, spherically  symmetric gravitating source in locally conformal invariant  Weyl gravity.  This solution is the analog of the exterior  Schwarzschild vacuum solution of Einstein's general  relativity.    One important aim of this project is to involve physics and  mathematics students in undergraduate research experiences.  This project will provide talented students with the  opportunity for planning, carrying out, and reporting  scientific research.  By using advanced computational tools,  they will develop computing skills needed for their future  advancement in science or engineering.",
