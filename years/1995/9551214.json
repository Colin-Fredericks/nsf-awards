 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the Biology curriculum a series of experimental laboratories  are using molecular approaches to the study of genetic variation  and evolution.  These laboratories give the students an opportunity  to perform experimental techniques and ask theoretical questions  about material they formerly learned mainly through lectures of  dry-labs.  The laboratories improve the teaching of evolutionary  concepts, broaden the exposure to molecular techniques of both  majors and non-majors and finally, prepare undergraduates for  research projects that use molecular approaches to understanding  evolutionary questions.  Targeted courses include the General  Biology Introductory course for majors, a non-majors Life Science  course, and the Evolution course.  Investigative topics include  evolution of genomes, DNA fingerprinting, Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium, phylogenetic analyses, advanced population genetics,  plastid DNA variation and divergence.  The non-majors Life Science  Course is crucial in the science training of elementary and middle  school education majors.  Improvements in this course correspond to  changes in the elementary and middle school teacher preparation  curriculum supported by a grant from the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts (Partnerships Advancing the Learning of Mathematics  and Science, (PALMS) to restructure the college's teacher  preparation program in mathematics, science and technology  education.",
