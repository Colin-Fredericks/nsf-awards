Work by the authors has uncovered several interesting   aspects of these methods.  Approximation bounds have been obtained by   methods taken from the probability theory of empirical processes,   including bounds on the average squared error and the maximal error of   neural network and related approximations.  These approximation bounds   reveal a rate of convergence that is insensitive to the dimension of the   input space for certain nonparametric (infinite dimensional) classes of   functions, specified via the closure of convex hulls of finite dimensional  families of functions.  As a consequence accurate statistical estimation   of functions in these nonparametric classes is possible without recourse   to exponentially large sample sizes.  Unfortunately, computation of neural   net estimates can be an extremely difficult task.  The investigators study   how the problems of accurate approximation, estimation, and computation are   intertwined.  In this research they investigate fundamental mathematical,   statistical, and computational limits of the capacity to approximate and   to estimate these functions accurately by computationally feasible   algorithms.    Empirical modeling techniques used in a variety of scientific and  engineering tasks deal with the problem of how to combine a large  number of observable quantities to best predict or approximate   a response variable.   The input - response relation may be described   by a rather complicated function, and it may be desirable to   approximate it by a combination of a small number of    elementary, comparatively s impler, functions. These models   differ from classical techniques in approximation  and statistical estimation in that the functions that are combined   are not fixed in advance, but rather selected and adjusted according   to what is known or observed concerning the intended response variable   so as to provide the best fit.  The investigators are quantifying the   mathematical and statistical advantages of these  adjustable selections.  Artificial neural networks and related techniques are at the heart  of modern models for adaptive and high performance computation.  The investigators study the limits of what is computationally   feasible with these models.  The ubiquity of requirements for accurate  prediction and empirical modeling for use of the scientific method  in general and for nationally strategic topics in particular are  motivating factors in this research.",
