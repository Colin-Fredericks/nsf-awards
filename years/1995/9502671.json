In recent years, neural network systems have been used to provide  solutions to a variety of problems, from speech recognition and  manufacturing control to forensic hair analysis and medical  diagnosis.  This project uses an application to a problem of  national interest -- remediation of hazardous waste sites -- as  the focus of a program of research with broader implications.  Networks built as part of this project are being used to aid in  the interpretation of data supplied by noninvasive sensors such  as magnetic devices and ground penetrating radar, in order to  characterize the location and nature of buried waste before it is  dug up or treated in situ.  Students at both the undergraduate  and graduate levels are involved in this project, which serves  both educational and research purposes.    Within the work on waste remediation, research is being  undertaken on transfer of knowledge.   Neural networks are  automatically constructed (\"trained\") from a set of data  representing desired system input and output, and neural network  transfer addresses the question of how a network trained for one  task can be used to aid in training a network for a new but  related task.  Without transfer, training times for a new task  can be lengthy, and a large amount of training data can be  required.  With transfer, both of these factors can be reduced.  Transfer applied to the hazardous waste remediation problem  addresses important practical concerns in that type of  application.  For example, a network trained to interpret sensors  at one site can be used to facilitate training for a network with  different geophysical characteristics.  Also, a network trained  on data generated from a synthetic sensor model can be used to  facilitate training  on field data.",
