 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, David   Nesbitt of the University of Colorado will investigate the potential   energy surfaces of van der Waals molecules using laser based   spectroscopic methods.  These studies will concentrate on hydrogen bonded   species and multiple rare-gas cluster systems including HF, HCL, and   water.  Additional work will focus on the production and infrared   characterization of radical and radical complexes of important   atmospheric components such as the peroxyl radical, and the spectroscopy   and dynamics of prototypical heavy-light-heavy reactive systems such as   Cl-HCl and F-HF.  High resolution near infrared light will be used to   state-select a cluster which will be subsequently  photolyzed in studies   involving reactive and inelastic scattering.  These systems include   DCl-HCl and XH-NNO (ONN), and provide control over cluster size, quantum   state, and reactant approach geometry.  The determination of potential energy surfaces provides the information   needed to understand and control the course of a chemical reaction.    Professor Nesbitt's studies will provide quantum state specificity and a   specific reactant approach geometry for an important class of chemical   reactions known as heavy-light-heavy reactions.  The information obtained   from this work will be an important step towards using lasers to control   of the outcome of chemical reactions.",
