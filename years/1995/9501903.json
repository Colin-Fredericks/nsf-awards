 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501903   This research is focused on the quality control problem of understanding processes whose behaviors are affected by multiple, autocorrelated variables.  Traditional statistical process control (SPC) is based on a single variable and the assumption of normality, independence, and homogeneous variance.  This research capitalizes on the inappropriateness of these assumptions and the use of a single variable as a basis to understand and control a process when indeed in today's industrial environment there could be multiple, autocorrelated variables.  The objective of the research is to systematically explore the behavior, sensitivity, and consistency of several multivariate quality control methods when autocorrelated multivariate data is present.  These methods include the multivariate EWMA, principal component analysis, and multiple time series.  The research was motivated by the lack of sufficient analytical tools to handle statistical process control situations in which multiple correlated factors influence the behavior of a process.  The research plans to pursue the use of different forms of models to address the problem.  The educational component of the research presents the investigator's teaching philosophy, methods of tracking teaching performance, and students understanding and involvement in the materials being taught.  The investigator will deploy and integrate the research outcome into classroom by developing a new combined course in statistics and quality control with emphasis on the use of these techniques to solving industry-relevant problems in statistical process control.  In addition, the techniques investigated in the research for the purpose of improving processes will be used to improve teaching effectiveness.   The potential for the research is good.  The outcome of the research can advance the body of knowledge in the broad area of multivariate process control.  This will lead to a better understanding of process behavior and method of control.  Improved control has  a positive relationship to productivity and consequently, on competitiveness.  By disseminating the research outcome through classroom instructions, students will gain an understanding of how process behavior is affected by process control parameters.  They will also gain valuable experience on how to monitor and control processes in actual industrial settings.",
