The university has  provided one year (Jan 94 - Jan 95) of support for a Ph.D.-level  technical scientist (Dr. Yuri Amelin) and will provide ca. 40% of  the next three years of salary support.  The technician will have  responsibility for quality control, maintenance procedures,  supervision of graduate students and visiting scientists and  improving procedures at this lab which was established with the  acquisition of a state-of-the-art VG sector 54 Thermal Ionization  Mass Spectrometer purchased in January, 1994 (EAR-9219862).  Although, the instrument has only recently attained its  manufacturer's specifications in terms of precision due to the  need for replacement of the original photomultiplier tube, the PI  has carefully documented a large number of analyses of standards,  blanks and initial samples of accessory minerals for U-Pb isotope  series dating.  The high-sensitivity, high-transmission  instrument has afforded this lab the ability to make ultra-high  precision measurements of Pb isotope ratios which, coupled with  their class-100 clean room and careful chemical preparation of  samples has resulted in very low, total-procedure, common-Pb  blanks that ultimately translates into precise ( 3 Ma) dating  capabilities for small (as little as 2 g) samples of accessory  phase minerals.      ***",
