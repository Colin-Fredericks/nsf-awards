 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417108  Miller         Determining relationships among processes of deposition,  formation of unconformity-bounded units (sequences), and global  sea-level on passive continental margins requires continuous  sampling and dating of stratigraphic sections in different tectonic  settings.  The New Jersey Sea-Level Transect (onshore drilling, ODP  Leg 150, and future shelf drilling) has begun the task of  evaluating passive margin sequences by drilling an integrated  transect of boreholes on the NJ coastal plain, shelf, and slope.   NSF-funded drilling onshore at Island Beach, Atlantic City, and  Cape May, NJ in 1993-94 was successful in assembling a mosaic of  coastal plain sequences that record uppermost Cretaceous-Recent  relative sea-level changes.  Comparison with other sea-level proxy  data should establish if these sequences were controlled by global  sea-level variations.  These sequences often bracket aquifer-  confining units and these hydrogeological couplets can be  correlated throughout the coastal plain.  Because of their  hydrogeological significance, the NJ Geological Survey has funded  drilling costs under a Water Bond Issue for a fourth borehole to be  drilled at Harrisville, NJ in 1995 (2,000 ft. proposed total  depth).         This is a renewal proposal to support science involved with  the drilling of the Harrisville borehole and integrated magneto-,  bio-, litho-, and isotopic stratigraphic studies.  These studies  represent a collaborative effort among Rutgers, Lamont-Doherty  Earth Observatory, the NJ Geological Survey, and the Eastern  Regional Branch of the USGS.  ***",
