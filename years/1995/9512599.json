 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512599  Weete    The ion accelerator laboratory at the Nuclear Science Center at  Auburn University will be upgraded through acquisition of a  tandem accelerator equipped with a radio frequency (rf) exchange  ion source, a high voltage source injector system, and a high  energy quadrupole focusing lens. The new machine replaces a  twenty-six year old accelerator which is nearing the end of its  serviceable life. The accelerator laboratory functions primarily  in support of various materials research programs in different  colleges and departments. These efforts focus primarily on thin  film systems and interactions, such as silicon carbide and III-V  compound semiconductor epitaxial film characterization, ion-  induced radiation damage in insulators, materials oxidation  processes, and electronics packaging and diamond film technology.  Analysis techniques available in the accelerator laboratory for  materials studies include proton induced x-ray emission (PIXE),  Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), light ion  channeling (LIC),  fast neutron activation analysis (FNAA), and  some ion implantation capabilities. Most of these techniques will  be available in the upgraded facility, and the new machine will  facilitate development of expanded analysis capabilities such as  neutron activation/time-of-flight techniques.  %%%  The new tandem accelerator will allow the laboratory to provide  efficient research support for materials science programs through  improved access to modern analytical techniques. It replaces an  ancient unit which currently consumes large material and human  resources for its maintenance. The accelerator laboratory has a  long history of collaborative research with nearby minority  institutions, and the program has a long-term commitment in  support of educational opportunities for minority students in the  physical sciences which the new accelerator will enhance.  ***",
