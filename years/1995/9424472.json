Optical experiments, NMR experiments,  and molecular dynamics computer simulations will be  performed to investigate these aspects of local dynamics in  polymer solutions, melts, blends, and glasses.  One project  will utilize molecular dynamics computer simulations to  investigate whether Tg is related to the extent of  cooperative motion which occurs in response to a  conformational transition.  Simulations are an ideal tool to  understand the microscopic features of local polymer motion  when they are tested by experiments which allow an  assessment of realism.  A second project will use a recently  developed photobleaching technique to explore the molecular  origins of physical aging.  Physical aging causes  degradation of the properties of glassy polymers over time.  These experiments will also help to unravel the fundamental  nature of the glass transition in polymers.  A third project  will use low-field NMR spectroscopy to study how the two  components of a polymer blend influence each other's local  dynamics.  These influences determine the mechanical  properties of the blend.  Ultimately, a prediction of blend  properties from component properties may be feasible.  %%%  Local polymer dynamics play an important role in the  structure/property relationships of amorphous polymers.  Local dynamics are directly responsible for a number of  important polymer properties such as the glass transition  temperature and the temperature dependence of the viscosity.  A fundamental understanding of local polymer dynamics may  allow the modification of existing materials to enhance  specific properties and possibly the development of new  materials.  ***",
