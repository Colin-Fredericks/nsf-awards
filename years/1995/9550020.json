It is  hoped that through this model teachers will build an  understanding of continuous assessment: its position in the  context of documenting and reporting student growth; and its  match with the use of hands-on, inquiry-based approaches for  developing scientific concepts, processes and dispositions.  The  elementary school teachers are expected to develop strategies for  conducting such everyday assessment of student learning that are  integrated and compatible with instructional activities and  classroom management.  The project will begin by working closely  with twelve teachers to plan, practice, document and evaluate  strategies for continuous assessment and the professional  development necessary for preparing teachers to use them.  During  the second year the project will work with working a larger  number of teachers to evaluate the model.  During the final year  of the project an action guide will be published to support the  dissemination of the model through Vermont's SSI project.    The cost sharing will be 18 percent of the NSF portion.  ***",
