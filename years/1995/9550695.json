 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the auspices of the UC Urban Community-School Collaborative,  the Summer Session Office of the University of California Santa  Cruz (UCSC), in collaboration with the Monterey Peninsula Unified  School District (MPUSD), is developing a comprehensive Marine  Science/Mathematics Institute for African American students  entering or currently in the 9th Grade.  A Participants will be  selected from Seaside and Monterey High Schools.  The 5-week  residential summer program will be held on the campus of the  University of California Santa Cruz, Santa CA.  The inquiry based  core curriculum of math and science will incorporate four main  themes:  Scale and Structure, Energy, Stability and Change and  Systems and Interactions.  Discussions will focus on the natural  history, biology, ecology and geology of the Monterey Bay National  Marine.  The pedagogical emphasis will be on cooperative learning  while \"doing science.\"  Close, Meaningful interactions with  university faculty and students during laboratory and field  experiences will be integral components of the summer and academic  year programs.  The summer curriculum will be augmented by courses  in library research techniques, work processing and spread sheet  operations and On-line information retrieval systems.  The  innovative Residential Program will include field trips and  workshops on academic/career development, conflict mediation,  developing interpersonal skills, time management and study skills.   The year-round follow up program will include mentorship/tutorial  programs, internships and parental information, education and  support services.  The active participation of high school teachers  from both schools during both the summer and academic year  programs, will provide a vital link to the students year round and  facilitate monitoring of the participants' academic progress.  ***",
