 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics Department at Western Piedmont Community  College requires extensive use of calculators in all transfer  mathematics courses.  College algebra students and calculus  students are required to have graphing calculators while other  students are required to have scientific calculators with linear  regression capability.  The integration of computer usage into the  mathematics curriculum is the next logical step in the evolution of  the College's mathematics program.  To achieve this goal, the  Western Piedmont Community College Computer Enhanced Mathematics  Instruction Project (CEMIP) will enable the department to equip a  multipurpose instructional computer laboratory by providing  matching funds for the purchase of 21 microcomputers, four  printers, a VGA liquid display panel with-an overhead projector,  and site licenses for three commercial software packages DERIVE,  MAPLE, and MINITAB.  The lab will be used as a teaching classroom,  an assigned computer usage lab, and limited-access lab open for  selected mathematics students.  Initially, the project will  concentrate on incorporating computer usage into calculus and  statistics instruction, with the ultimate goal of having computer  usage integrated into the entire mathematics curriculum.",
