 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powell       The investigator and his colleagues study the spatial  dynamics of populations, developing and analyzing models that  incorporate biological data and investigating the way individuals  of a population aggregate and disperse.  Aggregation leads to  spatial complexity through feedback.  The feedback is nonlinear  when the cues individuals use to aggregate depend on the number of  individuals.  In a population model that allows for movement,  aggregative feedback causes nonlinear self-focussing, the  organization or `focussing' of population groups on small scales.  Decreases in the scale of spatial correlation make the dispersal  pattern more complex, leading to complicated spatial structure.  Mathematically, issues of pattern formation are related to the  structure of invasion waves or `fronts' between ecological states.  When the structure is known, stability analyses of states behind  the front or along the front determine how complexity is  generated.  A body of mathematical work has focussed on predicting  the speed and shape of invasion waves in biological problems.  Unfortunately, known techniques only address the invasion problem  in systems of low dimensionality (one or two dependent variables),  and do not lend themselves to general ecological application.  Techniques to predict front propagation in systems of many  variables are therefore at the center of the research.  Front  solutions, or waves of invasion, are the basis for stability  analyses at invasion boundaries, which predict how curvature  instabilities produce complexity at the invasion boundaries.  Results of these mathematical efforts are used to understand  complexity generation in the mountain pine beetle/pine system.  Results from the mathematical model are compared with data on  size, shape, and structure of known infestations.       In short, the idea is to determine how much focussing, or  clumping, of a species determines the natural formation of  patterns in ecosystems.  Aggregation, or clumping, of spec ies  occurs naturally, and can be predicted mathematically.  The  researchers examine how this mechanism creates complexity in  ecosystems, and study how to determine how much of ecological  complexity is self-generating, as opposed to being generated by  the complexity of the environment.  The Mountain Pine  Beetle/Lodgepole Pine ecosystem is studied because elements of the  spatial pattern (attacked and killed trees) are distinctive and  easy to measure.  Moreover, understanding the predictable aspects  of the course of pine beetle infestations is important to  understanding the role this pest plays in western forests,  including the relationship between beetle-killed pines and forest  fire.",
