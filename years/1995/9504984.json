 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504984  Williams    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion of  Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Eric Williams of the  Mathematics Department, University of Minnesota  Minneapolis, Minnesota. This fellowship opportunity will enable  Dr. Williams to begin a collaborative research effort with  Professor Minoru Takahashi of the Institute of Solid State  Physics (ISSP) at the University of Tokyo.  The researchers  propose to study integrable many body quantum mechanical systems,  in particular those for which the individual particle numbers are  not conserved. The 12-month visit by Dr. Williams will help him  to establish a personal and professional link with a leading  researcher in Japan.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Williams will have the opportunity  to interact with researchers at the University of Tokyo, as well  as contributing to the understanding of integrable systems and  physics. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international collaboration.  ***",
