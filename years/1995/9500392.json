 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, involves the extension of nonlinear multiresonant four  wave mixing (MFWM) spectroscopy to the selected excitation of  multiple vibrational transitions in the infrared spectral range.  Professor John C. Wright and his students at the University of  Wisconsin at Madison will use multiple infrared lasers to target  selected transitions within a molecule and induce unique excitation  responses reflective of the sum or difference of individual  resonances. The unparalleled selectivity afforded by this technique  is attributed to the wealth of infrared vibrational resonances that  are coupled to chemical functional group interactions, and the  concomitant capability for elimination of matrix, spectral and/or  solvent interferences using the four-wave mixing approach. In  addition, the inherent sharpness of vibrational transitions will  allow the generation of well resolved spectra at room temperatures.  Professor Wright will also extend this technique to the fingerprint  region of the infrared which will allow a more detailed assessment  of analyte molecular structure.  Multiresonant four wave mixing nonlinear spectroscopy involves the  use of multiple infrared lasers to enable the judicious selection  of excitation wavelengths related to specific components in complex  mixtures, chemical functionalities in biological and polymeric  macromolecules, and/or conformational distinctions in well ordered  systems. This technique allows both qualitative and quantitative  chemical differentiation with unparalleled selectivity. This  project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  is at a stage where its success will require the interdisciplinary  efforts of physical and analytical spectroscopists, and its mature  development will benefit the characterization of advanced materials  and biomacromolecules.",
