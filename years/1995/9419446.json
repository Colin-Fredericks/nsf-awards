 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a project submitted to the National Science Foundation, Drs. Robert  J. Lascano and R. Louis Baumhardt propose to develop software that  integrates the measurement and calculation of crop water use with a  water delivery system as a research tool for scientists evaluating the  fate of water in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Their objective is  to develop a software platform that integrates calculations of soil  (Es) and crop (Ec) water evaporation from measured weather parameters  using a mechanistic model, with independently obtained soil water  content and stem flow data. Results will be accessible through a user  friendly graphical interface that will also be configured to activate a  water delivery system. The software, modular in design and written in  Microsoft Visual for MS-Dos and Windows environment, first obtains  weather data and calculates Es and Ec with the mechanistic model  ENWATBAL. Second, the software compares calculated and the measured, if  available, values of Ec and Es. Crop evaporation is measured by the  stem-heat balance method using commercially available gauges and Es is  measured from changes in soil water content using time domain  reflectometry (TDR) technology. Third, the software compiles the data  in both tabular and graphical formats that maybe accessed through a  user friendly interface that also activates a water delivery system to  replenish the soil water according to the researchers' requirements. A  prototype software/water delivery system will be developed and tested  for an irrigated cotton crop using a drip system. Software development  and testing are proposed for two years. They will do a field experiment  to evaluate hardware performance and install instruments to measure  stem flow, soil water content and temperature, and weather parameters.  This data will be sent via cellular phone to a computer that executes  the ENWATBAL model providing the user with crop water use information  on real-time. The advantages of the proposed software/water-de livery  system include the integration of real time Es and Ec calculations  using a mechanistic model with the unique feedback loop of real time  measurements of Es and Ec and the automation of water application.      Lascano and Baumhardt contend that the proposed software will be a  valuable tool to researchers working on variable frequency and/or  deficit irrigation. Currently. these projects use an estimate of  potential (grass) total water evaporation and an empirical crop  coefficient to calculate actual water use and schedule irrigation that  could otherwise be directly calculated and validated with the proposed  software. Furthermore, other researchers working, for example, on  optimizing water use efficiency of various crop cultivars, relating  soil fertility to water use efficiency, determining the effects of  insect damage on crop water use, may use the proposed software to  evaluate their hypothesis and field experiments.",
