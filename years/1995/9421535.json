 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421535  Murdoch  The University of California, Santa Barbara, proposes to establish a Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (CEAS). The rational for the CEAS is to carry out collaborative research on the major fundamental and applied problems facing ecology, as defined by the nation's ecologists. The Center will develop new techniques, especially in mathematical modeling, intensive computation, visualization of ecological systems, and digital representation of geographic variation in complex ecological phenomena. It will provide special educational opportunities in new techniques and advances to students and young scientists, and will disseminate the results of its research to a broad class of potential users, including decision-makers and those involved directly in resource-management and other environmental areas. The Center will accomplish these goals by fostering individually based and collaborative research projects, and by conducting workshops and conferences. It is estimated that approximately 150 research ecologists will spend extended periods of time at the Center, and a further 600 researchers and students will participate in its conferences, workshops and training courses each year. The CEAS will be managed by a Director, a Scientific Advisory Board comprised of active members of the ecological community, and an External Liaison Committee with membership drawn from academia, state and federal agencies, and the public sector. Cost sharing with the California Trade and Commerce Agency and the University of California is approximately $4.03 million over five years.  The University of California, Santa Barbara is an ideal setting for the CEAS because it provides an intellectually stimulating environment, exceptional technical expertise and facilities, and a physically attractive location and facility. In addition, the UCSB proposal provided the strongest vision for a creative, forward-looking Center that was designed to be highly flexible in order to meet the needs of, and be high ly responsive to, the nation's ecological community.",
