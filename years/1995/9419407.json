 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419407  James Hanken    The  ultimate goal of this research project is to understand  the developmental basis of anatomical differences in anatomy  of  the  head among species.  The studies focus on a  unique  population  of  cells--the  neural  crest--from  which  many  cranial  tissues in vertebrates are derived.   The  specific  contributions of neural crest cells to the skull and cranial  musculature  in  different  species  will  be  assessed   by  labeling  these  cells  with  a  fluorescent  dye  early  in  development,  before  they begin to migrate  throughout  the  body,  and  tracking  their movement to  see  which  cranial  tissues  are  derived from the labeled cells.  The  research  will  also determine whether neural crest cells contain  the  developmental information that is responsible for anatomical  differences  among species and document the place  and  time  during  development  where genes are  expressed  that  might  mediate  the  development and adult fates  of  neural  crest  cells.   The  research will increase our  knowledge  of  the  genetic   and   developmental  mechanisms   underlying   the  integrated evolution of complex anatomical structures.",
