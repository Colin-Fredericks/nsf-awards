 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately every three years, for the past twenty years, international meetings have been held on the subject of ribosomes. The purpose of these meetings is to review the current research on the structure/function of the ribosome and the interactions of this complex macromolecule with other factors and ligands necessary for protein biosynthesis. PRIVATE    Topics to be discussed include rRNA structure/function; rRNA synthesis, processing and organization; ribosomal protein structure/function; rRNA/r protein interactions; ribosome assembly; evolution of the translational apparatus; mRNA interactions, tRNA interactions; fidelity of translation; and extrinsic factors/antibiotic interactions with ribosomes. This meeting, scheduled to be held May  20 25, 1995 in Victoria, British Columbia, will have a major impact on the international efforts being made in ribosome research.  It is a time when workers in the field from around the world will interact, discussing the progress made since the last meeting (Berlin, 1992) and outline that work which is expected to transpire in the future. Excel lent books summarizing the ribosome and its role in protein biosynthesis have emanated from most of the previous conferences.  Such a book is planned for this conference as well.  These books become rather standard in research  laboratories throughout the world as comprehensive references for the work done in this complex field.  %%%   The ribosome is the cellular machinery for protein synthesis. The ribosome field is a small but  vibrant research arena for many workers throughout the world.  Even though this field does not enjoy  all of the popularity it once did, much critical research and many advances take place with great  regularity.  Further research on ribosomes is essential to our understanding of protein synthesis.  Of  special interest in the last few years is the evidence mounting that the ribosome interacts in a  pliable way with tRNA (the structural RNA) and mRNA (which carries the message to encode the protein).  A main emphasis of this meeting is to understand the dynamics of theqe complex interactions. This meeting, scheduled to be held May 20-25, 1995 in Victoria, British Columbia, will have a major impact on the international efforts being made in ribosome research.",
