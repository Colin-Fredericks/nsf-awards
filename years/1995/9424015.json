 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424015  George   This project will provide an environment for minority undergraduate students to experience research in Applied Computer Science.  Ten minority students will be recruited to the REU program.  Minority institutions without graduate programs in Computer Science will be the main focus of the recruitment effort.  The major components of the REU program are a summer research project and a one day mini-seminar during the academic year.  The participants will be given well defined research projects and will participate in ongoing research projects.  They will also have the opportunity to interact with faculty and graduate students.  The research projects will be designed such that the participants can be co-authors of papers.  Such experience is expected to encourage the participants to continue their education into graduate school and move on the research careers.    The participants will be matched with faculty members based on their interests.  Examples of projects (not an exhaustive list) are simulation of architectures and protocols, and developing efficient implementations for abstract data types in shared memory and distributed memory machines.  The participants will work in small groups under experienced professors.  They will be expected to write a paper describing their research and present the results in a mini-seminar to be organized during the academic year.  Contact with the students will be maintained throughout the academic year.  ***",
