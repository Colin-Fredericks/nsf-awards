 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    REIMER, Robert  9417692    The CORF plays an essential role in defending the spectrum related interests of the U.S. scientific community before national and international organizations that deal with the allocation and efficient use of the radio spectrum.  During the last year the CORF filed comments before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), on matters related to the upcoming World Radio Conference (WRC-95), Mobile Satellite Proceedings, and Use of Frequencies Above 60 GHz. The Committee has made presentations to the FCC staff on radio astronomers' use of the spectrum, and related interference issues.      These activities will continue next year.  The next WARC (WRC-95) will be held in October-November of 1995, and the CORF will have to represent the point of view of the scientific community in various national and international fora dealing with preparations for the onference.  Moreover, since WRCs are now held on a regular, two yearly basis, preparations will have to begin for the 1997 Conference, which will deal with space related issues, among others.     The CORF, through it's liaison member, also participates in the work of the Radiocommunication Sector (formerly CCIR), particularly in the work of Study Group 7 (Science Services) and Task Group 1/3, dealing with spurious emissions. Recommendations issued  by the Radiocommunication Sector provide the technical underpinnings for the protection of radio astronomy from interference from active radio services.       ***",
