 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418853   Harper    This award will support the participation of ten U.S.scientists  to take part in a seminar concerned with preliminary site  selection for an international astronomical observatory to  be located on the Antarctic Plateau.  The seminar will be held   at the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, Australia in  February 1995.  The American coordinator is Prof. Doyal Harper  from the University of Chicago and director of the Center for  Astrophysical Research in Antarctica.  The Australian organizer  is Dr. Jeremy Mould of the Australian National University and  director of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories.  The seminar is being conducted under the U.S.-Australia  Cooperative Science  Program and support in Australia is provided  through the Department of Industry, Science and Technology  (DIST).    Nowhere else on Earth are conditions for astronomical observation  as close to ideal as they are above the Antarctic Plateau.  Observations from Antarctica can open windows on the Universe  normally closed to any but space-based missions. An astronomical  observatory capable of exploiting these natural conditions will  generate exciting new discoveries about the formation epoch of  galaxies, provide data on the physics of black holes, permit the  detection of photoplanetary systems and provide key data in  support of a host of other studies. The seminar will be a timely  opportunity to compare recent results, evaluate scientific  opportunities, and devise a rationalized international plan for  astronomical site testing in preparation for establishing a  first-class observatory in the Antarctic.",
