A dichotomous classification  problem will be examined to demonstrate how multiple inductive  agents can work cooperatively to solve a problem.  First, a  comparative analysis of various inductive methods, including  statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be  conducted.  This is followed by an in-depth investigation of how  the differences in sample characteristics (i.e., normality,  linearity, etc.) affect the performance of each inductive method  to establish a foundation for result integration.  The concepts  and procedures developed in meta-analysis statistics will be used  to combine results.  The research will facilitate true  cooperation in a DAI environment by introducing computational  models that promote negotiation through cooperation rather than  competition.  The incorporation of the models is expected to  improve the overall performance and enhance the consistency and  validity of a DAI system.",
