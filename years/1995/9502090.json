 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Julie d'Itri    The focus of the research is the development of new processes for conversion of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to environmentally more benign hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by catalytic hydrodechlorination.  The initial model under investigation is the hydrodechlorination of 1,1- dichlorotetrafluoroethane catalyzed by palladium supported on various materials.  Emphasis is placed on elucidating the factors that dictate selectivity towards 1,1,1,2- tetrafluoroethane.  Quantitative rate measurements provide fundamental kinetics parameters such as heat of adsorption, activation energy, and intrinsic rate constant.  The influences of metal particle size, metal-support interactions, and support acidity on each of these parameters are determined.  The mechanism and transition state are examined using isotopic transient experiments and linear free energy relationships.    The results of this research are important for the destruction of chlorofluorocarbons in industrial wastes, for control of CFC emissions, and for the production of substitute refrigerants, cleaning agents, blowing agents, and propellants that are more tolerable environmentally.    Curricular materials in the forms of  both classroom courses and laboratory experiments are developed in tandem with this research.  Students at both undergraduate and graduate levels are exposed the concepts and goals of environmentally benign chemical processing.  The intent is to instill new standards of engineering practice that include recognition of environmental concerns and needs.",
