The seminar will be devoted to the  topic \"Comparative Evaluation of Flood Control  Approaches for Bangladesh and the Mississippi  Rivers\".  The P.I., Dr. Salim Rashid of the  University of Illinois, Urbana, is also the  Vice President of the U.S.-based Bangladesh  Environment and Flood Committee in America  (BEFCA).  Dr. Rashid, with support from BEFCA,  will conduct the seminar with Dr. M. Mozzamel  Hoque, Professor and Director, Institute of  Flood Control and Drainage Research at the  BUET.  The seminar is scheduled for March 12th  to March 15th, 1995, and is expected to focus  on ways of comparing flood disasters in  developed  and developing countries, and of transferring  knowledge about disaster alleviation.  It will  particularly emphasize the aspects of the  socio-economic impacts of flood control.                              Scope:  This project meets objectives of the  Division of International Programs:  it  supports a joint seminar in an area of  importance to the U.S. and the collaborating  foreign country, Bangladesh.  The topics are  particularly important, in light of the recent  floods in the U.S., including the major  Missouri flooding in 1993 and the California  floods of 1995, and given the nearly perennial  flood problems in Bangladesh.  The  seminar  should lead to recommendations on research  areas in flood control policies and flood  damage mitigation procedures.  ***",
