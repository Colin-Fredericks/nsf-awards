 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415451  Barrett    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative  research in nuclear physics between Bruce R. Barrett of the  University of Arizona and Piet van Isacker at GANIL  (Grand Accelerateur National d' Ions Lourds), Caen, France.  The objective of their research is the study of  properties  of exotic light nuclei away from the proton and neutron  lines of stability.  They propose to reach as high a mass as  A=11 in order to investigate the so-called \"halo\" structure.  Studies on large-scale microscopic (also known as shell-  model) calculations will be complemented by model  calculations utilizing the Interactive Boson Model-3.  Recent advances in nuclear structure theory and computer  technology will be applied to these investigations.    Dr. Barrett brings to this project expertise in shell-model  calculations and effective theory.  This is complemented by  the French investigators' experience in group theory and  Interacting Boson Model.  The project takes advantage of  excellent facilities at GANIL, including a very powerful  LISE spectrometer, and provides access to an experimental  group currently performing investigations on the structure  of exotic light nuclei.  These studies on nuclear structure  have important applications in energy research, physics and  astronomy.  ***",
