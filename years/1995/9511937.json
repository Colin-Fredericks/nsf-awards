This study examines the global market processes that have led to a \"commodification\" of poor children and how those processes are worked out in the transnational legal arena and in the adoption policies and practices of the United States and Sweden.  It does so by investigating the connections between global market processes, transnational legal processes, specifically the expansion of formal and informal legal ideologies and practices among those handling adoption, and local practices and policies surrounding adoption in Sweden and the United States.  Its method is ethnographic.  It will contribute to our understanding of  how world legal \"space\" changes and is itself changed by local legal culture and practices.  %%%%  Adoption can be an important process in building strong families and improving the condition of individual deprived children.
