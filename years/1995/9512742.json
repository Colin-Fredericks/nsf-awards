 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schuyler/Church    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Schuyler, Ms. Minette Church  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will  excavate two abandoned farmsteads located in southeastern  Colorado which were occupied in the 19th century. She will also  examine the documentation associated with them. The occupants of  each farm are known: one was Anglo-American, the other Hispanic.  Archaeological investigation will entail four weeks of excavation  at each site as well as examination of the artifacts that prior  survey crews have systematically collected from the surface. The  two homesteads will be mapped in detail with special attention  paid to placement, orientation, spatial layout and construction  of buildings and outbuildings and location of debris. To help  determine land use, flotation samples and pollen cores will be  collected. The results of the excavation of the homesteads, when  combined with collections of oral histories, journals and other  primary documentary sources will supply key information on the  material culture and life at the household level.    This research has two underlying goals. The first is to examine  the role of ethnicity in adaptation. Groups from different  cultural backgrounds moved to this rural region of Colorado to  farm and herd livestock. Anthropologists and historians have  speculated on similarities and differences in adaptation which  occurred and related these both to different forms of social  organization and distance travelled from point of origin. Some  have argued that the single set of environmental conditions led  to cultural convergence while others have postulated that  distinct subcultures were maintained. MS Church will attempt to  determine which view is correct. The second goal is a  methodological one. Because written documentation exists for both  sites, a good deal of a priori control is possible. Ms. Church  wishes to examine the material remains which she collects and  determine the extent to which they reflect ethnicit y. The  methodology she develops and conclusions she draws will be uqeful  in a number of archaeological situations.     This work is important for several reasons. It will increase our  understanding of a dynamic period in American history. It will  shed new light on cultural adaptation and will assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
