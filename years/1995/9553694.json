Designed to promote the adoption of GIS as an integral part of  numerous technically-oriented instructional programs in two-year  colleges, this model program is taking the needed first step in  supplying the workforce in the Midwest with technicians educated in  the use of this rapidly growing technology.  Working in teams of  two or three community college instructors from the same  institution, participants are acquiring the basic principles of GIS  in two 3-week summer institutes and in one continuing education  class.  They are learning of the many ways in which this technology  is used today in business, government, and industry.  The immediate  aim of this project is to give participants sufficient familiarity  with GIS principles and knowledge of software and its utility so  that they can return to their campuses with enough expertise to  begin to incorporate this technology into existing courses.  The  long-term aim envisions participants establishing discrete GIS-  education programs at their institutions. To ensure realization of  project goals, consultants from two-year colleges with successful  GIS programs are advising in organizing all instructional programs  and are part of the summer institutes' teaching teams.  A two-year  college faculty member is serving as project evaluator.    Close cooperation of the Robinson, Illinois campus of Illinois  Eastern Illinois Co mmunity Colleges and the Terre Haute campus of  Indiana Vocational Technical Institute is assured with the  inclusion of faculty teams from those two institutions receiving  GIS instruction in the summer institutes and by providing them with  hardware and software to help facilitate employment of GIS into  their existing courses.  Development of introductory courses in GIS  and integration of GIS into existing courses at these two  institutions is a primary aim of the project.",
