 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501325  Stephens    Recipients of this grant will investigate the relationship between the  structural  and  electrical properties of fullerene  based  compounds.  The  sample  preparation  effort will be  concentrated  on  conducting  polymeric fullerides of A-carbon-60 composition, where A is an  alkali  metal,  and  related compounds.  Materials obtained from collaborators  will  also  be  investigated.  X-ray diffraction and infrared  optical  spectroscopy  will  be performed in the laboratory  of  the  principal  investigators  at  Stony Brook, and also at the  National  Synchrotron  Light  Source  at  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory.   Direct  current  electrical transport will be measured in Stony Brook.  In addition  to  being  a  potentially  useful material in  electronic  and  structural  applications,  the  carbon-60 molecule is also challenging  for  basic  research, as it provides systems in which the electron-phonon coupling  (on  the  molecule) and the electron transport (between the molecules)  may be independently tuned.  %%%  Among the myriad compounds synthesized from buckminster fullerene (the  carbon-60   molecule),  three  groups  have  particularly  interesting  properties:  the  superconductors, the organic ferromagnets,  and  the  electrically  conducting polymers.  The research team at  Stony  Brook  has a proven track record in the investigation of these materials, and  continues  to  explore new compounds based on this remarkable,  highly  symmetric  molecule.   The  main focus  of  the  research  is  on  the  relationship  between structural and electrical properties.   The  two  most extensively utilized experimental tools will be X-ray diffraction  and  optical spectroscopy.  This project will benefit greatly from the  extensive use of instrumentation  and collaboration with scientists at  the  Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Research on fullerenes may  lead  to  novel electronic and structural materials.  The effort funded here  contributes significantly t o this broader goal by utilizing the unique  experimental capabilities available to the investigators.  ***",
