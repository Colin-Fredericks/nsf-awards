 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports a project to compare the modern marine  climate with that of the last interglacial episode in the Bering  Strait region.  The two primary goals of the project are to: (1)  produce detailed records of seasonal temperature ranges as  recorded in the stable isotopic composition of mollusk shells for  the modern and the last interglacial, and (2) infer from the  stable isotope data the distribution of the major water masses  during each time slice.    In the first phase of the project, stable isotope methods will be  applied to an evaluation of the modern hydrography of the Bering  Sea - Chukchi Sea region.  Stable oxygen and carbon isotope  analyses of ostracodes and mollusks from the shelf will allow  quantification of regional differences in water-mass distribution  and latitudinal temperature gradients.  Isotope profiles of the  mollusks will provide a record of the seasonal range of  temperature and might be useful in distinguishing seasonally ice-  free from ice-covered conditions.  This calibration experiment in  the modern system will verify the relationship between the  isotopic composition of shell carbonate and seawater and identify  the geochemical signature of the principal water masses.    In the second phase, the results from the modern system will be  used to evaluate conditions during the highstand of the last  interglacial.  Stable isotope analyses will be performed on  fossil mollusks and ostracodes collected from the emergent  coastal plain deposits of the Pelukian transgression.  Collection  sites span a relatively broad latitudinal range from St. Lawrence  Island to Skull Cliff near Point Barrow; this distribution of  sites samples different water masses and points along the north-  south temperature gradient.  Ostracode specimens collected at  discrete intervals from vertical outcrop sections will provide a  record of isotopic composition changes within the transgressive  units.  Temperature ranges and water-mass variations can be  interpreted  from isotope profiles of mollusks as a complement to  the ostracode data to quantify the seasonal components of marine  paleoclimate.    The underlying scientific goal of the project is to investigate  the physical processes which control the advection of heat into  the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait, and to determine  whether these processes have varied significantly between  interglacial episodes.",
