 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422355  ROBESON       Wind-generated electricity has been viewed as one of the  least expensive and most abundant forms of energy.  Although  considerable attention has been given to overcoming technological  impediments to its use, far less work has been undertaken to  explore the physical characteristics of wind that affect its  utility as an energy resource.  Foremost among those  characteristics is the variability of wind over a variety of  geographic and temporal scales.  The continued development of  wind resources therefore requires better understanding of the  influence of climatic variability and possible climatic change on  the intra-annual and inter-annual variability of wind.  This  project will explore methodological issues inherent in the  development of more accurate and more finely refined wind  resource maps by explicitly considering the effects of regional  wind variability, including statistical analyses of trends,  periodicities, and autocorrelation.  It will examine temporal  variations over shorter time periods, using data gathered from  1961 through 1990 at a number of climatic stations in the  northern Great Plains states of North Dakota and South Dakota to  develop time series of wind power using one-hour, daily, and  monthly average wind speeds.  Following generation of those time  series, they will be statistically decomposed into a number of  components, including linear, daily, and seasonal trends.  These  components will be used to explore new forms of time-series  models for wind power.       This pilot project will facilitate refinement of statistical  approaches that can be used to improve knowledge about factors  that affect wind variability.  This new knowledge should provide  the basis for updating maps of wind resources in the U.S., and it  will permit refined assessments of the potential for developing  wind as an energy resource in different parts of the nation.",
