 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416740  KIRCHMAN      Large numbers of colloids (submicron particles) have been observed  in the ocean and are thought to play key roles in several  geochemical reactions. Preliminary experiments have led to the  hypothesis that colloids are crucial in the production of semi-  refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM) with turnover times  between truly labile compounds (e.g. free amino acids) and  refractory DOM with turnover times >1000 years.  Specifically it is  hypothesized that compounds associated with colloids are degraded  slower than the same compound freely dissolved. Experiments will be  conducted to test this hypothesis and to gain more information  about turnover of naturally-occurring submicron particles.  These  experiments will examine: 1) degradation of 3H-protein sorbed to or  trapped inside 14C-liposomes which mimic colloids produced by  flagellates (flagellate fecal pellets); 2) degradation of 3H-  protein sorbed to or trapped inside 14C-liposomes which mimic  colloids produced by flagellates (flagellate fecal pellets); and   2) degradation of protein adsorbed to natural colloids. Turnover of  colloids will be estimated from the degradation of dual  radiolabeled liposomes and from 14C-labeled flagellate fecal  pellets.  These experiments will be conducted in the Delaware  Estuary and coastal waters during the spring bloom and summer,  which should give a range of colloid types, concentrations and  degradation rates.  The work should provide insight into colloid  turnover, the degradation of DOM in oceanic environments, and  perphaps processes leading to the formation of truly refractory  DOM.",
