 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, funds are provided to improve undergraduate  mathematics education by developing a high-quality computational  environment for students interested in Industrial & Applied  Mathematics (IAM).   The Student Applied Mathematics Computer  Laboratory (SAM-LAB) is being upgraded through the purchase of  networked PC workstations running both UNIX and Windows and  appropriate peripheral hardware.   These workstations will be  connected to the campus network through the purchase of a network  hub.  The SAM-LAB provides a high-quality, dedicated computer  environment for undergraduate majors in engineering technologies  and computer science which will help them acquire strong  analytical, computational, and numerical skills.   Students using  the SAM-LAB and its configuration of computers connected to the  Internet have the opportunity to:  (1) pursue advanced  computational issues such as parallelization, (2) dedicate  computational resources for large tasks, (3) perform carefully  controlled mathematical experiments, and (4) develop an evolving  portfolio consisting of a set of projects.  A lab manual  containing detailed objectives and procedures for each project  developed during the course of this program is being compiled and  will be published.   Experiences with the laboratory will be  publicized at regional American Mathematical Association and  American Physical Society Meetings.   Students are encouraged to  present representative work from their portfolios at these  regional meetings.   Several of the laboratories using  commercially available packages or in-house developed software  will be distributed electronically.   A select number will be  published in appropriate journals.",
