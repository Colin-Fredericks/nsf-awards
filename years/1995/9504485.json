 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS 9504485  PI:  Frits Ruymgaart  Institution:  Texas Tech  Title: Inverse Estimation Problems    Abstract:      Inverse estimation is concerned with indirect curve estimation:  the  curve of interest is to be recovered from observations, subject to  random blur, on a transformation of the curve.  This class of problems  is very broad and formally contains ordinary, direct, curve  estimation as a special case.  Many interesting examples come from  physics, signal processing, statistics, and applied mathematics.  The  estimation problem can essentially be solved by inverting the  transformation involved.  Since this inverse is not in general  continuous, the problem is typically ill-posed and regularization of  the inverse  is required.  Two important questions are how  restriction, due to limitations in time or space, of the  transformation relate to the unrestricted transformation, and how  recovery of irregular curves can be modified so as to avoid the Gibbs  phenomenon.  Along with a comprehensive study of deconvolution on  locally compact Abelian groups, this research addresses these  questions.  Also, the study of some examples of  practical interest are explored.    Inverse estimation arises when an object, e.g.,     part of the human brain, can only be indirectly observed,  and recovery of information about the object  is required from the indirect measurements.      Indirect measurement techniques, such as those used  in medical imagery, are attractive  because they are noninvasive.  Perfect reconstruction of the image would, in  principle, be possible if an unlimited number of uncorrupted  measurements were available.  In practice, however, one can only  obtain finitely many data that, moreover, are corrupted by  measurement errors.  Here statistical considerations and techniques  play a role in the image reconstruction process.  Aspects  addressed in this  research include how the reconstruction  depends on the specific way in which   the indirect data are collected, and al so how it should be tuned to prior  information about the object to be recovered.",
