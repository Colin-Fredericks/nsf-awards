 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523553 Barnett  This research project investigates the kinetic processes and microstructure which occur as a result of glancing angle low energy ion irradiation during MBE growth. Studies of angle-dependent ion damage generation are used to develop new approaches to surface modification, and the use of in-situ ion scattering spectroscopy as a non-destructive analytic technique.  The research also includes efforts to modify surface morphology in island growth, and explores research ideas related to selective epitaxy.  Electrical, optical and structural characterization will be used throughout the research to evaluate the films. %%% The primary goal of this research project is to establish greater basic understanding of particular phenomena relevant to thin film synthesis and processing through the study of glancing angle low energy ion irradiation during molecular beam epitaxy, and to relate this understanding to the development of advanced microelectronics devices through modifications in processing methods.  Additionally, an important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute generally to improving the performance of advanced devices used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications. ***",
