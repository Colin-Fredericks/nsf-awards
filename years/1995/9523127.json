 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523127  Rao   The principal objective of this research is to develop a new class of modeling and computational methods to solve certain very large-scale structural optimization problems.  In particular, the focus is on the topology design of discrete structures, which are recognized as one of the most important and challenging problems in the field of applied optimization.  These new methods are based on the principles of mathematical duality and have so far been deployed with remarkable success in two application classes:  the maximum stiffness design of elastic structures and the minimum weight design of plastic structures.  This work will significantly broaden the class of problems where similar duality-based methods can be applied. The major components of this project are the new modeling capability due to primal-dual transformations in various applications and the efficient, problem specific nonsmooth algorithms that exploit the structure of the resulting min-max formulations.   In advancing the frontiers of modern design techniques, researchers are constantly seeking scientific and mathematical tools by which satisfactory (i.e., feasible) or even optimal designs can be efficiently computed.  While this has lead to numerous very successful applications in a wide cross-section of engineering disciplines, the class of problems related to the topology or configuration design of discrete structures had remained distinctly unsolved until the recent emergence of these duality-based methods.  Further development of these methods will represent a significant advance in applied design optimization, and will show how new and provably optimum topologies can be generated for static and dynamic load-bearing structures in a variety of automotive, civil and aerospace applications.",
