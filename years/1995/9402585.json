 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research between Yorai Wardi of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Jean-Marie Proth of the French National Institute for Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) in Metz, France.  Their objective is to investigate optimization problems frequently found in the preliminary design and management of manufacturing systems. Problems related to production lines, job-shop systems, `Just-In-Time` systems, and assembly systems will be addressed.  They will use Petri nets for developing fast and efficient simulation-based optimization algorithms.  Petri nets are considered a powerful simulation tool for modeling and evaluation of modern manufacturing systems.   In this proposal Petri nets are linked to sensitivity analysis and optimization of manufacturing systems.   The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in analysis of dynamic systems and in numerical models for the optimization of manufacturing systems.  This is complemented by the French investigator's significant research in Petri nets in manufacturing.  In combining these techniques, the proposed research could lead to the development of novel design methods for complex manufacturing systems.",
