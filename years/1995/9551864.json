The college  seeks new methods, curriculum, and teaching strategies to retain  and prepare students for transfer to four-year institutions.  The  approach the Departments of Astronomy, Chemistry, Mathematics,  Earth and Computer Sciences in this project is to provide a greater  amount of active learning through the use of \"hands on\" computer  simulations of projects that previously were lecture only topics.   The subject matter chosen for active learning are abstract topics  and three dimensional presentations that require some  \"visualization\".  Greater \"visualization\" is now possible through  the use of computers using complex graphical, animation, and  simulation programs that allow for the examination and presentation  of math and science topics in ways that never before existed.  By  introducing \"visualization\" in a variety of courses and  assignments, the faculty believe that greater understanding,  appreciation, and retention of course material will occur.  Each of  the five departments have described, and in some cases pilot  tested, projects and subject matter for \"visualization\".  The  departments will share a single multi-disciplinary, multimedia  computer laboratory with both Macintosh and IBM capability.  The  goal is to increase the number of students completing their  bachelor degrees within the next five years.   Since two thirds of  all El Camino students are minority students, a greater transfer  and graduation rate of El Camino students will add to the pool of  minority mathematicians and scientists.  Evaluation of retention  and comparison of test score data will be examined.  Significant  results will be published in professional journals as well as  presentations to regional professional organizations.",
