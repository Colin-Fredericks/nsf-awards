 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central analytic-theoretical task of the project is to  integrate the constraint-based core-periphery model of the  phonological lexicon into Optimality Theory (OT). Optimality  Theory deals with the interaction of phonological constraints  with each other and is built on the idea that constraints are  ranked and violable. Exploratory work on Japanese indicates that  developing the core-periphery model of the lexicon within OT not  only leads to a much improved understanding of lexical  organization and of the principles that give rise to it, but in  turn also makes a contribution to Optimality Theory itself, and  leads to many new empirical and theoretical issues.       These issues will be investigated through detailed empirical  analyses of the phonological lexica of particular languages (in  order to sharpen and test the details of the theory) and through  cross-language surveys (in order to secure the topological  validity of the predictions). The results of the project will be  reported in research articles and conference papers as they  become available; and the main empirical findings and theoretical  conclusions will be consolidated and summarized In a monograph at  the end of the project.",
