 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to make the social sciences  and humanities more meaningful to engineering students,  including women and underrepresented minorities. It is  an  effort to reform undergraduate engineering  education by offering a unique interdisciplinary and  multi-cultural diversity engineering course as part of  the general education curriculum. The course, entitled  \"Technology and Culture\", places specific engineering  designs within the social and political context of  race, gender and individuals. The course is designed to  give technical students a better understanding of the  cultural, historical and political context of their  disciplines. At the same time it gives humanities and  social science students a better understanding of the  methods and capabilities of science and engineering.    The project promotes new interdisciplinary teaching  methods and encourages faculty to experiment with  different ways of incorporating multi-cultural  diversity and gender issues into their courses. It  enlists the cooperation of faculty, departments and  committees across the colleges of engineering and the  liberal arts and sciences. It reinforces this  cooperation through a series of faculty development  workshops emphasizing cultural sensitivity training and  interdisciplinary teaching methods.    The project also serves as a catalyst for reform for  the teaching of other courses that integrate  engineering and science with disciplines in the  humanities and the social sciences.",
