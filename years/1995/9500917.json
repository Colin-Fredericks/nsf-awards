 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Zhong  DMS-9500917      This project treats the almost everywhere behavior and the local smoothing   property of the solutions of the Cauchy problem of the time-dependent   Schrodinger equation with the initial value in a Sobolev space.To study   the almost everywhere behavior of the solutions, by the Stein-Nikishin   theory, it suffices to study the mapping properties of the associated  maximal operators. By the Kolmogrov-Seliverstov-Plessner method, it suffices   to study the mapping properties of the corresponding linearized operators.   The local smoothing properties of the solutions are also the mapping   properties of some linear operators.  To study the mapping properties of the associated linear operators,  the main idea of our approach is to estimate the kernel functions first   and then apply classical Fourier analysis theories   such as the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev theorem for fractional integrals,   the Sobolev embedding theorem, the Calderon-Zygmund singular integral   theory, and Stein's complex interpolation theorem for an analytic family   of linear operators. The Tomas-Stein restriction theorem for the   Fourier transform is related to these mapping properties. For certain   special case, the orthogonality method plays an important role.   The main difficulty is in estimating the kernel functions. Some oscillatory   integral estimates, such as van der Corput type lemma, can be applied.  The ideas of Carleson, Kenig and Ruiz, Sjolin, Vega, Ruiz and Vega seem   to be important here.    The Schrodinger equation is the basic equation of motion in Quantum Mechanics,   which is an important branch of modern Physics.   The results about the existence and the regularity of the solutions of   the Schrodinger equation can be used to explain some phenomena in Physics.   In January, 1926, Schrodinger  invented the Schrodinger equation, which describes the discrete states of   an atom. Since then, the existence and the regularity of the solutions of   the Schrodinger equation have been i mportant research topics in Mathematics   and Physics. In this project, we employ some important techniques in modern   Mathematics to study the regularity of the solutions of the Schrodinger   equation. The complete understanding of these problems will   have some important applications in the areas such as  Fourier Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics.",
