The twenty topics for Season range from earth science, to physical science, to life science, to technology and include programs on such diverse subjects as spiders, time, life cycles, inventions, flowers, architecture, computers, probability, invertebrates, and forensics.      Outreach activities for the third season are designed an emphasis on reaching out to new audiences, especially girls and children of color.  The Season III outreach components consist of:    o \"The Big News of Science\" - a newsletter distributed through youth serving organizations as well as being mailed directly to viewers at home    o An at-home science kit - an easy to use kit that enables children and their families to perform science experiments together at home.  Two-thirds of the kits to be distributed directly to youth and one-third will be distributed to children participating in afterschool and community programs.    o Teacher's Kit - to be distributed to fourth grade teachers nationwide.      o Special appearances - As Bill Nye's schedule permits, he will present a live, traveling science demonstration show in selected urban communities.  The programs will be based at science museums, community centers, or similar venues and will include an explanation about the science content of the series, and demonstrations of science experiments where children are invited to participate.    o A PBS station outreach kit - This material will provide PBS outreach and education staff with programs, tips for developing local science outreach projects, and a list of informal science resources.      The staffing for Season III will remain basically the same as it has been for Seasons I and II.  Bill Nye will remain as Chief Writer and Host,  Elizabeth Brock will continue as Executive Producer, and James McKenna and Erren Gottlieb will remain the series producers.",
