George Mason University    Title: Predictability and Variability of the Present Climate        This research encompasses a number of closely related projects  which are aimed  at understanding the low frequency (monthly to  decadal) variations of the  coupled climate system consisting of the  atmosphere, hydrosphere, land  biosystems, oceans and ice, primarily  in the present climatic regime.  Goals  include both the ability to  simulate these low frequency variations with complex  numerical  models of the individual and coupled systems, and to estimate the   degree to which these variations are predictable.  The methods to  be used will  involve extensive experimentation with existing  numerical models and schemes to  couple them, and extensive  diagnosis and analysis of observational data from  both existing  records and from the retrospective assimilation of atmospheric  data  planned by the major operational centers of the world for the near  future.   In addition to the intrinsic importance of understanding  and predicting the low  frequency variability of the climate system,   this work will help to define the  accuracy and coverage  requirements for current and future climate observing  systems in  order to adequately monitor the current behavior of the climate   system.         1. Predictability of the coupled ocean-land-atmosphere system.    The predictability of this system on both the seasonal and  interannual time  scales will be systematically explored, the former  by a large number of seasonal  atmospheric simulations, and the  latter from integrations of the fully coupled  system.         2. Land-surface-climate interactions.  The importance of   vegetation change, albedo feedback and the global boundary  conditions in the  Sahel drought will be explored.  The potential  impacts of man's activity on  climate through the (hypothetical)  doubling of the world's deserts, global  de forestati   on and the  desiccation of the Aral Sea region will be addressed.         3.  Climate diagnostics.  Diagnostics of the planned  reassimilation of atmospheric  data includes a detailed examination  of the hydrological cycle, and global  energy cycle and the critical  tropical-extratropical interactions.  These  efforts will be aided  by the availability of consistent estimates of the subtle   quantities of divergence, specific humidity and diabetic heating.         4.  Simulation of the present climate.  To test the ability of  numerical models to  simulate the observed low frequency anomalies,  the PIs plan an integration of  the atmospheric model dor about 100  years using observed boundary conditions.   Similarly, they will  integrate the coupled climate system model for several  hundred  years in order to test the realism of its overall statistical  behavior.          5. Climate observing system simulation.  The PIs will estimate  the  sensitivity of the atmospheric circulation to many types of  changes in the  boundary conditions.  They will \"observe\"  numerically modelled climate system  using methods similar to the  current (and future) observing systems for the real  climate to  explore their sampling and accuracy characteristics systematically.     This research is important because it seeks to enhance knowledge  about climate  processes and improvements in predicting climate  variation and change.    Part  of this research is funded under the USGCRP CMAP project.",
