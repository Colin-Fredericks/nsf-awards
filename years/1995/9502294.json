 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project are 1) determining the communication,  synchronization, and architectural requirements for supporting DSM  and 2) developing design guidelines to build efficient wormhole-  routed networks for supporting the DSM models.  The research is  focused on four research directions: developing multicast  algorithms for effective cache-coherency, mechanisms and algorithms  for barrier synchronization, techniques to alleviate hop-spot  problems, and determining the necessary architectural supports.   Theoretical and probabilistic analysis together with simulation  experiments are being used to develop and validate the results.    The educational activities of this project include enhancing and  strengthening the computer architecture curriculum (undergraduate,  graduate core, and graduate research courses), formulating a  capstone design course, undergraduate mentoring, and creating  challenging and interactive environment for graduate learning.",
