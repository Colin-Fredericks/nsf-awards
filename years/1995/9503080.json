The focus of the measurements is electron-  electron interactions, which can be directly measured with the new  technique. Measurements will explore the influence of disorder on  electron systems in detail. The goal is to isolate for the first time  a central physical element of disorder induced effects: correlations  between electrons. Other fundamental issues to be addressed include  electron screening, examined through direct experimental measurement  of corrections to random phase approximation screening calculations.  The relevance of the issues explored in these measurements extends to  virtually all electronic systems, from conventional semiconductors to  new reduced dimensionality systems.  %%%  The  properties  of  metals and semiconductors  can  be  fundamentally  altered by interaction between the electrons present in these systems.  A  new  measurement technique, which provides direct  and  unambiguous  measurement  of  these  otherwise elusive  interactions,  permits  new  approaches to important questions in these materials. The influence of  disorder  on  electronic  properties is one area  to  be  explored  in  detail. Another area is the degree to which the electrons collectively  shield  themselves  from  external  forces  and  voltages,  a  complex  phenomena  notoriously difficult to calculate directly. The  relevance  of  the issues explored in these measurements extends to virtually all  electronic   systems,   from  conventional   semiconductors   to   new  nanostructured materials.  ***",
