 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lynn C. Francesconi, Chemistry Department, CUNY Hunter College, is   supported by the Inorganic,  Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career   Advancement Award to prepare technetium oxide molecules and to pursue a   five pronged program to improve the educational experiences offered at   Hunter College. In the research component technicium will be incorported   into cage polyoxoanion structures of tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and   phosphorus. In the educational component outside institutional research   collaborations will be established and the supervision of undergraduate   research students will be delegated to graduate students in order the   improve the relevance and vitality of the graduate training. At the   undergraduate level increased laboratory participation will be   accomplished by a redesign of the courses and the undergraduate research   experience, communication and student involvement will be increased in   the freshman course through the institution of a workshop approach, and a   new inorganic chemistry lecture course will be devised.  Technecium is used as an imaging agent in medicine and occurs as a   component in radioactive wastes. This research will produce new compounds   which may be valuable both in the imaging application and point the way   to substances which can efficiently remove technecium from water   solutions. The educational efforts will improve the teaching program at   Hunter College, particularly as it relates to minority students.",
