The next aim is to  develop some ef  ficient numerical algorithms for their solution. Generally, an  inverse problem  consists in finding a coefficient of source term in a partial  differential equa  tion from an additional boundary or scattering data. Also of  interest are cer-  tain unknown domains entering a boundary value problem. Elliptic,  parabolic, an  d hyperbolic equations will be studied. Accordingly we focus on  the inverse  conductivity problem, inverse scattering and seismic problems.  The additional  data which are generated by single or many   boundary measurements will be considered. A special attention  will be paid to  use of local boundary data, finite number of scattering  frequencies, and to  identification of non-linear equations. The powerful methods of  PDE and Complex  Variables are supposed to be used which include potential theory,  Carleman type  estimates, complex geometrical optics, and Fourier Integral  Operators. The work  is planned to be a deep theoretical and subsequent numerical  investigation of  challegning applied problems, like acoustic, electrical, and  seismic prospec-  ting in geophysics and medicine, as well as cracks detection and  finding physi-  cal constitutive laws from results of boundary measurements of  physical fields.  %%%  This project is dedicated to challenging and important problems  of applied  mathematics which will be studied by contemporary mathematical  means. This is  expected to answer several questions about possibility of  evaluation of  important characteristics of physical and medical objects from  relatively cheap  ,non-destructive, and feasible exterior measurements. A deeper  understanding of  nonclassical and hard mathematical questions will generate better  and reliable  numerical algorithms. This must lead to efficient methods of  medical diagnostic  from electrical, magnetic, and u ltrasound data, of cracks  detection. The method  s of finding (non-linear)   laws governing several complicated  systems in che-  mistry and engineering promises to enhance possibilities of  mathematical simula  tion and to reduce cost of developement of new technologies.  ***",
