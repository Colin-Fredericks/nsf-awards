 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510585  AHN    How do people learn new concepts?  Previous studies in  categorization fall into two camps, similarity-based and theory-  based views.  The similarity-based view assumes that natural  categories in the world look coherent to us because members in  the same categories are similar to each other whereas the members  in different categories are dissimilar to each other.  The  theory-based view rose in reaction to the similarity-based view,  which tended to neglect the role of existing background  knowledge.  Many researchers have shown that background knowledge  or context drastically changes similarities among object.  For  example, a person from Maine and a person from Florida might look  very different from each other if they are compared in Washington  D.C.  But if they are compared in Tokyo, they would look very  similar to each other because the feature, \"being an American\"  would become salient in the context of Tokyo.  One's background  knowledge also plays a crucial role in categorization.  For  example, students learn to classify a whale as a mammal because  of their background knowledge on mammals, although a whale is  perceptually more similar to fish.  This research will focus on  the structural or syntactic aspect of causal background  knowledge.  That is, how does the status of features in causal  structure determine various similarity functions and  categorization processes?  Suppose a patient displays typical  symptoms of Disease X except for one symptom.  The idea is that  the impact of this missing symptom in further diagnosis or  categorization depends on the causal status of the symptom in the  clinician's background knowledge.  The long-term goal of this  project is to develop a computational model of categorization   incorporating causal knowledge.  Developing a computational model  is very important for both theoretical and practical reasons.  On  the theoretical side, a computational model will allow  researchers to generate precise predictions to be tested t hrough  experiments.  On the practical side, a precisely defined  computational model can serve as a basis for tutoring systems  which can diagnose students' background knowledge and tailor   instruction for each individual.  Teachers can also be aware of  biases that students might display in learning new concepts  because of their initial background knowledge.  This kind of  computational model can also  be used for developing expert  systems which can spontaneously learn new  concepts and serve as  aids for human experts.  This Research Planning Grant (RPG) will  allow Ahn to collect pilot data on categorization and similarity  judgment tasks which manipulate causal structures, and (2) to  test existing computational models on these tasks.  The aim of  the RPG is to come up with a coherent framework for approaching  the issues discussed above, so that the output of this  preliminary research can be used to develop a full proposal for  the regular funding competition.    ***",
