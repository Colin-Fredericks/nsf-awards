 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the project is on that area of hydraulics dealing  with phenomena of open channel flow.   Recent natural disaster,  such as the Mississippi basin flooding, demonstrate that a  greater awareness of the forces of nature and the principles of  open channel flow are needed in our society to plan and develop  better optimum infrastructures.  This project integrates physical  laboratory experimentation in hydraulics and data acquisition  techniques with engineering calculations to facilitate the  graphical/pictorial and animation power of the computer to create  an integrated multivisual presentation.   The laboratory setting,  part of the Civil Engineering Technology and Environmental  Studies program at the colleges, is analogous to a modern day  process \"control room\" with multiple displays providing student  groups with the capability for interactive learning.   Students  receive different perspectives of data, relevant equation,  experimental dynamics, visual enimation, and actual real-world  photos/videos of the phenomena under study.  System integration  requires the utilization of an open channel testing flume  structure; computer hardware and software; optical discs; and  software (media) production processes to develop a coherent  story-line and interactive presentation of the experiment for on-  line student understanding.   As part of this project, students  are being exposed to problems of environmentally related channel  flow as experienced in the area.   Project outcomes are suitable  for demonstrations to K-12 secondary public school students, to  motivate interest in science and technology.",
