 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9511710  Driscoll, Monica A.      All living organisms have the ability to sense and respond to  mechanical stimuli.  Mechanotransduction is critical to such  diverse processes as hearing, touch and gravitaxis in plants and  animals.  Mechanotransduction in all species studied to date  appears to be mediated by ion channels that open or close in  response to mechanical stimuli.  The genes encoding these channels  have been identified but an examination of the subunit structures,  composition and assembly has yet to be undertaken.  Dr. Driscoll  has been instrumental in identifying these novel channels in a  simple biological model system and she proposes to continue her  studies with these interesting proteins.  In the proposed studies,  she will determine how these channels assembled and which subunits  are linked together into functional units.  Additionally, since  tension must be applied to the channel for it to open or close, the  implication is that it is somehow anchored into the cell.  Further  studies will identify the normal constituents of the cellular  skeleton that serve as the anchor point for these channels.   Through these studies, Dr. Driscoll will gain unique insights into  the biochemical nature of the mechanisms by which cellular  distention is involved in changing cellular function.  In addition,  since mechanical forces are involved in changing cellular function  in mammals as well as simple organisms, new insights may be gained  about the mechanisms in which sonic or tactile information are  transduced in humans thereby opening new avenues of clinical  significance.",
