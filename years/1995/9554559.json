Strategies for the solution  of these problems must be based on  an interdisciplinary, coordinated  approach, with a systems  perspective. In this proposal we  describe an innovative visionary  graduate program in Engineering  Systems at the Colorado School of  Mines. This course of study is  deliberately designed to integrate  across traditional boundaries with  the intent of enabling graduates to  see connections between disparate  disciplines and methods of  analysis, to think in terms of a  systems approach, and to comprehend  the demands of the societal and  global marketplace. The proposal  sets forth the application of the  Engineering Systems Curricula and  research agenda to the problems of  the civil infrastructure, and  demonstrates how this program will  provide a strong and creative model  for training engineers to address  civil infrastructure problems. The  three focus areas of the  Engineering Systems program, energy  systems, mechanics and structural  systems, and applied sensors and  automation systems, each applies  directly to several civil  infrastructure problem areas. With  this background, graduates will  have the technical expertise, the  systems methodology, and the  corporate perspicacity to  effectively champion sound  technology transfer. Graduates will  be industry-oriented to take  leadership roles for rebuilding the  civil infrastructure.",
