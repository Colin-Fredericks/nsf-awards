 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development, construction and testing of  new architectures for high-speed computing. The idea being  exploited is that of combining in a loosely-coupled fashion,  general-purpose, RISC-based processing nodes each with multiple  field-programmable-logic-array(FPLA) based coprocessor systems.  With this kind of system, one has the hardware properties of a  general-purpose computer, but the advantage, brought about by  suitable reconfigurability, of performance more akin to that of a  special-purpose engine. In particular, the 20-node Armstrong III  system has been built and is operational and provides nearly  two-orders of magnitude improvement over current advanced  workstations. The hardware system, combined with its configuration  compiler, a program that automatically translates a C function  subroutine to both machine code and to the hardware design of the  reconfigurable coprocessors, are the basic building blocks for this  class of architectures. Thus, this research is directly focused on  one of the strategic areas of national concern, that of high  performance computing.    There is uniqueness to this program in that not only has the  hardware/software system been built, but it is also being tested on  important, real applications. In particular, the training of a  modern hidden Markov model(HMM) based speech recognition system  requires hundreds of hours, even with some of the variants  developed recently at Brown and elsewhere. The reduction of this  training time to ten or so minutes means that research progress in  this area may be made at a faster rate and/or that expensive  nonlinear optimization techniques may now be applied to the  problem. Also, this means that data from a less cumbersome sensor  system (the microphone array systems in place and being developed  at Brown) can be suitably incorporated into a more robust speech  recognition system. Currently, eight PhD students, two ScM students  and five undergraduates are involved with this project; ni ne PhD's  have been graduated from this project under past funding.",
