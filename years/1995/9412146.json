 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spence  9412146    A three year program of research is proposed of atomic  bonding in crystals, at interfaces and at defects.  Ceramics  and intermetallic compounds will be studied using a  combination of ab-initio quantum molecular dynamics  computations, self-consistent calculations and experimental  measurements of bond charge distributions by quantitative  convergent beam electron diffraction method.  The Zeiss  Omega energy-filtering electron microscope at the Arizona  State University center for High Resolution Electron  Microscopy will be used for the experimental work.  Principal Investors propose a new technique based on the  specular electron beam reflected from a metal-ceramic  interface in the transmission geometry for reflection  imaging, microanalysis and bonding studies of buried  interfaces.  This work is collaborative with C.P. Flynn.  For perfect crystals, in which bonds have been \"seen\" for  the first time only recently,  Principal Investors propose  bond charge distribution measurements in titanium-aluminum  and a series of ionic crystals in order to test the accuracy  of self-consistent computations based on the local density  approximation.  Measured bond distributions will be compared  for titanium-aluminum with and without  manganese doping,  which is found to reduce brittleness.  In ferroectric  crystal Principal Investigators plan comparisons of charge  transfer between titanium and oxygen in strontium titanate  and isostructural barium titanate oxygen in order to  understand why one is ferroelectric and the other not.  %%%  The proposed research seeks to investigate the origins of  atomic bonding in crystals, at interfaces and defects.  Ceramics and intermetallic compounds will be studied using a  combination of theoretical calculations and experimental  measurements of bond charge distributions by quantitative  techniques.  ***",
