 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMR-9502675  Clark    Experimental and modeling studies directed toward  understanding the  collective behavior of strongly interacting spherical  particle systems will be  carried out.  Experiments will exploit the large length and  time scales  characteristic of colloidal suspensions of polymer spheres  to probe  equilibrium and nonequilibrium collective properties such as  melting, crystal  nucleation and growth, shear-induced melting and rheology.  Experimental  techniques include optical microscopy and digital image  analysis, static and  quasielastic light scattering, and x-ray diffraction.  The  modeling will focus  on exploring the roles of geometric and topological defects  on liquid  structure, equilibrium melting, and shear-induced melting.  %%%  Systems of interacting spherical particles (colloids) are of  fundamental  interest in condensed matter physics.  They are the simplest  way to exhibit  the still poorly understood melting-crystallization  transition.  Colloids  exhibit the unique combination of softness of interaction,  slowness in  motion, and large spacing between particles that enables  their effective use  in the study of spherical particle behavior.  Experiments  involving a variety  of optical techniques will be combined with model  calculations to study  recrystallization and glass formation as well as the  importance of structural  defects.  ***",
