This  fellowship will enable Dr. Reimer to begin a collaboration with  Dr. Hiroo Hashizume of the Tokyo Institute of Technology to  develop new x-ray methods to investigate two-dimensional physics:  the understanding of surfaces and interfaces.  This project aims  to develop new methods of finding the atomic structures of  surfaces and interfaces based on high-intensity x-ray scattering  experiments.    The research program is in the spirit of the Program objectives  to transfer and exchange scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr.  Reimer will make measurements and become familiar with research  techniques and equipment at the nearby Photon Factory synchrotron  in Tsukuba, in addition to other contributions to the research  effort.  The fellowship will enable Dr. Reimer to work with a premier  researcher, as well as developing personal and professional  connections with a wider group of researchers at one of Japan's  foremost research facilities.",
