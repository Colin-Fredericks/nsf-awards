 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507388  Zera    Life  history  traits, such as the age at which reproduction  begins,  total  egg  production  and  duration  of  juvenile  development     differ    dramatically    among     species.  Understanding how these differences evolve is  an  important  part   in   understanding  modern  patterns  of   biological  diversity, yet we know very little about the mechanisms that  are responsible for variation in life histories.  This study  will  identify  differences  in  endocrine  mechanisms  that  underlie  the  first stages of life history  evolution.   It  will  determine  how  genetically  based  variation  in  key  developmental and reproductive hormones cause populations to  differ  il  life history traits, using crickets as  a  model  system.  The research will show whether differences  in  age  of  onset of reproduction result from differences in  timing  and  concentration  of juvenile hormone levels,  or  whether  they  result from genetically based differences  in  ovarian  hormone  receptors.   The results will reveal  the  role  of  genetic  differences in juvenile hormone or molting  hormone  systems  in  producing correlation between the  duration  of  juvenile  development and the onset of  adult  reproduction.  The research is a synthesis of evolutionary genetics, insect  endocrinology, and life history evolution.  It will identify  for  the  first time the specific mechanisms  that  underlie  genetic  differences in life history traits and correlations  between those traits.  In the long term, it may lead to  new  approaches to managing insect populations.",
