 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research in support of the Advanced Materials Processing Program are funding Dr. Seth Marder of the California Institute of Technology to organize and run three annual NSF Materials Chemistry Workshops.  These workshops provide an opportunity for informal discussion among scientists with diverse backgrounds emphasizing progress, research ideas, and directions in the growing area of materials chemistry. Attendance will be by application, including a one-page abstract of the research area to be discussed.  Selection of approximately 30 applicants will be based on merit by a committee chosen by the organizers which includes participants from the previous workshops.  Participants will be drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories at all stages of careers and backgrounds.  Junior faculty, women, and underrepresented minorities will be strongly encouraged.  Two discussion leaders will be invited in addition to the thirty speaking participants.   Each participant will make a 30-minute presentation followed by a compulsory discussion period of at least 10 minutes.     The goals of the three-day weekend sessions will be to provide a format for lively discussion and to produce a document which provides a consensus of opinion for the future of materials chemistry education and research.  Such discussion will help identify new directions and opportunities for chemists and chemistry in NSF's Advanced Materials and Processing Program.",
