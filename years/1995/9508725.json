 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508725  Wierman   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Based   Graduate Research Assistantships provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend   part of their time in the classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting. These   awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the   nation.   One important function of the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH), Centers for   Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is to estimate the number of people who die each   year from smoking, or smoking attributable mortality (SAM).  SAM is a function of the   attributable fraction (AF) associated with smoking and the total number of deaths.  The    attributable fraction, in turn, is a function of the relative risk (RR) associated with smoking   and smoking prevalence. One of the relevant methodological issues in estimating SAM is   how to properly adjust the SAM for confounding factors such as age, sex, race,   occupation, etc.  Methodology does not yet exist for adjusting the SAM when the SAM is   estimated using two independent data sources. One aspect of this research is to study a   quasi-likelihood based method of estimation. Another area of research will be a study of   the relationship between exposure to acrylontrile and cause-specific mortality, particularly   cancers of the lung, brain, prostate and stomach.",
