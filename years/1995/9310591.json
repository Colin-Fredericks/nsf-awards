 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310591  Wisher           This research, part of the Joint Gobal Ocean Flux Study  (JGOFS) of the Arabian Sea, addresses the question of  whether the widespread suboxic conditions below the euphotic  zone in the Arabian Sea restrict carbon cycling by metazoans  primarily to regions above and below the oxygen minimum zone  and whether this results in elevated carbon concentrations  (in the form of plankton biomass) at depth.  This project  has two foci: (1)  the measurement of mesozooplankton  distributions and size-fractionated biomass in vertical  strata to the deep sea, with particular attention to the  oxygen minimum zone and its upper and lower interfaces, and  (2)  examination of oxygen minimum zone effects on  zooplankton trophic relationships, including the potential  zooplankton-bacteria link.  Vertically stratified  zooplankton samples down to 3500 m will be taken during four  seasons with a MOCNESS plankton net system day and night at  the four intensive JGOFS stations and at intervals along  transects between the stations for the determination of  mesozooplankton distributions and size-fractionated biomass.  Gut contents of zooplankton will be analyzed by transmission  electron microscopy for determination of trophic webs.  The  potential bacteria-zooplankton link will be investigated  further with the use of molecular probes.  The upper and  lower interfaces of the oxygen minimum zone, which may be  locations of high zooplankton and particle abundances and  intense processing of organic material, will be specially  targetted for studies of distributions and food webs.  Low  mesozooplankton abundances within the oxygen minimum zone  may contribute to enhanced fluxes of organic materials to  the sea floor, because the utilization of particulate  material in midwater by these detritivores would be reduced.  High mesozooplankton abundances and a short food chain  (bacteria to zooplankton) at the oxygen minimum zone  interfaces would suggest intense processing of organic  material localiz ed within a narrow depth window, possibly  acting as a filter for sinking particles.  This work will  help elucidate how organic material may be altered during  passage through the water column to the sea floor.  It will  contribute to understanding how the seasonal monsoom cycle  of the Arabian Sea and resultant productivity peaks are  coupled to carbon fluxes and deposition and may provide some  analogies for predicting effects of climate change.",
