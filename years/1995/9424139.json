 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award provides supports to continue a cooperative research  program between the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Michigan  State University, the Yakut Science Center (YSC, Yakutsk,  Russia), and the Northeast Interdisciplinary Scientific Research  Institute (NEISRI, Magadan, Russia) which was initiated in 1990.  The research program is interdisciplinary, using paleomagnetism,  geochronology, geochemistry, seismology and structural geology to  study the Mesozoic to Cenozoic tectonic history of northeastern  Russia from the edge of the Siberian platform up to, and  including, the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt (OCVB).  The study  area includes the zone of Mesozoic accretion of terranes of both  Arctic and Pacific origins and the present-day plate boundary  between North America (NA) and Eurasia (EU).  So far, this  cooperative project has detected an age progression among  Mesozoic granites, identified a widespread paleomagnetic  overprint in the northwestern Kolyma Structural Loop (KSL), and  obtained previously published paleomagnetic data for the region.  Earthquake focal mechanisms, based on regional and teleseismic  data, reveal that crustal shortening in the region, driven by the  opening of the Arctic Ocean is being relieved by the extrusion of  the Okhotsk (OK) plate to the southeast.   To expand  understanding of the KSL, this project will focus on its  southeastern end, where formations similar to those studied in  the northeastern part of the loop turn from a southeasterly  strike to a northeasterly one.  This region also lies along the  NA-OK plate boundary and fault traces and seismically generated  features are visible in low resolution satellite images.  The  next phase of work will involve two transects by NEISRI and the  YSC along the Kolyma and Indigirka Rivers, and analysis the  samples collected.  These transects cross the Kular-Nera slate  belt, the Omulevka composite terrane, the Il'in-Tas formation, or  their along-strike equivalents.  These units represent,  according  to one model, the Late Jurassic forearc, arc, and back-arc  deposits of the Uyandina-Yasachnaya island arc which was located  on or near the edge of the Kolyma-Omolon superterrane (K-OS);  this model, however, is still open to considerable debate,  especially relating to the polarity of subduction.  The primary  objectives here are to determine the age and polarity of the  Uyandina arc, the relationship between the K-OS and the Viliga  shelf terrane, the extent of the paleomagnetic overprint, whether  oroclinal bending occurs, the age and paleolatitude of the Late  Cretaceous OCVB, the detailed tectonics and location of the NA-OK  plate boundary, and the crustal structure of the region.  Resolution of these problems will aid in constraining the  tectonic evolution of northeast Russia, which has implications  for the tectonics of the North Pacific and the Arctic Ocean.  In  particular, this work will aid in determining the timing and  methodology of the isolation of the Arctic basin which has impact  on paleoclimatology.  The seismic studies will help in  constraining the amount of crustal thickening resulting from  compression and aid in wave propagation studies and nuclear test-  ban monitoring.",
