 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meinzer  9419500    Transpiration, or evaporation of water from the leaves of  plants, is a biological process that has a large impact on  our physical environment through its effects on soil water  storage, atmospheric water content, and the distribution of  rainfall.  Little is known about how plant species in  tropical forests partition and regulate their use of soil  water in time and space, yet such information is critical  for predicting the effects of deforestation and climatic  fluctuations on the water balance of tropical as well as  temperate regions.  The overall goal of this research is to  determine how water movement along a continuum from the soil  through plants to the atmosphere is regulated in contrasting  types of tropical forest plants such as upper canopy trees,  characteristic of mature forests, and forest gap colonizing  plants, which may be representative of regrowth after  harvest.  The project will be carried out at three sites  operated by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in  Panama.  The relative roles of external environmental  factors and inherent plant traits in the regulation of water  use will be characterized.  The research will provide  unique, detailed information about how soil water resources  in a seasonally dry environment are shared in time and space  among different types of plants.  General patterns that  emerge will be applicable to temperate zone forests and  other plant communities as well as tropical forests.  The  findings will contribute to our ability to predict how water  use by vegetation at the stand and regional scales is  influenced by species composition and should constitute a  valuable contribution to the data necessary to make informed  decisions in watershed management.",
