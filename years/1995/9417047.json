The emphasis is on defects, intermediate  degrees of order, and the interplay between geometry and  statistical mechanics.  Columnar liquid crystals, often composed of  semiflexible polymers, provide fascinating examples of partially  ordered systems, with material properties influenced by linear  vacancy and interstitial defects.  Such defects have no analogue in  assemblies of point-like particles.  Additional challenging  problems arise when the polymers are chiral, as in DNA or the  polypeptide poly (y-benzyl glutamate) (PBG).  Work on flux pinning  in semiconductors is directed at predicting optimal vortex pinning  structures, such as splayed columnar defects induced by heavy ion  radiation.  A complete understanding of the resulting \"splayed  glass\" and flux liquid phases requires an extension of quantum  mechanics in the equivalent many-body boson problem to allow for a  quenched random imaginary vector potential.  Studies of vortex  smectics and entanglement around fixed obstacles are also planned.   The existence of the flat phase and a continuous broken symmetry in  flexible polymerized membranes raises interesting questions about  closely related spin systems in two dimensions.  Investigations  will be made on a dyadic spin model which interpolates between  Heisenberg-like systems, for which genuine long-range order is  impossible, and tehered membranes, which have now been observed  experimentally to exhibit continuous symmetry-breaking.  %%%  The interplay between geometry and statistical mechanics which  arises in certain liquid crystalline polymers, in high temperature  superconductors, and in magnetic materials will be studied.   Polymer liquid crystal phases, such as those prepared from  biological materials, like DNA double helix and certain a rtificial  proteins, can be strongly influenced by the effects of chirality,  i.e., by the lack of mirror symmetry in these macromolecules.    It is hoped to investigate vacancy and interstitial defects, and to  understand how chirality can cause such polymers to braid up  spontaneously.  This work may eventually lead to strategies for  synthesizing stronger polymeric materials.  Many applications of  the new high temperature superconductors require efficient pinning  of quantized lines of magnetic field called vortices.  In  additional work, optimal arrangements of defects in the underlying  crystal which pin the vortices in place will be searched.  Finally,  the relationship between oder in a special class of magnetic  materials and the crumpling of sheet polymers will be studied.",
