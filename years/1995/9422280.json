Both the theory and the   practice of constructing a physical model, described mathematically in the form of a   matrix, from prescribed spectral data will be investigated.  This proposal continues and   extends previous studies.  In particular, a dynamical system for each inverse eigenvalue   problem will be formulated to ensure that a specific task is taking place continuously.  The   dynamics will then be explored using computer experiments, high resolution graphics and   symbolic manipulation, in conjunction with analysis. This study should lead to fundamental   advances in the understanding of inverse eigenvalue problems.  This project is expected to   find important applications ranging from new development of numerical algorithms to   theoretical solutions of difficult problems.  Since inverse eigenvalue problems arise from a   wide variety of disciplines, the resulting technology would have impact on a number of   scientific and engineering fields.    Inverse eigenvalue problems arise in many important applications, including control   design, vibration isolation, system identification, exploration and remote sensing, and   signal processing.  A significant common phenomenon in all these areas of application is   that the physical parameter of a certain system is to be reconstructed from knowledge or   expectation of its dynamical behavior, in particular its natural frequencies and/or normal   modes.  The advances obtained from this proposed work will contribute to the   understanding of issues that arise in several strategic areas, particularly in the areas of   global change, manufacturing, transportation, and environmental monitoring.",
