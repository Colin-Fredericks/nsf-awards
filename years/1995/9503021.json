 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503021  Alexander   This research will be undertaken as part of the CRISP (Combined Research Industry  Scholarship Project) under the 1994-95 GOALI (Grants Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) initiatives.  The aim of the GOALI initiatives was to provide some mechanism to encourage and promote industry-university partnerships to work on research problems of interests to industry.  It is believed that such partnerships can grow and lead to other meaningful joint industry-university research projects that can be of benefit to both industry and academia.  The industrial partner for this research is Liqui-Dri Foods, a Division of Quaker Corporation.  The objective of the research is to reduce process variability with an emphasis on improving the control systems of fill process lines at Liqui-Dri/Quaker.  The control systems were designed to keep four filling lines at Liqui-Dri/Quaker on target.  However, the workers tend to shut off these control systems because they feel the control systems are slow to react.  This study is aimed at integrating monitoring systems with the automatic control systems in order to detect the changes in the underlying process models used by the control systems to predict system state.   In the research, a diagnostic module will be used to determine the form of the disturbances and probable causes of system instability.  The design and use of fuzzy controllers for controlling the process will also be investigated.   Due to its applied nature, the participants on this project stand to draw some significant benefits from it.  For the industrial partner, control of process variability will translate to enhanced product quality and reduced losses due to potential overfill.  The reliability of the system will be enhanced.   From the academic points of view, the researchers will gain some practical experiences on a real industrial problem. However, on a more general perspective, outcome of this research can be applied to a host of industrial problems where close m itering and monitoring are critical to line reliability and functionality.",
