This activity is  part of the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the  Environment) Program, a developing international program, housed in  an office in the White House.  Goals of GLOBE are to link  scientists and school children in a global information network,  with the shared goal of better understanding the Earth's  environment and changes that take place within.  The New Hampshire  team will develop teacher enhancement materials, provide training  to teachers and other instructors, and develop data integration and  program assessment materials following the initial April, 1995  sampling activities.  Data collected by students and evaluated by  scientists will be part of a study of the health of the white pine  trees, a known bioindicator for tropospheric ozone damage.  This  data will be linked to the international effort of the GLOBE  Program.",
