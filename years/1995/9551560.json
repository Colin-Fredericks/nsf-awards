 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is designed to increase the involvement of  undergraduate sociology students in research.   Using MicroCase  software on a portable microcomputer with high quality projection  equipment, instructors test student-generated hypotheses in 11  substantive and methodological sociology classes.   Students also  participate in research by doing assignments and writing term  papers that involve testing hypotheses using microcomputers  located in a Social Science Computer Cluster.   The faculty  coordinates in selecting software so that the same software is  used across several courses.   For the first year and in  lower-division courses, simple software, such as MicroCase, is  being used.   In upper-division courses, software such as  SPSS-Windows, PC Globe, and U.S.  Census software for the CD-ROM  is being used.   This project funds the purchase of the  computers, software, and projection equipment that is necessary.    Involving students in research across the entire curriculum is  important because (a) students retain more of the content of the  courses, since they are active learners; (b) students are  challenged to think critically, and (c) students gain experience  and training they can use in a variety of occupations as  professional sociologists.",
