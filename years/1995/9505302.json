 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9505302  Alivisatos    Semiconductor nanocrystals are a new type of material exhibiting a  wide range of size dependent optical, electrical, and thermodynamic  properties. A great deal is now known about the interior  composition and structure of nanocrystals, but relatively little is  known about their interfaces. The aim of this work is to develop  the ability to control the composition and structure of  semiconductor nanocrystal interfaces. This is necessary before the  physics of quantum confinement can be understood and before the  technological promise of this class of materials can be assessed.  Two main tools will be used: 1) photoelectron spectroscopy and  related techniques, and 2)  infrared reflection-absorption  spectroscopy. Using an ordinary X-ray source, it will be possible  to routinely identify and potentially to manipulate the chemical  identity of the nanocrystal surface species. With the Advanced  Light Source synchrotron, it will be possible to perform  photoemission experiments at higher resolution and with variable  photon energy. These experiments will be targeted at measuring  average bond lengths, and the density of interior and surface  electronic states, both occupied and unoccupied. Infrared  reflection-absorption spectroscopy will be used to identify the  chemical species present, and the nature of their bonding. If the  nanocrystals can be oriented in the chemical deposition process,  then orientational information can also be extracted.  %%%  Semiconductor nanocrystals are a new type of material exhibiting a  wide range of size dependent optical, electrical, and thermodynamic  properties. The limiting factor scientifically and technologically  in the area of nanocrystals is inadequate understanding and control  of the nanocrystal surface. In optical spectroscopy, trap levels  associated with the interface strongly influence absorption and  emission linewidths and lifetimes. In electrical studies, all  carriers must pass through the interface. In thermo dynamic studies,  the fact that order 50% of the atoms are at the surface strongly  influences the phase diagrams. A great deal is now known about the  interior composition and structure of nanocrystals, but relatively  little is known about their interfaces. The objective of this work  is to construct a \"surface science\" of nanocrystals, just as there  is one for plane crystal surfaces.",
