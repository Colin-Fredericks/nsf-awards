 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418018  Hixon      This award will support the participation of ten American marine   ecologists at a workshop entitled \"The Recruitment and Population  Dynamics of Coral Reef Fishes\" to be held near Townsville,  Queensland, Australia, July 10 through 14, 1995.  The American  organizer is Dr. Mark A. Hixon from the Department of Zoology at  Oregon State University.  The Australian principal organizer is  Dr. Geoffrey P. Jones from the Department of Marine Biology at  the James Cook University of North Queensland.    Both the United States and Australia have become increasingly  concerned about the health of their coral-reef resources.  Coral-reef fishes have become recognized as ideal model systems  for furthering insight into the dynamics of marine fish  populations.  The idea that populations of coral-reef fishes   are recruitment limited by larval supply has become both popular  and increasingly controversial.  Researchers from both countries  have become polarized in their thinking about recruitment  limitation, resulting in a conceptual stalemate that seems to be  inhibiting scientific progress.  By bringing together top  investigators from both countries, including a selected few from  Canada, Japan, France and the United Kingdom, the workshop will  seek to begin the resolution of this controversy. Among the  topics to be considered are appropriate spatial scales for reef   fish studies, competition effects on survivorship, predation  and density-dependence, recruitment limitation, and the  management and conservation of reef fisheries.    Australian support for this workshop is provided by the  Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST).",
