The course which uses  transducers interfaced to microcomputers will be further developed  and expanded during the period of the present proposal, and the  results adapted for and shared with a diverse population of high  school teachers and their students and 2 year college faculty and  students. The makeup of the Rutgers-Newark student body and the  geography and demographics of the Newark area, coupled with  significant outreach efforts, ensures a large minority student  participation in this project. Teaching and learning strategies  geared to the needs of a diverse urban student population will be  developed. These strategies will utilize non intimidating but  rigorous discovery based and goal oriented experiments and will  provide a meaningful and accurate introduction to the excitement  and creativity of scientific discovery and analysis. The course  will develop and use modern sensors for motion, force, temperature,  sound and electromagnetic field measurements. The sensors are  interfaced to microcomputers, allowing the students to acquire data  and analyze their measurements rapidly in order to explore  alternative physical hypotheses. The project will attract more  students into physics and engineering, and will produce better  educated students with critical analytical skills in all majors.",
