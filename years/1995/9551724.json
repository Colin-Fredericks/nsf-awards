 "awd_abstract_narration": "The revision of the chemistry curriculum centers around the  acquisition of an automated gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer  with volatile and semivolatile capability.   In addition to  gaining experience with complex multicomponent analyses and  automated systems with this equipment, students analyze more  unknowns during one laboratory exercise than they once completed  during their entire undergraduate career.  The objectives of the  project are:  (1) modifications of existing courses; (2)  development of new courses focused on environmental applications;  (3) development of an emphasis area in applied chemistry; and (4)  support for interdisciplinary undergraduate research.    University faculty, students, and the Spokane Intercollegiate  Research and Technology Institute are collaborating to  disseminate and evaluate the project from the perspective of  regional universities and employers.",
