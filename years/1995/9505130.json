Recently the investigator has constructed a category of spectra  with a symmetric monoidal smash product.  The construction is  elementary and will provide an introduction to spectra which will  not scare away the novice.  The strict associativity of the smash  product means that many other definitions regarding spectra can be  greatly simplified.  For example, one can easily discuss ring  spectra, commutative ring spectra, module spectra.  The  investigator is using this new definition of ring spectra in the   study of topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic  homology.       Spectra have been developed over the last thirty years as a  bridge between the geometric problems that the algebraic topologist  studies and the algebraic techniques which he uses.  The earliest  examples were given by Rene Thom in his work on the cobordism  classification of manifolds, where he showed that manifolds, the  geometric objects common to mathematics and physics, are classified  up to cobordism by certain spectra.  Over the years, as one needed  spectra having more and more properties, many different  constructions have been given.  These constructions have became  increasingly complicated, until only a few experts could understand  them.  However, recently the investigator has found a much easier  way to construct spectra that nonetheless have all the properties  one needs for the applications.  This makes the field far more  accessible, especially to graduate students, and should lead to  much fuller appreciation of this powerful tool.  ***",
