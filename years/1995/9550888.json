 "awd_abstract_narration": "Material science, recently identified as one of five strategic  and critical areas of research by the Clinton administration, is  experiencing a period of major advances in numerous areas.    Since many of the desired characteristics of these materials are  evaluated as a function of their structure and/or elemental  composition, the material scientist looks toward x-ray techniques  to provide fast, accurate, elemental and structural information  requiring minimal sample preparation.  The chemistry department  is establishing a modern x-ray analysis laboratory composed of a  wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and an  x-ray powder diffractometer.   This project affects non-science-  majors in general education courses, as well as most science  majors in courses ranging from General Chemistry to Physical  Chemistry.   Undergraduate research, examining environmental  topics, is being implemented, thereby encouraging participation  in independent study by African-American and women students.",
