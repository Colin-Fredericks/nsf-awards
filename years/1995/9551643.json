 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry department is purchasing a modem high-field nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enable its students to  learn modern techniques in structure determination.   The  instrument is being used at all levels of the curriculum and  leads students to a more sophisticated understanding of the power  of NMR techniques to unlock chemical secrets.   Beginning with  organic chemistry, students learn to interpret coupling patterns  and chemical shifts in 1H and 13C spectra to identify molecular  structure.   At the next level, in Instrumental Methods, the  introduction to Fourier transform and quantitative measurements  provides a theoretical basis for better understanding FT-NMR.    In upper-level courseq students gain experience in a rich array  of techniques available to a multinuclear high-field NMR.   For  instance, biochemistry students study the stereochemistry of an  enzymatic reaction and observe structural variations in protein  structures, and in physical chemistry they determine the kinetics  of an exchange reaction and study the thermodynamics of an  equilibrium reaction.   The presence of the FT-NMR spectrometer  enhances the undergraduate research program and is used for  routine analysis of products prepared in inorganic synthesis.",
