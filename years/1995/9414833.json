 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ARI award will provide funding for the renovation of the environmental infrastructure and mechanical facilities supporting the research and research training spaces for the science building on the campus of Indiana State University.  The 36 year old facility houses four science departments; Life Sciences, Geography and Geology, Chemistry and Physics.  Currently, most of the laboratories are antiquated, unsafe and in desperate need of repair.  In spite of the science building's infrastructure deterioration, the university has established nationally recognized and funded research programs throughout the science departments.  The renovations for all research laboratories will consist of the following:  1) new walls, ceilings and floors; 2) installation of new fixed laboratory equipment; 3) new mechanical services, including supply and exhaust systems; 4) improved electrical services; and 5) new plumbing and fire protection systems.  Numerous state a federal and safety codes will be met once renovations are completed.  The renovation project will give research faculty the opportunity to expand competitive interdisciplinary research programs, offering quality research training to high school students, college undergraduates, master's and doctoral students.  The modernization of this facility will increase the quality of the research programs and allow for the initiation of new programs in the sciences.",
