 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422542       The remote mountainous areas of Northern Laos and  Northwestern Vietnam are home to a number of little-known  ethnolinguistic communities speaking languages of the Northern  Mon-Khmer family. Internationally isolated for decades, the area  remains until now a virtual terra incognita to western scholars  of linguistics, ethnography, folklore, and history. This project-   to be carried out by an interdisciplinary, international team of  researchers, working closely with colleagues from Lao and  Vietnamese research institutions- will take advantage of new  opportunities for collaborative field investigations in the two  countries.       The focus of study will be several ethnolinguistic  communities whose members speak languages within the Khmuic and  Palaungic branches of the Mon-Khmer family (i.e., the Northern  Division of Mon-Khmer).  The research, primarily descriptive and  empirical in approach, will include eliciting lengthy word lists  suitable for comparative study, as well as gathering other  linguistic data; recording linguistic texts including songs,  folktales, myths, ritual languages, play languages, and other  traditional verbal arts; and interviewing community members about  the traditions and history of each ethnicity. The research  promises to make important contributions to understanding the  linguistic and ethnographic history and relations not only of the  particular ethnic groups studied, but of the region as a whole.  The languages to be studied will also provide rich data for  consideration of problems of interest to general linguistics such  as the relations of register and tone, tonogenetic mechanisms and  processes, person-referring forms (pronouns, kinship terms, and  so on) and group-referring forms (ethnonyms and glossonyms), play  languages and speech surrogates, and reduplication and  parallelism.",
