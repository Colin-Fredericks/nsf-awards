 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415123  Kirn  Nottenbohm  Macklis    Many brain disorders, result from the death of brain cells.  We do not know how to replace these cells, or even if this  is possible.  However, death and replacement of brain cells  (neurons) occurs spontaneously in the brain of adult birds.  The new neurons are born in the walls of the lateral  ventricle of the brain.  Some of these cells are part of the  vocal control system, and are known to be involved in  controlling the learning and remembering of song.  Since  this constant replacement is not preceded or accompanied by  overt pathology, it can be thought of as a form of brain  rejuvenation.  In collaborative research proposed here by  Drs. Nottenbohm, Macklis and Kirn, a new technique for  inducing selective cell death in the brain will be used and  resulting effects on the generation and function of new  brain cells will be tested.  The questions that will be  answered are:  1) Is cell replacement restricted to a few  kinds of cells, or will any type of brain cell that dies be  replaced by another one of the same kind?  2) Do signals  emitted by dying cells play a role in the birth, migration,  and survival of the new cells?  3) Does cell replacement  affect memory and the acquisition of new memories?  The  answers to these questions will help reveal the cellular  dynamics underlying memory formation, and may help in the  development of new approaches to repairing brains and  controlling the decrement of function that accompanies  aging.***",
