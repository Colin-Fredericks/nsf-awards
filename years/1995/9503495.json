During her fellowship, Dr. Sekreta will be resident at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMCR) at Tsukuba.  In conjunction with Drs. M. Sato and T. Sako of the Department of Chemical Systems at NIMCR, Dr. Sekreta will study innovative chemical systems that have practical applications with regard to energy conservation and the environment.  The proposed work is part of a more extensive project probing aspects of cluster reactions as well as separation technologies using supercritical fluids.  As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Sekreta will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and equipment at the NIMCR while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***                                                     Oh     +'  0                                       D        h                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           @       d                                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                   6   This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the                Tonya L.
