 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science has become increasingly concerned with the  concept of type. From the 60's onward this notion has  demonstrated its value as  an effective organizing  concept_first in programming and programming languages,  then  in knowledge representation, in automated reasoning, in  formal methods,  and now perhaps in computer algebra systems.  Previous NSF-supported research  has led to a coherent family  of constructive type theories and to the  implementation of  them in the Nuprl system from Cornell and related systems  elsewhere.    The plan of the investigation is to find the right concepts  to  explain the use of types in computer algebra systems and  in formalizations of  abstract computational mathematics  (especially algebra). It is conjectured that  in some cases  the right concepts are generalizations of algebraic data  types  to higher-order ADT's. In other cases, new type  constructors may be necessary,  such as the very dependent  types. These concepts are expected  to clarify  both pragmatic issues and foundational questions.  Moreover,  the  method of investigation seeks to formalize the object  oriented features of  algebra systems and generalize them to  other programming environments.    The  result of this research enables the design of a new  generation of computer  system that integrates subsystems  (such as compilers, concrete and symbolic  evaluators,  transformation systems, provers, and data base managers)  around a  rich notion of type used to specify and verify the  linking protocols.  Investigation of computational  type theory also deepens  understanding of the  foundations of computer science and its links to  mathematics  and computational science.",
