 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the effectiveness of undergraduate  instruction in the area of fluid power actuation and control by  upgrading the laboratory experience mechanical engineering  students receive in this area.   It has typically been the case  that the laboratory exposure students receive has not fully  illustrated concepts or components related to fluid power in  sufficient depth and in the context of applications of current  interest.  This project exposes students to a greater variety of  fluid power components and systems, and investigates their  behavior in greater depth so that students develop a better  appreciation for the capabilities and limitations of fluid power  in relation to other forms of actuation such as electromechanical  actuation.  Applications of current interest are also highlighted  to better motivate students to investigate fluid power in greater  detail in the context of design projects and elective courses.",
