University of Florida  Title:    The Physical Origin of Initial Discharge Processes in            Lighting    Transient electric fields have been recorded in a 800 Hz to 5 MHz  bandwidth at four to five stations at Kennedy Space Center since  October 1991.  These fields are radiated from lighting and other  electrical processes of a much smaller scale than lighting.  The  primary focus of this proposal is the analysis of these data to  establish the physical origin of their sources, with an emphasis on  the initial discharge processes in lighting and the initial  lightings in a cell.     According to recent theory that employs a transmission-line model,  four electric field measurements on a sub-microsecond time scale  can be processed to give the three-dimisional location, vector  velocity, and peak current of an in-cloud source.  Wideband  electric fields pulses are associated with both step formation in  streamers and the propagation of large current pulse downs ionized  channels.  The objective of the modeling is to characterize  physically the sources of processes that previouly have been  characterize only in terms of features of their electric field  waveshapes.  This will enable us to investigate the physical origin  of processes that produce large microsecond-scale electric field  pulses.    Or particular importance are the sources of wideband electric field  that occur in the initial stages of lighting, since these are most  likely to reflect the pre-existing thunderstorm charge, and the  initial lightings in a cell, since these are a manifestation of the  thunderstorm charge generator.  Our analysis will result in the  physical characterization of the bipolar pulses that have been  detected in the early stages of both intracloud and cloud-to-ground  flashes, narrow bipolar pulses that may result from a discharge of  much smaller extent than typical lighting, early stepped leader  steps, and sources, and sources of fine structure in first return   strokes.",
