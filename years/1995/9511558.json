 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lnenicka  9511558  The development and regeneration of the nervous system is highly  dependent upon the properties of the growing tip of the nerve cell,  the growth cone. Growth cones control the extent and direction of  nerve cell elongation and, thus, allow the formation of appropriate  connections in the nervous system. The actions of growth cones are  largely regulated by their level of intracellular calcium. Calcium  enters the growth cone through calcium channels and is removed  through a number of processes collectively referred to as calcium  buffering. Nerve cells show differences in their properties of  growth. Differences in the regulation of intracellular calcium  and/or the sensitivity of growth cones to intracellular calcium  play an important role in these differences in nerve cell growth.  The purpose of this research is to define the role of calcium  regulation and calcium sensitivity in these differences in nerve  cell growth. In addition, the factors responsible for the  development of these differences in growth cone properties will be  examined. In particular, the hypothesis that the previous activity  or \"use\" of nerve cells affects their properties of regeneration  will be tested. These studies are possible by utilizing the  relatively simple invertebrate nervous system, where large  identified cells with differences in activity and growth cone  properties can be directly examined. The studies will be performed  using previously developed cell-culture techniques for studying the  growth of regenerating axons of nerve cells. Axon growth will be  followed using time-lapse video-microscopy of growth cones.  Recently developed methods for measuring intracellular calcium  concentration using imaging techniques will be used to determine  the sensitivity of the growth cones to intracellular calcium, and  their calcium buffering capacity. Calcium influx will also be  directly measured in growth cones. These studies will contribute to  our understanding of the basic mechanisms invo lved in the growth  and regeneration of nerve cells.",
