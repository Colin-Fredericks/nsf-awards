 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry  Program, Dr. Richard D. Adams of the University  of South Carolina will continue his studies of  heterometallic polynuclear clusters.  These recently discovered compounds contain triangular  layers of platinum and ruthenium or osmium atoms and carbonyl ligands.  Preliminary results  suggest metal selectivity  in reactions with organic compounds. Major objectives of the research  are the development of systematic methods for preparation of these novel metal clusters and a  comprehensive investigation of selectivity effects in coordination of substrates, and cooperativity  in their activation, by the different metal layers.  A combination of infrared, polynuclear NMR and  single crystal x-ray diffraction coupled with reactivity studies, including kinetics, will be used to  explore these new cluster compounds.    A number of significant industrial heterogeneous catalysts contain more than one type of metal.   These mixed metal, heterometallic catalysts are more active and/or selective in their reactions than  are catalysts generated from the individual metals.  The reasons for this synergistic action are not  well understood.  This project will utilize novel heterometallic cluster compounds to investigate  reactions in homogeneous systems that may then be related to heterogeneous situations.  The  information obtained may  allow for the development of a better understanding of the reasons why  mixed metal, heterogeneous catalysts have unique properties and ultimately for the rational design  of new catalysts.",
