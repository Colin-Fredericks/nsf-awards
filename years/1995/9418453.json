 "awd_abstract_narration": "How tissues and cells respond in a spatially and temporally  coordinated fashion to developmental cues remains poorly  understood.  Numerous signal transduction pathways exist,  the components of which are often ubiquitous.  One level at  which specificity in the transduction of a signal may be  achieved is by packaging signal transduction molecules, such  as hormone receptors or certain kinases, into multicomponent  complexes which function to control their intracellular  localization and their activation.  The Hsp90 molecular  chaperone has been studied intensively in vertebrates and in  yeast, and has been shown to be a key component of several  multicomponent signaling complexes - steroid hormone  receptors, src-family kinases, raf kinase - that is required  for specific localization, activation and/or function of the  transducing molecules.  From such cell biological and  biochemical analyses of Hsp90, an important regulatory  function during development might be anticipated.  However  little is known about the developmental role of any  molecular chaperone, Hsp90 included, in the context of a  multicellular organism.  The Hsp90 family of molecular  chaperones has a single member in Drosophila, called Hsp83.  Work from this laboratory revealed an uncommonly dynamic  spatial and temporal expression of Hsp83 RNA during  oogenesis and embryogenesis.  This led to the hypothesis  that Hsp83 might regulate the function of more ubiquitous  partner proteins during development, potentiating signal  transduction processes only in certain tissues and at  particular stages.  The research proposed here seeks to  define the specific developmental functions of Hsp83.  Maternally synthesized Hsp83 RNA is localized to the  posterior polar plasm, is taken up into the pole cells and  Hsp83 is expressed at high levels in the primordial germ  cells and the germline through most of development.  Zygotic  transcription of Hsp83 is restricted initially to the  anterior third of the embryo, and this expression is   regulated directly by the anterior morphogen, bicoid.  Subsequently, Hsp83 is expressed in the head, the  neuroblasts and nervous system, and the germline of the  embryo.  The cis-regulatory elements that control Hsp83  expression in these tissues are being defined in detail.  Epitope-tagged transgenic lines have been produced and are  being used to assay HSP83 protein expression patterns.  Mutations in Hsp83 are lethal.  Strong alleles are embryonic  lethal and die with novel head defects consistent with a  role for Hsp83 in coordinating head development.  Weaker  alleles result in morphologically normal first instar larvae  that are unable to molt to the second instar and eventually  die after spending several days in the first instar.  This  phenotype is consistent with a role for Hsp83 in the  transduction of the hormonal signal that coordinates the  larval molts.  Detailed analyses of Hsp83 mutant phenotypes  will be conducted in embryos, early larvae, and in the  germline.  Transgenic Hsp83 constructs that are deleted for  particular cis-regulatory elements will be sued to target  phenotypes to the times and places of interest.  Genetic  tests for interacting loci will be conducted in order to  define HSP83's partner proteins in specific tissues and at  particular times.  Immunopurification of epitope-tagged  HSP83 and assays for copurification of partner proteins will  complement the genetic-interaction tests.  Taken together,  these studies will provide the first analysis of the  developmental functions of the Hsp90 family of chaperones.",
