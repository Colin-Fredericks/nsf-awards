 "awd_abstract_narration": "MARANTZ  This study employs MEG imaging techniques to investigate how the brain  represents and uses linguistic categories. Ultimately this research  will explore all levels of linguistic analysis from the phonetic to  the semantic. The current project starts with phonetic and  phonological categories - distinctive features of speech sounds - and  how they are realized during speech perception at auditory cortex.   The primary goal of this preliminary research is to compare the  brain's reaction to the acoustic as opposed to the linguistic  properties of speech. For example, voiced and voiceless stops (in  English) are distinguished acoustically by voicing onset time (VOT), a  continuous physical dimension.  Perception of speech sounds, however,  isn't continuous along the VOT dimension.  Along this dimension,  sounds are heard categorically, as belonging to either the voiced or  voiceless categories.  Relatively large differences in VOT within a  category are difficult to perceive while relatively small differences  that cross the boundary between categories are easy to perceive.  It  is clear that the auditory system and brain do not map the physically  continuous dimension of VOT linearly, or log-linearly as pitch and  loudness are mapped.  Possible neurophysiological bases of categorical  perception have been suggested from the results of experiments with  animals.  This project asks to what extent the human response  resembles the animal models and what constitutes linguistic category  perception over and above the physical response common to the  mammalian auditory system.",
