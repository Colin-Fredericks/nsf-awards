 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arnold    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Philip Arnold and  his colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological  research at the site of La Joya which is located in the Tuxtla  Mountains of Mexico. The Olmec culture is one of the earliest and  also best known in Middle America. The large sculpted stone heads  which weigh many tons each and were made by Olmec peoples bespeak  a surprisingly high level of social organization at an early  date. While the overall importance of the Olmecs has long been  recognized, very little is archaeologically known about them and  the two sites which have been excavated are both located along  the Gulf coast of Mexico. The adjacent Tuxtla Mountains have both  fertile well drained soils. They also served as the source for  the basalts used for the monumental sculpture, elite tombs and  utilitarian ground stone artifacts at Gulf Olmec centers. With  the exception of Dr. Arnold's reconnaissance, very little  archaeological work has been focussed on the Olmec in this  region. At La Joya Dr. Arnold has discovered a large site which  dates to the early Olmec period and therefore has the potential  to shed light on the rise of this culture.    Several goals guide the excavation and subsequent analyses. Dr.  Arnold wishes to  focus on households and to determine how  individual households were organized and how they changed over  time.He will also characterize subsistence strategies and land  use practices which the La Joya residents employed and finally  will investigate how utilitarian craft objects were produced.  Together these data will provide information on how La Joya  people related both to each other and to their environment. To  accomplish this goal Dr. Arnold will combine both survey and  excavation. This will allow him to plot the distribution of sites  over the landscape and to determine the context of several of  these.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It  will shed light on  the rise of complex society in the New World and help scientists  to understand how groups at relatively simple technological  levels interact with their environment.",
