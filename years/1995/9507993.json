 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a full, balanced  academic career which involves both research and education  activities, as emphasized by the NSF CAREER Program.  A brief  summary of the research and education plans follows.         (A)  Research Plan:  Magnetic reconnection plays a very  important role in the transfer of the solar wind mass, momentum,  and energy into the earth's magnetosphere through the magnetospause  and in the development of geomagnetic substorms and energy release  in the magnetotail.  In the reconnection process, a layered  structure which contains several magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)  discontinuities and waves can be formed in the outflow region.  The  energy conversion in the magnetic reconnection is mainly through  the discontinuities and waves in this reconnection layer.  The  purpose of the research plan is to systematically study the  formation and structure of reconnection layers in the magnetotail.   The primary research tools of the study are one-dimensional )1-D)  and two dimensional (2-D) hybrid simulations, guided by MHD  theories and simulations of the reconnection layer.  Specifically,  this proposal is to:   (1) Determine the structure of the distant-tail reconnection layer  and associated discontinuities in quasi-steady reconnection during  quiet time;  (2) Study the structure and evolution of the near-tail reconnection  layer during transient stages of magnetic reconnection in a  substorm active time:  (3) Investigate the structure and ion heating of slow shocks in the  magnetotail  The proposed study is expected to contribute significantly to our  understanding of the structure of the tail plasma sheet boundary,  the slow shocks and electromagnetic waves, and the ion dynamics in  the magnetotail magnetic reconnection.         (B) Education Plan:  In addition to the scientific research,  the other important component of academic activities at the Physics  Department of Auburn University is science education.  Instruction,  research, and out reach are inexorably intertwined in a manner that  each re-enforces the other.  The PI's education plan is made to  balance the research activity of the PI and to be consistent with  the department goals.  Specifically, the education plan includes:  (1) A five-year plan of undergraduate and graduate course teaching  at the introductory level, advanced undergraduate and graduate  level, which effectively utilizes the expertise of the PI;   (2) Research projects for undergraduate students in order to  attract students to higher levels of study and to contribute to the  research activities of the PI;  (3) Outreach activities to area high schools, to interact with and  train high school science teachers and students, and participation  in the $1.3 million Hughes Initiative.",
