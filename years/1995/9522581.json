 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many mass-collecting methods have been used in biodiversity surveys of terrestrial  arthropods, including Malaise traps (tent-like structures that funnel flying insects into a  collecting, jar), light traps, pitfall traps, sweep nets, and canopy fogging with insecticides.  Although samples should ideally be representative of the community or taxon selected for investigation  capture depends on such factors as individuals  behavior, activity level, and size.  Each method has  inherent sampling biases and caution must be exercised in comparing subsets of specimens across  samples.  Malaise traps are widely-used, cost-effective devices for collecting large numbers of flying  insects.  Their usefulness in quantitative biotic surveys and ecological studies has been questioned,  however, because their trapping efficiency and bias are generally unknown.  Using recent barcode  technology that considerably speeds the quantification of between-sample differences for abundant,  speciose taxa, this project will explore the appropriateness of Malaise traps as quantitative sampling  devices",
