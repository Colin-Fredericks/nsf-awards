 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory, to support a three-course sequence in parallel and  distributed computing is being created.   The goals of the lab  are (1) to provide a rigorous grounding in the basics of these  fields, while exploring innovative educational ideas: the use of  a distributed spreadsheet to teach the basics of distributed  computing, and an active learning approach to teaching parallel  algorithm design; (2) to orient the courses toward the technical  issues students encounter in applying parallel and distributed  computing to Information Technology (IT) problems in the service  sector (e.g., air transportation, telecommunications, wholesale  and retail trade, health care, the financial services industry)  rather than problems in scientific computing.   The course is  taught on workstation networks and gives equal attention to  database problems as well as to numerical computing.   The course  also introduces issues of security and reliability, which are  often more important than program performance.   The course  sequence culminates in a group project course in which students  carry out projects motivated by real problems from the IT sector.",
