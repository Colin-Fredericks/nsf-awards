 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424205  Rencis   The REU Site focuses on engineering mechanics and materials in mechanical engineering.  The Site is for 3 years and each year a different group of eight talented senior undergraduate students will carry out research on the Worcester Polytechnic Institute campus for a ten week summer internship period.  The faculty and graduate mentorship teams assembled for each intern topic is carrying out ongoing research in the focus area.  Each research topic is short, self-contained and considers cutting-edge problems that will challenge each intern.  Each topic has been carefully selected so that a positive, successful experience will encourage a student in selecting a career in engineering mechanics and materials.  The common theme of engineering mechanics and materials provides considerable interaction between the intern and faculty/graduate student mentorship team.  All interns will have access to several well equipped mechanical engineering laboratories and state-of-the-art computational facilities.  Recruitment of summer interns will be from the following four groups: 1) WPI programs; 2) minority institutions; 3) women and handicapped students, and; 4) undergraduates from four year schools that have a small or nonexistent research base.  Selection of the interns will be based upon their career objectives, academic qualifications and past work experiences.  Each student will be contacted by the faculty mentor prior to the summer internship so that they have a clear understanding of the project and what role they will play.  The program will be carefully planned so that all materials and equipment will be in working order before the students arrive to the campus.  Each intern will meet regularly, usually daily with the faculty mentor.  The principal investigator also will meet with each student on a weekly basis to be sure that student/faculty concerns and placement difficulties are addressed.  Social and extracurricular activities will be scheduled throughout the ten week internship p eriod.  Each student will present their findings at the interim and the internship will conclude with a formal presentation session.  A final report will be required at the end of the internship.  Students will be encouraged to present their findings at a conference and possibly publish a paper.  ***",
