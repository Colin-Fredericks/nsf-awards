The expansion, made  possible through a redesign of the curriculum, occurs through  demonstrations and carefully structured laboratory exercises in  introductory and intermediate courses in physical geography and  geographical methods and through a new course, Digital Terrain  Analysis, which will integrate these two areas at the advanced  level.  The course provides experimentation and project work  using the new capabilities afforded by the new equipment and  software.  By addressing the curriculum at all levels and in two  emphasis areas, the project will provide for a coherent and  integrated understanding of new material on the part of the  students.  Additionally, the project will enhance the experience  and knowledge of students who are training to be teachers and  should give them the background they need to take thee condepts  of diigital terrain analysis into schools.  The project involves  the purchase of a Unix-based server and four Unix-based  workstations, with software from ERDAS, Inc., and Environmental  Systems Research Institute (ESRI), for the efficient provision of  advanced capabilities in terrain data interpretation, collection,  management, and visualization.  An additional PC-based  workstation will be set up to demonstrate lower cost software  (from R-WEL, Inc., Golden Software, and the Idrisi Project) to  teachers-in-training so that they might be encouraged to use the  software in their own classrooms.  The effectiveness of the  project in expanding the  knowledge and skills of the students  will be evaluated through supplemental course evaluations and  focus groups, the results of which will be presented to  colleagues in professional organizations.",
