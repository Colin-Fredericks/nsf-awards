This decision is stimulated by a pressing need to  incorporate innovative methods for recording, quantifying, and  analyzing biological processes. In addition, new technological  advancements in applied optics, electronic imaging, and  computational-based image processing continue to drive the frontier  of biomolecular imaging into all elements of our lives from medical  diagnostics to science education and research. Clearly, if we plan  to stay at the frontier of this technology, we must provide  undergraduates with the opportunity to experiment, explore, and  discover the power of applied optical imaging. To integrate  bioimaging into undergraduate laboratories, we are carrying out a  variety of experiments that combine the use of important new  biosensors and molecular probes with state-of-the-art electronic  detectors, high-powered confocal optics, and sophisticated software  programs for the study of dynamic cell, developmental, and  physiological processes. These exercises are training students in  the nuts and bolts of electronic image acquisition, processing, and  analysis, while emphasizing the power of computer-based digital  optical instrumentation and its use as a quantitative tool for  biological investigation.",
