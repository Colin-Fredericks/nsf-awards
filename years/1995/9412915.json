 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed understanding of the bond between an adsorbed molecule and a solid substrate can  be obtained by spectroscopic characterization of the adsorbed molecule.  Very little has been  learned about the low energy modes of this adsorbate-substrate complex, due to the lack of  spectroscopic probes relevant to this energy regime.  This research project, supported by the  Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State  Chemistry and Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research, is directed toward  obtaining this low energy information.  Helium atom scattering has been developed as a method  which can address this question, and Professor B.J. Hinch and her students at Rutgers University  will take advantage of this method to probe the low energy frustrated rotations and translations  of model molecules adsorbed on well characterized surfaces.  This information will provide a  stringent test of our present understanding of chemisorption and the surface chemical bond.  This  information is crucial to a number of technologies, ranging from catalysis to electronic device  fabrication.    Spectroscopic characterization of the low energy vibrations of adsorbed molecules is the focus  of this research project.  Scattering of helium atoms from adsorbed molecular species will be  used to obtain this spectroscopic information.  This heretofore unavailable data will be compared  with current theories of adsorption, with the goal of increasing our understanding of this  technologically important phenomenon.",
