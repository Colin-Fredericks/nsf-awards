 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fogel    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Fogel will culture  bone cells in media that has been formulated to answer specific  questions regarding the incorporation of carbohydrates, proteins  and lipids into collagen and hydroxylapatite. Compound-specific  isotopic measurements of C and N of individual amino acids will  be determined on each of the experimental cultures. This research  will provide the basis of improved interpretation of isotopic  ratios from fossil bone and assist in the reconstruction of  prehistoric human diet. In a second part of the study, results  will be applied to six suites of fossil bone to address questions  of direct archaeological relevance.    Archaeologists wish to reconstruct the diet of past populations  because such data not only sheds light into ancient subsistence  practices but also provides insight into other aspects of  societies such as the degree of hierarchical social organization.  Research has indicated that the carbon and nitrogen isotope  ratios in bone are related to diet and that one can work  backwards from skeletal remains to gain insight into what was  eaten. However the process is far from straightforward and  scientists do not understand how elements from different kinds of  foods are differentially incorporated into the different phases  of bone. Through her carefully controlled work at the cellular  levels, Dr. Fogel should be able to unravel these interactions.  This research will have widespread applicability not only in  archaeology but in other areas of science as well.",
