 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417210  Wilking    The study of the mass function of a young, embedded cluster of stars in  the Galaxy is the most direct way to investigate the origin of stellar  masses.  The young stellar objects in molecular clouds in our Galaxy  are strongly bound and have not had time to wander far from their  birthplace.  Interpretation of the observed peaks or low-mass cut-offs  in the mass function of a young stellar cluster can reteal a possible  characteristic or minimum mass for star formation which can be related  to the local and global environment.  However, infrared wavelength  observations are needed to probe through the obscuring dust in these  regions and new techniques must be developed to estimate stellar masses  for pre-main-sequence stars from infrared data alone.  Infrared  wavelength array detectors will be used to observe a flux-limited  sample of sources emitting at 2 micron wavelengths in the Rho Ophiuchi  cloud core.  A scheme will be devised to identify a subset of this  sample which is in a T Tauri star type phase of evolution, for which  the stellar photospheres can be corrected for obscuration effects, and  using recent theoretical models for a given stellar age, the  luminosities and masses of the stars can be derived.  To supplement  this observational sample of stars, new and sensitive X-ray, Hydrogen  alpha, and radio wavelength continuum observational surveys will be  used to identify young stars with little or no infrared excess.  The  goal is to produce a mass function for 100-150 young stellar objects in  the cloud.  As a check on the scheme that is planned, infrared  wavelength spectroscopic observations of stars will be used to  determine the spectral types of the stars and to independently estimate  the ages and masses of the starq.  In the course of the investigations,  other important issues concerning the Rho Ophiuchi cloud core will be  considered; such as the number of low-luminosity embedded sources, the  three-dimensional distribution of young stars, the freque ncy of binary  stars, and the degree of Hydrogen alpha wavelength emission variability  in pre-main-sequence stars.  Ultimately, the mass functions of several  star-forming regions with distinct physical environments will be  compared to see if significant differences do arise when comparing the  different star forming regions.",
