Geographically, the  project targets the Southern Illinois (SI) region consisting of 22 mostly rural counties, including  the 9 poorest counties in the state, where the percentage of girls preparing for college is  significantly lower than statewide or national averages.  The target populations are: pre-college  girls, their parents, teachers, and school counselors.  The project is unique in that:  (1) it  encompasses a wide geographic area; and (2) its long-range plan is to provide a sequence of  SEM experiences for girls, beginning with a broad \"taste\" of many SEM disciplines, and leading  through successively more intense experiences to a level of mastery in chosen fields that will  give the girls the self-confidence to continue on to college.      A sequence of SEM activities will be set up in cooperation with the Shagbark Council of the Girl  Scouts, in the St. Louis Science Center, and in the Carbondale Science Center.  In grade school,  the participants' curiosity will be piqued via Science Experiences for Girl Scout troops,  including visits to the St. Louis Science Center.  Attending Expanding your Horizons  Workshops (EYH) will provide more intensive, hands-on experiences, as well as role-models  of women scientists at work.  For somewhat older girls, participation includes the Science Fair  Cooperative Workshops; small-group work on an exhibit for the Carbondale Science Center;  and in-depth, hands-on science, engineering, mathematics (SEM) experiences at a WISE  summer camp.  Guided by female SEM faculty and graduate students, the participants are to   interact with older girls who already have experienced a more advanced phase of the project,  and with role-model women scientists.  Participants also a re to give a helping hand to younger  girls in the pipeline.  The involvement of parents, teachers and school counselors is essential,  in discussions of how females best learn science, what career opportunities are open to women  in SEM, etc., and in hand-on SEM experiences that they can share with the girls.  The climate  change envisioned for SI will be supported by a Database of Science Activities for  disseminating information about SEM activities to the community, available to SI students,  parents, teachers, and to public libraries, throughout the calendar year.  This database will be  widely advertised through SI schools, libraries, and community organizations.    ***",
