The hair bundles of these organisms are mechanoreceptors that participate in regulating discharge of nematocysts into moving targets including prey.  While little is known of the signal transduction in this process, models have been developed to explain signal transduction in vertebrate hair bundles.  This investigator has found that anemone hair bundles are structurally and functionally similar to hair bundles in vertebrates, so he now proposes to test a model for signal transduction in anemones that incorporates features of the tip-link model for vertebrate hair bundles.  Tip-links are filaments which open and close ion channel gates at the tips of stereocilia.  The  hypothesis to be tested is that the tip links mechanically couple the gate of the ion channel to an adjacent stereocilium of the bundle.  This will be tested using a fluorescent dyes and computer imaging to see if a deflection of the bundle will cause membrane depolarization and alter fluorescence.  Electrophys iological recording (by patch clamping) during  mechanical stimulation of hair bundles and morphological studies using field emission scanning microscopy  will also be done.   %%%  These studies on the basis of mechanosensitive signal transduction in anemones are important for studies of biodiversity and well as evolution. Moreover they will enhance understanding of how  hair bundles respond in other systems, including vertebrates. ***                         ;                                                    Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Abstract                            Una Solomon                         Una Solomon                 @        %                          @                                   @        %                                                                                                  @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e =       e                                                                               l       l   l       l       l       l       l                                                                       b   1                                                                                                   $               D           T       2   b                       l                                                                         b               l       l                                                                       l               l                                                       l       l       l       l                           Z                                                                                                 Abstract 9505844 Watson         This research project will investigate signal transduction in hair bundles of  sea anemones.
