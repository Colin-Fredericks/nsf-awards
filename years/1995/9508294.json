McCann University of Wisconsin-Madison  Dissertation  Improvement Research: Historical Ecology of Terra Preta Vegetation in the Lower Amazon  This project  will investigate the extent and ways in which past and present activities of Amazonian peoples have  influenced the vegetation of Amazonian forests.  To do this the project will study the historical  ecology of the people and plants in the Arapiuns River Basin, Brazil.  This region is particularly  suited for learning about the human role in shaping a complex and diverse environment.  Species  composition, structure, diversity, use, and management will be compared with control forest plots.  The hypothesis is that in comparison to the surrounding forest, the study sites are distinct in  species composition and structure, have greater potential for crop productivity, have a greater  concentration of useful species, and present evidence of human-induced enhancement of biodiversity.  The results of the research should have important theoretical implications for both social and  ecological sciences and hold valuable le ssons for the applied fields of conservation, environmental  management, and development.",
