 "awd_abstract_narration": "Starrfield  9417057    Novae occur in cataclysmic binary systems in which a Roche lobe  filling secondary is losing hydrogen-rich material through the  inner Lagrangian point onto a white dwarf primary.  The  accumulating shell of material on the white dwarf is unstable to a  thermonuclear runaway and hydrodynamic simulations of this  phenomenon reproduce many of the observed features of the nova  outburst.  The proposed research falls into two main areas:   theoretical studies of the classical nova outburst and related  topics using both the PI s hydrodynamic-nucleosynthesis stellar  evolution code plus a new radiation-hydrodynamic code and, in  addition, optical observational studies in support of the  theoretical investigations.    The questions to be answered theoretically are: (1) Since virtually  all well studied novae exhibit enriched nuclear abundances in the  material ejected by the explosion, what is the source of that  enrichment? (2) Since many recent novae exhibit ejecta enriched in  oxygen, neon, and magnesium, what are the consequences of accretion  onto ONeMg white dwarfs and why do these novae eject so much  material? (3) Since both V1500 Cygni and GQMus have been identified  as binary systems containing magnetized white dwarfs (AM Her  variable), what are the consequences of strong magnetic fields on  the outburst? (4) Since observations of novae by the ROSAT and IUE  satellites have now measured the turn off times for V1974 Cygni and  GQMus, what is the cause of the cessation of nuclear burning and  the return to quiescence of the white dwarf? (5) Since we now have  superb collections of data on the outbursts of a number of recent  novae such as V1974 Cyg, Cas 1993, and LMC 1990#1, how well can   we simulate the outbursts of these novae? (6) Since all fast novae  seem to experience a phase of super-Eddington luminosity, what are  the critical factors that produce this phase?      Finally, optical observations to study the evolution of novae in   outburst and determine energy b udgets, elemental abundances, and  turn off times will be continued.  ***",
