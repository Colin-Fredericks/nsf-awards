Multiple mating may provide an  effective defense against by permitting females to screen  out genetically incompatible gametes.  This research will  test that hypothesis using a species in which pedigree  analysis and single locus, minisatellite DNA fingerprinting  have detected meiotic drive and female-biased sex ratios.  These phenomena are linked to reduced female reproductive  success in mice and Drosophila.  The hypothesis will be  tested by investigation of the reproductive consequences of  crosses between populations that have diverged to the point  of partial reproductive incompatibility.  Hybrids that  combine alleles capable of segregation distortion and/or  skewing of sex ratios with responder loci lacking coevolved  insensitivity to such alleles may produce such  incompatibility.  Single-locus DNA fingerprinting will  determine whether suppressed intragenomic or nucleo  cytoplasmic conflict is unleashed in hybrids.  It will test  the prediction that multiple mating enables females to  safeguard their reproductive investment either by shunting  resources to viable embryos, or through cryptic choice of  genetically compatible sperm.",
