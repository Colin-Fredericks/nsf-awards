 "awd_abstract_narration": "A curricular innovation is being implemented that involves the  introductory and intermediate courses offered during the first  two years in the chemistry curriculum.  There are three critical  components to this project: l) to integrate both inorganic and  organic chemistry throughout the first two years of introductory  and intermediate chemistry; 2) to fashion a laboratory sequence  that promotes student understanding of the qualitative and  multidisciplinary aspects of chemistry, including the use of  modern instrumentation at the introductory level; and, 3) to  create lecture and laboratory texts for use with such  innovations.  A unique advantage of this sequence, absent in the  \"traditional,\" \"organic first,\" and \"two cycle\" approaches, is  the overall matching of topic development to student ability over  the two-year sequence.  This approach builds from an empirical  basis those unifying concepts of chemistry throughout a two-year  sequence.  By removing the barrier separating organic from  inorganic, both major and non-major chemistry students will be  exposed to a more integrated view of chemistry, and will have  fundamental concepts reinforced with the widest possible variety  of chemical examples.",
