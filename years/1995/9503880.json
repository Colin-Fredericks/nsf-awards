 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI research project studies the issue of specification and  verification of computer systems that are both delay-sensitive  and distributed.  The behaviors of such a system strongly depend  upon the timing sequences of  events, and failure to meet these  timing requirements can either cause severe  consequences or  affect the correctness and/or performance of the system. Due to  the extra dimension of complexity introduced by the time  components in these  systems, specification and verification of  delay-sensitive distributed systems  have presented a unique  challenge to software practitioners.  This project  studies a broad range of issues related to  specifying and verifying  delay-sensitive distributed systems.  A  new specification model, Time  Communicating Finite State Machines  (TCFSMs), is proposed. TCFSMs is based on  the classical CFSMs  model with capability added to express time constraints for  specifying and verifying delay sensitive distributed systems.  A  token  passing-based system is studied to demonstrate how to  concisely specify and  verify self-stabilizing systems with  TCFSMs. This research examines a broad  spectrum of problems  related to TCFSMs:  the semantics and  alternative semantics of TCFSMs and their effects on  applications  and efficiencies; methodologies for  synthesizing time constraints  in TCFSMs; new  verification  techniques for TCFSMs  extending symbolic timing verification techniques; methodologies  for modeling self-stabilizing distributed systems  with TCFSMs,  suitable formalisms for self-stabilization and special classes of TCFSMs that  can be  efficiently self-stabilized; alternative extensions of  TCFSMs  related to other popular specification  models; and TCFSMs-based tools for simulations and rapid  prototyping. A component of this  RUI project is th e comparison of  TCFSMs with other specification models to  identify and evaluate  their strengths and weaknesses.",
