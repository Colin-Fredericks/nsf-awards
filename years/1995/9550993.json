 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is purchasing a modern photodiode array (PDA)  instrument to upgrade its analytical chemistry curriculum.     Semester-long courses in Quantitative and Instrumental Analysis  are being integrated into a 2-semester series entitled Analytical  Chemistry I and II.   The department also plans to integrate a  course in Spectrometric Identification.   The instrument is  utilized in General Chemistry and Biochemistry.   The primary  objective in General Chemistry is to increase student interest in  the sciences by exposing them to modern instrumentation early in  their undergraduate career.   In Analytical Chemistry-I, students  are exposed to the advantages of PDA technology for the  quantitative analysis of mixtures, and to study reaction  equilibria under varying environmental conditions.   The  instrument is used for lessons in precision and accuracy in  Analytical Chemistry-II and for lessons in spectroscopy in  Spectrometric Identification.   Lastly, the instrument exposes  Biochemistry majors to the latest methods for analyzing enzyme  kinetics, including the determination of constants that  characterize binding and reaction rates.",
