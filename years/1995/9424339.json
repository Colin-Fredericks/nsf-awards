 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424339  Flynn  We   explore   and  control  the  magnetic  behavior   of   rare-earth  nanostructures.   These  are  synthesized from  rare-earth  metals  as  stacks of sheets, tailored in thickness and content by molecular  beam  epitaxy.   Bulk rare earths exhibit a rich variety of unusal  magnetic  behavior,  including unique helimagnetism and large  magnetostriction.  The  proposed  research  includes  studies  of  structure,  magnetism,  magnetic microstructure, and magnetotransport in these novel materials  configurations.   Use is made of neutron scattering, x-ray  scattering  with   synchrotron  radiation,  SQUID  magnetometry,   and   transport  measurements  on  lithographically processed structures.   Of  special  interest  are:  control  of  magnetic phase stability  and  thin  film  microstructure;  chemical  synthesis of new  magnetic  nanostructures;  prediction  of  magnetic couplings near interfaces; and transformation  dynamics including fluctuation and inelastic processes.  %%%  We  focus  on  the synthesis and properties of magnetic nanostructures  made   from   rare-earth  metals  by  molecular  beam  surface   layer  deposition.   This controlled process assembles thin  films  layer  by  layer on a crystalline substrate, from selected element metals, in the  form  of  high  quality  single crystals,  with  a  designed  chemical  sequence  of  successive layers.  The focus on  rare-earth  metals  is  driven   by  technical  and  scientific  interest  in  their  magnetic  behavior.   Our abiliity to tailor selected structures  allows  us  to  explore the interactions among the atomic magnetic moments that  cause  a  rich  variety of magnetic structures.  The surface layer deposition  process  has a controlling influence on magnetism through the clamping  of  the  film to the substrate, and through the resulting  strain  and  thin film geometry.  The ability to control magnetic behavior of these  materials  is  of  interest  in connection with  applications  to  the  storage,   switching, and manipulation of information using  thin  film  magnetic devices.  ***",
