 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salem-Teikyo University (S-TU) is a not-for-profit United States  institution of higher learning located in rural Appalachia. Although no  financial support is derived from Teikyo University, the merger has  brought about the opportunity for sharing research resources and  faculty with the international science community. At the same time, we  continue to have a special impact on the Appalachian region. About 60%  of the S-TU student body comes from around the U. S.    S-TU is committed to developing both undergraduate and M.S. programs in  molecular biology/biotechnology within the Natural Science and  Mathematics Department, which also offers majors in mathematics,  environmental science, and biology. New courses related to  biotechnology include an intensive course on research techniques and  advanced courses in cell biology and molecular biology. Near completion  of the program, undergraduates will conduct independent research. The  undereraduate program was established in 1992. The offering of the  master's program is pending approval from the North Central  Association.    S-TU's molecular biology/biotechnology research is in cooperation with  Tampa Bay Research Institute (TBRI) in St. Petersburg, FL and with  Teikyo University School of Science and Engineering in Utsunomiya,  Japan. S-TU is specializing in the biology and genetic engineering of  plants, and it is for this research that support is being sought. Drs.  Suzanne Rogers, Takashi Ueda, and Kirk Cammarata have established  active research programs and several undergraduate students are now  involved.    Presently, the development of research is hampered by inadequate  culture facilities. A small laboratory which was converted into a  dedicated plant tissue culture area has proved inadequate for two  reasons: temperature and humidity variations in the room, and the  different conditions required by separate investigators. Hence, funds  are requested to purchase four separate plant growth chambers with  controls for temperature, li ght, and humidity. These should provide the  necessary control of environmental conditions for all current and  foreseeable research.    The areas of research that will benefit from the NSF funding are  directed either toward elucidation of control of gene expression in  plants or toward genetic transformation of plants to improve quality or  economic use. Dr. Rogers is developing methods for propagating rare and  fragile plants by cloning and regeneration procedures. Dr. Ueda is  studying the genetic program controlling plant seed development7  particularly those genes regulating production of the storage protein  zein in corn. Dr. Cammarata is examining roles of various defense and  stress-related genes encoding chloroplast localized products  (polyphenol oxidase, etc.).",
