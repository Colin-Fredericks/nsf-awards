Collaborative Research:  Household Relations, Migration Decisions, and Employment Outcomes     This collaborative research proposal requests funding to conduct field research and quantitative and qualitative analyses of intra-household relationships, migration decisions by different household members, and employment outcomes in destination regions.  The research questions and design are the result of collaboration among two economists, a geographer, and a biostatistician.  The field area is several urban areas in Ecuador.  The Ecuadorian setting is characterized by rapid urban population growth (including via in-migration) in the context of rapid, policy-induced, changes in economic structure.  The field work entails three stages over 18 months:  extensive surveys of migrant and non-migrant households in destination cities;  household surveys in the main origin areas;  and in-depth case histories for migrants in destination areas to complement and extend the survey findings through detailed examinations of the connections between life, household, and work histories.  The results will:  focus attention on household structures and dynamics as influences on migration processes;  combine research traditions of migration as an individual, household and local-context phenomenon;  and relate migration motivations to employment outcomes at the destination.",
