 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  The research examines the social organization of homeless people who camp on publicly-owned lands.  It tests prior theories about the homeless, comparing older theories about social disaffiliation with newer ones on the culture of resistance.  The study builds on the co-investigator's four years of previous research and observations on this population by using ethnographic methods of data collection.  New data will come from 120 days of observations and 60 intensive interviews.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of the lives of homeless rural residents.  It adds to a tradition that looks for insights into how social organizations are formed and operate by examining those who live unconventional lifestyles.  Findings may also be of help to policy-makers, concerned with programs for reducing homelessness.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
