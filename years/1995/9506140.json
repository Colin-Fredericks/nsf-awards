 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506140  Ogrydziak    Protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  membrane is a basic biological process in which signal  recognition particle (SRP) has a critical role.  Mammalian  SRP consists of RNA (300 nucleotides) and six protein  subunits (Srp9, 14, 19, 54, 68, 72p).  Only recently has an  in vivo role for SRP in protein translocation been  demonstrated.  The long term goals of this research are to  understand early events in ER protein targeting, with an  emphasis on the structures, functions, and interactions of  SRP and its components.  Specific objectives of this project  are 1) to identify key components involved in the process  and determine if they are essential for growth, and 2) to  develop tools needed for in vivo studies of protein  targeting and translocation.  The studies will be done with  the genetically tractable yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.  It  secretes high levels of an alkaline extracellular protease  (AEP) which will be used as a reporter molecule.  Several  interrelated lines of research will be conducted.  1) SRP  will be purified, sizes of the subunits determined, and N-  terminal amino acid sequence of SRP14 homologue gene product  determined.  The SRP receptor alpha-subunit gene will be  cloned, sequenced, and disrupted.  In Saccharomyces  cerevisiae all SRP components are important but not  essential for growth.  Unexpectedly, at least one of Y.  lipolytica's two functional SRP RNA genes is essential for  growth but SRP54 is not.  So determining whether or not the  SRP receptor alpha subunit gene is essential will be of  interest. 2) Because sensititity to loss of SRP components  seems to be protein-specific in S cerevisiae, studies on Y.  lipolytica Kar2p as an additional reporter molecule will be  completed.  Several laboratories, including our own, have  had difficulties isolating temperature (heat) sensitive  mutations in genes coding for SRP polypeptides.  Therefore,  a system for protein depletion will be developed because it  has been found  in S. cerevisiae that depletion of SRP  components results in more severe translocation defects than  does deletion.  %%%  Of the many fungi upon which people rely for food and drink,  yeast is arguably the most important. This project focuses  on a yeast species, Yarrowia lipolytica, which is a \"high  secretor\"; its rate of secretion of certain proteins is  greater than for other yeast species, such as Saccharomyces  cerevisiae.  To explore this interesting difference, the  initial events involved in secretion are studied.  These  events include the recognition of the secreted proteins so  that they can enter  the secretory system efficiently. This  is accomplished by a signal recognition particle, SRP, that  recognizes a signal sequence on the protein to be secreted.  Part of the project is to biochemically and genetically  dissect the SRP and to develop more probes to test its  functionality.  The SRP \"sits\" on the membrane system, the  endoplasmic reticulum, which serves as the entry point for  secreted proteins.  Where the SRP \"sits\" is determined by a  receptor which recognizes the SRP.  This project will test  if one of the subunits of the receptor is essential for  growth.  It will also genetically deplete other components  of the SRP to determine if their role in protein delivery is  ancillary or direct.  The work has broad biotechnological  application through  providing a system whereby commercial  proteins may be more rapidly secreted and through shedding  light on the secretion process itself.  ***",
