 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510146  Roughgarden  Early competition theory is based on the Lotka-Volterra competition equations, which are widely viewed as inadequate. A problem today is to develop new models of competition specific to systems where competition is known to occur. This research will develop and begin to test a new model of competition, tailored for terrestrial foragers, such as Anolis lizards that are known to compete. The new model involves processes at four scales, a capture event scale measured in seconds, an optimal foraging scale in hours, a social spacing scale in days, and a population-dynamic scale in weeks. The model at the capture event scale is a behavioral rule that shows how optimal foraging may be learned in a matter of hours. The model at the optimal foraging scale shows how the asymptotic outcome of the behavioral rule can be predicted by maximizing net rate of energy intake. The model for the social spacing scale shows how the spacing of animal territories is ideally adjusted according to the spatial distribution of resources. Combining these relatively small-scale models culminates in a model for population dynamics and interspecific competition. The counterparts of classic population-dynamic parameters, such as r, and K of the logistic equation,  are derived in terms of measurements defined on individuals, leading to a so-called individual-based model of population dynamics. It is proposed to extend this theory beyond the preliminary stage outlined in the proposal, to make it more realistic in many respects, and to revise it depending on results of future field studies.",
