 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Tyson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of propagating waves of   chemical activity in stratified media.  In collaboration with Pavel K.   Brazhnik, Tyson will study wave propagation in media with stratified   inhomogeneities attempting to characterize the reflection and refraction   of traveling waves at boundaries between layers.  The study will be   carried out by analytical, numerical, and experimental techniques.    Analysis will be done by two complementary methods: the kinematic   approach, and singular perturbation theory.  Numerical simulation will   also exploit complementary methods: standard finite-difference   approximations to partial differential equations, and cellular automaton   modeling of excitable media.  The analytical and numerical results will   be compared with experimental observations of wave propagation in a   stratified chemical excitable medium, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.  Traveling waves of chemical reaction are unusual but not uncommon   occurrences in the natural world.  Examples abound in combustion   chemistry, catalytic converters, waves of membrane depolarization   propagating through muscle tissue,  waves of cyclic AMP production in   slime mold growth, and a prominent Calcium wave signaling the   fertilization of an egg by sperm.  Chemical wave propagation has been   studied for many years in homogeneous, isotropic media.  Tyson's work   would be the first attempt to study wave propagation in media with   stratified inhomogeneities which are more realistic mimics of important   biological systems.",
