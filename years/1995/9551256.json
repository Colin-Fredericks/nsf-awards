 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates PowerMac computers as instruments of  active teaching and learning into Calculus I, II, and III;  Multivariable Calculus; and Numerical Analysis I and II, using  the software Mathematica.   These courses take advantage of the  graphics and programming capabilities of Mathematica, allowing  students to gain insight into the core of the subject matter.    Mathematica supports the development of \"notebooks;\"  a writer  can present paragraphs of text, embedded equations, tables, and  graphs.   The student can read the text, manipulate the  equations, generate new graphs, and experiment with parameter  values.   Students can use the material in more active and  creative ways.   In Calculus courses, fundamental concepts, such  as function and limit, continuity and differentiability, and  instantaneous rates of change, are greatly illuminated by  graphical and numerical treatments.   When Mathematica is used as  a tool, students of Multivariable Calculus can easily visualize  three-dimensional problems using 3D plot and rotation.   In the  Numerical Analysis course, it is now possible to take on more  relevant problems that otherwise would not be covered because of  their extreme complexity.   Mathematica can easily deal with  complex, repetitive computations that are inherent to the course,  allowing students to concentrate on more difficult concepts;  thus, students, engineers, and mathematicians are better equipped  for research.",
