More particularly, it will explore a sphere of activity, the consumption of so-called \"health foods\" in the United States, in which scientific authority has been notably ineffective during an era generally believed to mark a high point of public regard for science and its practitioners.  It will examine why the use of these foods and food supplements continued unabated and even increased during the current century, even though most nutrition scientists condemned these dietary practices as \"food faddism.\".    Preliminary research has shown that the proposition that the American food supply is nutritionally poor, which is the core belief of most post-1920's health food advocates, has often been fostered by the work of mainstream nutrition researchers.  This project will examine in detail the links between nutrition science and the three major health food claims: 1) modern food processing robs food of valuable nutrients, 2) commercial agriculture produces nutrient-poor crops, and 3) the nation's food products are laden with harmful chemical additives.  It will evaluate the scientific authenticity of these claims and explore how the lack of scientific consensus on many nutritional issues contributed to the spread of health food doctrine.  In pursuit of these objectives, the careers of a number of scientists who were highly esteemed by the health food community will be investigated.    In addition, this project will look at the role played by scientists in both combating and encouraging food faddism.  It will examine the campaigns waged against nutritional  misinformation, and attempt to evaluate the reasons fo r their failure.  Conversely, it will show how the activities of some nutrition scientists, especially their involvement in public health affairs, have perhaps inadvertently furthered health food practices.",
