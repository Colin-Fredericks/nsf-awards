 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520528  Brown      Research in the Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the University of  Massachusetts has been underway for the last twenty years, with  emphasis on studies of the paleosecular variation of the Earth's  magnetic field and on the solution of geologic problems using  paleo-magnetism. Current and past research have been done using  measurements from a spinner magnetometer.  With the increasing  numbers of samples needed for both paleosecular variation and  tectonic studies, and the detailed demagnetization steps required  with current standards, measurements such as these are a lengthy  process.  This grant provide funds for the acquisition of a  cryogenic magnetometer that will allow for the accurate  processing of weakly magnetized sediment samples, as well as  radically decrease measurement times.  The active Quaternary  research group at the University of Massachusetts will now have a  paleomagnetic laboratory that is capable of competitive research  into paleosecular variation studies on recent sediments and  paleoclimatic studies of weakly magnetized materials.  The new  instrument will also benefit a larger, five-college Quaternary  Research Group composed of faculty from Amherst, Hampshire, Mount  Holyoke and Smith as well as the host institution.    ***",
