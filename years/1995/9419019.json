The approach involves the use of three  complementary spectroscopic techniques that are capable of  selectively monitoring the electronic, magnetic and vibrational  properties of the Mo/W-pterin centers even in the presence of  additional paramagnetic or chromophoric prosthetic groups.  Ground  and excited state electronic properties for Mo(V) and W(V) forms  will be established by variable temperature magnetic circular  dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies.   Vibrational frequencies for Mo/W-ligand and molybdopterin  stretching modes will be investigated by resonance Raman  spectroscopy using excitation into visible charge transfer bands/   Electronic and vibrational assignments will be based on resonance  excitation profiles, isotope shifts, and studies of appropriate  Mo/W model complexes.    Spectroscopic studies will focus on five distinct classes of  oxotransferases:  hepatic sulfite oxidase, DMSO reductase from  Rhodobacter sphaeroides, formate dehydrogenase from Clostridium  thermoaceticum, aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases from the  hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrococcus furiosus and ES-4,  formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases from the hyperthermophilic  archaea Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis.  %%%  Oxotransferases catalyze a diverse array of oxygen  insertion/removal reactions that are of crucial importance in the  metabolism of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur.  In mesophilic organisms  that function at ambient temperatures (plants, bacteria and  mammals), many of these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes with a  novel molybdopterin active site of unknown structure.  Recent  studies of hyperthermorphilic archaea from deep sea volcanic vents  have revealed the presence of similar enzymes with tungstopteri n  active sites, that appear to be evolutionary ancestors of the  mesophilic enzymes.  The objective of this research is to  investigate the structural and functional diversity of  molybdopterin and tungstopterin oxotransferases in terms of  molybdenum/tungsten coordination environment and the nature and  properties of the pterin component. The approach involves the use  of three complementary spectroscopic techniques that are capable of  selectively monitoring the electronic, magnetic and vibrational  properties of the molybdopterin and tungstopterin cofactors.   Ground and excited state electronic properties for molybdenum(V)  and tungsten(V) forms will be established by variable temperature  magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance  spectroscopies.  Vibrational frequencies for metal-ligand and  pterin stretching modes will be investigated by resonance Raman  spectroscopy using excitation into visible charge transfer bands.   Electronic and vibrational assignments will be based on resonance  excitation profiles, isotope shifts, and studies of appropriate  molybdenum and tungsten model complexes.  The results will be  important in understanding the catalytic mechanisms of this class  of enzymes and are likely to have important evolutionary and  biotechnological implications.  ***",
