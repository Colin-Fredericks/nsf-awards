Dr.  Lahiri will also work with T.J. Rao of the Indian Institute of  Statistics, Calcutta to explore new areas in survey sampling.   Estimators used in large scale national sample surveys perform  poorly at the sub-national level.  The P.I. proposes to explore the  use of empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes methods in  developing estimators to generate reliable small area statistics.  The  collaborators will  investigate whether this method which Lahiri has  shown to be superior to the best linear estimators for small area  means, holds for the general mixed model with random error  variance components.  They will extend the empirical Bayes and  hierarchical Bayes methods to find estimators of small area  characteristics for discrete data.         Scope:  Research in small area estimation is important for  generating  statistics at the state and county levels and for  subgroups of the population.  In India and the U.S., such statistics  are needed by various federal and local governments for policy  making and allocation of funds.  The foreign collaborator has done  outstanding work in the areas of Bayesian statistics, higher order  asymptotics and survey sampling.  Professor Mukherjee's recent  advances in the area of asymptotics will be very helpful in proving  difficult asymptotic results mentioned in the proposal.  Many  mutual benefits may be expected to result from this new  collaborative activity.       ***",
