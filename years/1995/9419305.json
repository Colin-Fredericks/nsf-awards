 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419305  Chung  A broad range of functional polymers and graft copolymers,  with polypropylene (PP), ethylene-propylene copolymers, and  polyisobutylene backbones, have been synthesized by using a  borane approach.  Most of them would be very difficult to  obtain by other existing methods.  The key advantages of the  borane approach  are (a) the stability of borane groups to  transition metal catalysts, such as Ziegler-Natta and  metathesis catalysts, (b) the solubility of borane groups in  the hydrocarbon solvents used in the polymerization  reactions (both are essential to ensure the effective  incorporation of borane groups in polyolefins under  conventional reaction conditions) and (c) the versatility of  borane groups which can be transformed to a remarkable  variety of functionalities.  In addition, the borane groups  in polymer can be selectively auto-oxidized to polymeric  radicals, which are then used as a active sites for graft  polymerizations.  A broad range of polyolefin graft  copolymers, with polyolefin backbone and functional polymer  side chains, have thus been obtained.  The successful  results in the borane approach will now be used in four  related areas:  (1)  \"living\" radical polymerization using  oxidation adducts of borane moieties as the initiators; (2)  a synthetic route to prepare borane-group terminated  polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene by using Ziegler-Natta  catalysts and borane chain transfer agents; (3)  the  utilization of borane-terminated polyolefins to prepare  diblock copolymers that have a polyolefin block, such as PE  and PP, and a functional polymer block; (4)  the extension  of the functionalization chemistry to metallocene \"single-  site\" catalysts which will allow us to effectively  incorporate borane groups in polyethylene.  The resulting  linear low-density polyethylene with various functional  groups, such as -OH, -NH2 and halides, will be a both  scientifically interesting and potentially commercially  important material.  %%%  Overall, the goal  is not only to extend the borane approach  to broader polymer compositions and structures of  functionalized polyolefins, but also to widen the role of  borane reagents in polymer chemistry.  These uses of borane  reagents in polymers may provide us with new tools to  control polymerization processes and to obtain polymer  structures which can not be obtained by other existing  methods.",
