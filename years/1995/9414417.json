 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lynn, David  Recent advances at the interface between physical, inorganic, and organic  chemistry and the biological sciences have been dramatic. Stimulated by the exciting  scientific possibilities for the future, the Chemistry Department at the University of  Chicago plans to increase its strength in this interfacial area.  In order to do so, the  department has coordinated plans for stronger intellectual ties with both the Biological  Sciences and Physical Sciences Divisions. Crucial to the fulfillment of these plans is  the renovation of the fourth floor of George Herbert Jones Chemical Laboratory  which served as the principal chemical research building on campus from its  construction in 1928 until the completion of adjacent Searle Chemistry Building in  1968.    The $1.7 million project to renovate the fourth floor of Jones Hall and a cold  room in Searle Hall will be supported equally by NSF and the University of Chicago  with an investment of $850,000 each.  Renovation activities will correct current space  deficiencies which include the lack of air conditioning and adequate heating, and old  and unsafe electrical and plumbing systems.  These problems create research facilities  which are poorly controlled and unreliable in air/humidity regulation and cause the  loss of important research organisms.  Fume hoods which are far below the minimum  safety requirements will also be replaced.    The renovated space is key to chemists, bio-physical chemists, and organic chemists.  Beneficiaries include 6 faculty directly and another 12 indirectly.  In addition, 46  graduate students and 19 postdoctoral students will be working in the renovated space.   The program emphasizes participation by women and minorities and is proactive in  the recruitment of new faculty and students in further development of the new  interdisciplinary biological chemistry program.",
