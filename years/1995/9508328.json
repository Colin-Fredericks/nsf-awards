 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508328  Russell       The Center for Computational Mathematics at the  University of Colorado at Denver will purchase an  eight-processor Sun Microsystems SPARC server 1000E, which  will be dedicated to the support of research in the  mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for  several research projects, including in particular:       Parallel Implicit Multigrid Methods for Direct  Numerical Simulation of Time Dependent Compressible  Turbulent Flow around Flight Vehicles. Transitional and  turbulent flow at subsonic and hypersonic speeds will be  approximated directly, without turbulence models.       Eulerian-Lagrangian and Mixed Methods for Subsurface  Flows. Flows in porous media, with emphasis on applications  to oil recovery and groundwater contaminant transport, will  be simulated with new numerical methods designed to be  accurate for convection dominated flows through irregular  geological formations.       Stabilized Finite Element Methods and their Massively  Parallel Implementation. Discretizations with strong  accuracy and robustness for a wide range of applications  will be developed and analyzed, and domain-decomposition  equation solvers will be designed and implemented.       Parallel Iterative Methods. Robust, fast equation  solvers will be developed for equations arising from  discretizations of models of solid mechanics on highly  distorted finite element meshes.       Preconditioned Parallel Methods for Large Symmetric  Eigenproblems. Fast, accurate, robust methods will be  developed for computation of several extreme eigenpairs of  symmetric generalized eigenproblems.  The projects span major areas of scientific computation:  model development and application, discretization methods,  linear equations, and eigenvalue problems. All share  large-scale parallel computation as a central theme.",
