 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509229  Honma  The long term goal of the proposed research is to understand  the developmental changes that occur during the transition  from vegetative to reproductive growth in Arabidopsis  thaliana.  Physiological experiments suggest that  environmental as well as endogenous factors regulate the  time to flowering.  Relatively little is known, however,  about the genes and their protein products that are required  in this critical transition to the reproductive state.  The  identification of mutants altered in floral induction and  the isolation of the corresponding genes will contribute to  the understanding of this complex process.  An Ac/Ds  transposon system was developed for mutagenesis and gene  isolation.  This system has been used to generate an early  flowering mutant, eaf20, that makes the vegetative to  reproductive transition earlier than wild-type plants grown  in the same condition.  Genetic and molecular experiments  indicate that the eaf20 gene is tagged with Ds. The Ds  transposon sequences were used to isolate a small segment of  the flanking genomic region that encodes the flowering gene.  Future experiments will focus on isolation and  characterization of genomic and cDNA clones that correspond  to the eaf20 gene.  Genomic clones covering the eaf20 region  will be cloned using the previously isolated Ds flanking  sequence.  To confirm that the eaf20 gene has been isolated,  a complementation experiment will be done in which the  genomic clones are introduced into the eaf20 mutant plants  and screened for rescue of the mutant phenotype.  Sequencing  of the genomic copies of the eaf20 gene will provide  valuable information regarding regulatory regions of the  gene that will be used for subsequent studies.  The genomic  clones will also be used to isolate eaf20 cDNAs.  Sequencing  the eaf20 cDNAs will be followed by database searches to  look for regions of similarity to genes with known  biochemical functions.  These molecular studies will lay the  foundation for fut ure experiments and will contribute to our  understanding of floral induction in Arabidopsis.",
