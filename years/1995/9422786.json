 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Herman, Tulane University, is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his   theoretical work on the development of semiclassical methods for the   evaluation of vibrational relaxation rates in condensed media.  The goal   of this work is the development of well tested, accurate methods that are   sufficiently flexible so as to allow for the evaluation of the   vibrational energy relaxation in a broad range of physical systems.  The   strategies for the development of these methods employ a quantum   mechanical description of the vibrational motion of the molecules.    Semiclassical techniques are employed to describe the time evolution of   the nonvibrational degrees of freedom in the system.  These methods allow   for the coupling of the evolution of the nonvibrational degrees of   freedom to the quantum vibrational transitions, while retaining much of   the computational advantage of a classical mechanical description.  The rate at which molecules gain and lose vibrational energy influences   reaction kinetics, energy transport, the interpretation of spectroscopic   experiments and many other processes occurring in liquids, dense gases   and solids.  The theoretical description of this problem, in a manner   that leads to quantitative predictions, requires that the vibrations be   treated quantum mechanically.  The evaluation of transition rates between   quantum states of the molecule in a condensed phase system is an   important and challenging theoretical problem, requiring the coupling of   quantum techniques with procedures for averaging over the multitude of   configurations available to the condensed phase system.",
