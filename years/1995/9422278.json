But the settings in which it takes  place vary immensely, and these different settings shape the  questions researchers ask about bargaining. Economists, for  example, have generally focused on situations of voluntary  exchange. A seller, for instance, cannot compel a buyer to pay  more than the buyer believes the object for sale is worth; the  seller and buyer must agree on a price. This focus on voluntary  exchange leads naturally to a set of questions and concerns that  have received an enormous amount of attention since Rubinstein's  (1982) seminal paper renewed interest in noncooperative  bargaining theory: Does bargaining lead to Pareto eflicient  outcomes? Under what circumstances does Coase's theorem hold?  What accounts for delay in reaching agreement?    This project will use game-theoretic models of bargaining to  examine the effects of the shadow of power on bargaining.  Preliminary work has developed one model and employed it to study  the relation between stability and the distribution of power in  the context of international relations theory. The distribution  of power is fixed in the that model. With support from the NSF,  the model will be extended by letting the distribution of power  vary over time. The work will investigate, first, how a  time-varying distribution of power influences the timing and  terms of agreements and, second, the factors affecting the  \"stickiness\" of institutions and agreements. This study should  advance and deepen our understanding of important questions in  not only international relations but in political science more  generally.  ***",
