 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this program has two major thrusts: 1) an  investigation of the mathematical and computational aspects of the  multiframe, bilinear image-recovery problem; and 2) the development  and application of solutions for problems in the areas of high-  resolution transmission electron microscopy, and ground- and  spaced-based astronomy.  Theoretical advances in this program are  providing a unified approach to many imaging problems in which  intensity data are recorded, including those for which satisfactory  solutions have not been previously discovered.  Collaborations with  materials scientists on problems such as the study of atomic scale  processes in solid batteries are providing exciting applications  for which new methods developed in this program are being used to  enhance the resolving and information-gathering powers of electron  microscopes.    Through the teaching component, an educational program is being  established with emphasis on; 1) the development of a multi-  disciplinary laboratory in which faculty and students from many  departments jointly explore problems in remote sensing and imaging;  2) the development of multi-disciplinary courses in remote sensing  imaging in which students from many departments are included, and  the educational goals for each student -- ranging from theoretical  foundations to specific applications -- are tailored to his or her  individual needs; and 3) the use of a strong research-teaching  exchange in which cutting-edge technology is used in the classroom  and laboratory as a tool to excite, motivate, and retain enthusiasm  in the students.",
