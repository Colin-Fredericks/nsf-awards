Project funding will enable Dr. Zhu to spend three months in  Japan, resident at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, in order to  participate in on-going research projects on ionic glasses, and  learn the techniques and methods used in synthesizing advanced  materials in Dr. Kawazoe's group.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of condensed matter physics and  materials research.  The U. S. scientist will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques, data,  equipment, and facilities at the Tokyo Institute of Technology  while contributing to the overall research effort.  Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
