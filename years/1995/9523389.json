Section 2 of  PL 103-374 reauthorizing the  National Earthquake Hazards  Reduction Program (NEHRP), calls  for such an assessment of  the  Earthquake Engineering Research  Institute (EERI) will draw upon its  committee structure and membership  to survey existing testing  facilities.  EERI will commission a  set of papers and convene a  workshop to identify specific  needs, the potential for  cooperative efforts, both  internationally and between federal  and state agencies, and address  potential costs and funding  options.  The invited papers and  recommendations from the Workshop  will be compiled into a final  report to be submitted by NSF and  fellow NEHRP agencies to Congress  at the conclusion of the project.    This project is financially  supported by NSF and  NIST,  in a 2  to l ratio.  ***",
