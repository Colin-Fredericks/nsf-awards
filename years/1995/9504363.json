 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses issues of image registration, texture image  segmentation, and quantification of minor differences between  texture patterns, for example in medical images. The premise behind  the outlined algorithms is that 2-D image registration cannot  counteraffect 3-D positioning differences. The problem of precise  image registration is surmounted by comparing regions, in a manner  similar to analysis done by medical experts. The criteria for  region identification include location and intensity  characteristics. The selection procedure is divided into: (i)  selection of control points in two images (external markers and/or  selected internal points that have unique characteristics) to  determine locations of centers of regions to be compared, and (ii)  determination of region extent by image segmentation, thus ensuring  that the comparison is carried out between statistically  homogeneous regions. Hierarchical region splitting is proposed as  a means of achieving region size sensitive to subtle intensity  changes. Both intensity statistics and texture measurements are  included in region comparison procedure and decision making about  a region status.  The results of these basic investigations should  be valuable in attacking the problem of early breast cancer  detection based on comparison of different screenings of the same  patient.",
