 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long lifetime of Xe polarization and its strong  solubility in blood combine to allow the use of polarized Xe  for diagnostic imaging of parts of the human body.  In  conventional biological MRI, magnetic resonance signals are  produced by weakly polarized proton spins found in  biological tissues.  Proton spins are weakly polarized by  large magnetic fields.  What is needed for higher contrast  and better specificity in biological MRI and spectroscopy is  a benign substance that can quickly enter tissues of  interest, provide magnetic resonance signals that are  sensitive to the local physical and chemical environment,  and then leave the body.  This proposals is for work on  investigations of MRI enhanced by the use of optically  polarized 129Xe or 3He to follow on promising suggestions  that laser polarized Xe will provide just such a substance.  The proposal is an SGER request for the production of  polarized atoms followed by the study of invitro tissue  samples and small mammal models.  The study will be extended  to humans after the SGER grant is ended.",
