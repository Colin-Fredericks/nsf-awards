The importance of the proposed  research lies in its potential contribution to fields of  structural biology, where the ability to determine  macromolecular structures quickly and routinely would be  very valuable.  Current methods are time-consuming and  cumbersome, as noted in the reviews.  The two PIs bring  complementary expertise to the research:  Ke has experience  and expertise in the determination of protein structures and  Fan is a recognized authority in direct methods.  Thus, the  joint project brings together two groups with specialization  in different fields of crystallography.  Support on the  Chinese side will be provided by the Chinese Academy of  Sciences.  ***",
