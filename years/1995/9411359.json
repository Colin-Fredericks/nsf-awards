 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hatch    Under the direction of Dr. James Hatch, Mr. Adam King will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The goal of his  research is to reconstruct the development of different  organizational forms of chiefdoms in the Etowah River Valley of  Georgia during the period of ca. AD 950-1550. The Etowah site is  famous because of its large size and the raised earthen mounds  which it contains. For many years it has provided a focus for  archaeology in this region of the U.S. In addition to work at the  site however, a number of additional surveys have been conducted  and many sites of varying size located. Mr. King will work with  these data in an attempt to reconstruct the regional system of  which Etowah formed a part and to determine how this developed  and changed over time. In particular, he is interested in  learning how - and to what extent - the region was integrated  into a single political and economic unit. To accomplish this  goal, he will synthesize data from past excavations and conduct  small scale excavation to fill in several blanks. He will examine  size relations among sites to determine the degree to which a  hierarchical system existed. He will also focus on the analysis  of ceramic assemblages from a large number of sites to determine  the extent to which different types of pottery are shared among  sites. Pottery provides a good indicator not only exchange but  relative status.    Archaeologists know that many U.S. prehistoric native American  societies were organized into chiefdoms or complex social  entities which grouped large numbers of people into organized  social units. The large sites and impressive earthworks in the  Southeastern U.S. attest to such a large regional system. However  it is not clear how it developed and was maintained. The degree  to which centralization took place is also not known. Because of  long term archaeological interest in this region a great deal of  data is available. However it has not been synthesized and Mr.  King will undertake t his task. The result will be of interest to  many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the growth of  complex society and aid in the training of a promising young  scientist.",
