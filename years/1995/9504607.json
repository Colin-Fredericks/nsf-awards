Surgery is a mature subject, with the major open  questions being the Borel/Novikov conjecture and the four-  dimensional topological surgery conjecture.  James F. Davis  investigates topics connected with the Borel/Novikov conjecture:   the implications of this conjecture for stable-diffeomorphisms of  four-dimensional manifolds and for the study of manifolds with  infinite fundamental group.   Kent Orr investigates the homological  and geometrical properties of the fundamental group and its  transfinite lower central series.  This centers on the parafree  conjecture and its relevance to four dimensional cobordisms of  three-manifolds, the study of knots and links in dimensions three  and above, and the four-dimensional topological surgery conjecture.       An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points which is locally  modeled on an n-dimensional linear space.  For instance, a surface  is a locally 2-dimensional linear space.  The principal problem of  geometric topology is the classification of manifolds.  Two  manifolds are the same if there is a continuous function with a  continuous inverse between the manifolds.  One pathway to  understanding manifolds is through the fundamental group.  This  provides a transition to algebra.  The researchers emphasize the  use of homological and geometric techniques, and focus on both high  dimensional and low dimensional manifolds.  Four-dimensional  manifolds are of particular interest, as the results and techniques  in this dimension manifest the harmony of the algebraic techniques  which have found success in high dimensional manifold topology and  the geometric techniques which prevail in dimension three.   Investigating the foundations of manifold theory is important for  geometry, algebra, physics, and differential equations.  ***",
