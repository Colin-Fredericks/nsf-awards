 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418793  Siegfried  The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism of cell-  cell communication that regulates the development of the fruit fly  Drosophila melanogaster embryo.  Wingless is a protein that is  expressed in a subset of cells in the embryo that can signal to  neighboring cells that don't express the Wingless protein and  regulate their fate. The mechanism of this cell signalling is  unknown but we have identified a number of other molecules that are  involved in the signalling pathway.  Zeste white 3 kinase, which  has the ability to modify other proteins by adding phosphate to  them, and potentially alter their activity, is one component of  this pathway.  We propose to identify the proteins which Zeste  white 3 kinase does modify and to determine how Zeste white 3  kinase activity is itself modulated.  The investigation of Zeste  white 3 will lead to a greater understanding of the Wingless  signalling. This is relevant to the understanding of vertebrate  growth and development since Wingless is similar to proteins found  in mice that are required for normal development.  In addition, the  Wingless signalling pathway is likely to be conserved in  vertebrates since components such as Zeste white 3 also have  vertebrate counterparts.   ***",
