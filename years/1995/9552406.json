The equipment is an integral part of a  new course in environmental geophysics that allows students to  apply scientific concepts and state-of-the-art technology to  geological, engineering and environmental problems.  This course is  intended to teach upper-level undergraduate students how to ask  questions, collect appropriate data and how to interpret that data  in a meaningful way, in short, train students to think  scientifically.  In addition, GPR is used to demonstrate the  practical utility of geophysical measurements to first and second  year undergraduate geology and engineering majors through real time  visualization of familiar shallow sub-surface structures.",
