At this  time, the details of the effects of  the earthquake are unclear.  However, the death toll has risen  above 5000, and there is evidence  of widespread disruption of the  civil  infrastructure, including  damage and collapse of thousands of  engineered structures.  Both  geotechnical and structural issues  appear to have contributed to the  observed damage. While there are  many differences between the  conditions in Japan and those in  the United States, it is clear that  this tragic event holds many  lessons for U.S. construction  practices.  Many of the lessons  will be lost unless efforts are  made as soon as possible to gather  perishable data.    This project provides support  through NSF's SGER award mechanism  to assemble a team of researchers  from the  United States to travel  to the epicentral region, gather  data, prepare a written report, and  coordinate with other groups from  the United States having similar  missions.    The team focus on the following two  specific areas:         (a)  Building Structures, and       (b)  Bridge Structures    A technical report on the  reconnaissance team's findings will  be prepared and distributed.",
