 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507255  Tasayco  The goal of the research is to establish the principles underlying  the folding of  -sheets.  The approach chosen is to study the  structure, stability, dynamics and folding of a family of protein  fragments.  It is proposed to dissect E. coli thioredoxin, a well-  characterized small monomeric protein with a mixed   -structure,  into fragments.  They will be generated using tools of  biochemistry, chemistry and molecular biology.  These fragments  will be characterized using a combination of biochemical and  biophysical tools with increasing level of structural detail.   Circular dichroism in the far and near UV, fluorescence,  multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and  computer modeling will also be used. The educational aspect of this  proposal aims to complement the lectures of the standard  one-semester Physical Chemistry course for Biochemistry majors  using the Inverse Prediction Approach, which consists of building  a physical 3D-model of a macromolecular and using it to predict its  biophysical properties.   %%%  The ability to correlate structural changes with ahanges in the  biological function holds the key to the understanding of the  structure-function relationship of biological macromolecules.   However, protein structures are not established at the same pace at  which new amino acid sequence are generated.  Thus solving the  \"protein folding problem,\" that is, predicting the three  dimensional structure of a protein based solely on its primary  sequence, has become an area of intense research.  Much progress  has been made in the understanding of the principles behind the  formation of one kind of structure commonly found in proteins, the   -helix. However, little is known about the formation of  -sheets,  another equally important structural component.  This research will  compare the structure, stability and folding of the fragments of  thioredoxin and their association products with those of the  original protein to elucidate the folding of  the still little  understood  -sheets.  ***",
