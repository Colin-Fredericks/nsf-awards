 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is developing a vertically integrated hands-on  component for the mechanical engineering curriculum, which  provides timely exposure to state-of-the-art equipment and  experimental techniques.   The new approach provides for  dovetailing of the experiments with the theory leading to better  comprehension and retention of engineering fundamentals for the  students.   It also builds on the previous experiments and  theory, enhancing and reinforcing those topics.   As such it will  be an application of vertical integration of just-in-time  experimentation.   This new program fits well into the overall  curriculum revision the Department of Mechanical Engineering and  Engineering Science has undertaken.   The faculty of the  department are strongly committed to this curriculum revision.    This hands-on component of the curriculum is being utilized  starting freshman year and continuilg throughout the rest of the  curriculum.   To accomplish their goals, the faculty have  identified specific areas and equipment.   These areas are  instrumentation, data acquisition, fluid mechanics, heat  transfer, kinematics, controls, and manufacturing.   The faculty  believe such a curriculum can benefit the students and can be  used as a national model that integrates the various curriculum  revision trends.",
