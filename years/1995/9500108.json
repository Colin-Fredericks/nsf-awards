 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500108  Rutledge  Colorado State University (CSU) has operated a National Facility, CHILL Radar,  under a Cooperative Agreement (CA) with NSF for the past five years.  This proposal  is for a new five year renewal of the CA between NSF and CSU to continue operation  of the CHILL Radar as a National Facility.  The radar facility is used to support  education and research activities, both at CSU and at other universities or research  institutions supported by NSF.  Under this renewal of the CA, additional upgrades  will be completed for a dual-transmitter, dual receiver system which will provide the  atmospheric community with a state-of-the-art, highly advanced surface based radar  facility for cutting-edge polarimetric and Doppler research.  The CHILL Facility will  be one of the most advanced meteorological radars available for basic research and  education.  The facility will be directed by faculty from the Departments of  Atmospheric Science and Electrical Engineering of CSU.  A full time staff composed  of a Facility Manager and Senior Engineer will operate and maintain the radar  facility.  The proposal offers technical improvements to the radar system, access to an  advanced radar facility for the university research aommunity, an in-house research  program, and integration of the facility into the atmospheric and electrical engineering  educational activities.",
