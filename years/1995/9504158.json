Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean  and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are:  (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of  the present day arctic climate, including its variability, using  General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis  of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model  input, model validation and climate monitoring.     This work involves development of new technology for solar infrared  flux measurements at the Arctic Ocean surface.  Efforts will also  be made to develop an all season algorithm to retrieve total and  multi-year sea ice concentrations from SSM/I 85.5 Ghz imagery from  satellites and conduct a validation of polar cloud detection  principles, using AVHRR data matched with surface all-sky photography and sea ice  coverage logs.  This proposal focuses on  SHEBA PHASE I technological development and analysis of existing  data sets.",
