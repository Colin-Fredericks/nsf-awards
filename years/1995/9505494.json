The project combines analytical and computational expertise  from the US and state-of-the-art experimental facilities  from China.  It applies optimum system design techniques to  a variety of mechanical engineering mechanisms.  This  project continues work initiated under an earlier two year  award, through which methodology of limiting performance  analysis for rotors and mechanisms was developed.  Limiting  performance technology has had extensive development in the  US, but is in need of verification of the theories with  practical applications.  During this study, the University  of Virginia will provide the design process and analysis,  Tsinghua University will design and manufacture the test  protocol, and carry out the tests. Research results will be  used eventually in improved design of mechanical systems  involving the protection of the human body in impact  situations (helmet design, for example).  ***",
