 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Okikiolu  DMS-9506057    Okikiolu will investigate the connection between zeta-regularized determinants of certain elliptic operators on a manifold with boundary and certain Toeplitz determinants on the boundary.  She has proved a Campbell-Hausdorff formula for elliptic operators and a related trace formula, and developed new methods for symbolic computation.  She will now extend these results to manifolds with boundary.  Okikiolu also has proved an analogue of the strong Szego limit theorem for spheres of dimension two and three, and will further generalize this result.    Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.",
