 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of the national information infrastructure is a top  priority direction by which this country has chosen to drive its  technology to the future, innovate its social and economical  interests, and maintain its international competitiveness and  technological lead.  At the backbone of this information  superhighway lies the breakthrough technology of optical networks.   This research outlines the relevance of the mathematical techniques  of algorithmic graph theory and combinatorial optimization in the  design and operations of backbone all-optical networks.  Three  prototype classes of problems will be investigated.  The first  class is new and it exemplifies minimization of investment cost.   The second class is also new and it exemplifies optimization of  service.  The third class exemplifies maximization of technological  benefits, and has been previously examined under different model  assumptions.  The significance of automation in high speed network  studies and relevance of algorithms and optimization in the  manufacturing of all-optical devices for all-optical networks will  be outlined.    Interactive activites include:  teaching a graduate course on  Approximation Algorithms and Applications, teaching an  undergraduate course on Introduction to Algorithms, organizing a  workshop on Computational Support for Very High Speed Networking,  and organizing student field trips to visit laboratories at  Bellcore.",
