 "awd_abstract_narration": "Qammar    9502327    This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant which includes both a research as well as an educational component.    Research:  The objectives of this research are to investigate how improved controller designs may allow a process to operate in a chaotic region which could correspond to the economic optimum, thus limiting overdesign and inefficient operation.  Numerical simulations using ideal chaotic systems where the underlying properties of the chaos are known will be performed on conventional feedback controllers to identify the effect of chaos on controller performance.  One measure of the performance will be the basin of attraction for the desired reference state.  A realistic model of an industrial-scale, chaotic polymerization reaction and another model of chemical passivation of metals in solution will be applied to a number of existing control algorithms including PID, exact-linearization, dynamic matrix control, an adaptive nonlinear predictive controller, and nonlinear inferential control.  In addition, an extensive study of nonlinear model predictive control will be performed to determine whether models, horizon times, or observers developed from chaos theory perform better than the generic choices.  Research will be performed on the applicability of NARMAX models and an ODE synchronization modeling technique to noisy, experimental data sets and a data-set describing a non-stationary process.  This work will be done in collaboration with researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and NASA Lewis Research Center.  The usefulness of the resulting models for process control will also be investigated.    Education:  High student attrition is a problem at many universities, especially for women and minorities in engineering.  As part of her educational career plan, the PI intends to develop and implement a number of new courses.  A multi-level design course for undergraduate chemical engineers will be developed.  A typical design group will consist of st udents from freshmen to seniors.  Each level will be responsible for that aspect of the project in which they have completed coursework.  The objective of the course is to minimize student attrition, especially women and minority students.  She also plans to develop a senior level project in advanced computational methods.  There are three main objectives in the course, to encourage computationally adept ChE students to pursue an advanced degree, to provide these students some experience in teaching via example problem development, and to reinforce the relationship between computational techniques and their application to fundamental chemical engineering concepts.  To support her research efforts, graduate courses in advanced process control, advanced computational methods, and the analysis, identification, and modeling of chaotic data will also be developed.",
