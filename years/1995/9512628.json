 "awd_abstract_narration": "This request is for construction of state-of-the-art  instrumentation which would allow study of the effects of  changes in CO2 concentration on regenerating oak woodland in  southern California. There is an  urgent need to develop and  make available new instrumentation allowing the study of  ecosystem-level  responses to elevated CO2. Currently available data from  chamber-based studies, while valuable, do not  allow confident predictions of ecosystem-level responses.  Obtaining ecosystem-level responses to elevated  CO2 requires ecosystem-level manipulations of CO2. At  present, Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) is the  most promising technology available for such large-scale  manipulations.    We propose to expand our existing Free-Air CO2 Enrichment  (FACE) facility, which currently   consists of a single FACE ring in the California chaparral,  with plans to build a second, control ring, by   constructing six more rings in adjacent regenerating oak  woodlands. Our FACE system allows the   experimental manipulation of atmospheric CO2 concentration  over relatively large areas (177 m2) of   ecosystems without the use of chambers, presumably  eliminating or minimizing \"chamber\" effects. These   additional rings will each be maintained at one of five CO2  concentrations from current ambient (350 ppm) to more than  twice current ambient (750 ppm) in 100 ppm increments. This  expanded FACE facility will allow large collaborative  studies of the effects of elevated CO2 on ecosystem  source/sink status, water flux, energy balance,  productivity, soil nutrient processes, and community-level  processes. We anticipate this  facility will attract  cooperation with numerous scientists and students from  around the world, because of the unique opportunities to  study CO2 effects on intact ecosystems at a relatively large  scale, because of the likelihood that semi-arid woody  ecosystems will respond positively to CO2, and because of  the  international interest in semi-arid ecosvstems in ~eneral  and in Med iterranean-type ecosystems in particular.    Our expanded FACE facility will not only contribute to  greater knowledge about the responses of  semi-arid ecosystems to elevated CO2, but will also lead to  better predictions of how ecosystem-level  processes, including ecosystem source/sink status, may  change in the future. The facility will also allow  enhanced collaboration on an international scale and will  result in unparalleled opportunities for student   training.                             11",
