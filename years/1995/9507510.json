 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507510  Feather    This U.S.-Slovak cooperative research project between Dr. Milton  Feather of the University of Missouri-Columbia and Dr. Jan Hirsch  of the Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, will  address a series of disaccharides, as starting compounds in the  Maillard reaction (nonenzymatic browning), a naturally occurring  reaction between sugars and proteins and/or amines.   These  sugars will be used to study the effects of position and  substitution of the nonreducing residue on the course of the  reaction.  In the process, the researchers intend to chemically  synthesize several series of disaccharides derived from D-xylose  and D-glucose to convert them into Amadori compounds (1-amino-1-  deoxy-2-ketose sugar compounds).  These compounds will then be  studied for degradation reactions.  Results are expected to  provide insight into far ranging natural processes such as those  that affect food flavor and aroma production to an in vivo  reaction involving protein modification related to aging and  diabetes.    This biochemistry project in organic dynamics fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling  leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to  combine complementary talents and pool research resources in  areas of strong mutual interest and competence.      ***",
