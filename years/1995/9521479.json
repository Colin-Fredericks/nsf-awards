 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521479  Pepperberg    With this \"Small Grant for Exploratory Research ,\" a group  headed by Dr. Irene Pepperberg will conduct new studies on  how the brain controls vocalization.  The work will involve  a unique model system -- parrots that have been taught  English utterances.    Most of the existing knowledge on the neural control of bird  song comes from passerine songbirds such as canaries and  finches.  In order to study how other types of birds control  vocalization, the Pepperberg group has turned to parrots.  When parrots are taught English phrases, they form them into  song-like utterances and this offers the unique opportunity  to study vocal behaviors that are similar to those of the  well-known songbirds.  In order to understand how the brain  controls this behavior, the activity of various regions of  the brain  will be changed in a reversible manner while song  is being attempted.  This should provide information on  whether or not different groups of birds use different brain  mechanisms to produce song.  These studies will influence  our understanding of brain evolution, the neural control of  motor behavior, and the emergence of cognitive capacities  within animals.  ***",
