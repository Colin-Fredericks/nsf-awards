 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310943  Measures       The investigator will determine the concentrations of  dissolved iron, aluminum, manganese, selenium, and beryllium at  numerous stations throughout the Arabian Sea during the U.S.JGOFS  Arabian Sea Process Study.  Because of their different  chemistries, these metals can be used as indicators of various  biological, geochemical, and hydrographic processes.  They also  are interesting biologically, because, with the exception of  beryllium, they are required by marine biota and yet are present  at very low levels in ocean water; in particular, iron has been  recently implicated in other U.S.JGOFS studies as a limiting  nutrient for oceanic production far from the continents.       Taking advantage of the fact that the seasonal monsoons  trigger environmental conditions promoting primary production in  the Arabian Sea, the investigator expects to study the quantity,  fate, and biological impact of trace metals delivered from the  surrounding land masses to the Arabian Sea in aerosol form by the  monsoon winds.  He will also study how seasonal low-oxygen  conditions in the AS water column affects trace metal reactions  and the relationship between regional hydrography and trace metal  geographic distribution.  In the long term, the PI expects that  this study will inform our understanding of trace  metal/biological/hydrological relationships in the context of the  global carbon cycle.  ***",
