 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate statistics majors and mathematics majors with an  emphasis in statistics receive a broad education which includes  training in mathematics, applied and theoretical statistics,  computing, communication skills, and general education. Much of  this training is done in a piecemeal fashion. Students are seldom  required to combine the various skills learned throughout the  curriculum. They also seldom gain hands-on experience by  participating in real experiments. They graduate with a vast array  of knowledge but are often very inexperienced in putting the pieces  together. They are not ready to make their greatest possible impact  in the workplace. A pilot of a capstone course, which uses real  world problems, is being developed.  The projects studied  synthesize the lessons learned throughout the curriculum and  develop students' oral and written communication skills to the  level expected of professional statisticians. The synthesis will be  achieved by having teams of students participate in work on  projects from the industrial/real world arena. They will also study  technical writing and oral presentation modules. Students will  prepare formal written and oral reports. If a report is not of  professional quality, the student will be given considerable  feedback and required to repeat the report. All students will leave  the course with a firm understanding of the communication skills  required of the professional statistician.",
