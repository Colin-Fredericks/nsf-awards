 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  This award supports a project to understand the geochemical  evolution of the Kerguelen plume.  Mantle plumes are a major  vehicle of heat and mass transfer from the Earth's interior.  They are also important geochemical windows through which  materials and processes of the Earth's interior can be  studied.  Among mantle plumes, the Kerguelen plume is  distinctive because it has created a long (>120 million  year) magmatic record which included the Kerguelen Plateau,  one of the largest oceanic plateaus, the Ninetyeast Rdge, a  nearly 5000 kilometer linear chain of volcanoes which formed  as the Indian Plate moved northward over the plume, and the  Kerguelen Archipelago on the Antarctic plate.  This island  complex, active from about 40 million years ago to the  present, is largely composed of a thick (about 3 kilometers)  basaltic plateau lava sequence.  This project will undertake  detailed geochemical studies of the basaltic rocks on the  Kerguelen Archipelago as well as mafic and ultramafic  xenoliths occurring in the basaltic lavas.  This is a  collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  Woods Hole Oceanographic institution and the University  Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.  This collaborative research program is divides into two  projects:  (1) The Basalt Project is a study of lavas forming  stratigraphic sequences in the plateau lavas which are the  oldest and most voluminous extrusive unit in the  archipelago. The temporal variations in lava compositions  and isotopic ratios of strontium, neodymium and lead will be  used to determine temporal variations in proportions of  mantle source components, characteristics of the melting  process, magma supply rates and crustal processing history,  and to evaluate various models for the geochemical  characteristics of the plume.  (2) The Xenolith Project is a study of lower crustal and  mantle xenoliths.  This research will include petrography,  major and trace element abundances and isotopic ratios of  minerals.  Geoch emical results, including geothermometry,  geobarometry, and geochronology, will be used to understand  provenance of the xenoliths and to infer the geodynamic  environments and geochemical processes which existed during  the evolution of the plume.    These results of this research will better constrain  physical models of the evolution of the Kerguelen plume,  specifically, and mantle plumes in general.",
