 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whelan    Under the direction of Dr. Mary Whelan, Ms. Margot Neverett will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will continue her  analysis of abundant faunal material collected during the  excavation of the Gast Farm site which is located on an alluvial  fan at the edge of the Mississippi River in southeastern Iowa.  Four seasons of fieldwork have been conducted at the site and  these reveal two distinct periods of occupation both dating to  the Woodland period. The shift from the earlier Havana to later  Weaver phases took place approximately 2,000 years ago. Spatially  discrete remains of both Havana and Weaver villages have been  discovered. The sites have yielded abundant faunal as well as  other cultural remains and in her NSF supported research Ms.  Neverett will focus on the former. She will travel to La Crosse  Wisconsin and Springfield Illinois to examine comparative  collections which will permit detailed identification of the Gast  Village faunal remains. With the data collected she will then  reconstruct subsistence patterns and determine how food was  obtained and distributed in each time period.    The Gast Village Site forms part of the Midwestern Hopewell  complex. Hopewell has fascinated archaeologists in part because  the large mounds which Hopewell people constructed and the exotic  trade objects they obtained provide evidence for one of the  earliest complex highly-organized societies in North America. Of  equal interest is the decline of the Hopewell peoples because  over a relatively short period of time social organization  reverted to a less complex level. No new earthworks were  constructed and exotic trade items became rare. Archaeologists  have speculated on why this happened and have invoked a number of  causes such as environmental change. Ms. Neverett will approach  this question through an examination of social relations within  villages on each side of the transition and faunal remains  provide a convenient approach.     This research is important for  several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of how complex societies arise and decline, and  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
