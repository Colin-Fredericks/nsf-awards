 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Science Camp (SSC) program will take place on the San  German campus of Inter American University of Puerto Rico.      The project goal is to provide the foundation for a lidelong  interest in science and mathematics to underrepresented minority  students in Puerto Rico in the intermediate schools with the  objective of encouraging these students to consider science,  engineering and mathematics as possible career choices.  The  program will offer an intensified mathematics and science  enrichment program during a five-week period in the summer, and  will serve seventy-five (75) students each year selected from area  schools.  The program will provide instruction in math, computer  science, the biological and physical sciences, and in Spanish and  English communications skills as related to science.  Other program  activities include field trips, hands-on laboratory experience,  counseling and orientation, seminars, training in study skills,  career exploration activities, and motivational activities.  A  follow-up component will be held during the regular academic year  to permit project continuity and increase effectiveness.    The participants are expected to be equally divided between males  and females and predominantly Puerto Rican.  The outcomes of the  SSC program will be seventy-five underrepresented students annually  in Puerto Rico who will have increased their academic skills,  performance and motivational levels to enter and successfully  compete with their peers in a science, engineering or mathematics  career.  ***",
