He  will collaborate with Drs. Yoshiki  Sato, Tohru Kamo, and S.  Futamura of the Hydrocarbon Research Laboratory of NIRE.  Professor David Bodily of the Chemical and Fuels Engineering  Department, University of Utah will also participate in the  project.    The research is aimed at improvements in the recovery of  polymers and monomers from mixed waste plastics by selective  solvent dissolution and depolymerization at low-severity  conditions. Hilderbrand's regular solution theory will be  used to select solvents for the dissolution of waste plastic  mixtures. The mixtures are difficult to separate by physical  processes, and contamination by plastics such as polyvinyl  chloride creates conversion and disposal problems. Processes  such as incineration and pyrolysis cause potential air  pollution problems and low recovery of the energy contents  of the plastics. The combined liquid-phase process has the  potential to recover high yields of high-quality materials  from plastics. Chemical characterization of the recovered  products will provide for determination of the composition  of reaction products, aid in the selection optimal reaction  conditions, provide information for the understanding of  reaction mechanism, and verify the effectiveness of the  propose recovery scheme.  ***",
