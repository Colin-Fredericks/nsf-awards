In addition, counterfeit products such  as computer chips, compact discs, and designer fashions, are  arriving on our shores in great numbers.  With the rapid advances  in computers, CCD technology, image processing hardware and  software, printers, scanners, and copiers, it is becoming  increasingly easy to reproduce pictures, logos, symbols, paper  currency, or patterns.  Credit cards and passports currently use  holograms as a security measure to thwart copying.  But technology  has advanced to the point where the holographic image can be easily  acquired from a credit card - and a new hologram synthesized using  commercially available optical components or hologram-producing  equipment.    We propose a novel system for security verification of credit  cards, passports, and other IDs so that they cannot easily be  reproduced.  The system uses a new scheme of complex  phase/amplitude patterns that cannot be seen and cannot be copied  by an intensity-sensitive detector such as a CCD camera.  The basic  idea is to permanently and irretrievably bond a random phase mask  to a primary identification pattern such as a fingerprint, a  picture of a face, or a signature.  For additional security, the  primary pattern could also be phase encoded which results in a very  secure system.  Both the random phase mask and the primary pattern  are identifiable in an optical system.  ***",
