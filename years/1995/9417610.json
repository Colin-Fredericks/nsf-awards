 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deutscher  9417610  The study of enzymes and metabolic processes in vitro can give only a partial picture of how  enzymes actually function in cells.  A growing number of investigators have begun to consider  how the interaction of macromolecules, their restricted movement, and the high concentration  of these components within cells all influence the catalytic action of enzymes in vivo.  This  information is at the forefront of an emerging discipline that is attempting to meld what is known  about cell structure, macromolecular organization, metabolic pathways, and enzyme mechanisms  into a coherent picture of how cells carry out their many metabolic processes.  %%%  The Gordon Research Conference on Enzyme Organization and Cell Function will meet in  Oxnard, California, January 15-20, 1995.  It is a multi-disciplinary meeting that brings together  enzymologists, structural biologists, cell biologists and molecular biologists who all share a  common interest in trying to understand how enzymes, and other macromolecules, are organized  and function within cells.  It is the aim of this conference to foster the interaction and exchange  of ideas among the workers in diverse fields whose research is directed towards elucidating how  enzymes are organized and function in vivo.  ***",
