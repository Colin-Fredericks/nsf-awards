 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418219  McNutt  This project will support a post-doctoral investigator to  complete an existing database ion volcanic tremor from more  thal 160 volcanoes around the world.  The most important  parameter to be investigated is the amplitude of tremor  which is normalized to reduced displacement.  This problem  is as fundamental as the determination of earthquake  magnitudes.  Preliminary results show that tremor reduced  displacements during eruptions are proportional to the  Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), which is proportional to  the tephra volume.  We propose to test the hypothesis that  the energy of volcanic tremor is directly proportional to  the volume of magma and its contained volatiles.  We will  measure the seismic efficiencies of tremor, and we show  preliminary data that suggest there are different  efficiencies for different eruptive mechanisms.  This  project is complementary to many theoretical studies.  It is  broad and wide ranging because it includes data from all  known seismically monitored volcanoes worldwide.  Although  the chief value of the project is scientific, several  components, especially reduced displacement versus VEI, also  have a direct bearing on volcanic hazards assessment and  forecasting.",
