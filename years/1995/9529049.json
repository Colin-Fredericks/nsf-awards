 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron magnetic resonance methods at 9 and 35 GHz will be used to investigate the structural features  of transition metal ions of catalytic importance incorporated in microporous molecular sieve oxide  surfaces in this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The  emphasis will be on determining the location of transition metal ions in framework or non-framework  sites in aluminophosphate (AlPO4) and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) materials.  Spin echo modulation  spectrometry methods will provide information about adsorbate number, geometry, and orientation.  This  structural information will be related to the catalytic efficiency of the paramagnetic ion for probe reactions  such as olefin dimerization and propylene oxidation.  The behavior of Ni(I), Pd(I), and Rh(II) species in  AlPO4 and SAPO materials will be investigated.    In order to understand the mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis by high surface area microporous oxide  materials, structural information about the active transition metal ion incorporated into these materials  must be obtained.  This research project will utilize electron paramagnetic resonance methods to obtain  this structural information and relate it to the catalytic activity of catalyst materials for various probe  reactions.  The understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic activity is crucial to the rational design and  implementation of catalytic processes which underlie much of modern chemical industry.",
