Rogers      Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a member of the Foundation Engineering Edu-  cation Coalition, proposes to organize and conduct a conference for assessment team   members, campus coordinators, and project directors of the eight Engineering Educa-  tion Coalitions. The conference will feature presentations by experts in the assessment   and evaluation of educational innovations and their impact on students.  These will be   followed by small-group working sessions in which participants develop strategies for   applying improved assessment techniques within their own Coalitions and educational   institutions.  Approximately 80 participants are expected.  The outcome of the confer-  ence will be a set of improved assessment strategies, which will be documented in a re-  port to be broadly distributed throughout the Coalitions.    This proposed activity has been encouraged by NSF staff and will be of significant   benedit to the Engineering Education Coalitions Program.",
