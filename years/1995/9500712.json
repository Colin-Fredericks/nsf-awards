 "awd_abstract_narration": "This supports the work of Dr. Tony Pantev a post-doctoral  associate to Professor Kleiman. Three problems will be studied.  The first is to analyze the monodromy group of generalized theta  functions. The second problem asks for a geometric description of  the locus of motivic local systems on curves. The third problem  to be studied is a conjectural construction of Hyperkahler  manifolds.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.  ***",
