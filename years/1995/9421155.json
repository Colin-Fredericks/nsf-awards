 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study will address long-standing and sometimes contentious issues concerning the federal  government s ability to accurately project future supplies and demands for scientific and engineering  personnel with particular attention on the doctoral-level workforce.  The adequacy of the United  States technical workforce to meet the needs of federal programs (e.g., in defense, energy, space and  health research), as well as the broader needs of an open technological economy, have been the focus  of policy concerns by the federal government for many decades.  The situation has become even more  confusing in recent years because of the confluence of many contradictory trends that influence both  supplies and demands for such human resources (e.g., the end of the Cold War and growing international  economic competitiveness).  This study will address the need to improve our ability to make more  accurate long-term projections of the technical workforce and, perhaps as important, a need to develop  better means for integrating such information into public and private decision-making at all levels of  our society.  A  12-member committee will be formed to carry out this study over an 18-month period.  The committee will be composed of a balanced membership of  individuals including labor-market  economists, other social scientists knowledgeable about the broader social implications of being able  to make (and use) effective long-range workforce projections, and public policy representatives with  experience in dealing with the needs of high-level policy officials in the Congress and the executive  branch",
