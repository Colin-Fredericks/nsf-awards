 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roth  9408501    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative  research project between Dr. Monica Roth, Robert Wood  Johnson Medical School, New Jersey, and Dr. Oscar Leon,  Universidad Austral de Chile.  They propose to use chemical  cross-linking methods to study the interaction between  retroviral RNase H and tRNA to determine which regions of  the protein are at or near specific sites of the RNA-DNA  hybrid substrate. This approach will also help to pinpoint  amino acid sides chains that may be important for its  function.  For this purpose, RNA-DNA hybrid substrates of  RNase H will be synthesized and modified at specific sites  by the introduction of reactive groups.    The studies are of mutual benefits for both laboratories  involved and require a combination of the complementary  skills of both researchers.  Ongoing studies by Dr. Roth  apply biochemical approaches to understand the mechanism of  tRNA release by the RNase H activity and reverses  transcriptase, while Dr. Leon's expertise is in chemical  cross-linking of proteins and tRNA.  The results of the  studies are expected to contribute to the field of protein-  nucleic acid recognition.  Current procedures to be adapted  for the specific application to RNA/DNA hybrids may be  applicable to other similar systems.    ***",
