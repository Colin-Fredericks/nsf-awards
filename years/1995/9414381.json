University of Minnesota    This award supports the study of fossil diatom assemblages as  paleohydrological/paleoclimatic indicators in Moon Lake,a closed-  basin lake in the northern Great Plains.  This study will attempt  to reconstruct changes ineffective moisture (precipitation minus  evapotranspiration.  The historical relationship between diatom-  inferred salinity and climate will be used to calculate a transfer  function for effective moisture and hydrological drought (Palmer  Hydrological Drought Index) which will then be extended to the  entire post-glacial record.  Climatic conditions will be assessed  at century-scale resolution through the entire Holocene and at  decadal-scale resolution during three periods: the last glaciation-  deglaciation period, the early-Holocene forest/prairie transition,  and past 2000 years.  Paleoclimatic records from climatically  sensitive agricultural regions such as the Great Plains, where  little is known of past climate, and what is known is of a coarse  resolution, will provide a valuable contribution to the  understanding of climatic variability on local, regional, and  global scales.  Understanding drought characteristics through the  analysis of long-term trends in the paleoclimatic record will  provide valuable information for planning and managing water  shortages that may accompany future drought events.",
