The research aims at understanding the  mechanisms affecting the nodulation in legumes  planted under stress conditions such as heat  and salinity.  The work is to seek more  information concerning the cellular targets of  these stresses.  As nodulation is a  prerequisite of symbiotic nitrogen fixation,  the work will focus on this initial step.   Nodulation starts through cell division  possibly induced in G2 arrested cortical cells.  Plans call for using molecular probes and PCR  primers for two cell-cycle genes (namely  cyclin-B and cdc2) which were recently isolated  from soybean in Gresshoff's laboratory.  Focus  will be on non-radioactive PCR techniques to  define how stresses modulate the expression of  these critical genes.  The objectives of this  cooperative project are: to transfer technology  from soybean to the mungbean system; train the  research team in Faisalabad to use molecular  probes and primers to evaluate the impact of  heat and salinity stress on early nodulation of  mungbean; determine the degree of evolutionary  divergence between the soybean and mungbean  gene arrangements; and further develop the  knowledge base of cell cycle involvement in  meristem initiation and maintenance.    Scope:  This project meets a number of  important objectives of the Division of  International Programs: it allows cooperation  of two respected scientists, with complementary  capabilities, to do important scientific work;  it allows a foreign scientist in a developing  country to build the experience necessary to  continue this useful research beyond this  project; and it helps understand the causes of  a problem that affects productivity in marginal  lands around the world.  The Pakistani  scientist is one of that c ountry's most  distinguished researchers in the field, with an  impressive  record of scientific publications.   As a result of his work, the NIBGE was recently  established, with him as its first director.  ***",
