The University of  Iowa's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for  Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical System is  currently performing research addressing most areas of vehicle  design except for the power and drive train.  The University of  Texas at Austin has extensive facilities and capabilities for  research in electromechanical systems and proposes to collaborate  with the Center so that it could address total electric vehicle  design or the electric car.    This award provides funding to prepare and hold a planning meeting  at the University of Texas at Austin in the fall of 1995 to  determine a research agenda with industrial interest and to  determine if there is sufficient industrial support to warrant the  formation of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  site at the University of Texas at Austin.    The University of Texas at Austin research site will address  electromechanical component, subsystems and system modeling and  simulation.",
