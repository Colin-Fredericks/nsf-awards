 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408438  Russell  This project is on research to study the behavior of enzymes in  organic media by attachment of an enzyme to an organic polymer.   In particular, an enzyme will be fixed to a hydrophobic matrix of  polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains.  This would allow the enzyme to  dissolve in an organic solvent while maintaining activity.  The  enzyme would be attached to a polymer by: (1) direct  functionalization of the enzyme with an acrylate-terminal PEG to  produce an enzyme in an organic solvent, followed by (2) solution  copolymerization of the enzyme macromonomer with a vinyl monomer.   Studies of the enzyme stability, activity and specificity in this  environment, as well as studies on the effects of polymer  macrostructure on the overall kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed  reaction will be performed.  Also, a study of protein activity as  effected by polymer porosity, enzyme loading, the extent of  enzyme modification prior to immobilization, polymer  hydrophobicity, other physical properties, and mass transfer will  be performed.  The particular enzyme to be used in this research  is organophosphorous hydrolase, and enzyme which can degrade  certain insecticides such as parathion, and certain types of  nerve gases.  This research could have environmental impact  through the biodegradation of highly toxic compounds.  ***",
