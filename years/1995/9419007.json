Several of these RNAs have been shown to be involved in processing of ribosomal RNA precursors and the others are assumed to have roles in ribosome biogenesis as well.  A subset of the nucleolar snRNAs in vertebrates have the interesting property of being encoded in introns of protein genes.  These 'intronic snRNAs' are produced by processing of precursors that contain both mRNA and snRNA.  This discovery established a new biosynthetic pathway for snRNAs and raised several interesting questions about the processing scheme involved and the basis for this unique coding arrangement.  The proteins encoded at the same loci as the intronic snRNAs are all linked to ribosome synthesis or function and this suggests that the coding arrangement may provide some functional benefit.  Our laboratory has discovered that the yeast S. cerevisiae also contains intronic snRNAs. This finding shows that intronic snRNAs are widely conserved phylogenetically and opens the way for new approaches to studying their synthesis and function.  The intronic snRNAs discovered include a homolog of vertebrate U18 and two RNAs unique to yeast (snR38 and snR39). Yeast U18 and snR38 are encoded in genes for EF-l( and EF-l(, both subunits of translation elongation factor-one.  SnR39 is derived from a gene for ribosome protein L8.  The goals of this research are to define the RNA structural requirements for processing of an intronic snRNA, and to characterize the activities involved in the processing of intronic snRNAs.  These issues will be addressed with a combination of genetic and biochemical strategies, exploiting the special advantages yeast offers for in vivo studies and genetic manipulation.  %%%  Many of the small nuclear RNAs in eukaryotes are associated with the nucleolus.
