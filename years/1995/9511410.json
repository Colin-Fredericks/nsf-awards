Montgomery, Scientist, Fermilab, and  John Peoples, Director, Fermilab, to pursue with Drs. Joo Sang Kang, Department of  Physics, Korea University, Sun Kee Kim, Department of Physics, Seoul National University,  and Yeong Mouk Park, Department of Physics, Kyeong Seong University, for 24 months, a  program of cooperative research on the DO Experiment at the Fermilab antiproton-proton  Collider. The DO experiment will study the interactions among fundamental constituents of  matter at the highest energy available in the world today, seeking to elucidate the basic  structure of matter and forces at the shortest distance scales possible.    The DO experiment is a large cooperative project involving many U.S. institutions and  scientists from several foreign countries, as well.  The PIs hold that the Korean physicists'  expertise with particle tracking devices will benefit the DO collaboration in the development  of such devices for the DO upgrade.  Thus, the collaborative project is beneficial to the U.S.   The collaboration in a world class experimental program also will benefit the Korean  physicists and strengthen Korea's technical capabilities and infrastructure.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through  the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration  on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  The present project adds an international  cooperative dimension to the PI's ongoing research under NSF Grant No. PHY-9420671.   Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
