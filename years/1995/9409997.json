 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts research on the design, definition, and  implementation of programming languages, with emphasis on type  structure and on  bridging the gap between functional and  imperative programming.  In studying  how to implement the  programming language Forsythe, it investigates better  methods of  type checking for intersection types.  Considerable improvement  is  expected from using a top-down rather than the present bottom-  up algorithm.  A  more flexible approach to the implementation  of procedures is also  investigated, where a portion of the  procedure body is compiled into closed  code while the rest of the  body is compiled into inline code at each call site.  This is  expected to substantially alleviate the overhead associated with  call  by name.    The research seeks to unify two of the intractable dichotomies  that  complicate and divide the study of programming languages.  The goal is to unify  semantics based on domains, which permits  partial and infinite computations,  with semantics based on  partial equivalence relations and intuitionistic type  theory,  which is limited to always-terminating computations.  Also  investigated is the unification of earlier work on the syntactic  control of  interference in Algol-like languages with the more  recent development of  low-level functional languages based on  linear logic.  In particular, this  research would connect the  concept of passive types with the modal operators of  linear  logic.",
