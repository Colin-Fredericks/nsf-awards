This grant provides travel support for US philosophers of science to represent the United States scholarly community in the Xth International Congress of Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science to be held in Florence Italy in August, 1995.  The Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) has handled travel grants for previous International Congresses and will do so again with this grant.  A committee established by the PSA governing board will make recommendations for distribution of the travel funds.  Grants will be restricted to those presenting papers, having other active scholarly roles or with official duties.  Efforts are being made to assure that all disciplines in the philosophy of science are represented, that women and men participate at appropriate proportionate levels, and that worthy young scholars will have an opportunity to attend the meeting.  Grants provide assistance for air travel on U.S. flag carriers between the United States and Italy only.  Grants do not provide ground travel, per diem expenses, or registration fees.",
