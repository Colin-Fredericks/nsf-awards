 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loyola University Chicago in conjunction with Aspira of Illinois,  will offer a bilingual (English/Spanish) six week, commuter Summer  Science Camp integrating computer science, engineering, and physics  for thirty-five Hispanic middle school students.  The program  continues with a thirteen-week academic year follow-up.      The interdisciplinary activities begin with students being  introduced to basic computer architecture, after which they  assemble IBM-compatible computers for subsequently use in the  program.  Each week, the students experiment in three distinct  labs:  Digital electronics, Engineering design and control, and  Computer science programming, where computer concepts are  introduced through programming in Pascal language.  The summer  session includes career-oriented field trips to the facilities of  Argonne National Laboratories, Northwestern University, Chicago  Research & Trade (a securities trading firm), and People's Gas.   Students are paid a $120 stipend to cover their transportation  expenses and are granted a high school course credit through the  Chicago Public Schools.    Loyola/Aspira SSC replicates the DOE Loyola/Aspira Pre-Freshman  Enrichment Project (PREP), that in turn is a bilingual version of  an NSF Young Scholars Project redesigned for younger students.  The  NSF Young Scholars Project has already significantly affected  minority representation in computer science studies in Illinois.    Loyola/Aspira SSC's overall mission is to intellectually nurture  Hispanic students of limited opportunity, to provide them with  interest-stimulating experiences that enable and motivate them to  take college preparatory courses in science, engineering, and  mathematics, and to promote ultimately their entry into  sophisticated SEM careers.  ***",
