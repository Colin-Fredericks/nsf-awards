The proposed empirical models fit into a  developing literature that explains the evolution of industrial  concentration and its effect on interfirm competition.  A  long-run goal of this research is to address competition issues  that arise in antitrust economics, industrial policy, and  international trade.  The proposed models distinguish between  technological, demand, and strategic factors that affect  entrants' willingness to compete with established firms.  An  important goal is to model the effect that product  differentiation has on the extent of competitive entry.  The  research also addresses dynamic issues, including the role of  sunk costs in the timing of entry and exit.  The research will  use unique data on the location and sales of new and used car  dealers to test the models.  The empirical analysis will  illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods.  The  specific results will provide information about the role of  dealer systems in promoting retail competition.  As part of the  proposal, the author will assemble new information on consumer  search patterns and transactions prices.  These data will permit  desegregate studies of substitution patterns among overlapping  brands and dealers.  It also will provide useful information  about how consumer behavior is influenced by market structure.  ***",
