 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates in the Department of Geosciences a new  interactive computer laboratory--the Earth Systems Laboratory  (ESL)--dedicated to the visualization and analysis of Earth  features.   The project addresses two curricular needs in the  highest enrollment courses of general education curriculum:   Introduction to Oceanography lecture and laboratory.   Two  important, but difficult-to-acquire skills are developed:  first,  the ability to visualize the structure and evolution of  three-dimensional Earth phenomena with different time and space  scales; second, the capacity to understand the process of  scientific inquiry as an exploration and evolution of ideas, not  a static collection of facts.   In the ESL, students are not   passive observers, but active participants in the observation,  description, interpretation, and integration of Earth data.   The  ESL provides the essential hands-on experiences that make the  scientific discovery process come alive for our nonmajors  students.   Computers are being connected to campus and global  networks, thereby giving students access to many of the resources  available to professional scientists.   The project provides them  a guiding path for their access to data and manipulating software  by using Mosaic-type browsing software to identify resources and  to create documents that link these resources to menu items that  can be selected by students.   The project is being implemented  through the creation of new exercises made possible through the  acquisition of hardware and software for the ESL.",
