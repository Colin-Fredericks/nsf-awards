 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in electrochemical systems between Mark Orazem of the University of Florida and Claude Deslouis of the Laboratory for the Physics of Liquids and Electrochemistry at Pierre and Marie Curie  University.  The investigators will apply new statistical techniques and models using impedance spectroscopy.  Their objective is to increase the amount and quality of physical and chemical information that can be gained from impedance measurements.  Impedance spectroscopy has been established as a useful tool for characterization of electrochemical and electronic systems. The project addresses difficulties in interpretation of impedance spectra data through application of French experimental techniques.  Based on the use of driving forces, the experimental techniques isolate the phenomena responsible for the electrochemical behavior.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in statistical interpretive techniques and models.  This is complemented by the experimental and measurement techniques developed by the French investigator and his group in Paris.  Electrochemical processes play a fundamental role in many technological areas.  The project will lead to new, user-friendly methods for data interpretations for use by the electrochemical research community.",
