 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN#9506927  Wakimoto    The overall aim of this proposal is to identify products of  paternal origin that are required for early embryogenesis in  Drosophila melangaster.  This proposal concentrates on three genes,  the sneaky, paternal loss and ms(3)K81 genes.  Mutations of these  genes act as paternal effect mutations that cause defects in  development within minutes after entry of the sperm into the egg.   These mutations will be used to identify the molecules required for  normal response of the sperm to the egg cytoplasm, for syngamy and  for stable maintenance of the paternal chromosomes in the zygote.   The RNA and protein products of these genes will be identified and  their subcellular distribution during spermatogenesis and  embryogenesis will be determined.  To study the function of these  products, the consequences of mutations that alter the level or  distribution of the snky, pal and K81 products will be analyzed.   Mutant transgenes designed to test the function of specific domains  of the RNA or protein products will be constructed in vitro and  introduced into flies by germ line transformation.  New snky  mutations will be isolated and genetically characterized.  These  studies should contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of  the differences between the paternal and maternal contributions and  the regulation of the events that ensure their successful union  during the earliest stages of embryogenesis.     ***",
