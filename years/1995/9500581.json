 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves the use of algebraic, geometric  and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental questions  involving convex polytopes, their subdivisions, and piecewise  polynomial functions defined over them. Questions considered  involve structures on the set of all subdivisions and enumerative  properties of general polytopes and of spaces of piecewise  polynomials. A major focus is the application of the techniques  developed to specific polytopes of interest in optimization  theory and in the theory of multivariate discriminants. These  polytopes arise in the solution of problems in manufacturing and  distribution, and the results obtained in this project will be of  interest in these areas.     This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how  discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of  discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those  occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this  makes use of combinatorial research. In addition, the type of  enumerative information being sought in this project has been of  use in the design of geometric algorithms for problems in  robotics and motion planning.",
