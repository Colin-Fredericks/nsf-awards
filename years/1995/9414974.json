 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF and Emory University will co-fund a major renovation of 20-year old Atwood Hall for the benefit of Chemistry research and research training.  The project is part of a major effort on the Emory campus to consolidate the disciplines of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science into one large complex.  Planning for the renovation has followed a carefully developed needs assessment and design process.   NSF support which represents less than 30% of the project expense will be used to support the installation of a new HVAC system permitting enhanced environmental control, replacement of ductwork to eliminate particulate matter, conversion of new and existing hoods to variable air volume design, modification of the fire protection systems for code compliance, and installation of a 10base-T system for networking for high speed computing.     The renovations will facilitate research activities in two broad areas:  traditional inorganic, organic, physical and analytical chemistry, and new areas including materials, biomolecular, and computational chemistry.  Thirteen faculty will be direct beneficiaries of the renovation, and the majority of the 117 graduate students will receive research training and will conduct independent experiments within the renovated space.  Undergraduates are encouraged to participate in research activities, and the space enhancements will permit safer and expanded participation by this group.",
