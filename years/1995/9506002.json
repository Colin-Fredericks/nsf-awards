 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506002  Brodsky    The molecular mechanism of protein translocation into the yeast ER will  be detailed, affording a deeper understanding of how polypeptides may  cross biological membranes. Although several factors required for  protein translocation have been identified through genetic analyses,  how these components act coordinately to thread a precursor protein  across the ER membrane remains obscure. Each member of the  translocation complex will be purified using standard techniques and  analyzed with a novel biochemical complementation test. The  mechanism(s) whereby ATP drives protein translocation, perhaps by  altering the conformation and activity of a subcomplex of the  translocation apparatus will be investigated. The purification of  active members of the translocation complex will rely on an assay in  which wild type protein fractions are tested for their ability to  restore protein import to reconstituted proteoliposomes prepared from  cells with non-functional mutations in the corresponding genes. An  active subcomplex of the translocation complex was successfully  purified using this test of biochemical complementation. Once other  active components in the complex are isolated, their interactions with  one another, their associations with a precursor protein and ribosomes,  and their ability to regulate the translocation channel will be  investigated. A liposome reconstituted with essential purified factors  in the complex should support protein import and determine which  members of the translocation machine are stimulatory or regulatory. To  examine how constituents of the translocation complex interact,  affinity columns containing the required translocation factors are  prepared. Purified proteins or crude solubilized membrane extracts are  applied to the matrices to identify interacting subcomplexes or novel  members of the translocation complex. To determine which factors in the  translocation apparatus contact ribosomes and precursor proteins,  purified factors will be r econstituted into liposomes and mixed with  radiolabeled ribosomes or secreted proteins to assess their  interaction. A likely candidate for these contacts is the translocation  channel, Sec61p, which is presently 50%  pure and biochemically  complements the sec61 mutant in the reconstituted assay described  above. The interaction of Sec61p with other factors in the  translocation complex and measurements of the uptake of radiolabeled  peptides into liposomes containing either Sec61p alone or combined with  other purified proteins offer insights into how the translocation pore  is regulated. These studies will dissect an intricate protein machine  at the ER membrane that performs the first step in the secretory  pathway. The results from this study will permit an understanding of  how the transport of a protein across a membrane, an energetically  unfavorable process, is facilitated by the translocation complex: a  membrane protein machine of this complexity has not been fully examined  and reconstituted to date. The work proposed here will further the  comprehension of energy-requiring transport systems, of gated channels,  of heat shock protein function, and of the secretory pathway. Finally,  because these studies utilize a genetically defined system and  biochemical methods, novel techniques for examining membrane transport  and other cell biological phenomena will become evident.  %%%  The cell uses protein complexes to spacially organize temporal events.  These protein machines are found throughout the cell and help to  organize, for example, metabolic sequences, global cellular structure  and polarity, and traffic of newly synthesized proteins to their  correct locations.  The protein machine of interest here is an example  of the latter;  it is one which recognizes newly synthesized proteins  destined for delivery outside the cell (secretion) and, like a grocery  clerk, bags them up.  Interestingly, it only takes those items which  should be secreted, so it must recognize those items and  open up the  bag for them only -- not other proteins.  The movement (translocation)  of proteins into the bag, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is regulated  by this energy-consuming protein machine.  This work is to dissect the  machine, purify the components, and reconstitute its activity using a  \"synthetic\" bag, a liposome. This type or reconstitution has not been  done before.  The components of the machine have been identified using  the power of yeast genetics; if one of the components is made  nonfunctional by mutation,  the machine stops.  The sensitivity of the  machine to these mutations can be studied both in the cell (using ER)  and in the test tube (using liposomes).  The interaction of these  components, their energy dependence, and their self-assembly in the  test tube are analyzed.  The results have application to how other  protein machines fit together and how the cell regulates what gets out  of and what stays inside the cell.  ***",
