 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop emission control strategies based on on-line FT-IR diagnostics and improved combustion modeling. Many technologies are emerging for improved incineration of hazardous wastes including turbulent spray flames, spouted bed or fluidized bed combustors, dump combustors or rotary kilns, and more innovative technologies such as plasma torch, circulating combustion bed, and solar assisted incineration. For wastes considered hazardous under RCRA, 99.99% DREs are required for incineration. Destruction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also covered under the TSCA, requiring 99.9999% DREs. The environmental impact of thermal destruction systems can be compounded by the fact that thermal treatment of halogenated wastes may result in the production of secondary wastes more toxic than the primary waste. In order to properly control the destruction efficiency of thermal treatment systems and prevent potential environmental contamination, instrumentation is needed to provide real-time control of particulate and volatile air toxics. Current analysis methods rely on laboratory procedures which may take up to two months for results, not providing any feedback for control or environmental protection. The resulting control system will be capable of ensuring that regulated DREs are met and environmental health is protected.",
