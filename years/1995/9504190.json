 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two major goals in multiprogramming research are: (1) to design  and understand the modules (e.g., processes or data objects) of a  program in  isolation, without considerations of interference by  the other modules, and (2)  to implement the modules on separate  processors with a fine grain of  interleaving so that no processor  is ever locked out of accessing common data  for long periods of  time. Further, it is essential to devise a model in which  the  distinction between computation and communication is removed; in  particular, the methods for designing and reasoning about the  interfaces should  be no different from those employed for the  computations at the nodes of the  network.    The project is based on the hypothesis that many of the  programming  concepts developed for databases, object-oriented  programming and designs of  reactive systems can be unified into a  compact model of distributed programs  that meets the desired  goals. In the past, much effort has gone into limiting  interference among the modules by employing a variety of  synchronization  mechanisms: locks or semaphores, critical  regions, monitors and communication.  In this project, no specific  communication or synchronization mechanism, except  procedure  call, is built into the model.  Yet, the traditional schemes for  communication using bounded or unbounded channels, semaphores,  and accesses to  shared memory can be encoded as modules. This  project uses two distinct kinds  of procedures, to model  sequential and concurrent aspects of programming. The  programming  model allows for disciplined interactions between these two types  of procedures.    The research seeks to: (1) develop the model, in particular for  dynamic creations of modules (2) implement the model on top of an  existing  language, and (3) develop the appropriate formalism to  specify and verify the  properties of  programs.",
