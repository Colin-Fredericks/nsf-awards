 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jarvis   9501617    This is an award made under the CAREER program to Professor Tyler  Jarvis. This product has both an educational component and a  research component. The research will be to study the moduli  space of higher spin curves and of different compactifications of  the resulting moduli space. In particular he hopes to study the  moduli of line and vector bundles on degenerating curves. In  education he has two projects. The first is a rigorous study of  the effect of class size on students in introductory calculus and  the second is to develop a new abstract algebra course for junior  level students.    The mathematical research in this project falls into the general  area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the  oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This  combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently  solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many  consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are  essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact  disks. The educational component falls into the broad area of  science curriculum reform which is vital if the nation is to meet  its need for scientifically trained adults.",
