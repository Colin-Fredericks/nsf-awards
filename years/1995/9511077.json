 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9511077  Truman, James W.      The brain contains a myriad of substances with the potential to be  used as chemical messengers between cells.  One class of messenger  molecules are small protein-like substances called neuropeptides.   These messengers can function in communication between cells where  their release is a local event or in situations where they are  carried great distances and act as hormones.  The target tissues,  either local or distant, contain recognition sites for these  substances, which then use secondary systems to transmit the signal  into the cell, thereby altering its level of activity.  Altering  the activity of a large population of cells potentially changes the  physiology and behavior of the organism.  Dr. Truman isolated and  characterized such a peptidergic messenger molecule called eclosion  hormone (EH) and has provided preliminary information on the  biological significance of this messenger.  In the present studies,  he will investigate the mechanisms employed by neurons to generate  second messengers functioning inside the neuronal targets for EH.   In addition, because of his past ability to isolate the gene  encoding EH, he will use molecular biological tools to generate  mutants unable to produce this messenger molecule and study their  behavior.  These investigations will further understanding about  the role of neuropeptides in the functioning of the nervous system  and the mechanisms used by peptides to alter behavior.",
