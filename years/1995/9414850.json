 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Guam Marine Laboratory (UOGML), the only U.S. marine laboratory in the tropical western Pacific, is a research unit of the University of Guam that serves the U.S.-affiliated islands of Micronesia, including the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Belau, and the Marshall Islands.  Established in 1970, the UOGML is uniquely situated near a variety of thriving coral reef habitats that have allowed the laboratory to become an important center for the study of tropical marine biology.  Previously, research conducted at the facility focused on the structure and function of coral reef communities with applied research programs on tropical fisheries and aquaculture.  However, over the past six years, research programs have been diversified to include chemical ecology, marine microbiology, biogeochemistry, larval biology, genetics of reef fishes, and paleobiology.  The Laboratory has acquired an international reputation in coral reef research in which the faculty have collaborated with coral reef scientist from all over the world.  Minority research programs are available, that currently involve twelve faculty members and over twenty students.   In order to maintain this treasured research base, the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will provide funds to enable the UOGML to modernize its research facility.  Funds will be used to renovate and improve the electrical and plumbing systems in individual faculty laboratories and multi-user laboratories.  Laboratory furniture will be replaced and configured to provide more efficient work space.  The availability of a modern facility is vital to research as well as to studies of the development, conservation, and utilization of the region's substantial marine resources, which are of paramount importance to the people of the western Pacific.",
