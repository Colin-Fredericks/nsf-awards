 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given an existing software system and a task to accomplish,  software engineers decide whether and how to proceed based  on experience,  judgment, and system-specific knowledge. For  even modest-sized software  systems, there is a substantial  risk of making poor decisions because it is  difficult (if  not impossible) for software engineers to maintain adequate  knowledge of the source. To manage this risk, engineers  often use high-level  models to focus on particular aspects  of the system relevant to the task.  These models help the  engineer reduce risk only if they are sufficiently  accurate  representations of the actual system.    This research investigates an  approach that may help  engineers determine whether their task-specific models  are  good enough to make informed decisions.  An engineer  defines a  high-level structural model appropriate for the  task at hand and also specifies  how the model maps to the  source. A tool then computes a reflexion model that  shows  the engineer where the high-level model is consistent with  and differs  from the source. Analyzing the reflexion model  and applying personal experience  and judgment, an engineer  can then assess the risk of proceeding with the task.  In  some cases, especially when there are unexpected  inconsistencies between  the model and the source,  computation of additional reflexion models may be  needed  before an informed decision can be made.    This project concentrates on  two activities intended to  determine whether reflexion models genuinely help  improve  our ability to effectively engineer software. The first  activity  focuses on specific enabling technical problems  related to reflexion models.  The second activity consists  of case studies with industrial partners. Kevin J.  Sullivan,  University of Virginia participates through a research  subcontract.",
