 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this conference is to bring together experts in the area of robust Bayesian inference to discuss applications, recent methodological developments and theory. Of particular interest are practical methods for implementing the theory such as those that exploit recent advances in statistical computing. Among the topics to be discussed at the workshop are: robust Bayesian methods in biostatistics, local sensitivity, hierarchical models, dynamic graphics, Bayes factros, density estimation and time series.  The term ``Bayesian statistics'' refers to a class of data analysis techniques based on probability theory .  These techniques are very general and have been successfully used in such diverse areas as quality  control, engineering, psychology, medicine, environmental sciences and astrophysics. But applications  of Bayesian methods to science and technology have been hindered since Bayesian analysis often  requires the use  of certain simplifying assumptions. ``Bayesian robustness'' is concerned with  developing techniques for understanding how scientific conclusions depend on the assumptions that are  used by statisticians when analyzing the data. Bayesian robustness is crucial for the successful  development of practical Bayesian data analysis methods. It is a relatively new, quickly growing area  and hence it difficult for researchers -- especially young researchers -- to meet and stay in touch  with the latest ideas. The objective of the  workshop is to draw together researchers to discuss the  latest advances in this field.       LEVEL OF EFFORT STATEMENT  The recommended level of support for this conference, though slightly lower than what we had hoped for, is still substantial and, together  with the funds provided by the Italian government, we expect to produce a high quality workshop.  Indeed, preparations for the conference are in progress and many top researchers have already  indicated their intention to participate. Furthermore, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics has  indicated that it is likely they will publish the proceedings in their Lecture Note series. We will  make every effort to ensure a successful conference.",
