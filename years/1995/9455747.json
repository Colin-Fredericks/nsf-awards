 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common dilemma of first-year college chemistry is that the needs  of diverse student populations are not being met by the traditional  instructor focused classroom.  At College of DuPage, Oakland  Community College, and Oakland University this diversity includes  ethnicity, age distribution, aptitude, science background, and  learning styles.  In this project, classroom time is being used to  help students develop conceptual understandings that incorporate  the ability to view phenomena from multiple perspectives.   Classroom activities stress active learning and scientific  exploration.  Topics and methods are used that reflect contemporary  science integrated with the personal experiences and interests of  students.  Interactive-multimedia materials, showing synchronized  multiple representations of chemical species and phenomena, are  being developed and used in classrooms and by groups of students.  A sense of ownership of new materials and commitment to their use  is being developed by involving faculty, from all institutions, in  their selection, design, development and evaluation.  Student  versions encourage group learning and exploration.  Training  workshops are aimed at assisting faculty in implementing the  multimedia materials in manners that promote more active learning  environments.  Evaluations assess: 1) changes in classroom  pedagogy, 2) achievement gains of students, and 3) changes in  students' attitudes toward science.  Project products will be nine  multimedia modules, student versions of each module, training  workshops and their support materials, assessment materials and  research analyses of the effectiveness of all products.",
