 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research, proposed by Computational Physics,  Inc. and Southwest Research Institute, will carry out modeling  studies of the magnitude of and spatial variation in the upper  atmosphere's 1083 airglow emission.  The project will build upon  the investigator's previous exploratory work in a two-year effort.   The investigators will include empirical and analytic descriptions  of the attenuation of photoelectron fluxes upon passage through the  plasmasphere in the iterative calculation for conjugate  photoelectron fluxes.  They will also generate comprehensive maps  (latitude vs. local time) of helium distributions and resulting  1083 nm and 388.9 nm emission intensities under a variety of  geophysical conditions, both for revealing the sensitivities of the  airglow emissions to various inputs and for supporting the analysis  and interpretation of 1083 nm and 388.9 nm data obtained by others.   In the second year, they will assess line profile features for  remote sensing of thermospheric temperatures and motions.  Helium  is a tracer of upper thermospheric dynamics, so that measured line  center displacements may offer a unique test of general circulation  models of the upper thermosphere.  However, since the 1083 emission  peak altitude is above 400 km, observed displacements will not  constitute a direct wind speed measurement, but rather will reflect  the magnitude of lateral (ballistic) fluxes governed by latitudinal  and longitudinal gradients in density and temperature as well as by  wind patterns.",
