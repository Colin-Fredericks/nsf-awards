 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toomre  9417337  The study of the dynamics of the solar convection zone requires substantial advances in helioseismic inverse theory in order to develop new analysis techniques that are needed to make good use of the highdegree oscillation data to be provided by the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) and by other helioseismology observations.  The wave-field distortions and frequency splittings of high-degree oscillations should allow one to measure large-scale flows and associated temperature fluctuations in the convection zone immediately beneath the surface of the sun.  This project will develop and refine advanced inversion techniques to interpret the observed frequency splittings and distortions in the wave field following two approaches.  The first employs ring diagrams of power spectra obtained from 3-D Fourier transforms to do mosaic mapping of the flow fields and thermal fields, with the detailed shapes and displacements of such rings depending upon the averaged velocities and their gradients within each of the small areas being assessed.  The recent potential discovery of zonal jets below the surface using preliminary ring-diagram analysis adds strong impetus to this work.  The second method uses Hilbert Transforms of acoustic wave trains, analyzing their phase and amplitude variations to detect changes in wave propagation speeds caused by underlying temperature and magnetic fields.  Phase information provided by the Hilbert transform of distorted wave packets as they travel through an assembly of convection cells is used as input to inversion procedures to obtain spatial maps of sound-speed variations.  The ringdiagram and Hilbert wave-train analyses are complementary: ring analysis is a robust local procedure which sacrificeq certain global information for simplicity, whereas the Hilbert technique is more sophisticated, relating phases in widely separated regions of the flow to obtain higher spatial resolution than is possible by Fourier techniques.  Both methods are essential  to understanding how the solar convection zone operates.  Such procedures will be first employed on high-degree oscillation data now being obtained at the National Solar Observatory with the HighDegree Helioseismometer (HDH) in order to develop them as refined tools for later use on other helioseismic data sets, including those to be provided by the NSF-funded GONG project and by the SOI-MDI instrument on the SOHO spacecraft.  ***",
