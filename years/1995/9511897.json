 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Coleman is undertaking a major study of bioscience and its role in Japanese society.  To complete his portrait of Japanese bioscience, he is examining several groups as well as individuals in Japan who pursue laboratory research in biochemistry, molecular biology and protein engineering, and the organizations in Japanese society that support (and sometimes hinder) their work.  This project offers a systematic study in another culture of bioscience as a basic science with very close connections to commercial applications.  Dr. Coleman hopes to demonstrate the pervasive influences on laboratory social organization from a number of specific elements in Japan's social structure, in particular government bureaucracy, management practices in industry, education in the life sciences, and the women's labor market.  He will present rich accounts and observations created through first-hand observation, in illustrations or qualified interpretations of aggregate survey studies.  He will thus provide a clear understanding of the direction of rapid change in the organization of present-day laboratory life science research in Japan.    Dr. Coleman is using a variety of data sets that he has already collected.  Among them are interview transcriptions and field notes from a previously supported year of participation observation in four bioscience laboratories in Japan, government surveys unavailable in English, and popular writings for both bioscientists and laypeople (also unavailable in English).  Under this grant, Dr. Coleman is undertaking additional research in Japan at the Science and Technology Agency's National Institute for Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP).  He will be examining the relations between basic bioscience research and biotechnology as an organizational and managerial issue.    This project promises contributions to our understanding of the social dimensions of the relationship between basic and applied research in the life sciences, and the constraints and opportunities of the larg er society with which research teams articulate.  It will also contribute to the current discussion regarding the role of ethnography in studies of laboratory social organization, and provide a new perspective on the \"insider/outsider\" debate concerning the epistemological status of ethnography's subjects.",
