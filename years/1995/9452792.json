 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452792  Bartlett    This three year project will develop curricular materials based on  the use of Landsat Thematic Mapper data as a learning tool for  students in grades 5-12.  As part of \"Forest Watch,\" the students  will be involved in environmental monitoring activities, ranging  from hands-on assessment of local tree species to evaluating the  Landsat data for their own hometown.  The curriculum, which will be  written by scientists and teachers, will include activities that  integrate field- and laboratory-based studies of the health of the  white pine tree, a known bioindicator of tropospheric ozone  exposure.  These materials will be evaluated and disseminated  through a series of collaborative educative workshops involving the  grades 5-12 teachers, their students, and university scientists in  a regional environmental monitoring research effort.  The effort  includes authentic problem-solving and data gathering activities  such as ground truthing, laboratory analysis of branch and foliar  samples from the white pine, and the processing, analysis and  display of Landsat data of each school area.  This grant will be  administered by the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and  Space (EOS) at the University of New Hampshire in conjunction with  WGBH, public television in Boston.",
