 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423125  Stimson    This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support addresses the  question:  Why at some times, does the American public favor  governmental action to promote racial equality, whereas at other  times, the public opposes such action?  Existing theories of  racial attitudes cannot account for such swings between  liberalism and conservatism.  The dissertation student will  propose a theory of public opinion that can explain such  variation over time.  It begins with the premise that most  citizens feel value conflict on issues of public policy,  sympathizing with both sides of most issues.  The balance of  these \"competing considerations\" is tipped by a variety of  personal and situational forces.  Among these the national media,  which frame political issues in the context of values, become the  keys to accounting for over time macro movements of opinion.  As  the media's framing of issues changes over time, as it did in the  case of race, then so will the balance of competing  considerations in the minds of individuals, and hence the balance  of policy preferences in the aggregate.  Specifically, when the  national media frame their coverage of racial issues in the  context of egalitarianism, the public comes to prefer a more  active government to promote equality.  In contrast, when the  media frame their coverage in the language of individualism, the  public becomes less enthusiastic about such government activity.   These shifts in public opinion, it is argued, lead to changes in  public policy, which in turn have significant consequences for  relative equality between blacks and whites.  The thesis is  tested in a longitudinal design where racial public opinion is  measured from existing survey materials, media framing is tapped  by content analysis, and other plausible influences are included  for full model specification.  ***",
