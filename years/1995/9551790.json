 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 10 years ago, the development of the biology curriculum  began with the establishment of a new course, Methods in  Biological Research, and the institution of a research  curriculum.   Our investigative approach emphasizes creativity,  critical reasoning and problem solving, integration of writing,  mathematical and processing skills, and self-reliance.   However,  this program is at a very critical stage:  outfitting the  physiology laboratory with up-to-date, reliable, and computerized  equipment.   This project funds the purchase six computerized  physiology workstations.   Students are being provided with  quality and reliable equipment and moving forward with the  research curriculum.   The laboratory experience is taught from  an investigative perspective that utilizes exercise as a stress  to extend and integrate basic physiology.   The foundations of  physiological control mechanisms are provided during the lecture  course, while the lab experience emphasizes understanding the  effects of acute and chronic exercise on several body systems.    Student-driven experiments test the effects of exercise on  several systems.   During the final weeks of the course, students  plan and conduct research experiments, analyze data, and present  their findings at the Annual Physiology Poster Session.   This  project enables the university to incorporate computerized data  acquisition techniques and to develop scientifically and  computer-literate citizens of tomorrow.",
