 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quality oriented management practices have lacked a well grounded behavioral theory base for explaining and predicting variance in outcomes across different organizational contexts.  This research will test and refine a new theoretical framework that will enable tailoring of quality management practices contingent on organizational conditions, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of these practices.  The new theoretical framework suggests that there are two different types of quality management practices, one type that is suited very well for quality improvement of highly certain tasks, and the other is well suited to improvement of uncertain tasks.  This theory suggests that quality practices must match the task environment if they are to be effective.  The research will be use a multi disciplinary empirical methodology combining case studies with a large scale survey.  The case studies will challenge certain aspects of the new theory, while the survey will enable generalizability of the theory as modified following the case studies.  Two previously related studies have successfully pilot some of the proposed methods.  case study research will be conducted in firms that represent a range of sizes and industries, including Zerox, Motorola, Applied Materials, U. S Bureau of Mines, and smaller organizations belonging to the Hogan Quality Consortium.",
