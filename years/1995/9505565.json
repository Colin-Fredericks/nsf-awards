 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505565  Kauzlarich    This research is concerned with the synthesis and  characterization of transition metal pnictide and pnictide  oxide compounds. Efforts will be focused on the combination  of the heavy main group pnictogens such as arsenic, antimony  and bismuth, the first row transition metals, and the  alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals. The Zintl  concept will be used to direct the synthesis of new  compounds. One objective of this research is to synthesize  new ternary compounds of the type A+ +  (MX)- , where M is a  transition metal, A = alkali or alkaline earth metal, and X  = semimetal or main group element. These new compounds can  be considered Zintl compounds if the d electrons are  localized on the metal and the bonding description remains  the same. This strategy for the synthesis of new compounds  is unique to solid-state chemistry and is a directed  synthetic effort. In addition, transition metal pnictide  oxides will be synthesized and characterized. Unlike most  compounds containing a pnictogen and oxygen atom, there is  no bonding interactions between the two in these compounds.  They are layered materials and one might expect to find  unique properties associated with compounds that crystallize  in this structure type. New compounds will be characterized  by powder and single crystal x-ray and/op neutron  diffraction, resistivity versus temperature, magnetization  versus field and versus temperature, thermogravimetric  analysis, differential thermal analysis, epr, IR and UV-vis  spectroscopy.  %%%  This project will result in the synthesis of new compounds  that may exhibit novel magnetic and electronic properties  and will expand the knowledge concerning structure,  properties, and bonding of materials at the interface  between Zintl compounds and intermetallics. In addition,  structure-property relationships will be studied. Research  on ternary transition metal pnictides will provide new  insight on the development of solids with novel properties.  Pnictide  Oxides are a small class of compounds that have not  been well characterized to date.",
