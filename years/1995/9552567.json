With the goal of working toward universal technology enfranchisement and prior support from the NSF Informal Science Education Program, the PTW Network currently links close to fifty agencies in a mutually supportive community of neighborhood technology learning centers serving people living in low-income areas who otherwise would have little or no access to computer-based technologies.  The purposes of this phase of the project are:      - to increase the number of affiliates nationally  - to provide effective support for their technology programs and to do so in a planned and thoughtful manner which also is flexible and responsive to the flows, demands, and unforeseen opportunities fro community technology center development  -- to move the affiliate membership toward independence and self-governance.     Each year of the project, PTW will work in collaboration with the United Neighborhood Centers of America, the Alliance fro Community Media, NTIA-funded programs, FreeNets, and others in three to four target areas of the US to recruitment additional primary affiliates.  The goal is to add 20 additional affiliates annually who will be supported by local coordinators and another 30 with subsidized telecommunications support.       PTW plans to enrich programmatic content at the centers with special emphasis on math and science.  The network will support an on-line math and science program consultant and  continue to recruit and support affiliates with a math/science program emphasis.     The Co-Principal Investigators for the project will be Myles Gordon, Director of EDC's Center for Learning, Teaching and Technology, and Antonia Stone, Founder of PTW and PI for the previous phases of the project.",
