Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that this novel form of DNA exists in vivo as a structural intermediate for several cellular processes including meiosis, telomere functioning, and G-rich sequence mediated recombination.  The yeast gene KEMI encodes a G4-DNA dependent nuclease.  A homozygous deletion of this gene blocks yeast cells at meiosis I, where homologous chromosomes are paired but fail to resolve, supporting the hypothesis that G4-DNA is involved in meiotic chromosome pairing.  Naked chromosomes will be isolated from meiotically blocked (kem1() yeast cells and their DNA will be visualized and examined by a light microscopy, and by CHEF gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting in comparison with chromosomes from wild type cells.  Chromosomes from keml( mutant cells blocked in meiosis I should exhibit higher-order structural changes including retarded mobility in CHEF gels, and tetrameric (4N) complexes of DNA from homologous chromosomes joined at multiple points.  This research will shed new light on meiotic chromosome pairing by demonstrating DNA-DNA interaction consistent with G4-DNA pairing in vivo,  and will establish the foundation to investigate other cellular processes in which this tetraplex DNA might be involved, such as telomere functioning and recombination.  %%%  The objective of this research is to obtain evidence for the novel G4 tetraplex DNA structure in meiotically paired chromosomes.
