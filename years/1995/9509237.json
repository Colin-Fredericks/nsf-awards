 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509237  Turchin    Reaction-diffusion theory has been employed in several branches of biology in order to understand and model formation of spatial patterns.  Among ecologists there is currently a wide appreciation of the importance of spatial heterogeneity, and it has been theorized that reaction-diffusion theory provides a common mechanisms by which such patchiness arises.  However, this theoretical explanation has not been empirically tested.  Reaction-diffusion theory will be tested in the ecological system consisting of southern pine beetles (SPB), pine trees that are attacked by SPB, and SPB predators.  This system is characterized by an extremely patchy pattern of SPB attack; in some areas, called 'SPB spots', all trees are killed, while outside spots very few trees are killed.  Reaction-diffusion theory suggests that the discontinuous pattern of SPB attack is due, at least partly, to the effect of predators disproportionately killing SPB just outside the spot boundaries.  This project will combine modeling with experimental studies.  Field studies will be used to measure the parameters of the model, and to test the model predictions.  The strongest test of the theory will consist of adding predators to existing SPB spots.    Although the primary thrust of this research is basic, it will also yield information highly relevant to applied aspects of ecology, such as the effects of spatial heterogeneity and fragmentation on biological conservation and pest control.  Moreover, if predators are found to play an important role in preventing spread of SPB spots, this will provide a very useful tool for biological control of SPB, the most destructive pest of southern pines.",
