 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this work is to develop a writing tool for native users of American Sign  Language (ASL).  Envisioned is a computer system that will take a piece of text written by a deaf  user, analyze that text for errors, engage that user in a tutorial dialogue, and generate appropriate  corrections to the text.  Some of the necessary foundation for the envisioned system are laid.  One  area of interest is the detection and correction of discourse structuring and cohesion errors.  Emphasis is on errors involving reference to items previously introduced in the discourse.  Because  there is evidence that many of the writing errors found are attributable to transfering strategies  from ASL to English, reference to ASL in the correction may be beneficial.  This requires a flexible  correction system design which is able modularly alter the content and form of a correction strategy.  Feedback is tailored to the needs, preferences, and abilities of each individual user. This is  achieved through the development of a linguistically motivated user model to track the user's  acquisition of English, and a sen tence generator which is able to tailor its output to the various  levels of acquisition.",
