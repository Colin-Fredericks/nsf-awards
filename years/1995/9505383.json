 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flora of North America (FNA) is a project undertaken by the community of systematic  botanists to provide authoritative, up-to-date information, to a wide range of users and in a variety  of media, on the names, relationships, characteristics, and distributions of the 20,000 species of  plants that grow outside of cultivation in North America north of Mexico. Flora of North America  presents an assemblage of knowledge resulting from original research as well as a fresh consideration  of any previous studies, including recent experimental research, field work, study of herbarium  specimens, and careful analysis of previous literature.  Particularly important is the unique  integration of knowledge of the taxa throug hout their range in the U.S., Canada, and Greenland.  Many  of the treatments present for the first time, and possibly the only time, knowledge that results form  a researcher s lifetime of study of a group of plants.  The treatments also incorporate results of  recent research that otherwise might not have become available to nonspecilalists for many decades.  This project is a binational collaboration between U.S. and Canadian botanists that has been endorsed  by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, the American Bryological and Lichenological Society, the  Canadian Botanical Association, and the Botanical Society of America.  It is the only research program  to have been so endorsed.  Thirty institutions have committed major staff time and facilities to the  successful completion of the Flora, and hundreds of botanists in the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere are  contribution their time and expertise to the project. Specific products of Flora of North America  include fourteen printed volumes and a CD-ROM, a new relational database, a variety of Internet-  accessible information services, including traditional gopher services, a full-featured FNA World Wide  Web site, WWW/Mosaic interfaces to online, multimedia publications, and an SQL-compliant Mosaic  interface to FNA s relational data.  these products contain data on taxonomic relationships, toxicity,  economic use, and other biologically important information that are received from specialists, edited  by project staff and editorial committee members, reviewed by taxonomic and regional specialists, and  put into final form for delivery in Internet and in print.  Additional and up-dated information is  received form a variety of sources, evaluated by the information management committee, and integrated  into the database. Flora of North America provides a unified framework for basic and applied research  dealing with North American plants and plant products.  Diverse kinds of information that have been  carefully verified by project staff and reviewers are av ailable form a single source in a uniform  format, and differing taxonomic opinions form many widely used references are reconciled and related  to an authoritative standard.  Plant anatomists and morphologists, ecologists, phytochemists,  evolutionary biologists, and molecular biologists in addition to our fellow taxonomists, all need  accurate, complete information in order to circumscribe their studies appropriately, to select  representative taxa for detailed investigations in large groups, and to interpret their results in  relation to the massive body of data now available for many groups.  Information in the database,  particularly when linked with precise locality data found on herbarium specimens, can be analyzed to  discover correlation s among geographical distribution, co-occurrence with other organisms, genetic  relationships, and morphological chemical attributes.  Flora of North America provides a gold mine of  information for further research.",
