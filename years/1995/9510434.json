Most  research  on artificial magnetic heterostructures and multilayers  has  been  done  on metallic systems; experimental and theoretical  results  for  low  carrier  concentration  systems  have  only  recently  begun  emerging.   Studies  of  such  systems are of  fundamental  importance  because   the   interaction  mechanisms  underlying   their   magnetic  properties  differ  from those of metals.  Also, heterostructures  and  multilayers  composed  of insulating or semiconducting  compounds  are  interesting  in  that  many of these materials  are  antiferromagnets,  frequently having layered structures, thus offering opportunities  for  \"engineering\" the superlattices.  Systems to be studied will be  based  primarily  on  europium  and  manganese  chalcogenides,  with  samples  prepared  by molecular beam epitaxy at the Johannes Kepler University,  Linz, Austria.  Neutron scattering studies will be conducted primarily  at  the  National  Institute  of Science  and  Technology,  and  X-ray  measurements   at   Brookhaven  National  Laboratory.    Complementary  measurements  of magnetic properties will be made at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology.  %%%  The  objective  of the proposed research is to use neutron  scattering  and synchrotron X-radiation techniques to investigate the magnetic and  structural  properties of multilayer atomic \"superlattices\"  built  up  from  magnetic and non-magnetic semiconducting materials.  Studies  of  such  systems  are  of  fundamental importance  because  the  physical  mechanisms  by  which the atoms in one magnetic layer interact  (i.e.,  communicate)  with  those  in  another  magnetic  layer   through   an  intervening  non-magneti c  layer  are  poorly  understood  and  differ  significantly from the mechanisms which apply in the case of  metallic  multilayer  superlattices.  The materials to be investigated  will  be  based  primarily  on  magnetic europium and  manganese  selenides  and  tellurides and non-magnetic lead selenide and telluride.   This  is  a  multidisciplinary project, with samples being prepared at the Johannes  Kepler University, Linz, Austria, and experimental work carried out at  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  and  at  the  Brookhaven    National   Laboratory.    In   addition,   complementary  measurements  of  the  magnetic  properties  will  be  made   at   the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   ***",
