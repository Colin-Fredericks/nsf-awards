 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422135  Moon     This award is to purchase equipment for characterizing major disturbances and designing effective equalization schemes for high density data storage channels.  Advanced signal processing and communications techniques are playing an increasingly important role in improving reliability and storage capacity of magnetic data storage systems.  Although similar to most communication channels in many respects, magnetic storage channels suffer from channel disturbances that are considerably different from those observed in other communication channels.  Presently, a communication channel model describing the read and write processes in the high density magnetic channel corrupted by nonadditive media noise and nonlinear distortion is being developed.  The effective equalization and channel estimation schemes suitable for magnetic recording under such severe channel conditions are also being investigated.  Experimental disk spindle systems are under development to pursue the channel characterization and signal processing research.  The equipment will be used to develop these experimental test spindle systems to support several research projects, including in particular: characterization of nonlinearity, design of nonlinear equalizers, adaptive channel identification/equalization, characterization of transition noise, and design of a read transducer for narrow track recording.  ***",
