 "awd_abstract_narration": "501497  Ward    Systems of ordinary or parabolic partial differential equations  serve in modeling many physical systems. The differential  equations typically contain parameters whose values correspond to  physical properties of the system. Such a system generates a  dynamical  system in an appropriate phase space. To understand a dynamical  system  we should determine its compact invariant sets, which  contain  the  non-transient solutions such as equilibria, periodic solutions,  or ones  of greater complexity. It is important also to determine the  behavior  of the transient solutions with respect to the non-transients.  Finally,  one should know how all of this depends upon the parameters. For  example,  a parameter change may induce a stable or hyperbolic equilibrium  state  to bifurcate into one or more time-periodic solutions, or ones  with a  more complex time structure. The Conley homotopy index theory  contains  concepts and methods that can be used to prove existence, and  determine  the properties, of compact isolated invariant sets in a dynamical  system.  Like topological degree the index is locally constant, and if the  index  changes as a parameter crosses a value, a bifurcation is implied.  A  major part of this project is the application of Conley homotopy  index  methods to study bifurcation in systems of reaction-diffusion  equations.  The investigators will: (I) Continue investigations of continua  of  full bounded solutions bifurcating from trivial solutions in  infinite  dimensional dynamical systems, especially in nonlinear reaction-  diffusion systems. Using Conley homotopy index methods Ward  recently  demonstrated conditions for the existence of such bifurcating  continua.  Two of the main goals of this project are to fully describe the  global  aspects of these continua, and to apply the results to the study  of  global bifurcation of equilibria in gradient systems. (II) Study  bifurcation and persistence in reaction-diffusion models arising  in  population biology an d chemistry. Physically meaningful solutions  must  have non-negative components. In this connection the  investigators  propose the development of a homotopy index bifurcation theory  for  nonlinear ordinary and parabolic partial differential systems  which  have an invariant non-negative cone. (III) Build on their earlier  work  on nonautonomous differential equations. In particular, they will  continue the development of a homotopy index based theory for  nonlinear  time-dependent ordinary and parabolic partial differential  systems. In  this case a dynamical system is not generated in the space of  initial  values, but one can associate a skew-product flow and use the  Conley  theory to study its invariant sets. From this one can derive  information regarding the original system. The investigators will  focus  on existence, dynamics, and bifurcation phenomena. (IV) Study  related  problems for semilinear parabolic partial differential equations  with  nonlinear boundary conditions, such the existence and asymptotic  stability of periodic solutions, and the effect of interactions  between  the spectrum of the linear part of such equations with the  nonlinearities.  %%%   Differential equations model physical phenomena such as  mechanical  systems, chemical reactions, and the spread of disease.  An  initial state  (e.g., initial number of infected individuals) then evolves over  time  according to the laws of the system expressed by its equations.  This  constitutes a dynamical system. A goal of dynamical systems  theory is to  describe how the states of the system evolve. Thus, the number of  fish  of a given species in a lake might tend toward a steady, fixed  population,  while the number of  individuals infected at any given time with  a  transmittable disease, such as  chicken pox,  may exhibit a  periodic  behavior, peaking every six or seven years. To understand a  complex  dynamical system one should determine the non-transient or  long-term  phenomena such as equilibria, time-periodic  regimes, and others  perhaps  of a more complex nature, the relation between the transient  solutions  and the non-transients, and how this all depends on system  parameters.  Mathematical models depend upon certain parameters fom the  physical system,  such as the volume of a lake in a study of its fish population or  diffusion  rates in a chemical reaction. The nature of the long-term  behavior of a  system may depend upon its parameter values. If the parameters  change,  the number or structure of the non-transient solutions can  change.  Such a parameter dependent change is a bifurcation. Another kind  of  bifurcation occurs when the behavior of the transients changes,  as when  an equilibrium point (a non-transient) loses stablity with a  parameter  change. Non-transient solutions correspond to invariant sets in  the  dynamical system. The homotopy index theory was developed by  Charles  Conley and others to analyze the existence and properties of  isolated  invariant sets in dynamical systems. It also can be used to show  that  bifurcations must take place at certain parameter values. A main  part  of this project involves the application of Conley homotopy index  methods to bifurcation phenomena in systems of reaction-diffusion  equations. Reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential  equations  relate diffusion phenomena, such as diffusion of a chemical in a  medium,  with reaction rates, as in a chemical reaction. They serve as the  mathematical models of  a great many phenomena, including  chemical  reactions, population densities, and climate.  The investigators will: (I) Continue investigations of continua  (families of solutions joined together) of bounded solutions  bifurcating  from equilibrium solutions in nonlinear reaction-diffusion  systems.  By using Conley homotopy index methods Ward recently found  conditions  for the existence of such bifurcating continua. Two of the main  goals  of this project are to fully describe the global aspects of these  families of bifurcat ing solutions, and to apply these results to  study  global bifurcation of equilibria in gradient systems (systems  which,  in the long run, will reach an equilibrium state). (II) Study  bifurcation and persistence in reaction-diffusion models arising  in  population biology and chemistry. (III) Build on their  earlier  work  on time-varying systems of differential equations. Such systems  exhibit  phenomena different from the time-independent systems discussed  above.  The investigators will continue to develop a homotopy index based  theory  for nonlinear time-dependent ordinary and parabolic partial  differential  systems.  ***",
