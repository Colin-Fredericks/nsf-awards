 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453861  Linn    Although the Internet offers a vast resource of scientific  information and experiences, even experts regularly report  confusion, frustration, and inefficiency when participating in  network activities.  What are promising roles of human and  electronic guides to the Internet?  The project will explore  tradeoffs between human and electronic resources, group and  individual exploration, as well as between immediate and long-term  benefits.    How can Internet tools encourage students to continuously build on  their ideas and integrate information into more abstract,  comprehensive explanations or models?  As the information highway  reaches homes, schools, and the workplace we seek to prepare  students who will continue to use it long after they complete their  science courses.    How can we help students solve personally relevant problems,  develop a firm foundation of science understanding, and continue to  explore scientific questions?  The project will draw on the  Internet participants to create innovative approaches that  dramatically improve what scientists can contribute and what  educators can deliver.  The project will document particular  solutions as well as identify broad strategies to capitalize on  this amazing resource.    The project will research solutions that encourage learners to link  and connect ideas rather than to isolate them and that allow  students to solve relevant, personally compelling problems rather  than perform exercises.  Project networking tools will build on  Mosaic and World Wide Web to take advantage of the science  information on the Internet.  The tools will help teachers design  activities that draw on Internet information, guide students as  they complete projects, and allow students from all over the  Internet to jointly discuss topics that interest them.  A central  research question for this project concerns the sort of guidance  each type of user needs to organize knowledge including users who  are autonomous as well as those who  are not.  ***",
