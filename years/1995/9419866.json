 "awd_abstract_narration": "Financial support is requested for acquisition of an X-ray  area detector to be used with an existing rotating anode  generator Rigaku RU-200. Recent advances in image detection  technology have made area detector diffractometers the  instrument of choice for X-ray data collection for crystals  of macromolecules. Indeed, the proliferation of these  instruments is the major reason for the recently observed  rapid increase in the number of protein structures  published annually. There is no X-ray area detector in the  State of South Carolina.          Our present selection of the detector is R-AXIS II produced  by Rigaku and marketed by the Molecular Structure  Corporation. The resulting facility will be operated as  X-ray Diffraction Laboratory of Institute of Biological  Research and Technology at the University of South  Carolina. The facility will be used primarily for the  crystallographic structure determination of biological  macromolecules. Immediate applications include studies of a  series of enzymes: chloroperoxidase/dehalogenase,  formyltetrahydrofolate synthase, transcarboxylase, enolase,  glutaminase/asparaginase, prostatic acid phosphatase, and  thymidylate synthase. We will also study the  bioincorporation of tellurium into proteins in the form of  derivatized amino acids telluromethionine and  tellurotryptophane.    Recently, area detectors are frequently used also in \"small  molecules\" crystallography. With Mo K radiation, they  routinely provide data sets as good as conventional  diffractometers but in much shorter time. For large \"small  molecules\" such as metal cluster complexes with organic  ligands, area detectors, even with Cu K radiation, offer  important advantages. We would like to use the area  detector to collect data for the structure analyses of  metal clusters with large unit cell dimensions and poor  stability in the X-ray beam.          The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers  graduate course CHEM745 \"Introductory Crystallography\"  every second year.  In Spring 1993 the enrollment was 10  students. The area detector diffractometer will be used to  train students in state-of-the art data collection  techniques.",
