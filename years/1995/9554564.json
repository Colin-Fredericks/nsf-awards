 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554564  DiSessa  Building on two well-developed and respected PhD training  programs in mathematics and science education research, we  propose a new program combining the best features of  cumulative , scientific research  and educational innovation. This program will create  researchers who expand our understanding of science and  mathematics education while contributing practical solutions  to problems. The Graduate Traineeship area for this proposal  is: Research and Technology for the Teaching and Learning of  Science and Mathematics targeted subdiscipline of Education  and Human Resources. Current  training in education is polarized between abstract, basic  principles  and ad hoc innovation. We seek  instead to train students capable  of (a) developing scientific principles grounded in practice  and (b) developing principled  educational innovations by  conducting design experiments in diverse, authentic  settings. We  call our approach the \"Reforming Education through Science  and  Design\" (RE:SD) paradigm. RE:SD requires training in new  inquiry methods that promote equity and capitalize on  authentic research contexts. Effective use of modern  technology, including computers and telecommunications,  requires new, creative scientific principles, but  it also enables new methodologies  of investigation and avenues of practical impact. Innovative  components of the proposed training include (a)  multidisciplinary collaboration between faculty in physical,  mathematical, cognitive,  and instructional sciences; (b) an intense, apprenticeship-  style  learning environment; (c) a proven, comprehensive commitment  to equity; and (d) success in preparing  students for the full range of relevant careers including  university faculty, policy makers, curriculum reformers, and  software designers.",
