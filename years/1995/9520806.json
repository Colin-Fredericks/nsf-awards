 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, addresses the question of the mechanism of  oxidative coupling of methane over oxide catalyst surfaces.  The  use of in situ Raman spectroscopy to identify potentially active  forms of oxygen such as peroxide, superoxide, and oxo species is a  principal focus of this work.  Isotope labeling experiments will be  used to help to identify intermediates, as well as to ascertain  rate determining steps in the oxidative and non-oxidative coupling  reactions of methane over oxide and zeolitic catalyst materials.   Coupling of methane to form aromatic products is also being  examined in this research.  The conversion of methane, an abundant hydrocarbon resource, into  more useful chemicals and fuels is an important goal of  heterogeneous catalysis science.  The thrust of this research  project is directed toward developing an understanding of the  detailed mechanism of methane conversion on oxide catalysts,  primarily via oxidative coupling reactions.  Raman spectroscopic  probes will be developed and used to provide this understanding.   The outcome of this research project could have significant impact  on this technologically and environmentally important process.",
