 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520302  Pratt    A numerical and analytical study will be undertaken of wind-driven  circulation around islands, including evaluation of the validity of  the 'Island Rule'.   Classical ocean circulation theory based on  homogeneous models has provided insight into certain striking  features of wind-driven currents such as westward intensification.  When the calculations are done in a domain closed to the north,  such as in models of the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the  interior circulation is joined to a western boundary layer whose  transport is determined by the condition of zero net meridional  transport across the entire basin.  When a large island is present,  it may also create a western boundary layer (along its eastern  coastline).     The main goals of the this research is to systematically determine  the qualitative, wind-driven circulation schemes near islands, to  diagnose the associated dynamics, to assess the general  applicability of the Island Rule, and to perform a limited number  of qualitative case studies.  It is anticipated that the Island  Rule will provide a good approximation to the true transport under  a wide variety of conditions.",
