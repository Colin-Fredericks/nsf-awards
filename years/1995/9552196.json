Missing from this curriculum (and most  science curricula) is the opportunity for every undergraduate major  to experience the complete process of being a scientist. This  proposal requests equipment to make such immersion in the process  of science possible with the development of a Total Science  Experience laboratory in the final required Biology course for  majors; Ecology and Evolution. The Total Science Experience  laboratory is a fifteen week laboratory unit focused on response of  organisms to global and regional environmental change. In this  unit, students: (1) write a pre-proposal and grant proposal (in  response to a Request for Proposals), thereby learning (a) how to  conduct a computer-assisted literature review, (b) how to formulate  hypotheses and objectives, (c) how to design a meaningful  experiment to test these hypotheses, and (d) how to formulate a  convincing project plan, (2) write proposal reviews of other  students' proposals and receive mock panel reviews of grant  proposals, with 'funding' of some projects and others being  declined (with invited resubmission), (3) execute their  experiments, with full responsibility for carrying each experiment  through to completion, (4) analyze experimental data, with training  on use of advanced s tatistical software, (S) present results in a  special student symposium (posters and oral presentations)  including training on advanced graphics software, and (6) submit a  full-length manuscript to a 'journal,' followed by editorial review  and resubmission. A trial of this laboratory format in Spring  semester, 1993 was extremely encouraging, as students experienced  both the excitement and frustrations of performing original  research. Obstacles to implementing this laboratory for the entire  class include insufficient computational power for the statistics  and graphics, and lack of controlled environment conditions to  offer students for their experiments. This project will remove  these obstacles and allow full implementation of the Total Science  Experience laboratory.",
