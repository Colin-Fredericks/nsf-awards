Travel expenses  could deterrent for graduate students planning to attend this  conference, in particular travel cost to Bozeman, Montana.    NAPS is an annual conference, sponsored by the Institute of  Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the university on  the North American Continent.  At this conference, university  professors and students are encouraged to present the results of  their research among colleagues at a very early stage in their  work.    NAPS participants are from the electrical engineering departments  of major universities in the country with research interests in  different areas of power engineering, some from universities  abroad, and some from industry.  NAPS authors are required to  attend the conference and present their papers.    This proposal discusses the justification for travel support,  requested from the National Science Foundation, for student  authors attending the symposium.  It also discusses coverage and  criteria for selection of student authors, activities planned for  the symposium, and the impact of the proposed travel grant.  ***",
