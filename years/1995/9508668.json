 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert T. Paine, Chemistry Department, University of New Mexico, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division for the study of phosphorus-boron cage   molecules and closely related species in which a phosphorus or boron atom   is substituted by another main group element. The basic objective of the   project is  to determine if new polycyclic boron-phosphorus cage   compounds can be formed from cyclic and acyclic phosphinoborane molecules   by sequential addition and elimination chemistry. As a portion of the   investigation, polycyclic B-P cage molecules which contain a heteroatom    will be prepared and the extent to which the size and  composition of the   cage can be tailored will be assessed. Finally, these species will be   utilized as precursors to electronic material including quantum confined   semiconductors.  While boron phosphide (BP) is a semiconductor with potentially valuable   electronic properties, it is currently only available as  an impure   material, which displays low electron mobility and which is hard to   process. These features have retarded commercial  development of BP. In   this project molecular cage molecules, which are composed of a three   dimensional B-P framework, will be prepared. These compounds, together   with closely related molecules that incorporate small amounts of yet a   third element into the cage, will be examined as precursors from which BP   can be made more easily and cleanly. As small fragments of BP will be    preformed in the core of the molecules, precise control of the size of   the resulting BP may be possible, leading to the possibility of obtaining   very small particles of BP for use as `quantum-confined semiconductors.`",
