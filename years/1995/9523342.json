 "awd_abstract_narration": "Karpur  9523342  Ultrasonic techniques have been  found to be very effective in  detecting small defects in  comparatively small samples.  However, in big civil  infrastructure type specimens such  as bridges, columns, poles and  pipelines use of ultrasonic  techniques has been limited because  of high absorption and scattering  of body waves (longitudinal and  shear waves which are  used in  ultrasonic experiments) in such big  objects.  In this project  unconventional Lamb waves at very  low frequencies (30 kHz - 200 kHz)  will be used to detect internal  defects in civil infrastructures.  Initial investigations have shown  that for detecting weak bonds and  partially damaged internal  interfaces, Lamb waves are much  more efficient than body waves.  However, Lamb wave sensors have not  been developed yet to its full  potential because of the lack of  expertise in this field in sensor  industries.  In this research the  theory necessary to develop  efficient Lamb wave or guided wave  sensors will be developed first.  Then the new sensor will be  fabricated with the help of  transducer manufacturing  industries.  These sensors will be  tested at the Wright-Patterson  Material Laboratory and will be  used to detect internal damages in  concrete and metal slabs and  pipeline type civil  infrastructures.    Two companion projects are  supported to carry out the above  described research:  University of  Arizona which will develop the  basic lamb wave theory and conduct  initial sensor design and testing,  and University of Dayton/Wright-  Patterson Laboratory which will  test the fabricated sensors and  evaluate the results.  ***",
