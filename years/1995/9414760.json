 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a study of the formation of auroral arcs  caused by the large scale dynamics of ions and electrons in the  magnetotail.  The first step is to construct ion distribution  functions moments (density, temperature, pressure, etc.) in a  three-dimensional large scale magnetospheric model.  This will be  done using the technique of large scale kinetics, whereby thousands  of ion trajectories are launched from a variety of sources into a  magnetic and electric field model of the magnetosphere.  The 3D  auroral precipitation profile (with local time dependence) will be  determined and compared with observations.  The second step will be  to perform a similar large scale kinetic study using electrons,  after which the ion and electron results will be compared and in  regions where there are charge imbalances, parallel electric fields  will be imposed.  The precipitated electron flux will then be  calculated and theoretical auroral images will be produced.  The  third step is to introduce time dependence into the large scale  kinetic model.  This will be done by using different field model  \"snapshots\" which represent different states (i.e., growth phase,  recovery, etc.) of the magnetosphere and calculating the ion and  electron precipitation profiles. Once a general understanding using  these snapshots has been achieved, an attempt will be made to model  the growth phase by temporally evolving the quiet time field model  to a more disturbed time.  The last step is to bring all of these  results together to delineate the formation of auroral arcs.  The  physical mechanisms in the magnetotail that result in the large  longitudinal extent of auroral arcs will be identified and the  results will be compared to observations.",
