 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems addressed by the proposal are: the lack of  participation of students from under-represented groups in  mathematics; an unsatisfactory rate of attrition among all  students in precalculus and calculus; lack of student  understanding and retention of fundamental precalculus/calculus  concepts; reluctance of faculty to develop and initiate  alternatives to the lecture format of teaching; and lack of  effective communication between two and four-year institutions,  especially among the faculty on the various campuses. A coalition  of thirteen SUNY schools, composed of two and four year colleges,  has identified three broad objectives to address these problems:  1) to develop methods for attracting and retaining students from  under-represented groups in mathematics; 2) to integrate workshop  approaches into the teaching of precalculus and calculus to a  diverse student population and, 3) to put in place a structure  for continued faculty and curriculum development across the SUNY  system.    The coalition, with the help of consultants, will work  cooperatively in a faculty enhancement workshop to develop  methods, strategies, and materials that will be implemented in  Fall 1995 to begin addressing the above stated problems.  Specifically Treisman type student workshops, based on academic  excellence rather than remediation, will be planned to engage  students in problem solving and problem posing experiences in a  cooperative learning environment that makes significant use of  technology. The basic themes of the highly successful Treisman  workshops will be tailored to meet SUNY's unique needs. The  student workshops will provide peer interaction and a sense of  community that is invitational, one that welcomes our students,  especially those from under-represented groups, to mathematics  and its challenges.    The first year coalition members and their campuses are committed  to pilot programs in the Fall of 1995. The second year program is  aimed at getting pilot programs at fourteen  more campuses.  Eventually the coalition, with the help of the SUNY Central  Administration, will effect systemic change in the way  precalculus and calculus is taught.",
