 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMR-9505760, PI-Kelly:  This represents a new approach to the understanding of occluded cell chemistry in localized corrosion.  An advanced solution analysis technique, capillary electrophoresis, is employed that is capable of detecting nanogram quantities of a wide variety of ions in small solution volumes.  The combination of this high sensitivity and the ability to determine the ionic speciation (e.g., sulfur as sulfide versus thiosulfate) makes capillary electrophoresis a valuable tool in understanding solution chemistry and electrochemistry which have impact on corrosion resistance.  By using this technique to probe the progression of the solution chemistry within occluded cells, new insights into the fundamental processes controlling corrosion pit initiation and propagation are possible. Ion sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs), capable of measuring pH changes over a wide range, allow the spatiotemporal variations in pH inside occluded sites to be followed with sub-mm and sub-sec resolutions.  By combining these techniques, the local conditions inside occluded sites on stainless steels is measured in unprecedented detail.  The experimental work is coordinated with the development of an improved mathematical description of the development and maintenance of occluded site chemistry.  ***Such understanding will have a major impact on the development of strategies for the prevention and mitigation of pitting, crevice corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking.  This work has a wide variety of potential applications including aging aircraft and long-term storage of high-level nuclear waste.***",
