 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413239  Davis  This award renews support for a Research Training Group (RTG) at the University of Minnesota.  Participating faculty include members of the Departments of Geology, of Geography and of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior.  The RTG emphasizes training at the undergraduate and graduate student level with focus on understanding the relationship of past climate changes and various changes in the physical and biological landscape.  Research areas include studies of the effects of climate on the growth and diversity of vegetation, on marine organisms, and on lakes and other aspects of the physical landscape, using the geological record as an indicator.  Recent effects of human habitation (anthropogenic change) on climate and the landscape are also studied using techniques similar to those used to look at more ancient effects.  Funds provided by the award will be used to support training of graduate students through short (3 month) or medium term (1-2 year) fellowships, small research awards for costs of research or meeting attendance, and travelling awards that allow the trainees to attend short courses at other institutions or allow students from other institutions to come to the RTG to learn specialized techniques.  Training of undergraduates is supported both during the summer and academic years.  Since the analysis of the localization and distribution naturally occurring isotopes plays a key role in the RTG's research activities, an important aspect of the award has been partial support for purchase and operation of modern sampling and analytical instrumentation to be used by the trainees.  ***",
