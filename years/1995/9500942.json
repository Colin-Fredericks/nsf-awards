 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the use of advanced constraint-based techniques for the production of high  quality user interfaces.  Constraints as a general technique allow the declaration of a set of  relationships that are to hold between entities.  Constraint satisfaction systems are then used to  maintain those declared relationships automatically without explicit programming.  The use of  constraint techniques offers to dramatically simplify the task of user interface implementation and  hence make the creation of easy to use computer applications substantially easier.  This project will  employ propagation-based constraint techniques and seek to provide advances in several related areas.  Tools to make existing constraint techniques more practical will be produced and distributed to the  user interface community.  New applications of constraints to user interface tasks will be explored,  and new visual notations for constraints will be developed.  Finally, this project will develop new  concurrent algorithms for constraint satisfaction which will, for the first time, allow constraints to  be effectively employe d in multi-user interfaces distributed across networks.  Taken together, these  advances will serve to make a wide variety of high quality user interfaces easier to construct, and  hence will promote creation of dynamic computer applications that are significantly easier to use.",
