 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image and signal processing laboratory experiments support major  study courses of the upper-division undergraduate programs in  electrical engineering and computer engineering.   They offer  students powerful techniques and tools to apply, synthesize,  design, simulate, and implement state-of-the-art solutions to  modern engineering problems.   This project provides laboratory  equipment capable of supporting experiments in image processing.     The equipment also enhances educational capabilities in the area  of digital signal processing.   Such educational capabilities in  image and signal processing are critical to technical leadership  of U.S.  industry.  The new equipment establishes three PC-based  workstations to support eight programmed experiments based on  classical and modern approaches to image processing.   The  equipment also expands capabilities of design projects at the  senior level.",
