 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419927  Agee         This grant will address the dynamic and thermodynamic  properties and characteristics of convective marine boundary  layers, through both observational study of special field data and  theoretical model simulations.  These cloud-topped boundary layers  form in response to cold continental air masses that advect out  over relatively warmer water, resulting in convective mixing and  the formation of large polygonal arrays of mesoscale cellular  convection that reside within the first one of two kilometers of  the atmosphere.  This convective pattern may exist as two-  dimensional bands or streets, but often (downstream) resolves  itself into three dimensional cells.       During the past three decades a wealth of observational data  for atmospheric convection studies has been accumulated from  measurements by various means, including radar, aircraft, and  satellites in special field observation programs.  From the data,  statistical parameters were obtained describing the structure and  dynamics of the planetary boundary layers (PBL).  These parameters  are commonly computed in the form of temporal or spatial averages  from a few (often from one) records of limited length, while  theoretical studies operate with ensemble averages which assume  averaging over an infinite number of realizations of random  functions.  Ensemble averages can be approximated by the averages  taken over sufficiently large time or space segments only if the  underlying random function is stationary (homogeneous).  Current  meteorological studies often result in statistically unreliable  inference because of nonstationarity or inhomogeneity of data and  inadequate averaging distances.  For these reasons, under this  project, data sets collected during several field programs will be  revisited by employing a recently developed comprehensive  statistical method that provides estimates of both statistical  parameters and their statistical reliability.         Large eddy simulation (LES) modeling is anoth er powerful tool  that helps provide a theoretical understanding of the intricate  fluid mechanics of atmospheric convection.  Once again there is a  problem of obtaining statistically reliable results, which will be  addressed in this project by extending the above statistical method  from random processes to random fields, and by approximating  ensemble averages using Monte Carlo techniques.  New LES model  development of mesoscale convection in PBLs and proper statistical  analysis of the LES model data will also be performed.  The focus  will be on the physical properties of convective PBLs with ice  particles and snow precipitation.  Model results will be compared  with statistically reliable findings from field programs.",
