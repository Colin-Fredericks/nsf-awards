 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terman       The investigator studies large networks of relaxation-type  oscillators with coupling that mimics chemical synapses.  These  lead to large systems of differential equations that include  numerous physical parameters as well as multiple time scales.  The  models typically display an incredibly rich structure of dynamic  behavior; this depends in a highly nontrivial way on the various  parameters.  The investigator systematically studies what sorts of  collective behavior are possible in a given network, determines  the mathematical mechanisms responsible for this rich oscillatory  behavior, classifies the sorts of bifurcations that can take place  as parameters in the models are varied, and determines the  physical consequences of the underlying mathematical structures.       The types of networks considered in this project arise in  numerous applications.  These include several areas of the nervous  system, respiration, movement, secretion, and models for scene  segmentation.  The project examines models for bursting  oscillations in pancreatic beta cells.  These cells are responsible  for the secretion of insulin.  It also analyzes models for  oscillations in various parts of the nervous system, including the  hippocampus and the thalamus.  The investigator also continues a  study of scene segmentation and other aspects of visual  processing.  This work contributes to fundamental understanding of  pancreatic functions and a variety of neurophysiological  questions.",
