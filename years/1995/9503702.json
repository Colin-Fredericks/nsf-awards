 "awd_abstract_narration": "In their previous work, the proposers have used probabilistic  methods to establish an optimal extension of Hormander's theorem  for second order differential operators. Their extension asserts  hypoellipticity under hypotheses that allow the usual Lie algebra  condition to fail at an exponential rate on a collection of  hypersurfaces. The proposers use these techniques to investigate  a series of further problems in the areas of partial and  stochastic differential equations. In particular, they study the  Dirichlet problem for exponentially degenerate operators on  smooth domains in Euclidean space. They also investigate the  existence of smooth densities for a large class of highly  degenerate stochastic functional equations.     The research  deals with two important problem areas that arise in physics and  engineering. The first area concerns an important class of  mathematical models, called partial differential equations, that  play a fundamental role in the study of heat conduction, electric  potential and fluid flow.  The second area of investigation is  devoted to a class of models that are used in physics,  engineering and biology in order to analyze dynamical systems  whose evolution is influenced by random fluctuations and past  history. These models are very important in a variety of diverse  areas ranging from signal processing, stock market fluctuations,  economic and labor models, aircraft dynamics, materials with  memory and population dynamics.  The investigators use techniques  from the calculus of probability in order to develop a deeper  understanding of the above-mentioned models.",
