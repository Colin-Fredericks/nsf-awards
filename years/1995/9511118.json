 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together three distinct lines of research on  variation in speech production. The first line of research concerns  how consonants are articulated when they are at the beginning of a  word or syllable, vs. at the end of a word or syllable. Initial  consonants have more articulatory contact and in general more  extreme articulations than do final consonants. The second line of  research concerns how consonants are articulated in different  positions in a phrase or utterance. Consonants at the beginning of  a phrase or utterance have more articulatory contact and in general  more extreme articulations than do consonants that come later in a  phrase or utterance. The third line of research concerns  large-scale trends in consonant and vowel articulation over whole  utterances. It has been suggested that less articulatory effort is  expended on consonants and vowels that come later in an utterance.  The present project tests a hypothesis that unifies these lines of  research: that articulations are more extreme at the beginning of  units larger than a segment (syllable, word, phrases, utterance).  This hypothesis will be tested in four languages: English, French,  Korean, and Taiwanese. A series of experiments is proposed to  compare articulations in different positions in different sized  units. The primary dependent variable is tongue-palate contact as  measured by electropalatography. Other measures include Voice Onset  Time, nasal airflow and vocal cord contact as measured by  electroglottography. Variation in articulation will also be  compared to general trends in subglottal pressure and fundamental  frequency.  The significance of this project will be to develop something  that has long been known in general but never worked out in any  specific way: that the articulations of individual consonants and  vowels depend on their prosodic positions. The results of the  project will be relevant to researchers in linguistic phonetics,  speech production, and speech technology.",
