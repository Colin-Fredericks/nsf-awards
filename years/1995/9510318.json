A number of hypotheses have successfully explained aspects of the origin and maintenance of biodiversity including, the niche diversification, compensatory mortality, equal chance, and intermediate disturbance hypotheses.  This Career Advancement Award research project explores the role of disturbance, in particular, intermediate levels of biodiversity, in maintaining diversity in dynamic landscapes within the context of work being done at the Santa Fe Institute.   Research at this Institute seeks a common theoretical framework for complex adaptive systems and aims to find shared features of such systems that explain their origin and functioning in a variety of fields, from cell biology and evolution to economics and language.  The objective of this study is to explore several similarities between properties found in these systems and those found in complex disturbed ecosystems.  The work involves a broad review of the literature and formalization of  several aspects of disturbed forest communities in order to test hypotheses about the role of disturbance in generating and maintaining diversity.  There are unresolved theoretical questions about the assemblage of species, as well as, the rules that govern diversity in natural communities.  General rules and insights that emerge from this study of complex systems may offer a fresh theoretical approach to the study of ecological diversity.",
