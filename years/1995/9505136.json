 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505136  Ontaneda       A basic problem in Geometry and Topology is to study the  relation between curvature (local information about a space) and  topology (global information about a space).  The investigator  studies a particular case of curvature: spaces of non-positive  curvature, in the riemannian case and in the PL (piecewise linear)  case. He also studies some problems concerning riemannian and PL  rigidity (in the non-positively curved case); the relation between  riemannian and PL non-positively curved geometry; and how the  topology could determine the curvature: which spaces admit a  non-positively curved geometry.       A space with non-positively curved geometry is a space on  which, essentially, an object, as it moves away from an observer,  seems to decrease in size at a rate equal to or faster than the  rate in the \"real world\" (euclidean geometry).  In general,  geometry determines some properties about the (global) shape of the  space.  For instance, if a space has a non-positively curved  geometry, after \"unwrapping\" the space we obtain another space  that, unlike a doughnut, can be shrunk within itself to a single  point (Cartan-Hadamard theorem).  This research project is oriented  towards studying such relations on spaces with non-positive  geometry: how the geometry (local data) determines the global shape  (topology) and also how topology could determine the geometry.   Although the relevance of this to the \"real world\" is not obvious  if one considers only the apparently Euclidean environs of the  earth, questions of cosmology -- the nature of the universe as a  whole and not merely our small corner of it -- are intimately  related to these mathematical questions.  ***",
