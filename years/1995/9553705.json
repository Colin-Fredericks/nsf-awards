Brown                               DUE 9553705  Rose-Hulman Inst of Tech                    FY1995 $    Terre Haute, IN  47803                      Advanced Technological Education                                                  Title: Problem-Based Learning:  A Key to Enhanced Performance in    Advanced Technological Education           Education in the United States is at a pivotal juncture.  U.S.  citizens must compete in a demanding global society, but our  educational systems are struggling with outdated approaches and  stagnant budgets.  The \"knowledge explosion\" of the past 20 to 30  years has provided advanced technological education with the  singularly difficult challenge.  The traditional answer to this  \"knowledge explosion\" has been to pack more \"essential facts\" into  the curricula Careful consideration of this issue suggests that an  information-laden society requires resourceful skills, insights,  and abilities; hence, educational innovation must focus less on  facts and more on problem solving and inquiry-based learning.  The  Wabash Valley Educational Alliance seeks support for the  implementation of an important educational vision and the  establishment of a permanent cooperative effort within the Wabash  Valley (west central Indiana).  This project addresses  instructional methods that will impact the education of students of  technology, science, mathematics, and engineering in two year,  associate degree granting institutions.  It will affect educational  approaches at all levels of technology; produce new curricula  materials including problems and examples; provide a \"living\" video  series of applications; and create a national, refereed, electronic  database for sharing problem-based materials and experiences.   Problem-based instruction concentrates learning around \"real-world\"  problems similar to those encountered by practitioners in the  field.  In problem-based learning the teacher' s role changes quite  dramatically from that in a traditional learning s ituation.  The  teacher must guide the students in the problem-solving process,  directing them through questioning techniques.  Problem-based  learning can help students become critical thinkers and problem  solvers.  There is significant potential for its further refinement  and widespread application to advanced technological education.   This potential, if fully developed, can place technological  education in a leadership role and heighten it's visibility among  the professions.",
