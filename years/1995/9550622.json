 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County CPMSA Project addresses its  purpose: to develop, provide and make systemic a high quality  math/science educational program which expands access,  participation and achievement of K-12 minority students who are  under-represented in science, engineering and math pipeline.   Project goals are: to significantly increase K-12 student  participation in high interest mathematics and science activities;  to significantly  increase minority K-12 student participation in  gatekeeper courses for math, science, engineering and technology  college preparation; to significantly increase minority college  student majors in SMET fields; and to put in place a systemic  reform of curriculum, instruction, and community involvement which  facilitates ongoing realization of the first three goals.  Project  objectives are: (a) to provide a broad scope of programs which  provide weekly and summer opportunities for all minority students  and parents to participate in science and mathematics activities in  their neighborhoods, in their schools and at project collaborators'  facilities; (b) to strengthen the capacity of the teachers in the  delivery system to develop and deliver the high interest and  motivational activities; (c) to motivate minority students and  their parents/guardians with opportunities to participate in high  interest activities; (d) to mentor the minority students with  university and industry faculty entering the gatekeeper courses, to  encourage their successful participation in the gatekeeper courses  and continuation with those courses; (e) to evaluate the students  and monitor their progress through the project each year; (f) to  demonstrate the ability to replicate and continue the project's  strategies and interventions which correlate significantly with  reaching project goals--statewide, regionally, and nationally.    Project partners collaborating with Project JUST are:  Winston-  Salem State University; Wake Forest University; SciWorks (The  Science Cen ter and Environmental Park of Forsyth County); The Urban  League; and the YMCA.  Each collaborating partner will provide  direct services to students of the targeted project population:  approximately 14,000 K-12 African-American students living in the  city's designated Enterprise Community, a 15 square mile section  from which most elementary school student are bussed to achieve  racial integration in 32 schools.  Project activities will be  provided: in neighborhoods, through partnering with the housing  authority and churches; at all K-12; at Winston-Salem State  University; at Wake Forest University; and at SciWorks.  Project  activities will involve mentors, through partnering with  professional SMET associations and with local businesses (e.g., RJR  Tobacco).  Project activities will include students' family  involvement.  School system curriculum/instructional reform of K-12  science and math will be achieved through teacher driven staff  development, provided by strong science/math teacher and designed  to be systemically accessible through site-based expectations and  scheduling.  ***",
