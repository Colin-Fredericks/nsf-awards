 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to explain some of the observed  properties of the auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), and to  understand some of the processes leading to the transverse  acceleration of ionospheric ions (TAI) that eventually populate the  Earth's magnetosphere and result in a strong ionosphere-  magnetosphere coupling.  The analytical and computational  techniques that will be used to attain the goals of this proposal  include the space-time evolution of instabilities in plasmas, and  wave induced chaos in ion dynamics including the novel concept of  web stochasticity.  AKR has been a source of fascination and extensive study,  observationally and theoretically, for nearly twenty years.  The  data accumulated during this period has provided information about  the AKR source regions, the modes and polarizations of the waves,  and the particle distributions that exist in and around the source  regions.  It is generally agreed upon that, since the radiated  power in AKR is orders of magnitude above thermal emissions, the  source of AKR is plasma instabilities.  Theories based upon the  electroncyclotron maser instabilities (ECMI), generated by loss-  cone electron distributions, have been successful in explaining  some of the observed properties of AKR.  Thus, ECMI are generally  believed to be the source of AKR.  However, the traditional  analyses of ECMI have failed to provide a clear explanation of some  of the important features of AKR that are consistent with  observations.  The proposed work intends to understand and explain  the specific phenomena that have not yet been understood  theoretically.  A signature of the strong ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling is a  series of observations, reported over the past fifteen years, which  show that a significant population of the ions in the  magnetospheric plasma are of ionospheric origin.  In the  ionosphere, the ions are observed to be accelerated in a direction  transverse to the geomagnetic field.  The interaction between ions   and plasma waves, that seem to be present in regions where TAI  occurs, is believed to play an important role in the TAI.  The  proposed research is to use concepts of nonlinear dynamics and web  stochasticity to understand the acceleration of ions by lower-  hybrid wave packets; the observed tail heating of O+ and bulk  heating of H+; the ion distribution functions observed during TAI.",
