 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a set of tools that will  automatically  map data and computation for HPF programs, thereby reducing the  programming time and effort required for producing efficient and  portable  parallel programs. The system of tools will use the  alignment-distribution  graph as the internal representation of  Fortran 90 (and HPF) programs and use  graph-theoretic, linear-  algebraic and discrete optimization techniques to  determine  alignment and distribution of arrays that minimize program  completion time.  The system will not be limited to the `owner-  computes` rule  often employed by HPF compilers, but will choose  the computation rules that  minimize running time of the program.  The system will also provide a back-end  for generating code for  message passing systems, and a graphical user interface  for  debugging and visual feedback. The project will develop  algorithms for  inter-procedural layout analysis, and heuristics  for reducing the complexity of  analysis algorithms.    The educational component of this project will develop  undergraduate courses with laboratory emphasizing experiment  design,  measurement and use of statistical analysis.",
