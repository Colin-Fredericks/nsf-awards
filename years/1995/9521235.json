 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  This study compares the formation and changes in roles and activities of ethnic organizations serving Jews and Italians in Argentina and Venezuela.  It draws on theories of immigrant and ethnic integration and tests their applicability to Latin America.  Data are based on existing records from 1940 to the 1990s obtained from newspapers, ethnic organizations, and ethnic schools.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of how immigrant ethnic groups form communities that foster (or impede) their integration into host societies.  It will also add generally to understanding Latin American societies and how they compare to the United States.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
