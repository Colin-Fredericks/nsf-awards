 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will substantially increase the enrollment,  achievement and preparation of African American students in the  Omaha Public Schools for university studies in mathematics and   science.  Teachers will learn to use appropriate adaptive  instruction to meet the needs and interests of their students.   High standards of achievement consistent with state and national  frameworks will be used to judge student success on standardized  and performance based assessments.  The project has been planned  and will be implemented with the guidance of a representative  Advisory Council.  School staff will use a Total Quality Management  approach to analyze the documented results of their work, revise  strategies, and implement them.  Staff will participate in a  professional development curriculum designed to change instruction  and enrollment in advanced science and mathematics.  Articulation  among schools will be improved by increasing personalized  information about the success and needs of African American  students.  Support for student interest and motivation will be  addressed by enrichment and community support activities.  Students  will have a number of enrichment opportunities including summer  camps that will demonstrate use of science and mathematics in  ecology, agriculture, health services, finance, engineering and  others.  Students will master science and mathematics curriculum  with school and community based tutoring when necessary.  The  project will serve as a collaboration point for a number of  existing programs in the community and school system, clarifying  objectives and coordinating services.  The project will be  carefully evaluated and judged and will be implemented to assure  continuation after NSF funding is ended.  Records and materials  will be organized so the project can be described for replication.  ***",
