 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419353  Ilic       This project uses an already conceived structure-based  modeling approach which does not require the assumption on weak  interconnections, and it also naturally lends itself to inclusion  of devices which control the line flows directly.  The salient  features of this approach which allow for such significant  generalization of the present approaches are briefly summarized  in this Proposal, and are further supported by several  publications.       Conceptually, the proposed approach allows for extracting  minimum order models directly relevant for various levels of a  very large scale dynamical system, much in the spirit of the  Coordination Theory for multivariable systems.  The modeling and  control concepts developed recently by the PI and her team offer  simple ways of supporting this mainly qualitative theory in terms  of explicit, low order models directly relevant for specific  levels of a complex system.       Using vertical separation principle under the assumption of  stable and fast dynamics at the lowest level, relatively low-  order-discrete-time models are extracted at both secondary  (subsystem) and tertiary (interconnected) system levels.  A  direct mapping between these models and the physical processes  captured are illustrated in this Proposal as applied to the real  power generation control problem for frequency regulation in a  multi-utility environment.       The main objective of this project is to apply this approach  towards further development of a systematic framework for next  generation Load Frequency Control (LRC) / Automatic Generation  Control (AGC) of the electric power systems.  Particular emphasis  is on accommodating the open access operating mode evolving among  the utilities in the United States.  ***",
