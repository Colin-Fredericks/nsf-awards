 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521687  DUSZYNSKI   Domestic and zoo animals as well as wild animal populations, including various invertebrates, can be devastated by the disease known as coccidiosis, which is caused by a diversity of intracellular intestinal parasites known collectively as the Coccidia (Protista: Apicomplexa: Eimeriorina).  The taxonomy of this economically important group is complicated and in disarray because of  complex life cycles which for many species have not even associated the different life stages.  Drs. Duszynski and Upton are recognized systematic authorities for these parasites.  They will produce a monographic treating the world fauna of coccidians that develops a standard of description and type designation and clarifies nomenclatural problems.  Results of their work will be made available electronically as well as in published form.  And they will train both graduate and undergraduate students to become badly needed systematic researchers with these poorly known organisms.   This award will contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity and relationships of these single celled, parasitic organisms and support the graduate education and training young systematists capable of further research with these organisms.  The project has potential to provide information relevant for management and control of these serious disease causing organisms as well as contributing knowledge of relationships of lineages important for basic research in studies of host coevolution, biogeography, ecology, etc..",
