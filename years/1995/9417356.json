 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417356  Eriksson    This award supports a two-year cooperative research project between  Dr. Karl-Erik Eriksson of the University of Georgia and Dr. Masahiro  Samejima of the University of Tokyo. The objective of this  cooperative research project is to construct a new enzymatic system  for cellulose surface analysis.  The investigators intend to exploit two  characteristics for cellulose surface analysis: high specificity for  substrate and high catalytic activity.  It will also be necessary to  further characterize specific antibodies for immunolocalization studies  as well as to examine the practical application of  cellobiose  dehydrogenases (CDH) to celluloses from a variety of industrial  processes.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working on the biochemical properties of wood.   Dr. Eriksson s  group has extensive knowledge and experience in biochemistry of  cellulolytic enzymes including CDH.  The team led by Dr. Samejima  has worked on enzymatic surface analysis of cellulose and pulp.  By  combining these expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper  understanding and more rapid progress than can either group alone.   Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
