 "awd_abstract_narration": "Noll  9418197  This project is an investigation of the physiology of elemental  sulfur reduction to sulfide by the hyperthromophilic bacterium  Thermotoga neapolitana.  Sulfur reduction (sulfidogenesis) is a  common property of hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea, but the  mechanisms by which it occurs may differ among these organisms.   Since sulfidogenesis is found in organisms similar to the common  ancestors of two phylogenetic domains, it may have been present in  the ancestors of all lining organisms and, thus, represents an  early means to enhance catabolism using an inorganic electron  acceptor.  Our goals in this project are to determine how  sulfidogenesis contributes to bioenergetics and to elucidate the  metabolic pathways that lead to sulfide production.  We intend to  achieve these goals by pursuing three objectives.  (1) We will  purify and characterize an NADH:polysulfide oxidoreductase, one of  two known sulfur reductases in T. neapolitiana.  We will clone its  gene to study its regulation and relationship to adjacent genes.  (2) We will isolate mutants defective in key enzymatic activities  to test hypotheses derived from biochemical studies and look for  evidence of alternative bioenergetics pathways.  (3) We will  finally develop a cloning vector for T. neapolitiana for the long  range goals of introducing mutations via gene replacement and  examining catabolic regulation.  %%%  This project is a study of how solid elemental sulfur is converted  to hydrogen sulfide gas by the bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana, an  organism that grows at very high temperatures (a  hyperthermophilic).  Sulfide formation is a common property of  hyperthermophilic organisms, but the mechanism by which it occurs  is unknown for many of them.  This process has evolutionary,  ecological, and economic importance.  Since the process is found in  organisms thought to be like some of the fist organisms to appear  on Earth, it may represent an early metabolic process.  The sulfur  cycle is central to t he biology of geothermal ecosystems, so these  hyperthermophiles are important in these environments.  The  biological removal of sulfurous compounds from coals and ores has  traditionally been mediated by aerobes.  Hyperthermophilic  anaerobes or their enzymes may provide an alternative means to  solubilize bound sulfur for measurement or removal.  Our goals in  this project are to determine how sulfide formation contributes to  bioenergetics and to elucidate the metabolic pathways that lead to  sulfide production. We intend to achieve these goals by studying  the enzymes that mediate this process, isolating the genes that  encode these enzymes, and developing genetic tools that will allow  future investigations of these enzymes, and developing genetic  tools that will allow future investigations of these and other  questions about the metabolism of this fascinating organism.  ***",
