 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in economics is how markets coordinate the  behavior of anonymous decision makers in a many person  decentralized economy.  Economic theory has progressed using the  equilibrium method.  For abstract games, an equilibrium is  defined as an assignment to each player of a strategy that is  best for him when the others use the strategies assigned to them.   However, the relevance of this abstract mutual consistency  requirement for economic modeling is an open question.  This  project will focus on two related problems.  First, the mutual  consistency requirement of an equilibrium assignment is not an  implication of individual rationality, because individual  rationality does not restrict the subjective beliefs a player may  hold.  Rather, individual rationality means internal consistency  and internally consistent beliefs and actions of different  players may not be mutually consistent.  Second there is often  more than one equilibrium assignment.  Consequently,  understanding the origin of mutually consistent behavior is an  essential complement to the theory of equilibrium points.  This  project will utilize experimental methods in order to determine  how people actually use the strategic details of their  environment.  The ultimate goal is to develop an empirical  foundation for a convincing explanation of the origin of mutually  consistent behavior in observable games, that is, how people  learn equilibrium behavior.",
