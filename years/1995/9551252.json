Hamline University  will acquire lasers, light detecting components, a monochromator,  signal processing equipment, and data acquisition equipment.   Laboratory experiments will be introduced for the study of  laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy using single photon  absorption and two photon absorption.  Experiments involving  excited states of Ru(II) coordination complexes will be introduced  to demonstrate methods for handling and evaluating kinetic events  in the nano to millisecond time range.  All experiments have an  open-ended quality to them which allows students to explore other  aspects of laser spectroscopy.  Students in our general chemistry  course will also be exposed to this technology through  demonstrations/seminars presented by their upper-division peers.   These seminars will enable a safe interesting preview of some  exciting concepts in chemistry.  The requested equipment will also  be used in undergraduate research projects such as in a comparison  of the electron transfer ability of Os(II) complexes to that of the  analogous Ru(II) complexes.",
