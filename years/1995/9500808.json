 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500808  Blackmore        The objectives of the project are: 1) to further develop the  sweep   differential equation (SDE) approach so as to enhance its  applicability to the   analysis and representation of swept volumes; and 2) to translate  the   improvements of the SDE method into algorithms and software tools  for   solving motion verification and planning problems in automated   manufacturing. In the SDE method, the surface of the region  traversed by an   object moving through space (the swept volume of the object) is   characterized in terms of a differential equation (the SDE). A  major goal of   the project is to obtain a generalization of the SDE -  incorporating the   geometry of the object - that has the property that its  trajectories foliate   most of the boundary of the swept volume. This leads to a  reduction of one   dimension in the set that generates the swept volume, and it  promises to   yield an order of magnitude decrease in the computational  complexity of   algorithms based on this new method. Algorithms based on this new  method   shall be developed, and the unique features of the approach shall  be   exploited to obtain  approximate numerical and graphical  representations of   swept volumes. In particular, the foliation of the boundary  surface shall be   incorporated into new interpolation procedures, and a natural  functional   criterion for trimming (or excluding) points not belonging to the  swept   volume boundary shall be employed. The algorithms shall be used  to   develop computer programs for automatic verification and  generation of   numerically  controlled (NC) machining programs and robot motion   planning problems.    The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between  an applied   mathematician and a mechanical engineer aimed at developing new  theory   that is to be implemented for practical manufacturing related  problems,   thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in advanced manufacturing.  A   primary objective is to develop new tech niques that enable one to    characterize swept volumes essentially by a curve on the boundary  surface   of an object in its initial position - with the swept volume  being generated   by solutions of a differential equation. This innovation is to be  used to   develop accurate computer-aided methods for obtaining numerical  and   graphical representations of configurations swept out by objects  moving   through space. The algorithms based upon this theoretical   framework have   the potential to reduce the computations of existing algorithms  by at least an   order of magnitude. As swept volume plays an important role in  such   diverse areas of automated manufacturing as NC machining, robot  motion   planning and computer-aided design, the applications of the  research in this   project should have a significant impact on modern manufacturing  theory   and practice.",
