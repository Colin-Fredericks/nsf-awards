He is continuing his work on  topological Andre-Quillen homology and its relation to unstable  homotopy theory.  He is also investigating the properties of a  construction on A-infinity ring spectra that is analogous to the  center of a ring in algebra; this seems likely to have applications  to a question posed by Mahowald, Ravenel and Shick in their work on  the telescope conjecture.  He intends to do some calculations with  cyclotomic homology (a construction that was defined by Bokstedt,  Goodwillie, Hsiang and Madsen, which has important applications in  algebraic K-theory).  He is investigating the question of whether  the wedge of the even suspensions of a complex-oriented E-infinity  ring is again an E-infinity ring, and some consequences that this  property would have.  He intends to work on several problems which  relate homotopy theory to C*-algebras.  He is investigating some  old questions posed by Adams-Wilkerson and Atiyah involving the  relationship between Adams operations and Steenrod operations in  the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.  He is seeking a better  understanding of the Morava K-theory of extended powers.       Topology is the study of certain properties that shapes can  have that do not depend on detailed measurement (the well-known  example is that a doughnut and a coffee cup are the same to a  topologist, because one can be stretched to look exactly like the  other).  Algebraic topology is a method for describing shapes by  means of certain kinds of calculation.  For example, the surfaces  of the doughnut and the coffee cup could be divided into  non-overlapping triangles, and one could then calculate the number  of triangles plus the number of vertices minus the number of edges;  the result would be the same in both cases, and this fact shows (by  means of a nontrivial theorem) that one shape can be stretched into  the other.  In order to get more info rmation from these  calculations, one incorporates them into the framework of abstract  algebra by relating them to groups or rings.  One of the most  interesting trends in the subject in the last decade has been to  bring in abstract algebra at an earlier stage of the process by  relating the shapes themselves to groups or rings; that is what the  phrase \"A-infinity ring spectrum\" refers to.  The main purpose of  this project is to continue the development of this idea.  ***",
