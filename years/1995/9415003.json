 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415003  Frenzen  This research will evaluate changes in the equation for turbulent  kinetic energy (TKE) in the surface layer as a function of  roughness Reynolds number as well as stability by conducting and  add-on experiment over an extensive forest in north central  Saskatchewan.  A 26-m tower temporarily installed in this location  for the BOREAS experiment offers a timely opportunity to determine  weather findings of earlier TKE studies conducted over selected  \"ideal\" field sites also apply over more realistic terrain.   Questions raised by recent experiments over two relatively smooth  sites (zo < 5 cm) will be investigated over the much rougher forest  canopy (zo> 50 cm) using proven procedures and equipment  development for the earlier work.  These questions include:  a) How  much does the difference between rates of turbulent energy  production and dissipation (the dissipation deficit) changes with  increasing roughness Reynolds number?  b) How do the higher-order,  turbulence and pressure transport terms adjust to these changes in  the energy balance over rough surfaces?  and c) Does the von Karman  constant continue to decrease with roughness Reynolds number to the  theoretical limit of 0.37?  Results obtained will be used to  develop generalized terms for applying the TKE equation to surface  layer flows over real terrain, and will be used to determine the  accuracy of various scaling hypotheses proposed for flow over  forests.",
