This  anisotropy  influences metallic, superconducting, magnetic, and insulating  states  in these materials.  The main objectives of the proposed work are:  to  compare  experimentally and computationally the effects of  electronic  anisotropy;  to manipulate the degree of anisotropy by physical  means  to  produce  new  electronic states; to understand  more  clearly  how  superconductivity  arises  in  low-dimensional  systems;  to   explore  quantum  limit effects in anisotropic materials; to extend traditional  Fermi surface studies into new regimes of pulsed magnetic fields above  30  T; and to consider speculative new methods of physical measurement  in intense magnetic fields and very high pressures in these materials.  %%%  The  area of molecular crystals is an emerging one in the science  and  technology  of  electronic (electrically conducting) materials.   They  link  the realms of semiconductors, metals, and biological structures.  Unlike traditional solids such as silicon or copper which are composed  of  atoms  arranged in simple three-dimensional ordered  arrays,  with  little  or  no distinction between directions, molecular crystals  are  composed  of  large  (usually organic) molecules  arranged  in  either  chains  or  layers.   Hence, the electronic  properties  of  molecular  crystals  can be very different (anisotropic) in the three  directions  within  the  solid.   This  anisotropy affects their  superconducting,  magnetic, and semiconducting properties.  The purpose of the  proposed  research is to investigate experimentally and computationally the role  of  anisotropy in crystalline molecular solids, including the  use  of  electronic,  magnetic,  pressure, and optical probes  to  measure  and  manipulate  their  physical  properties..   An  understanding  of  the  mechanisms by which anisotropy influences these properties  wi ll  lead  to  the  design  and synthesis of new materials in this  class  having  particularly desirable physical properties.  ***",
