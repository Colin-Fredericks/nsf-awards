 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robotic devices move autonomously, apply forces to objects in their  environment, react to forces applied to them to achieve desired  velocities, positions or impedances.  Conventional robots use  motors (active power transduction devices) to achieve these ends.   This research examines a passive alternative to provide forces to  resist motion initiated by a human or other active agent for the  purpose of haptic display of remote or virtual environments or for  guidance of the agent's motion.  Ultimate applications are for  virtual reality displays, for teleoperation, for surgical  assistance, for exercise and for rehabilitation.  The advantages of  a passive approach include the elimination of inherent dangers of  an active device and the reduction of cost and complexity when a  power supply must be provided.  This research will utilize a  recently constructed prototype passive arm known as PTER (Passive  Trajectory Enhancing Robot) as a test case.  PTER has two degrees  of freedom, coupled via electromagnetic brakes so that  energy can  be diverted in a controlled manner from one axis to the other.  The  research will explore the theoretical and practical aspects of the  control algorithms to accomplish this coupling for purposes of  haptic display such as PTER.  The limitations of the passive  actuators provide the uniqueness and challenge of the control. The  control algorithm will be tested to determine effectiveness of the  controlled passive device against two alternatives:  (1) a direct  physical display (not programmable) and (2) an electrically powered  virtual display on an available kinematically identical robot.  The  measures of performance be both quantitative and subjective.   The  accuracy of the trajectory followed and the accuracy of  representation of an environment's impedance (force-velocity  relationship) can be quantitatively evaluated.  Human operators  will be employed to provide a more subjective evaluation on the  effectiveness of the passive display.  Example task s will be to  follow a virtual maze as guided by the feel imparted by the device.",
