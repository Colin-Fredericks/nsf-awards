The Great Hanshin,  i.e. Kobe earthquake struck the  area surrounding the city of Kobe  Japan on 17 January 1995.  The  epicenter of this moment magnitude  6.9 event was about 20 km southwest  of downtown Kobe.  Roughly 40-km  strike-slip rupture extended  directly under the city.  The event  left more than 5000 people dead,  with tens of thousands of  structures destroyed by ground  shaking and subsequent fire.  Parallels have been drawn to  possible scenarios for urban  earthquakes in the United States.  The Great Hanshin earthquake  therefore offers an opportunity for  the United States to learn and  become better prepared for future  earthquakes.    A systematic exchange with Japanese  researchers, engineers, and  planners is desirable so that  counterparts in the United States  can best learn the lessons of this  earthquake as they  apply to the  United States.  This project is to  open that dialogue by conducting a  seminar in Japan and a follow-up  workshop in the United States.  These activities will include  presentations of findings related  to this earthquake, identification  of  research needs, and in-depth  discussions on how to take  advantage of the data made  available to the research community  in the United States.  The reports  will include a recommended research  agenda for such subjects as  structural design, repair/retrofit,  seismic reconstruction,  preparedness and emergency  responses, etc.  These  recommendations will form the basis  for future funding priorities for  cooperative research with Japan by  the National Science Foundation and  other funding agencies in the  United States.  ***",
