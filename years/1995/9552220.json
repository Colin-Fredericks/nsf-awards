 "awd_abstract_narration": "To meet the growing demand of industry and academia, the  university emphasizes automated data acquisition,  instrumentation, and process control.   In addition to supporting  the needs of Engineering Technology majors, the extended  interdisciplinary course offering in these areas provides  instructional and practical training to physical science majors  as well.   Major equipment includes four personal computers with  data acquisition and GPIB plug-in cards, as well as visual  programming software for analysis and data presentation.   These  four networked stations are being used to introduce automated  data acquisition, high-speed instrumentation employing the GPIB  bus, and process control.  The project enhances students'  theoretical and practical abilities in terms of how to sense  real-world quantities such as temperature, force, motion, sound,  light, etc., and also how to configure, use, interface, and  integrate such sensors to a personal computer (PC) based system.    This also provides students with the tools needed not only to  sense but also to control physical phenomena or devices.   The  new use of graphical programming language makes their task of  displaying the results, analyzing the data, and performing  mathematical and statistical calculations less tedious and  permits them to devote more time in learning about  instrumentation and control and less time in programming.   While  performing experiments, students see the necessity and usefulness  of the techniques of grounding, shielding, signal conditioning,  noise-filtering, hardware and software interfacing, etc., in a  unified manner.   The integration of theoretical and practical  aspects learned by the students in several courses prepares them  better to meet with the technological challenges of the industry.",
