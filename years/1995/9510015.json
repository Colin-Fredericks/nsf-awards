To achieve these goals, herbarium  sheets of species from 30 living plant communities across Africa  will be videotaped and leaf images will be analyzed using Optimas.   Information on leaf area, length, breadth, perimeter, and margin  (entire or not, presence or absence of compound teeth, presence or  absence of drip tip) will be recorded.  Monthly climate data  obtained  from published sources, the U.S. Data Center, and the  Ulited Nations Environmental Program Global Resource Information  Database (GRID) will be mapped as contours on a base map of Africa  using GSMAP and related utilities.  Climate data for each plant  site will be read from the map and interpolations will be checked  by consulting local station records where possible.  The leaf and  climate data will be analyzed by appropriate statistical methods  depending upon distributions and relationships among the variables.   For example, multivariate methods such as correspondence analysis  and canonical correspondence analysis, which are intended for  nonlinear data, may be appropriate.  The resulting statistical  relationships will be calibrated.  The calibration will be tested  for accuracy by applying it to modern sites not included in the  analysis.  If climatic parameters of modern assemblages are  estimated accurately, then the technique can be used to reconstruct  climate for Miocene leaf assemblages.    The middle to late Miocene is a significant time interval because  the human family originated in Africa during that time.  Further,  modern atmospheric circulation patterns, most importantly the Asian  monsoon, are thought to have originated in the Miocene (Quade et  al., 1989; Prell et al., 1992).  Monsoonal circulation is, in part,  responsible for the distribution of  modern plant communities,  including savannas and grasslands.  The origin of these biomes,  perhaps coincident with the origin of the monsoons and the origin  of hominids, remains a controversial subject (Retallack, 1992;  Cerling et al., 1991; Kingston et al, 1994; Wheeler, 1991; Lovejoy,  1981).  Similarly, hypotheses that explain disjunct distributions  of modern forest species in East and West Africa suggest  fragmentation of middle Miocene continuous forest as a causal  factor (Lovett, 1993).  The paleobotanical record for this time  period offers a direct test for these hypotheses.  In addition, the  fossil record of most equatorial plant species is poor.  The study  of paleobotanical sites offers an opportunity to make contributions  regarding phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history of  the living flora.",
