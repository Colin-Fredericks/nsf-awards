Larval Arizona tiger salamanders are unusual in  that they occur in nature as two distinct types: a 'typical'  morph and a 'cannibal' morph.  The cannibal morph is  produced only when larvae are crowded at high densities, and  this morph feeds primarily on other tiger salamanders.  When  housed with smaller larvae that differ in relatedness,  cannibals preferentially consume less related individuals,  both in the laboratory and in the field.  This  discrimination is most pronounced among larvae from families  that are especially likely to produce cannibal morphs.  This  research will test two non-exclusive evolutionary hypotheses  on why cannibals recognize their relatives.  First, by not  eating a relative, with whom the cannibal shares some genes  due to common descent, cannibals can indirectly increase  their own genetic representation or \"inclusive\" fitness in  the population.  Alternatively, cannibals may avoid eating  kin to lessen their chances of dying from disease.  In  nature, a deadly bacterium can infect these animals, and  cannibalism is an especially efficient way of acquiring the  disease. Moreover, this infectious agent may be highly  transmissible among close relatives, perhaps because kin  have similar immune systems.  This research will use field  observations and field and laboratory experiments to test  specific predictions made by each hypothesis. Tiger  salamanders are an ideal model system for separating the  direct and indirect inclusive fitness consequences of kin  discrimination.  This study thus promises to help resolve  why certain animals recognize kin, which is important to  current theories concerning the evolution of altruism.  The  research will also increase understanding of the role of  kinship in disease transmission.",
