 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stephen J. Klippenstein at the Department of Chemistry, Case   Western Reserve University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the development of   theoretical approaches and the application of these approaches to the   study of barrierless reactions. These reactions can be viewed as   unimolecular dissociation reactions for which there is no barrier to the   reverse recombination process. The research under this grant is focused   on three topics: (1) The description of the interaction energies between   the reacting fragments. (2) The determination of the density of states,   especially in the region of the transition state. And, (3) the study of   energy flow processes in the reaction, especially as this can be used to   evaluate statistical models of reaction kinetics. Detailed comparisons of   the results obtained from these studies are being made with experimental   results and with other theoretical results in order to obtain an enhanced   understanding of reaction dynamics.   Accurate descriptions of the kinetics of barrierless associations and the   reverse dissociations are of the utmost importance for the modelling of a   variety of gas phase chemistries including those occuring in combustion,   atmospheric, and interstellar environments. An important objective of the   work supported by this grant is to improve the ability to interpret and   to predict properties of these barrierless reactions.",
