 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510553  Williams    This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the  causes and implications of the distribution of land use \"bads\"  through zoning in cities.  \"Bads\" are defined as land uses that  produce negative spillovers to surrounding property.  Using data  from cincinnati, Columbus, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee, the  project investigates the effects of electoral institutions on the  distribution of land use bads and the politics of  bureaucratic/legislative relations between the planning  department and city council in distributing these policy outputs.   The research also explores the efficiency implications of the  distribution of land use bads.  Efficiency of bad siting patterns  is measured in two ways--the effect of bad siting patterns on  property values, and the effect of bad siting patterns on the  supply of public goods.    This study is innovative and contributes to a larger theory of  public policy distribution in two respects.  First, it examines  the distribution of bads instead of the more often-studied goods.   Second, by studying distribution in cities, it is possible to  take advantage of institutional variation that does not exist in  the study of distribution in the United States Congress, where  institutional structures are fixed.  ***",
