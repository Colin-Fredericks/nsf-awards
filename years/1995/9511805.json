 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate a new approach to learning models of dynamical systems  for use in advanced reinforcement learning architectures.  It will develop a method by which a  reinforcement learning system can learn multiple time scale models and use them as the basis for  hierarchical learning and planning.  the project(s objectives are to develop the mathematical theory  of this approach, to examine its relationship to control theory and to behavioral and neural models of  learning, and to demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of simulated learning tasks. The  significance of the project for engineeirng is that the use of TD models will be major generalization  of RL architectures, making them much more widely applicable.  It also has the possibility of  establshing the utility of TD modesl for system identification in more conventional adaptive control.  The project also has implication for our understanding of animal learning able to model indirect and  direct  associations and their interactions in a mathematically principled way.  An Additinoal impact  of this research will be t o strengthen links between engineering, artifical intellegence, and  biological studies of learning, thereby contributng to all three areas by facilitating a transfer of  concepts and methods.",
