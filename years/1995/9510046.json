 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510046  Van Stryland  The PI proposes to apply the knowledge he has gained in  understanding the nonlinear response of inorganic materials (both  semiconductors and dielectrics) to organic materials.  In  particular he will concentrate on specific classes of organic  materials such as macrocyclic dyes that have been shown to exhibit  strong nonlinearities.  He will also investigate resonant  nonlinearities in these materials.  For example,  metallophthalocyanines and metallo-naphthalocyanines exhibit  increasing absorption from excited state absorption (reverse  saturable absorbers).  Such nonlinearities are proving useful for  optical limiting.  In addition, he will further develop a numerical  modeling for determining the propagation of light through thick  nonlinear media.  This modeling allows optimized use of nonlinear  absorption and nonlinear refraction for applications such as  optical limiting.  His past research investigated two-photon  absorption (2PA), bound electronic nonlinear refraction  characterized by n2, and free-carrier effects in semiconductors and  dielectrics.  He has recently extended these measurements to  molecular species and observed analogous nonlinearities.  ***",
