 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510731  Thompson  This  project  will  investigate the  effect  of  fission-induced  columnar  defects  on  vortex pinning in  a  variety  of  high-Tc  materials,  such as practical Pb-doped Bi-2223/Ag composite  wire  or  tapes,  Hg-based cuprate epitaxial films and bulk  materials,  and  Bi-2212  single crystals. The goal is to  develop  practical  ways  to  enhance  the  critical current density,  Jc,  in  these  materials  via deliberate introduction of extended  defects  with  GeV range light particle irradiation, with potential for scale-up  to  large  prefabricated structures. The project  incorporates  a  focused  joint  effort of groups at the University of  Tennessee,  Knoxville,  and  at  IBM  T.  J.  Watson  Research  Center,  with  demonstrated  expertise  in  studies of  superconductors  and  in  various magnetic and transport methods. The project also draws on  the  expertise and irradiation facilities at Los Alamos  National  Laboratory and on fabrication of wires and tapes at the  American  Superconductor Corporation.  %%%  Large-scale applications of high temperature superconductors  are  not  yet  possible due to difficulties in manufacturing wires  or  tapes  capable of carrying large currents, that is, having  large  critical  current  densities, Jc, sustainable  in  high  magnetic  fields.  The  problems  are  related  to  dissipative  motion  of  current  \"vortices\" which are intrinsic to the high-Tc  materials  in   the  presence  of  magnetic  fields.  This  project  employs  radiation induced damage centers, or columnar defects, which  act  to  \"pin\"  the  vortices so they are unable to move,  and,  as  a  result,  greatly enhance the current carrying properties  of  the  materials.  The  project incorporates a focused joint  effort  of  groups  at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and at IBM  T.  J. Watson Research Center, with demonstrated expertise in studies  of superconductors and in various magnetic and transport methods.  The   project   also  draws  on  t he  expertise  and  irradiation  facilities  at Los Alamos National Laboratory and on  fabrication  of wires and tapes at the American Superconductor Corporation.  ***",
