 "awd_abstract_narration": "The semidefinite programming problem  (SDP),  including implementation of numerically stable   interior point  algorithms, mathematical properties of the feasible sets, and   in  particular  applications of SDP in combinatorial optimization are  being   investigated.  First,  two versions of the primal-dual interior  point  SDP   algorithm are being  implemented. One version is in  MATLAB and is intended as an   easy to use  and change software for  small to medium size problems.   Another implementation  is in FORTRAN 90 and is intended for high performance   parallel and  vector/pipelined machines and is meant to solve large scale    problems.  In  addition feasibility of active set methods for  SDP  is being   investigated. Next  applications of SDP in general 0-1  integer programming   problems are being  studied. The feasibility of  branch and bound SDP techniques   which solve an SDP  problem at  each stage but may require far fewer branchings   overall is being  investigated.  If such an approach is found to be practical,    general purpose  programs will be developed.  In theoretical  investigations,   the following  applications of SDP are being studied:  parallel   computational complexity of the  Lovasz number of graphs,  approximation algorithms for the   minimum vertex cover  problem,  applications to the general matching problem, and   polyhedrality  of  the feasible sets of SDPs under affine transformations. The    connection of  primal--dual method of linear and semidefinite  programs to   the problem of  quadratically constrained quadratic  programming is being   investigated. In  addition, those cones are being investiagted whose associated   optimization  problem  leads to  complementarity relations that are bilinear forms;   programming, quadratically constrained quadratic programming   and  SDP are  examples of such problems.    For teaching plans, active   participation in  helping RUTCOR  establish a masters program is planned.   Courses in semidefinite programming  and in  computational  biology in graduate school, and a course designed  to survey   various software  available for optimization problems  are being developed. At   the undergraduate  level teaching of  courses in the affiliated departments of   computer science,  mathematics and statistics is expected. Also a  textbook on SDP is in preparation.",
