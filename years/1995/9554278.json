 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Williamson  95-54278    WhaleNet is a unique interdisciplinary, hands-on, collaborative telecomputing project  to foster excitement and learning about the natural world in schools across the nation and  around the world. Through interaction with cooperating international scientists and research  institutions, students will be able to participate in research projects on the marine ecosystem  and have access to data from a variety of research programs, including studies on marine  mammals, pollution, and general environmental sciences.      WhaleNet Program Goals:      to utilize telecommunications and other advanced technologies to enhance education through cooperation and communication among students, teachers, scientists, and research institutions;    to involve students in real-time interdisciplinary scientific research and education by sharing data collected from classroom field experiences, existing research programs, and new research projects by participating organizations using high technology devices;    to establish collaboration among business, education, and research institutions, with the goal of enhancing student involvement and interest in learning and environment;    to establish an international network of schools, students, educators and scientists who are interested in integrating WhaleNet into the K-12 curriculum as an interdisciplinary resource;    to connect students to a variety of research databases, students to scientists/naturalists, and students to students via telecommunication to stimulate interest in and involve students in interdisciplinary learning;    to make related supplementary curriculum materials available to educators electronically, utilizing a gopher server, listserv, and world wide-web connectivity.      The proposed project builds upon the success of WhaleNet - Interdisciplinary Curriculum Planning Grant (RED-9454757), which has been active throughout the academic year September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995. As a result of this planning grant, WhaleNet  has expanded to include participants from all 50 states and 28 countries. With continued funding students and educators will have access to scientists as well as past and current data so that they can experience a more comprehensive academic program on a year-round basis. WhaleNet continues to establish contacts among educators, students, scientists, and research programs to enhance K - 12 science education. Interdisciplinary K-12 teaching units and innovative, interactive CD-ROM materials are being produced so they can be used with the WhaleNet program. WhaleNet enables students to use research data and information in real-time to generate involvement and interest in scientific investigations while fostering an interdisciplinary approach to learning, research, critical thinking, and problem solving.",
