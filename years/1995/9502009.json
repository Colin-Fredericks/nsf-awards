The CAREER Program is an  National Science Foundation Program is intended to support junior faculty within the  context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single program the  support of quality research and education.          For the research component, the Principal Investigator will utilized an  advanced mesoscale numerical model to study the aggregate effect of the Great  Lakes on larger scale meteorological systems.  The Great Lakes effect weather on a  variety of scales.  While intense lake-effect storms are primarily the result of forcing  from individual lakes, larger effects also occur in winter as a result of forcing from  all the Great Lakes (e.g. the Great Lakes aggregate).  Under certain cold air  conditions, a 2000 km wide and 3 km deep circulation can develop that significantly  impact weak synoptic-scale systems.  The development and impact of lake-aggregate  circulations have not yet been studied.  The two primary research objectives are to  understand: how lake-aggregate circulations develop energetically; and how heat  aggregate-forced circulations depend on synoptic conditions and aggregate heating  characteristics.            The objectives of the educational component are to: bridge the gap between  classroom work, theoretical knowledge and  real-world  problems; give students an  in-depth look and hands-on experience on a problem concerning atmospheric scale  interactions; provide students with experience in the applications of advanced computer  technology.  The educational component will be attacked through the development of  homework problems; class projects and research opportunities.  ***",
