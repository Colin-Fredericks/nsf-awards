 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a valuable solution to power limitations of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles (EV) powered by fuel cells (FC) have appeal related to their high efficiency, low pollution levels and minimum number of moving parts. A major limitation of FC is their limited power. Historically oxygen based FC have increased power by increasing system pressure and oxygen partial pressure. This pressure process consumes significant energy and causes weight and design problems. The major limitation in using oxygen enriched air (OEA) from membranes for increasing oxygen partial pressure is that no compact OEA systems exists. Our high oxygen permeable perfluoropolymer membranes dramatically improve oxygen flux capability. They will supply compact OEA (30-35% oxygen) membrane systems for enhanced FC power. Engineering studies indicate our perfluoromembrane systems are 30 times more productive than existing membranes and can boost power 50% with significantly less weight than lead-acid batteries. Phase I focuses on proof of concept by developing the needed thin film composite hollow fiber structure to demonstrate high flux and doing engineering evaluations on the overall system. Phase II will focus on developing expanded area prototype membrane modules and running actual FC tests.",
