Spore formation is found in bacterial, fungi, protozoa, and algae.  The systematics of these organisms is complex.  Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive authoritative treatment of the description of spores and spore types means that many biodiversity and systematics studies are either in error (by not working on a  true  spore), or are not understandable due to resulting misidentifications or confusing descriptions.  Consequently, to help remedy the situation, an international workshop was organized and held in Santa Maria Imbaro, Italy, consisting of experts on the systematic of spore formation in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and algae.  The experts were chosen by consultation with appropriate international organizations involved with the systematic of these various microbes (such as the Bergey s Manual Trust and the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology for the bacteria.)  The object of the workshop was to rationalize and codify the terminology of spor e descriptions for all spore-forming type microorganisms.  The result of this effort will be a report on the proceedings of the workshop and a manual of definitions and instructions on accurate and standardized descriptions of spores.  It is intended that this report will serve as a multidisciplinary standards manual for systematics of spore forming microbes, thus providing for more accurate and consistent terminology and cell identifications in studies on microbial biodiversity. ***                         ;                                    S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Krichevsky, M.
