 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415454  Gamache         This project will focus on the development of a theoretical  framework to calculate pressure-broadened halfwidths ( ) and  pressure-induced line shifts ( ) for atmospherically important  species.  The halfwidth is the major source of error in remote  sensing data and in line-by-line models used to calculate radiative  forcing from greenhouse gases.  To address these problems, data are  needed for thousands of rotational-vibrational transitions.  Hence  a theoretical model is needed that is computationally efficient and  capable of achieving 5% uncertainty in  .         The resolvent operator formalism of Baranger, Kolb, and Greim  (BKG) is the basis of the theoretical approach.  Calculations will  use realistic molecular dynamics, explicit velocity averaging, and  all relevant terms in the interaction potential.  Calculations will  be done for atmospherically important rotor molecules (H2O, O3, SO2,  NO2, H2S) perturbed by N2 or O2 and self-interactions.  There are a  number of experimental measurements to compare with and test the  theory.  Once the theoretical questions are resolved, a database of    and   for atmospherically important transitions will be generated  for each species.  The vibrational, rotational state, and  temperature dependence of the halfwidths and line-shifts will be  investigated.         The major objective of this work is to improve our confidence  in remote sensing results and allow a better determination of the  radiative forcing of greenhouse gases.",
