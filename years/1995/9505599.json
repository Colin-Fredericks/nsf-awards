 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505599  Fredrickson  With the advent of powerful new surface characterization  techniques, a number of experimental groups have reported on  the surface segregation and wetting behavior of  multicomponent polymer blends, as well as block and random  copolymers.  Surface energy differences between components  are generally assumed to be responsible for producing the  inhomogeneous composition profiles in such systems.  Very  recent experiments on model polyolefin blends and  copolymers, however, have shown that a strong correlation  exists between interfacial thermodynamics and the difference  in conformational properties (i.e., backbone flexibilities)  of the components, leading to an alternative entropic  explanation for surface segregation.  Theoretical  calculations based on the self-consistent field theory of  Edwards will be performed to place these experimental  observations on a sound theoretical footing.  Besides  exploring surface enrichment in such \"conformationally  asymmetric\" polymer blends and copolymers with small heats  of mixing (e.g., polyolefins), calculations will be  performed to investigate interfacial thermodynamics and  wetting behavior in blends of \"architecturally asymmetric\"  polymers, such as mixtures of linear and star polymers  composed of the same chemical repeat unit.  An examination  of surface enrichment is also planned for molten polymer  blends that contain star-block copolymers, and for which  broken conformational and architectural symmetries may  compete.  The objective of these studies if to develop  structure-property relations that will facilitate the  rational design of polymer interfaces for engineering  applications.  The theoretical work proposed will be  coordinated with parallel experimental efforts currently  underway.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of  polymer surfaces.  In particular, the question of why  certain types of polymers tend to migrate to the surfaces of  polymer mixtures and solids will be explored.   While having  fundamental interest, this problem is also of high  technological interest since it impacts our ability to coat  and paint plastics.  ***",
