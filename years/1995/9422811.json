This research examines democratic transition in  Italy during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries -- a  crucial period of nation- and state-building marked by the  extension of political citizenship, the construction of national  consciousness and the transition to market capitalism.    Democratization is a longitudinal, dynamic process best  understood in comparative, historical perspective. Previous  theoretical and empirical work on Britain, Norway and Argentina  furnish the comparative, historical context for the Italian  experience. Italy constitutes a pivotal case in the study of  democratic transition; its origins in the collapse of empire, its  struggle to institute liberal-capitalist democracy, its collapse  into Fascism and imperialism, its post-war transition and current  crisis make it a central case for the study of democracy. The  research design examines four stages in the democratization  process across the four cases: non-democratic regimes prior to  democratization in the 19th century, transitional regimes in the  late 19th and early 20th centuries as well as stable and unstable  democratic outcomes. Norway provides the case of the transition  to stable social democracy; Britain, the case for triumph of a  stable liberal democracy, and Argentina, a non-European case of  democratic break-down and unstable politics. Italy provides a  third European case in which democratic transition was followed  by break-down and a return to democracy in the post-war period  and currently undergoing a second democratic transition.    Three interpretations of democracy initially guide the inquiry  into democratic transition: political cultural, institutional  design and social structural explanations. In addition, the  research employs core-periphery analysis to exam ine the impact of  peripheral nationalism, state traditions, and crossnational  forces on democratization. The research examines a mix of micro-  and macro-level processes, employing both qualitative and  quantitative historical information to test explanations of  democratic transition.     Historical, comparative in-depth studies systematically consider  the political cultural, social structural and institutional  design elements before, during and after efforts at  democratization. The proposed project is the first systematic,  quantitative historical investigation of Italy's transition to  democracy and provides important theoretical insights into  Italy's past and current politics. Moreover, when coupled to the  comparative analysis of Britain, Norway and Argentina, the  current project generates valuable theoretical and substantive  findings in the study of democratic transition for newer  democracies, particularly in eastern and southern Europe and  Latin America.",
