 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419916  Watson    The primary objective of the proposed research is to define the action of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) in the regulation of crustacean growth and development.  The crustacean carapace (exoskeleton) is restrictive to growth. Therefore, as crustaceans develop, they must periodically shed (molt) the old carapace and replace it with a new and larger version.  The processes of growth and molting are driven by steroid hormones (ecdysteroids) secreted by paired endocrine glands, the Y-organs.  The secretion of ecdysteroids by Y-organs is regulated by a neuropeptide hormone, MIH.  MIH is produced by a cluster of neurosecretory cells (the X-organ) located in neural ganglia of the eyestalks. Thus, a generally accepted model suggests MIH inhibits Y-organs during much of development, and a molting sequence ensues when MIH secretion declines. Despite the central importance of MIH in regulating crustacean development, little is known about its structure and function.  In particular, there is a glaring lack of information about MIH gene expression and secretory cycles.  Our lab has recently cloned a cDNA encoding MIH from the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Using the cloned cDNA as probe, recombinant DNA technology (e.g., Northern blot, nuclear runoff assay, in situ hybridization) will be employed (1) to quantify MIH mRNA levels during the blue crab molt cycle, and (2) to determine the tissues and cells that express the MIH gene.  In addition, recombinant MIH will be produced by inserting the cloned cDNA into a baculovirus expression vector. Monoclonal antibodies will be generated against the recombinant peptide and used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantification of MIH in crab hemolymph (blood).  The proposed research addresses fundamental questions about the neuroendocrine regulation of development in this abundant and economically important group of organisms.  The results will be a starting point for designing methods to specifically manipulate growth and  molting in crustaceans, a potential benefit to fisheries management, aquaculture, and consumers of shellfish.  ***",
