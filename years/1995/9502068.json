 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of efficient methods for   the preparation of functionalized thio- and phosphoglycosides and to use   these glycosides for diastereoselective synthesis of oligosaccharides.    The focus of the educational plan involves the development of programs,   laboratories and group activities that foster learning as an active   rather than passive activity.  Collaborative learning will be stressed.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research and educational plan of Dr. Kang Zhao of the Department of   Chemistry at New York University.  Professor Zhao will focus his research   efforts on the development of an automated protocol that allows the   coupling of a variety of reactivity- modulated glycosyl donors with   acceptors on solid supports.  The focus of Professor Zhao's educational   plan involves the development of programs laboratories and group   activities that foster learning  as an active rather than passive activity. Collaborative learning will be   stressed.",
