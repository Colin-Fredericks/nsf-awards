 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is acquiring of a high field Fourier transform  multinuclear NMR spectrometer for use as part of the overall  improvement of the undergraduate curriculum.   The improvement  plan is integrating the theory and applications of multinuclear  FT-NMR into ten regularly scheduled laboratory courses and the  undergraduate student research program.   The spectrometer  provides students and faculty with the capability to perform  pulse techniques which furnish structure information that are  routine by today's standards.   Courses which focus on the  technical aspects of FT methods and the applications of both C13  and H1 NMR methods for quantitative measurements are also being  enhanced by the spectrometer.   Experiments which target the  studies of reaction mechanisms, stereospecific reactions,  thermodynamic properties, equilibrium and substituent constants,  and enzyme kinetics are being introduced into physical, organic,  analytical, and biochemistry laboratories and into two  Instrumental Analysis courses.   The enhanced capability of high  resolution NMR pulse techniques also improves both the quality  and quantity of undergraduate student research which is a  requirement for all students seeking a major in chemistry.    Integration of high resolution FT-NMR into the chemistry  curriculum enhances the undergraduate experience with modern  instrumentation and reinforces student understanding of how  modern chemistry research is conducted.    The Bruker DPX-250 was  chosen for its cost effectiveness, versatility, and ease of use  in providing a number of applications.   The AVANCE DPX system  incorporates digital signal and filtering techniques which  provide ultra-high stability and sensitivity required for 3-D and  inverse experiments.   All advanced NMR experiments and  techniques, from ID and DEPT to inverse, 2D or gradient  experiments are performed automatically.   Experimental results  are automatically processed and plotted.   The Ethernet interface  allows for transfer of data  via a network to individual  workstations or PCs.   Most importantly, the AVANCE DPX is an  ideal teaching tool for illustrating the fundamental concepts of  NMR and illustrating how it is used to solve molecular structure  problems.",
