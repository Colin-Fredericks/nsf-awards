Long term cultures of B cells derived from primary and memory mice immunized with fluoresceinated macromolecules (as the antigen) will be generated by fusion with myeloma cells.   The density of the fluorescein on the carrier as well as the nature of the carrier used for immunization , will be varied to alter the extent of T cell help in the development of the antibody response.  The DNA sequences of IgM anti-fluorescein antibodies from primary and memory mice will be compared to determine whether there is  evidence for a unique population of secondary B cells expressing an antibody repertoire different from that secreted by animals recognizing the antigen for the first time.  Sequence comparisons will also be made between antibodies derived from animals in which T cell help has been optimized or minimized. Cytotoxic T cells from memory and primary mice  differ in their abilities to recognize and respond to cells with low densities of surface antigens, but the biological mechanisms for these differences are not understood.  This proposal will test whether immunization with fluorescein-coupled cells increases the frequency of fluorescein-response cytotoxic T cell precursors, whether different populations of cytotoxic T cells respond after the animal is antigenically experienced, or whether each type of cytotoxic T cells responds after the animal becomes antigenically experienced, or whether each individual cytotoxic T cell proliferates more efficiently and or binds more effectively to its target cells once it had prior antigenic exposure.   Cytotoxic T cells will be generated from primary and memory mice, fused with long-lived tumor cells and their receptor genes analyzed by DNA sequencing.  Cell surface density of the receptor and its associated molecules will be measured by flow cytometry, and the frequencies of  cytotoxic T cell precursors measured by limiting dilution analyses. %%%  These studies looking at differences in cells of the immune system during primary and secondary immune responses will increase our understanding of the basis of immunological memory.  ***                                              Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Abstract                            Barbara   S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Zain                        Shirley Parker              @     W1 8                          @                                   @      J4E                                                                                                  @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      3                                                                                       ;                                                                         e =       e               4   L                   4                                       l       l   l       l       l       l       l                                                                           1                                                                   3       5       5       5       S               s           T       6                           l                                                                                         l       l                                                                       l               l               3                                       l       l       l       l               3                                                                                                             Abstract 9507010 Owen    This proposal is studying the differences in lymphocytes responding to a foreign body for the first time (primary response) and those lymphocytes responding after having had prior exposure to that antigen (memory response).
