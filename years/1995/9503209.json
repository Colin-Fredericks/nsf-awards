 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503209  Ghaboussi  This project continues and extends  the development of an active  structural control method using  neural networks by the  investigators at the University of  Illinois in 1992 under the NSF's  structural control program.  The  main controller in the new method  of structural control is a trained  neural network, referred to as the  neuro-controller.  The training of  the neuro-controller is  accomplished with the aid of an  emulator neural network, which is  first trained to learn the  structural behavior.  Results from  the numerical simulations showed  that the new structural control  method performs well compared to  other control methods and is far  more robust as well as being an  inherently adaptive controller.    In this project research on neural  network based methods of structural  control will be continued to  consist  of (1) experimental  verification of the new structural  control method; and (2) the  extension into nonlinear control  problems.  The experimental work  will be done in two stages.  In the  initial  stage, extensive trial and  error, adjustment and the online  training of the emulator neural  network and the neuro-controller  will be done.  Verification tests  will be conducted on the shaking  table at the University of Illinois  Structural Engineering Laboratory,  using a three story, one bay  structural model, similar to those  used in numerical simulations.  The  next stage of experimental work  will be conducted at the NCEER  facilities, on a larger structural  model.  Finally, the new method of  structural control must be extended  to address the problem of nonlinear  control of structures sustaining  unpredictable damage and develop a  feasible and practical method of  nonlinear structural control.  ***",
