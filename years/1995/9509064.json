The research objectives are: (1) Determination of  whether the anomalous infrared bands detected between 2100 and 1900  cm-1 are general features of Ni hydrogenases.  To this end a series  of infrared studies will be carried out on a well-characterized  hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas. (2) Identification of the  structure responsible for these unusual infrared signatures using  infrared spectroscopy coupled with chemical modification of the  enzyme and the study of isotopically labeled enzyme. (3)  Utilization of the three infrared signatures for further study of  the various redox states of the enzyme.  This approach provides a  unique opportunity; Ni hydrogenases display at least two EPR-silent  species which are distinguishable by their infrared signatures in  the 2100 and 1900 cm-1 spectral region. (4) Utilization of mid-  infrared spectroscopy to examine the role individual amino acids  play in the activation of hydrogen. (5)  Examination of the  oxidation state of the Ni center in various redox states of the  enzymes.  This approach used the infrared detectable carbon  monoxide stretching frequency, arising from Ni bound carbon  monoxide, as a probe of the oxidation state of the Ni.  %%%  Ni Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the simplest reaction in  nature and the simplest conversion of electrical energy into  chemical energy of universal utility: 2e- + 2H+ = H2.  This research  involves a spectroscopic study of the anomalous infrared absorption  bands that are characteristic of these enzymes.  Infrared  spectroscopic studies will be made on the well-characterized Ni  hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio gigas.  It is a anticipated that  this work will have important consequences for understanding the  mechanism underlying Ni hydrogenase's ability to split molecular   hydrogen into protons and electrons.  The work also involves the  development of methodologies for handling infrared samples under  strictly anaerobic conditions, and should prove of general utility  in infrared studies of other oxygen sensitive metallo-proteins.  ***",
