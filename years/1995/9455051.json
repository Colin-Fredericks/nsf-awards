 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a cooperative effort between the Association for  Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer Science  Education (SIGCSE) and the Consortium for Computing in Small  Colleges (CCSC) to provide outreach services to Computer Science  faculty. Each group has as its primary focus improving faculty  teaching skills, increasing awareness of current issues in Computer  Science education and providing opportunities for faculty to share  ideas.  The two-year project has two components: (1) to provide  outreach services by offering two SIGCSE Symposium workshops at  each of the five CCSC Regional conferences each year, and (2)  provide funds for a competitive resource grant program for twenty  faculty to attend the SIGCSE Technical Symposium each year. The  first component allows more faculty to take advantage of the high  quality workshops at the Symposium, but within the context of a  less expensive regional conference. The second component   encourages and allows a number faculty members to participate in  the national Symposium and its workshops who would not otherwise be  able to attend due to lack of funds. The grant program  supports  some faculty who will present at the Symposium as well as people  who will not. All are provided with the opportunity to participate  as a session chair and become more involved with Symposium  activities.    The effectiveness of this overall project will be ascertained by  two separate evaluations from participants: one immediately  following the workshops/symposium, and one six months later to  determine impact on courses and curricula.",
