Recently Cohen, Jones, and Segal have defined an  underlying notion of Floer homotopy type, which can be interpreted  as the `universal deformation' of this topological field theory to  what physicists call a theory of two-dimensional topological  gravity.  This Floer homotopy type is a rather mysterious  MU-algebra spectrum.  In this project the investigator constructs  a conjectural model for it, and he probes some of the ways in which  it provides an understanding of the constructions of string  physicists from a homotopy-theoretical point of view.  The whole  subject has profound implications for the future of homotopy theory  and global analysis.       The theory of mechanics developed in the ninteenth century was  based on 'principles of least action': a ray of light, for example,  follows the path which minimizes its time of flight.  The physicist  Richard Feynman reinterpreted these ideas in terms of a theory of  integration over the space of all possible paths; his ideas are now  fundamental to our understanding of quantum mechanics.   Unfortunately, the theory of such Feynman path integrals has never  been made rigorous; indeed, it is now known that no naive  generalization of the classical theory of integration can form an  adequate basis for the integrals which arise in modern physics.  In  geometry, however, it has become clear recently that ideas from the  theory of Feynman integrals can be used to solve classical problems  of pure mathematics, and there is evidence that many geometric  problems are in some sense 'tame' enough so that an analogue of the  theory of Feynman integrals can be established rigorously.   Although restricted in many ways, these geometrical test questions  provide very clear and extremely important data for understanding  the 'dyna mical' problems of direct interest to physics, and they  are our best guide to a consistent theory of Feynman integrals.  In  this project the investigator sketches a conjectural description,  in terms of algebraic topology, for a rather lapge class of  topological field theories, which arise from the application of  Feynman integral techniques to the geometry of complex manifolds.  ***",
