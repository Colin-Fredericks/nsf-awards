 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9512315  Garofalo, Robert S.      The hormone, insulin, exerts its effects on cells by binding to a  cell surface protein called the insulin receptor.  This binding  causes the receptor to transmit signals into the interior of the  cell which result in glucose uptake and other metabolic changes.   While a great deal about the structure of the insulin receptor is  known, there is limited information about the nature of the signals  transmitted within the cell or the components of the signaling  pathway.  The studies proposed by Dr. Garofalo use an excellent  model system to study the mechanism of action of the insulin  receptor.  The model offers advantages over other experimental  systems, notably the ability to easily generate and characterize  mutations, and to study the effects of mutations on the function of  the insulin receptor in a complex organism.  Using this system, the  function of the insulin receptor in the development of the nervous  system and muscles, and in the regulation of growth will be  examined.  The proposed studies will also identify novel cellular  components involved in the function of the receptor.  The  elucidation of these components in this model system is simplified  by its ability to be modified genetically and characterized  biochemically.  The identification of components in the insulin  receptor signaling pathway is significant for our understanding of  the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases, such as diabetes and  cancer, and may suggest novel targets for intervention.",
