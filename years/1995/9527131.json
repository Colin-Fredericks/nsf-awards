 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527131  Marinescu  Dr. Marinescu and his collaborators will develop algorithms and programs for real time data acquisition and analysis of crystallographic and cryEM data.  These are required to process data produced at high rates.  10 Mbits per second or more, by new photon sources like the Advance Photon Source and by CCD detectors.  Similar data rates are produced by state of the art electron microscopes equipped with CCD detectors such as the new Philips CM200 installed at Purdue.  Real time analysis of such data streams require parallel and distributed computing.  The research will be done by an interdisciplinary collaboration among members of Purdue's Center for Structural Studies and Department of Computer Sciences.  The biological objectives are to provide improved tools for the structure determination of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes such as viruses, virus-receptors, and membrane bound cell surface molecules using X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cyroRM), and 3D image reconstruction.  An essential requirement for this is the fusion of structural biology and high performance computing.  The computer science objective is to create new algorithms, parallelize old ones, and design methodologies for the high performance computing required in structural studies of biological macromolecules.  %%%  The goal is to provide an integrated solution for the computational side of structure determination from data acquisition to data analysis and data visualization and to incorporate into our system programs developed elsewhere, e.g., the CCP4 suite.  This group is in a unique position due to the extensive experience in structural biology augmented by expertise in computer science and mathematics.  This project builds on ongoing collaborative research between faculty in the Structural Biology group and Computer Science department.    ***",
