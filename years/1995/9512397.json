 "awd_abstract_narration": "With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Irvine will purchase a Digital Equipment Corporation AlphaServer 2100 4/275. The RISC chip in this server runs at 275 MHz and the operating system is the Open Software Foundation version of Unix, OSF.  The server has 256 Mbytes of main memory with 8.3 Gbytes of disc space. This equipment will supplement and significantly upgrade the group's current system and will permit a broader range of analyses of large data sets.  The Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences is a multidisciplinary research center that draws its faculty from the Departments of Anthropology, Cognitive Sciences, Economics, Mathematics, Philosophy and Sociology and from the Graduate School of Management. The experience and expertise of the faculty cover much of the spectrum of formal and computational approaches to behavioral science. The equipment provided will further research in several areas that include cognitive sciences, economics, social networks and anthropology, and visual perception. This project has a strong educational component and the equipment will help graduate students in the Institute's M.A. and Ph.D. programs and graduate students in other Departments in the School of Social Sciences. The equipment will help with computer-aided learning for undergraduates in anthropology, economics and cognitive sciences.",
