 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408193  Floyd       The green algae (known formally as the Chlorophyceae) are a  diverse group of organisms, placed together by biologists because  of the nature of their photosynthetic pigments and storage  products.  It has become clear that they include several ancient  evolutionary lines.  The particular algal species chosen for this  study represent major groups within the green algae whose origins  and affinities are questionable.  The analysis emphasizes molecular  characters as markers of evolution.  The DNA sequences of genes  which code for the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA will be  determined.  These genes are referred to as the 18S rRNA genes.   Traditional approaches using morphological and microscopic  (ultrastructural) characters which can help to understand the  evolutionary pattern in these algae are either unavailable,  uninformative, or conflicting.         Several interrelated topics are to be investigated.  These  include: (1) the taxonomic relationships between members of the  algal order Tetrasporales, especially whether forms with four  flagella on their zoopores (called quadriflagellate) or two  flagella (biflagellate) are closely related, and whether the  species of the Tetrasporales are closely related to other algal  groups; (2) the origin and affinities of two groups of filamentous  algae, the Chaetophorales and the Oedogoniales, including if they  have a common origin, or are derived from other types of algae;  and, (3) the relationship between these filamentous algae and a  selected set of algae that do not produce motile cells at any time  in their life history, for which appropriate cell ultrastructure  information is unavailable.  The 18S rRNA genes of approximately 40  species will be studied by using the polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) to amplify copies of the gene, then sequencing the DNA  products.  The results of the current project can be compared with  sequences of the 18S rRNA  genes of the other algae already studied  and with published data on  algal 18S rRNA gene sequences.  The  relationships identified from the molecular analysis will be  compared with those based on traditional morphological characters,  and on ultrastructural studies.",
