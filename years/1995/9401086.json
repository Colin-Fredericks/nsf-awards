Both  components involve close scrutiny of continuous functions on  these objects, with severe restrictions imposed on the point  preimages.  The first comprises the final aspects of a  far-reaching effort to characterize manifolds topologically;  primarily it calls for determination of an appropriate geometric  notion of general position to fulfill the role played by the  Disjoint Disks Property in the characterization of high  dimensional manifolds.  The second arises because recent results  in the piecewise linear category make it reasonable to expect  discovery of widespread additional conditions under which one  quickly and easily detects an approximate fibration;  specifically, it seems that for many n-manifolds  N , any map  from an (n+k)-manifold onto a reasonable space  X  with each  point preimage homotopy equivalent to  N  will be an approximate  fibration.  Interest in this class stems from andtrades upon  computable relationships among domain, range, and typical fiber.   New tools are sought for this effort, geometric ones in the first  case, to distinguish genuine manifolds from pretenders, and  algebraic ones in the second case, both to improve the  recognition criteria and to expand the applications.       The projected research activity focuses on manifolds, a  foundational project in that these objects are central to so much  mathematics.  One aim is to characterize low-dimensional  manifolds, which would crown the far-reaching effort to  characterize manifolds topologically, with complete success  recently achieved in dimensions greater than 4, and hopes for  related success in the two remaining dimensions of interest.  A  second aim is to characterize certain nicely structured  functions, approximate fibrations, defined on manifolds.  This  effort appears promising now because several resu lts from the  past two years make it reasonable to expect discovery of  additional, useful conditions under which one could quickly  detect this class of functions.  The resultant ease and variety  of computations about the various objects at hand would be a  significant benefit.  New tools are sought for each of these  efforts, geometric ones in the first case, to distinguish genuine  manifolds from pretenders, and algebraic ones in the second case,  to provide additional relationships among domain, range, and  fiber of the functions under consideration and thereby to expand  the applications.  ***",
