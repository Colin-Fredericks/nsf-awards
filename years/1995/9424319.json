China is a country with a one-fourth of the world population.  There is a tremendous opportunity for investment of R&D  technologies in the energy sector in the nation's economy.  In  this conference, heavy representation from Japan and European  countries is expected.  The U.S. team would benefit from the  interaction and information exchange in understanding the  fundamental issues in basic methodologies and development need  for the Chinese power industry, which will help to maintain  competitiveness of U.S. researchers and industry in the global  economy.    A request is made to supplement the travel cost for about twenty  four participants from U.S. universities in attending the  conference.  ***",
