Improvements in the field-work infrastructure of the Bermuda  Biological Station for Research, Inc (BBSR) will be achieved  through the construction of a new facility.  BBSR has  sponsored marine research from the special perspective of a  mid-Atlantic Island since 1903.  The institution has grown  dramatically in the past decade, during which it has have  maintained its commitment to visiting scientists in both  marine biology and oceanography.  BBSR has expanded that  commitment by creating a new molecular biology facility.  This growth has led to overcrowding and inefficiencies in  support of all types of field activities.  This project will  support the upgrade some of the basic station infrastructure  that directly supports the entire suite of marine  activities.  BBSR will build a new 30' by 95' scientific  support and maintenance building dedicated to the storage of  scientific equipment behind the present workshop and  oceanographic storage facility (Pew Building).",
