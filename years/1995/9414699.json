 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mark A. Ratner at the Department of Chemistry, Northwestern   University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to study a number of systems with coupled   modes through the use of static and time dependent mean field methods.   These methods are being extended, especially to provide the theoretical   capability to study large systems of practical interest. The static mean   field techniques are being improved using perturbation theory, while the   dynamic, or time dependent, techniques are being extended to include   mixed quantum mechanical and  classical mechanical treatments. A wide   range of systems and properties, which include the low energy excitations   of porphyrins and peptides, proton transfer reactions, and cluster   melting, are to be studied with these mean field methods.  The principal concern of Prof. Ratner's work is the study of complex   systems which are directly connected to real problems in Materials   Science and Biology. Mean field methods, Prof. Ratner's primary   theoretical tools, involve using averages of various kinds of   interactions and provide the essential simplification needed to treat   these real systems. It has been shown that they have the capability to   treat the statics and the dynamics of coupled mode quantum mechanical   systems. Static methods are being used to study systems of biological   interest while time-dependent methods are being used to study dynamic   behavior in solids, in clusters, and in solutions.",
