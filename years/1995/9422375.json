Beginning with California in 1990, however, some sixteen  states have enacted term limits for their state legislative or  congressional representatives, and additional states are likely  to enact such limits in the near future.  Owing to this recent  timing, most writings about the topic are prescriptive, but the  arguments are intense and the claims are grandiose.    This project is the first large-scale study of the actual effects  of term limits,  The investigators will focus on the state  legislative level.  The heart of the project consists of: a) a  mail survey of all state legislators as of spring 1995; b)  personal interviews during 1995 with legislators and key  political observers in four states, one highly professionalized  legislature with term limits, one more amateur legislature with  term litis, and one of each type without term limits.  In  addition, the investigators will make use of data on state  legislative elections as well as other published data about  legislators and the legislatures.    This project should substantially enhance our understanding of  this interesting and important topic.  ***",
