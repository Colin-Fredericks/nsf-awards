 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interdisciplinary study of energy production and use presents  important opportunities to combine technical and liberal arts  education in the undergraduate curriculum.   In particular, the  recognition of energy conservation as a policy option and the  rise of an associated engineering subfield has raised a new range  of locally relevant questions for scientific, engineering,  political, and humanistic study and has also generated technical  means for investigating them inexpensively in real-world  situations.    The faculty responsible for energy studies at the  college is acquiring the capability for monitoring thermal and  electric energy flows in typical commercial and institutional  rooms to support (1) undergraduate study of basic physics and  engineering related to energy production and use, (2) student  experience with design of field investigations and deployment of  instrumentation, and (3) energy-related field projects for  upper-level undergraduates.",
