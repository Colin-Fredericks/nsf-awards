 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Stewart Novick of the Chemistry Department of   Wesleyan University will conduct a series of investigations on the   structures of transient free radicals by means of pulsed-jet Fabry-Perot   Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy using a new instrument   constructed at Wesleyan University.  Among the species to be studied are   those of chemical as well as astro-chemical interest.  Some   radical-containing van der Waals complexes will also be investigated.  A free radical may defined as a reactive transient molecular species in   the gas phase.  A more conventional definition is that of a molecule, or   molecular fragment, with one or more unpaired electrons.  These species   are highly reactive, elusive, hard to produce, and usually difficult to   study.  However, these radicals are extremely important, both as   intermediates in chemical reactions and as a species in their own right.    Many of the interstellar molecules that have been discovered by radio   astronomy  are, in fact, radicals.  Other radicals which can be produced   under laboratory conditions play a role as intermediates in organic   chemical reactions or, for example, as intermediates in commercial   deposition of thin metallic films.  The research conducted in this   project will provide information on the structure and ground state   electronic properties of an important group of radicals and thus provide   better understanding for their possible use in chemical processes.",
