 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aldenderfer    Under the direction of Dr.Mark Aldenderfer, Ms. Karen Rasmussen  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  one season of excavation at the archaeological site of Yara which  is located on the desert coast of Peru. Previous work at the site  indicates that it was occupied during the Middle Archaic period,  between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago. The density and configuration  of the remains suggests that Yara may have been occupied on a  long term basis and Ms. Rasmussen will examine this possibility.  She will excavate two large horizontal blocks, one centering on a  domestic area and the other around a possible cemetery. This  should permit exposure of such items as house floors, fire  hearths, storage areas and other indicators of a potential long-  term residential center. The site contains abundant faunal as  well as other cultural remains and Ms. Rasmussen will analyze  both.    After the end of the last Ice Age, human social organization in  many parts of the world was characterized by increased  sedentarization and the appearance of communities occupied for  extended periods of time. Most often this change is associated  with the appearance of agriculture and/or the herding of domestic  animals; archaeologists postulate that the appearance of these  new and rich food resources was responsible for the change in  settlement pattern. However the coast of Peru appears to be an  exception since sedentary communities seem to have emerged well  before domesticates became available. Ms. Rasmussen, as well as  many other archaeologists, want to understand what made this  transition possible and her excavation at Yara is directed  towards this end.    This research is important because it will provide data of  interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of how complex society emerged and will contribute  to the training of a promising young scientist.",
