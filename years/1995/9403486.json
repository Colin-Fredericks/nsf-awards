This project will establish cooperative research  to advance the genetic manipulation of garlic (Allium  Sativum L.) in vitro and in plants. The research will  perfect and expand true garlic seed production and develop  methods of garlic cell culture and genetic transformation.    Garlic, which is an important vegetable crop the world over,  has been domesticated for thousands of years but sexual  reproduction has been unknown.  Generation of sexual  recombinants is limited.  Because a system of genetic  transformation has not been developed which would allow  foreign genes to be introduced, a virus-free garlic can be  produced, but viral genes for cross-protection cannot be  inserted.    The U.S. researcher's work has enabled sexual reproduction  and evaluation of variation in garlic, while the Brazilian  researchers have worked extensively with garlic cell culture  and plant production.  The two sides will  exchange their  expertise and complementary skills to generate new garlic  variation from sexual reproduction and develop a system for  introducing foreign genes into garlic.    The research will be accomplished through an exchange of  visits between the U. Wisconsin  Agricultural Research  Service and EMBRAPA.      ***",
