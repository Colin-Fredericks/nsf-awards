The workshop is being organized by Dr. Mary Palm of the  Mycological Society of America and Dr. Joaquin Cifuentes  Blanco of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM,  in Mexico City.    Mexico, the U.S., and Canada are undergoing rapid changes,  central to which is a pressing need for devising and  implementing concepts of sustainability into economic  practices.  Fungi are key to sustainability in agricultural,  forest and wild-land management.  The goals for this  workshop are to facilitate an exchange of ideas and  experiences, analyze current practices, and chart future  projects of mutual interest, concentrating on the role of  mycology in sustainable development.  Panelists will present  each country's perspective as well as regional concerns.  Among the expected outcomes of the workshop will be written  proceedings available in printed and electronic format with  each participant's overview, as well as information on  anticipated collaborations and future goals .  ***",
