 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three items that would become components of our expanding  molecular biology/biotechnology and environmental biology  programs are solicited. These items are an automated DNA  sequencer, a DNA synthesizer and a filmless autoradiography  system. These tools for the synthesis of DNA and the  analysis and quantitation of nucleic acids and proteins will  extend research capabilities in numerous areas. A core of 12  research laboratories would directly benefit from the  acquisition of this equipment. This core includes members  from both the molecular biology/ biotechnology and the  environmental biology programs in the department. A major  Departmental priority has been to forge collaborations among  these diverse research interests. It has become clear that  the key to integrating these programs is molecular analysis.    The molecular biologists routinely require nucleic acid  sequence data for characterizing genes and verifying  constructs. In addition these researchers must precisely  quantify mRNA and protein levels to investigate gene  regulation, and must synthesize oligonucleotides to  manipulate specific DNA sequences. We also have an expanding  environmental biology program that has strengths in  conservation and population biology. The investigators of  this program are relying increasingly on the power and  resolution offered by molecular techniques. The problem  encountered by population biologists is that the large  sample sizes and extensive array of markers often required  for these studies have restricted the wide scale use of  laborious and expensive molecular techniques.    The proposed equipment would be used jointly by both the  molecular biology/ biotechnology and the environmental  biology segments of our department. The equipment would  serve as a focal point to foster collaborative and  integrative research efforts. These projects range from  basic research on gene regulation to studies of population  dynamics and conservation genetics. The efficiency of these  projects would  be increased and all would be expanded and  strengthened by the acquisition. The instrumentation would  also have a significant impact on our environmental biology,  biotechnology and molecular biology research training  capabilities.",
