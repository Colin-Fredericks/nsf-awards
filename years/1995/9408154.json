 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication systems employing antenna arrays are required in  situations where multiple co-channel signals are present  simultaneously.  The spatial discrimination provided by multiple  antenna elements allows spectrally overlapping signals to be  individually extracted.  While such systems have typically been  proposed in the context of military applications, a number of  important commercial applications have recently gained attention.   In particular, it has been proposed that antenna arrays be used in  land-based mobile radio systems to provide enhanced spatial  discrimination and hence increased capacity.  Such arrays could  potentially provide frequency reuse in adjacent cells, or within a  communication cell itself.    This research is examining signal copy, interference cancellation,  and source localization using antenna arrays, with particular  emphasis on scenarios that might be encountered in mobile radio  communications (e.g., multipath fading environments, certain signal  formats such as analog FM IS-3 AMPS, GSM, IS-54 offset QPSK, IS-95  CDMA, etc.).  A focus of this research is the development and  analysis of algorithms that exploit all available temporal and  spatial information.  Conventional techniques for direction finding  (DF) and signal copy (SC) rely on either spatial or temporal  structure in the data, but typically not both.  In situations where  both array response data and information about the signal structure  is available, it is obviously suboptimal to ignore either.   Consequently, several different techniques that exploit both  spatial and temporal signal structure for improved DF/SC will be  studies: iterative blindleast-squares; decision directed algorithms  array-based equalization of multipath channels; and optimal joint  DF/SC with parametric array uncertainty.  Finally, special emphasis  will be placed in this research on the use f real mobile cellular  radio data to test the effectiveness of the algorithms developed.",
