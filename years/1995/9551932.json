 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's engineering colleges must attract, retain, and  accommodate the various learning styles of a diverse student  body, including more women, underrepresented minorities, older  students, and part-time students than ever before.   Doing so  requires the development of improved teaching methods and  restructured curricula.   Modern information technology,  especially interactive multimedia, shows great promise for  supporting improvements in teaching and curricula directed at  meeting this goal.   For that promise to be fulfilled, faculty  must see how instructional technology can be used creatively and  effectively, and the resources for using it in lecture halls,  classrooms, and study halls must be readily accessible to faculty  and students.   At this school, over the past several years,  faculty interest and expertise in multimedia courseware have  developed to the extent that current teaching facilities will no  longer support the demand for either developing or delivering  such courseware.   The equipment acquired for this project is  creating the facilities to allow faculty to move to the next  level of instructional technology, undertaking substantially more  extensive and sophisticated courseware development projects than  they can now.   Funds are being used to equip, first, a  multimedia courseware studio and, second, an interactive  multimedia classroom which will be open long hours and also be  used as a multimedia study hall when not scheduled for group and  section meetings.   The immediate audience for this project  includes faculty and undergraduates in all departments at the  College of Engineering.   Through electronic publishing (via the  NEEDS Database and World Wide Web), the courseware being  developed will ultimately be available to engineering faculty and  students throughout the world.",
