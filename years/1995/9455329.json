 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planetary exploration captures the imagination and interest  o students having both science and non-science backgrounds  and aspirations.  Current textbooks that simply present a  few pictures from planetary missions fail to capitalize on  the potential for utilizing the excitement of planetary  exploration as a theme for learning about physical processes  and the methods of science.  The project is developing a  curriculum that will build upon the appeal of space  exploration to promote interest in science and to teach  modern methods of scientific investigation and discovery.  It uses a hands-on approach in exploring processes which  shape planetary worlds using actual spacecraft images and  existing Macintosh computers.  Through a set of exercises,  students learn that scientific images are no longer pictures  in books.  Instead, modern scientific images are digital  objects that can be manipulated and examined in quantitative  detail.  Spacecraft images are used to motivate scientific  inquiry but the curriculum also emphasizes that digital  imaging is becoming inherent to all areas of beyond science.  The new curriculum involving digital imaging will be  incorporated into our introductory level classes which  attract a broad cross section of science and non-science  students.  These students should carry their scientific and  digital imaging experience with them as new tools in their  pursuit of majors and careers in all areas of science,  engineering, medicine, humanities, and education.  Because  the curriculum is at the introductory science level and uses  both images and software available in the public domain (for  both Macintosh and PCs), these exercises can be available  for wide use in other colleges, universities, and high  schools.",
