Annual Symposium, entitled \"Carbon Partitioning and Source-Sink Interactions in Plants,\" to be held January 19-21, 1995.  It is organized by Professor Monica A. Madore, Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, UCR, and Professor William J. Lucas, Section of Plant Biology, Divison of Biological Sciences, University of California, Davis.    The objective of the 1995 Symposium is to bring together scientists working in the area of carbon partitioning and plant source-sink interactions, with the intention that the presentations, and the discussions arising from them, will lead to a greater understanding of the cellular, physiological, and genetic aspects of plant carbon metabolism.  Speakers from abroad and from other insititutions, including many young investigators who have introduced innovative molecular approaches to the study of carbon partitioning, will be invited to participate.  Poster presentations will also be included in the program.  The presented papers, as well as poster abstracts, will be published rapidly.",
