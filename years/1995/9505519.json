 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with both theoretical and prototyping  research  in parallel processing to harness the power of workstation  clusters.  The primary techniques will based on aggressive  scheduling, evasive memory and  dispersed data management.  The  formal work expands the previous results of the  PIs in  asynchronous computing in several directions:   (1)  Extend the models  to models of fine-grained programs.  (2)  Permit the inclusion of architecture  specific  characteristics into theoretical frameworks.  (3)  Techniques to  distinguish inconsistencies in memory states  as viewed by different processors  resulting from time-outs,  interrupts and failures (or indefinite postponement  of a  computation). (4)  Techniques to allow non-deterministic executions.  (5)  Model input/output operations of fault-tolerant programs.    The experimental  part of the project will build a scaled version  to execute parallel programs on  clusters of workstations.  The  prototype will address issues related to the  eager scheduling of  threads, the implementation of evasive memory and data  management.  The prototype will attempt to evaluate the  effectiveness of the  environment in terms of efficiency.    This project is conducted jointly by P.  Dasgupta of Arizona State  University and Z. Kedem, of New York University.",
