 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award will initiate a new theoretical research  program to study issues connected with the design of the  next generation of acoustic gravitational wave detectors  designed to operate at high frequency.  Data analysis  techniques that properly account for detector noise will be  adapted to the truncated isocahedral gravitational antenna   TIGA  design.  These techniques will be used to evaluate  several astrophysically relevant high-frequency  gravitational radiation sources, including  but not limited  to  the final burst of radiation from the coalescence of a  binary neutron star or stellar mass black hole system,  supernovae explosions, precessing pulsars, and general non  axisymmetric pulsars.    An educational program is proposed that focuses on  communicating to non-science students the nature of  scientific inquiry and the manner in which it is conducted.  The vehicle for this program is an astronomy course that  fulfills a university distribution requirement.  Computer  laboratories will be constructed that will allow students  to, for example, determine the age of a star cluster by  examining the distribution of stars within it, or calibrate  the distance scale and find the Hubble constant and age of a  model universe.  In addition, a novel evaluation and study  aid - concept maps - will be introduced into the same  course.  A concept is an object  e.g., star, planet, galaxy,  black hole  or an event  e.g., eclipse, nova, sidereal  year .  New concepts come to be understood in terms of their  relationships with concepts previously known.  Deeper  understanding of concepts already known corresponds to the  construction of new relationships between them.  A concept  map is a graphical representation of the concepts and the  relationships among them that a student has come to  recognize.",
