 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence both from time production experiments (in which a person attempts to respond at an appropriate time) and time perception experiments (in which a person attempts to accurately estimate a duration) will be obtained to provide data regarding the small, but systematic, deviations from perfect accuracy that occur. These discrepancies are likely to be related to the duration being timed, and to be similar for various different timing tasks. The quantitative features of this nonlinear representation of time (which is called the `oscillator signature`) will be used to identify a multiple-oscillator mechanism for time perception and production. The effects of various independent variables (such as perturbations and adapting stimuli) on the oscillator signature will be identified; the oscillator signatures obtained with various perceptual and motor tasks will be compared.  In addition, individual differences in oscillator signatures will be assessed; periodic phenomena that may be responsible for the oscillator signature will be identified; and alternative quantitative models of the oscillator signature will be evaluated.  Although psychological time appears to change in an approximately linear way with physical time, the small systematic deviations of psychological time from exact linearity with physical time provide a way to identify the biological mechanism responsible for time perception. The major hypothesis is that timing is made possible by many normally occurring periodic biological phenomena.",
