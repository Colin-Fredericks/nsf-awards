 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417359  Benson    The research to be carried out will include making BVRI observations of  supernovae, novae, and variable stars with a Photometrics NU200  Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) camera on the Wellesley College 24\" Boller  and Chivens telescope.  Observations will be made on most clear nights.   The image reduction and photometry will be done with the IRAF software  data reduction package.  Further analysis will be done by using  spreadsheets software programs.  A database of observations will be  kept.  For most objects, differential light curves will be made of the  stars.  For objects with calibrated fields, standard magnitudes of the  objects observed will be calculated.  These observations are a  continuation of a program begun about two years ago.  Light curves of  the objects observed will be published when appropriate.    The objectives of the research program are to 1), improve the quantity  of well-sampled light curves of supernovae, especially in the R and I  bands; 2), provide well-sampled multicolor light curves of galactic  novae; 3), correct classifications and periods for several variable  stars; 4), improve the knowledge of light curves and search for  outbursts or dimming of symbiotic and RCB stars; and 5) improve the  human resources base of women in science.    There are very few supernovae light curves that have been observed with  standard B, V, R, and I filters and thus have well-sampled light  curves.  Recent observations of supernovae, which have well sampled  light curves, seem to indicate that there is more variation in  intensity of their light than previously recognized.  Since supernovae  are often used as standard candles to determine the distances to other  galaxies, it is important to identify each kind of supernova, and to  have well-calibrated samples of the various types.  Many stars listed  in the General Catalog of Variable Stars have incomplete information  about them.  Many of these stars will be observed and monitored.  At  least two misclassificat ions have already been discovered.  It is  important to monitor symbiotic stars in order to understand the  interactions between the stars as well as to catch outbursts from  interactions as they begin, in order to obtain observations in other  wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum during outbursts.   Similarly, RCB stars need to be monitored in order to detect dust  events when they occur.  Lastly, many of the observations will be made  by female undergraduates at Wellesley College.  They will learn the  procedures for data acquisition, processing by using the IRAF software,  and analysis of the light curves of various stars and supernovae.   Although some of the participating students may not be majoring in  science, they will learn how science is done.  It is valuable to have a  scientific literate society.",
