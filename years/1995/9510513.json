 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510513 Olson  This work is supported by a Research Planning  Grant for Women  Scientists and Engineers Award. The purpose of  the proposed  research is to shed light on the behavior of  mixtures of materials,  particularly in cases where anisotropy or  nonlinear behavior plays  an important role. Effective medium  theories and the self-consistent  approximations have been  successfully used to pridict behavior of  mixtures in linear and  isotropic situations. New approximations are  proposed which  circumvent some of the drawbacks of the effective  medium  theories. An average energy approach rather than an  average  stress approach will be used.   The National Science Foundations  mandate to ensure the vitality of  the Nations scientific  enterprise includes concern for the quality,  composition,  distribution and effectiveness of the human resource  base in  science and engineering.  Within this context, the Foundation  is  committed to enhancing the current rate of participation of women   in science and engineering careers, in general, and as active   participants in all of its programs.  Research Planning Grant  awards  are made: (1) to help increase the number of new women   investigators participating in NSFs research programs; and, (2)  to  facilitate preliminary studies and other activities related  to the  development of competitive research projeats and  proposals by  women who have not previously had independent  Federal research  funding.  Research Planning Grants are one-time  awards that may be  used for preliminary work to determine the  feasibility of a proposed  line of inquiry, and/or for other  activities that will facilitate proposal  development.",
