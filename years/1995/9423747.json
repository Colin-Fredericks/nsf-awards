 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423747  Zeng  This is an extension to the VELACS (Verification of Liquefaction  Analysis by Centrifuge Studies) project, the purpose of which was  to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the existing  numerical and constitutive models used in the analysis of soil  liquefaction.  The motivation is to resolve the difficulties  encountered in the Class A predictions of VELACS, and to isolate  the main cause of these difficulties.    VELACS revealed that the current procedures used for the analysis  of geotechnical structures are not suitable, in general, for  predicting the consequences of soil liquefaction.  Some of the  most promising procedures available for the analysis of soil  liquefaction and its consequences will be identified in this  project.  A series of carefully-performed triaxial and torsional  tests are to be conducted and carefully examined, so as to  provide a small but reliable data base.  These data will be used  for the calibration of constitutive models, which in turn will be  used for a Class A prediction exercise of two centrifuge model  experiments.  The predictions will be compared with the  experimental results, and reasons for potential discrepancies  will be discussed.  Multiple checks for reliability will be  conducted in an effort to isolate reasons for the lack of  reliable predictions of the experiments already considered in the  VELACS project.  ***",
