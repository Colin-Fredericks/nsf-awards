The goal is to train students to use what  they learn to examine all that they see and as a result, to  question. The fundamental idea is to create a suite of simple  experiments which can be done in the home and assigned like  homework problems. Such simple, but elegant experiments are dubbed  Hands-On-Homework (HOH) which:  * encourages students to use engineering theory to explain everyday  phenomena, and to compare their observations to theoretical  prediction;  * provides open-ended opportunities to explore engineering  questions using readily available materials and familiar  experiences;  * trains students to conduct \"reality checks\" and naturally apply  theoretical analysis to experimental observations; and  * provides continuous opportunities for students to empirically  explore engineering questions throughout their college careers and  develop habits contpibuting to life long learning.  This project is tied to curriculum changes planned for the new  Integrated Teaching Laboratory. Hands-On Homework is liberally  sprinkled throughout the entire curriculum, primarily in the first  three years, including introductory mathematics and physics  courses. Initial disciplinary courses such as statics, dynamics,  thermodynamics, and circuits benefit, as well as more advanced  courses such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, control theory, or  materials.  HOH problems are piloted in two courses while doing an  outreach to identify further courses. Evaluation is done by holding  consensus groups during the semester and comparing performance of  students with and without HOH. Results will be presented at  meetings and reviews. Ultimately, a user's guide will be produced  containing all the Hands-On-Homeworks as well as the performance  evaluations.  Because HOH's are low-cost, they can be easily rep-  licated and the results of the project widely exported.",
