 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research in methods and tools  for  performance prediction of parallel programs.  The goal is a tool  set that  incorporates general and accurate methods to predict the  performance of a  parallel application in advance of its  execution.  The approach taken is based  on prior work that has  built tools to measure the performance of parallel  programs  (Predicate Profiling) and automatically construct performance  models  of existing applications (Lost Cycles Analysis).  While  the prior work has  relied principally on dynamic whole-program  analysis, this research will add  static analysis techniques and  apply dynamic tools to program fragments.  By  applying those  tools to program fragments, the research seeks a flexible method  for the performance prediction of alternative program structures.  The resulting  tool is expected to aid computational scientists  attempting to tune the  performance of programs running on high  performance, massively parallel  architectures.    The educational component of this CAREER award addresses  course  development and teaching of parallel processing for  undergraduates,  performance measurement and prediction for  graduate students, and a new  approach to introductory computer  science for freshmen.",
