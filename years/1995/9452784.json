With Culver Productions as a base of operations,  the development process will involve a known group of science  educators including Global Rivers Environmental Education Network  (GREEN), University of Michigan, and Paradyme Productions.   Students will identify problems based on watching a video  documentary that presents opposing facts and opinions and then  navigate through a rich database of video, text, graphics, GIS  maps, and simulations to develop startegies to solve problems.   Students will be guided through telecommunications to communicate  with other schools, contact public officials, or retrieve  government documents to develop their strategy.  Final results will  be evident in many forms including active debates and verbal  communications, hands-on research, and custom produced multimedia  presentations.  The curriculum, \"Without Water,\" will help teach  students the role citizens play in the health of society and the  earth.",
