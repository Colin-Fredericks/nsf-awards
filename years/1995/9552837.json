 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9552837  Beachy  One of the great challenges in  biology today is to determine the  functions of proteins and other  macromolecules in the context of  their three-dimensional structures.  This challenge defines the frontier  of research for a variety of  biological questions, including  many in plant biology. To train the  next generation of scientists in  this multidisciplinary area, a  research and training program has  been created at The Scripps  Research Institute. We are  requesting support to provide  training for PhD students pursuing  research problems in macromolecule  structure in Plant Biology as a  formal component of this PhD  program. An integral portion of the  training program will be the  identification of qualified  students of underrepresented  minorities through established  linkages with two campuses in the  California State University system,  i.e., Los Angeles and San Diego  State University, and with the San  Diego Plant Science Center. These  students will participate in  research programs that include  structural and functional analyses  of macromolecules involved in key  aspects of plant biology. Our  faculty includes a diverse group of  innovative plant biologists whose  research requires collaborations  with leading experts in the  analysis of molecular structure by  x-ray crystallography, NMR  spectroscopy. The Fellows sponsored  by this program will enable these  collaborations.",
