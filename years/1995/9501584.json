 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major focus of this research is to develop a general   ``industrial strength'' mixed integer programming (MIP) code   with  parallel  distributed computing capability --- in particular, a  code   that allows parallel  execution on clusters of personal  computers or various types   of workstation  platforms.    A second focus of the research is to explore   new applications of  mixed integer programming to problems in discriminant   analysis.  A recently  developed MIP model of a problem in discriminant  analysis   opens up a new avenue  for approaching this important  area of statistics.  The   polyhedral structure of  this class of  problems is being investigated, and efficient   strategies to solve real instances are being developed.    In   conjunction with the  research plan, a concerted effort is being  expended to   arouse more interest in  mathematical programming  (especially integer programming)   and its computational  aspects  among engineering students.  New courses/seminars on    linear algebra, parallel computation and mixed  integer   programming are  planned.  In addition, an effort  is being made to establish   interaction with  industry, thereby  exposing students to important issues in   building and  analyzing  models for real-world problems and in deriving and   solutions.",
