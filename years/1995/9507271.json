Evans MIT, Department of Urban Studies and Planning  Dissertation Improvement  Research: A Case Study of Infrastructures for Sharing Geographic Information Among Environmental  Agencies  This project seeks to determine why so few environmental agencies, not in the business of  providing environmental data,  share geographic information, despite the need to collaborate in  protecting shared natural resources and the recent growth of networked information facilities.  Initial studies suggest the reasons are a still-unclear combination of both technical and non-  technical factors.  An in-depth case study will analyze and compare four `coalitions` of government  agencies in the U.S. that are building `sharing infrastructures` to exchange environmental data and  use it meaningfully.  The study will search for impacts of networked-shared information on the work of  environmental managers, then determine and compare the intent, design, and architecture of the  `sharing infrastructures,` and the quality and quantity of shared information that has resulted.  The  study will focus t he development of technical solutions to information sharing, evaluate present-day  networks for information sharing, and highlight effective organizational strategies and technological  growth paths for information-based collaboration.",
