 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the investigation of surface passivation technologies for use in compound semiconductor devices. Many current semiconductor devices are limited in performance by problems associated with surface-related defects.  Semiconductor laser diodes are especially sensitive to the presence of surface defects. SDL proposes an innovative passivation technique to substantially reduce surface defects in compound semiconductor devices. The proposed technology passivates and seals the semiconductor surface to prevent degradation via surface oxidation. The surface passivation technology developed during this program will have a significant impact in both optoelectronic and electronic compound semiconductor devices. Furthermore, the development of a high quality passivation technology by a U.S. manufacturer will significantly benefit U.S. competitiveness in the face of intense foreign investment and competition.",
