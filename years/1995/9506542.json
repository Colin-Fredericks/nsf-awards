Fossum University of Washington  Dissertation Improvement  Research: Flexible Specialization and Specialty Wood Products in the Rural Northwest   This project  identifies several groups of specialty wood products producers in a four-state Northwest region and  examines firm behavior within and between clusters.  The study will develop important empirical  knowledge about the shape of flexible specialization in this prominent rural industry and lead to the  development of theory relevant to the conditions found in the Northwest wood products industry.  Most  recent research on flexible specialization has concentrated on  change in urban mass production  industries.  This proposal examines how clusters of rural firms may be generating collective  efficiencies.  The goal is to make a significant contribution to understanding the nature of  industrial diversification in this peripheral and largely non-industrialized region in this age of  industrial flexibility.",
