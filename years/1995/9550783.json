 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem addressed by this project is the outdated limiting  experiences students receive in animal and human learning, animal  cognition, and comparative psychology.   The problem is  pedagogical in the sense that students' exposure to animal  research, a benchmark in psychological science, is not  contemporary.   The problem is theoretical because research  involving complex visual and auditory stimuli cannot be  conducted.   It is methodological because human studies of  operant phenomena, a source of controversy in the literature, are  not easily conducted.   It is academic because the proper  methods, statistics, and design issues pertinent to a  contribution to laboratory sciences are not possible.   The  objective is to provide flexible, powerful learning stations to  study a range of species, a variety of visual and auditory  stimuli, and a range of responses including ones directed toward  the stimuli.   Restructuring solves the pedagogical, theoretical,  methodological, and academic problems the old laboratory faces.    Special audiences targeted for the project include students in  Introductory Psychology and in a variety of midlevel and advanced  courses and independent studies in Biological and Behavioral  Processes.",
