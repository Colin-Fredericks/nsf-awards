 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550540  Lochhead     Building on the successful development of four challenge-enhanced, replacement  science curriculum units for grade 9-12, the aim of this project is to create and publish 12 units that use design challenges while still emphasizing the learning of science concepts.   Design and Technology for Science includes challenges that involve biology, physical science, physics, integrated sciences, and technology education topics.  The curriculum focuses upon selective process skills:  information-gathering, designing, and planning and conducting experiments.  The units address national Standards and teach integrated science-technology in a work-related context useful both in academic and vocational programs.  The units can be used flexibly by teachers who are creating science and technology courses and by technology education teachers who want to experiment with  open-ended, constructivist-based materials that emphasize the acquisition of science concepts.  Optional low technology activities support the use of microcomputer-based laboratory equipment in the classroom as well as the use of graph-generating spreadsheets to collect and display data.  Thus, students take on the role of scientists and engineers as they experience hypothesis generating-testing and design cycles in real-world settings, and engage in tasks that integrate a wide range of scientific and technology-oriented skills and concepts.",
