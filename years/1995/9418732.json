 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418732  Stacey    This award supports the participation of six U.S. scientists in a U.S.-  Japan seminar on Molecular, Physiological, and Ecological Aspects  of Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation, to be held at Kagoshima University,  Kagoshima, Japan in October 1995.  The co-organizers are Dr. Gary  Stacey of the University of Tennessee and Dr. Shiro Higashi of  Kagoshima University  Both the U.S. and Japan are supporting major  efforts in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and interaction between the  research groups of both countries will accelerate progress.  The  seminar topic areas encompass both the plant host and bacterial  counterpart in the symbiotic nitrogen fixing interaction, as well as  topics ranging from enzymology, molecular genetics, plant cell  biology, whole plant physiology, ecology, and ultimately to plant  genetics and crop production.    This meeting is the third in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field held over a period of 10 years.  Although a core of individuals  has provided continuity from meeting to meeting, participants in the  seminars have changed through the years to reflect an appropriate  pairing between U.S. and Japanese participants and the progress of the  research.  The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of  expertise and geographical representation in the overall area of  symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and were selected on the basis of being  the most active researchers in the U.S.  Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
