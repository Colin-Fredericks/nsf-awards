 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522314    The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve (Wells NERR)  is part of a national system created to promote and support  estuarine research.  It is the sole on-site research  facility for the study of marsh dominated estuarine  ecosystems on the Gulf of Marine coast, and its site  encompasses estuarine ecosystems of such systems from Cape  Cod to Maine's mid-coast.  It contains one of the few  undeveloped barrier beaches in Maine and two marsh dominated  estuaries, one nearly pristine, the other in use as a harbor  and surrounded by development.  The Reserve has a Research  Program that is growing to meet the pressing need for  estuarine research in the Gulf of Maine region.    The Wells NERR is a partnership between governmental and  private entities.  A unique feature of the NERR program is  that research and resource management work together, so that  new research findings will be used to guide management of  coastal resources.  The Wells NERR has fulfilled many of the  research objectives set out in its first Management  Plan,  which was approved in 1990.  It is beginning to work on a  major revision of its Management Plan this year.  The  Research Program is cooperating with this effort.  The  research director will work with an independent panel of  scientist, herein called the Research Planning and Review  Committee, to review and develop the long-term goals of the  program and formulate achievable objectives for the next  five years, including establishment of a university  affiliation.    After the planning activities and conference are completed,  the Wells NERR will make the necessary changes that will  allow it to establish its place in the research community  and meet the demand for ecological research focused on marsh  dominated estuaries in the Gulf of Maine.",
