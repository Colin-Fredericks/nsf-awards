 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421881  VEBLEN       The influence of climate variation on vegetation are most  evident at coarse spatial and temporal scales.  The effects of  climate change on vegetational dynamics have been less clear at  time scales of decades to a few centuries, however.  Foremost  among the issues that have hindered research at this scale are  problems in separating climate-related from human-induced changes  and methodological problems in spatial and temporal scaling.  One  line of research that has offered great promise are analyses of  the role of fire as a factor influencing vegetation change at  scales ranging from local to regional.  This project will  continue collaborations by U.S. and Argentine scientists, who  have been studying the impacts of climate and human activities on  fire regimes in northern Patagonia over the last 700 to 1,000  years.  Past research by these investigators have focused on a  single transect ranging from Andean rainforests to Patagonian  steppes.  This research documented the influences of humans on  fire regimes over the last 250 years, and it analyzed the  influences of seasonal and annual climate variations on fire  regimes.  The research to be supported through this award will  expand on this base.  Research methods that will be used include  the dendrochronological dating of past fires, climatic  reconstructions through analyses of tree rings, analyses of fire-  regime variations over at least 700 years in relation to climatic  variation, and evaluation of archeological and historical data  focusing on human influences on fire regimes.  These analyses  will be conducted in three different study areas (at 38-, 41-,  and 43-degrees South latitude), which have different histories of  human occupation but common regional climatic variations.  As a  result, human impacts should be distinguishable from broader-  scale climatic influences on fire regimes.       This research will complement previous research on the  dynamics of fire regimes by incorporating the effects of  climate  variation across a broad range of temporal scales and by  broadening the geographic perspective to a regional scale.  This  integration will be a significant contribution to the challenge  of relating research on local-scale processes to climatic and  human influences on vegetation at landscape and regional scales.",
