 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives are in two areas.    The first is  that of one-rule semi-Thue systems, which are of  interest in the general topic  of theorem proving by machine.  The  research problem is to   determine a decision procedure that distinguishes whether    or not a given system is uniformly terminating; that  is, to tell  whether or not every derivation in the given system terminates.  The second area is that of infinite games; that is, games that  are conceived of  as being played by two players over an infinite  amount of time.  This area is  of interest in the general topic of  making assertions in formal logics about  the running of programs,  and, therefore, in the general topic of concurrency  control.  There are tow major research problems:               (I) To develop  the concept of the infinite game in the  setting of a board and pieces (like  many parlor  games).  The purpose is to make the game concept  more applicable  to computer science, by making it  more intuitively intelligible;  (ii) To develop a usable and justifiable method for  declaring a winner of an  infinite game after a  finite amount of time.",
