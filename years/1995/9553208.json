 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553208  Hering    This is an award to provide support for research on the mobility  and reactivity of trace metals in natural waters and soils and  the removal of trace inorganic contaminants by water treatment  processes.  This research is a continuation of work she has been  conducting under National Science Foundation Young Investigator  Award No. 92-58431.  The teaching component of this award  addresses her observation that a serious deficiency exists in  education of students in chemistry and integration of this  exposure into undergraduate civil and environmental engineering  courses.  Her plan includes development of a one-year  introductory chemistry course that introduces students to  concepts from physical, inorganic and organic chemistry that have  applicability to environmental engineering practice.    This is the initial increment of an award to provide support for  this Presidential Faculty Fellow who was selected through  evaluation procedures conducted by the National Science  Foundation and based on criteria contained in NSF 94-134 which  contains the nomination guidelines, review procedures and award  conditions.  Factors that control the transport and fate of  pollutants in aqueous systems are of interest because of the role  they play in controlling the movement and fate of pollutants  through aquifers, in treatment processes and natural systems.  Results of this research are expected to be applied in  engineering design of water supply, water treatment and pollution  abatement systems.",
