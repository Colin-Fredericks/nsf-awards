The 11th Affinity Chromatography and Biological Recognition Symposium, May 25 31, 1995  will be held in San Antonio, Texas, on the carnpus of Trinity University. This award will cover travel and living expenses forfive to eight predominantly younger investigators (age 35 and under). The Conference will rebate that portion of the fee above the cost of room and meals. A special four hour session will be devoted to talks from younger investigators from around the world, including those from the USA delegation, whose abstracts are accepted for oral presentation. Poster sessions will be required of all NSF sponsored younger investigators. The younger investigators will be required to submit a manuscript on their work, which, after appropriate review, will be published in both the Journal for Molecular Recognition and a special Proceedings volume. %%%  Affinity chromatography is critical for the development and utilization of the many advances that have been made in such fields as recombinant DNA and other biotechnology techniques which are blossoming through research laboratories world w ide. In addition, it provides an excellent resource for studying the interaction between biomolecules in protein protein interactions and polymerization processes, and the determination of substrate binding mechanisms for various enzymes, to list only a few applications of affinity techniques. Most significantly, affinity chromatography is the chief method used in the final purification of many enzymes and proteins, many of which have significant agricultural and therapeutic importance. The techniques have developed exponentially over the past few years and are present in virtually every issue of any major biochemical journal. For the promise of biotechnology to be realized, protein and nucleic acid purification using affinity chromatography techniques needs to be further developed and honed to their finest extent.                                 @                                                                                                                                                       ....()()))()()                                                                          ;                                                         Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       marcia steinberg                    marcia steinberg            @       k                           @                                   @      ?
