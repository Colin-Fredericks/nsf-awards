 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528888  Vernon-Gerstenfeld      This is an award to support a project the objective of which is  to determine the progress toward the application of two concepts  for management of wastewater treatment residues and to identify  further research needed to address issues that have precluded  their more widespread adoption in environmental engineering  practice.  The concepts to be studied include use of ionizing  radiation for disinfection of residuals and the use of these  residuals in production of ceramic building materials.   This  project, as was the prior one in 1988, will be conducted through  the Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Washington Project Center.    Since the prior study in 1988, there has been a strong movement  toward recycling of used materials to minimize impact of their  processing and disposal on environmental quality.  Three  undergraduate students will assist the Principal Investigator on  this project to fulfill the requirement of their having conducted  an Interactive Qualifying Project that links science, engineering  and technology to societal needs and concerns.  Results are  expected to assist in providing a basis for determination of  research needs and thus be useful for program planning purposes.",
