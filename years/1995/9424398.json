 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relatively new field of computational geometry has  developed  at an accelerating rate in the past few years. The   problems that  it  encompasses cover a wide range of applications, such as   motion  planning and  computer graphics, and their solution often involves  the use   of sophisticated  techniques drawn from many branches of  mathematics and   theoretical computer  science. Prior work includes  extensive contributions to many   basic and applied  problems in the  area, including motion planning, hidden   surface removal and  related visibility problems, combinatorial and algebraic   analysis  of  arrangements of curves and algebraic surfaces, randomized    algorithms for linear  programming and other optimization  problems, etc.    The   purpose of this  research is to  continue the work in these fields  and  to extend it into new core areas in  computational geometry.  A  major portion of the research is   devoted to the  study of  arrangements of curves and surfaces.      Specifically, the following  problems are being studied:    1. Combinatorial and   algorithmic problems related  to  substructures (lower envelopes, single cells, zones,   etc.) in  arrangements  of surfaces in higher dimensions.    2. Related algorithms in   real algebraic  geometry for computing  cells and road maps in semi-algebraic   sets.    3.  Combinatorial and algorithmic problems involving planar    arrangements of  segments or curves (also known as ``geometric  graphs''.    A   theme that is  manifest in this work is the rich cross-fertilization between   basic research  in computational geometry  and the various application areas,   where problems in  one area  motivate the study of new basic problems whose   solution in turn  finds  applications in many other areas.    Another theme is the   strong connection  between the combinatorial  analysis of substructures in   arrangements and the  design of  corresponding efficient algorithms for   constructing and utilizing  these structures.  Often the efficiency of such an algorithm    crucially depends  on the size of the structure to be computed,  and most of the   algorithm design  has to be devoted to the  combinatorial analysis of the   complexity of that  structure. These  considerations are reflected in the work   being done.",
