The project begins in 1995. It would also provide for 5 Saturday topical conferences in each of the two academic years.  During the workshops the teachers will:    improve their conceptual knowledge of their chemistry and physics;    learn how to integrate appropriate topics in chemistry and physics with the other sciences and mathematics and with science and technology issues;    become more proficient in the development and presentation of classroom activities for science instruction;    develop new teaching materials and strategies for teaching the physical sciences in middle schools;    become more familiar with the vast array of source materials available for teachers of middle school physical science;    Additional goals of the workshops are to:    develop networks of middle school and high school teachers within the Southern California region to provide on-going mutual support and assistance;    encourage teachers to pursue outreach activities to the community and to furnish them with the science demonstrations and supplies necessary to perform these activities.    The teachers will also have an opportunity to practice newly acquired teaching strategies and demonstrations with the middle school students in an associated Chemistry/Physics Camp.   The cost share of the project is 5% of the face value of Foundation support.",
