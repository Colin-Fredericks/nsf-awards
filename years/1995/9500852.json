 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500852 Arnold  The object of the proposed research is the  mathematical and numerical analysis of quantum kinetic equations  in solid state physics. We will first investigate relaxation-time  Wigner-Poisson models (quantum Boltzmann equation). The existence  and uniqueness analysis will be based on the reformulation of  this nonlinear evolution equation in terms of the density matrix  operator. The analysis of the large time behavior and the steady  states in thermodynamic equilibrium will be based on compactness  methods and a quantum entropy functional. Absorbing boundary  conditions for the 1D Wigner equation will be extended to 2D  situations, the coupled Wigner-Poisson and relaxation-time  models. The well- posedness analysis will be based on considering  the Wigner equation as a limit of finite dimensional hyperbolic  systems.   The models of quantum mechanical transport equations  have become the most important basis for accurate simulations of  novel, ultra-integrated semiconductor devices (quantum devices,  electron wave guides). A sound mathematical understanding of the  evolution equation will form the basis for numerical  implementations. The numerical simulation of hypersonic gas flows  around rigid objects (e.g., space shuttles in the high altitude  phase of their re-entry into the atmosphere) is usually  accomplished by numerically coupling two different transport  models . A refined coupling strategy is proposed here, which will  be equally relevant for gas dynamics applications, and for  efficient simulations of ultra-integrated semiconductor devices.  We will numerically compare it to existing coupling strategies  and investigate its stability.",
