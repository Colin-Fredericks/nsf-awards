 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422223  Mark  End linking of functionally-terminated polymer chains will  be used to obtain elastomers of known and controlled  structures.  Some will contain dangling-chain  irregularities, and others unimodal and multimodal  distributions of network chain-lengths.  Included will be  trimodal networks and unusually broad pseudo-unimodal  networks obtained by combining separately-prepared batches  of polysiloxanes of widely varying molecular weights.  Additional elastomers will be produced under conditions  giviing structures that are unusual in other respects, for  example by cross linking in solution or in a state of  strain.  Experiments will be performed for identifying  strain-induced crystallization, in elongation, biaxial  extension, shear, and torsion.  Simulations will also be  carried out to characterize the crystallization occurring in  some new polysiloxane chains of unusually high  stereoregularity.  Elastomeric gels will also be studied,  including some involved in processing techniques giving  liquid-crystalline polymers of enhanced orientation.  Gelation  kinetics will be studied, as will diffusion  coefficients of solvents into and out of swollen networks.  Novel reinforcing fillers will be prepared by the  hydrolysis, photolysis, or thermolysis of organometallic  materials such as silicates, titanates, zirconates,  aluminates, and simple metal salts such as ferric chloride.  Of particular importance will be identifying the particle  size that maximizes reinforcement, and characterizing the  effects of  particle shape.  The resulting filler-reinforced  elastomers will be characterized primarily by mechanical  property measurements, electron microsocpy, and by X-ray and  neutron scattering.  Simulations will also be carried to  elucidate reinforcing mechanisms in filler-reinforced  elastomers in general.  Finally, experiments will be carried  out to exploit the ability of elastomeric domains to improve  the impact resistance of polymer-ceramic hybrid composites  in which the cer amic is the continuous phase.  %%%  The primary significance of these projects is the  achievement of a better molecular understanding of  rubberlike elasticity and the ways in which fillers  reinforce elastomers.  The results should provide importance  guidance for producing elastomeric materials and elastomeric-  modified ceramics having unusaully attractive mechanical  properties.",
