 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research extends traditional public goods theory by  examining the connectivity and communality properties of  communication and information-based public goods.  This  pilot study supports the development of methods and  instruments to conduct a longitudinal examination of  communication and information-based public goods.  The  research is motivated by the specific example of a large  interorganizational computer-supported collaborative work  system.  This type of information-based collective action is  theorized to possess two properties that are uniquely  important to communication forms of collective goods:  connectivity and communality.  Marwell and Oliver's (1993)  theoretical framework integrates four characteristics of  public goods:  the good itself, individuals, the groups or  organizations involved with the good, and the action  process.  The research is designed to test hypotheses that  link collective action theory, communication and information  systems, and collaborative work processes and effects.",
