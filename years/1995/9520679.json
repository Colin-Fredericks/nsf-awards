 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520679  The  blue  oak  is  a keystone species in a  water  limiting  environment, and over much of its range in California,  this  tree  is  not  regenerating.   This  research  is  aimed  at  understanding  the  role  that  water  relations   play   in  determining  the  success of this tree.  The  research  will  compare vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation in  oaks  of  different ages.  It will determine the amount of genetic  variation  that exists in this trait, by comparing responses  of  seedlings produced by different parent trees.   Finally,  it will ascertain the importance of phenotypic plasticity in  modifying  response to different levels of moisture  stress.  The  research will increase understanding of the  mechanisms  and variability of response to drought induced cavitation in  woody plants.  Understanding of the phenotypic expression of  water-use traits, and knowledge of variation on temporal and  spatial scales should be of considerable value in developing  management  plans  for the conservation of  an  ecologically  important species.",
