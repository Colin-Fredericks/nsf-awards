 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to add excitation fluorescence spectroscopy  capability to present microspectrofluorometer with  capabilities for topographic and emission fluorescence  spectral scans. Thefluorescence excitation attachment will  be based on a spinning         multizone disk, prepared with  a series of alternate light and dark areas such that, as a  function of radius, there will be different numbers of  alternations at different distances from the center. As the  spectrum of the dispersion element is focused on the disk,  it will be modulated (coded) according to wavelength (i.e.  excitation wavelength interval divided into n 100  nm  bands). The resulting coded excitation light falls on the  object  to be studied. Thus it will be possible to build an  excitation-emission matrix (EEMS) of the fluorescence, a  powerful method to study  complex  multi-emission  spectra.  Both  the  theory and practice of building such EEMS has  been tested, the latter in cultured fibroblasts treated with  the fluorescent carcinogenic hydrocarbon  benzo(a)pyrene  -  (BP).  It  is  proposed  that  the usefulness  and  applications  of  the  proposed  apparatus  be  investigated in fibroblasts treated with BP metabolized  through the cytochrome P450 detoxification system,  daunorubicin extruded through the P-glycoprotein-mediated  MDR (multidrug-resistance) pathway, or a fluorescent  molecule such as mMSA. The observed         excitation-  emission  changes  may  relate  to  intracellular  metabolization, interactions, binding or quenching of the  drug, as well as its elimination by conjugation or  extrusion.         The microspectrofluorometer complemented  to that purpose will also provide real time processing of  data enabling alterations of the experimental design in the  course of observations. Thus a system of experimentation  will be produced which is rapidly           responsive to  the changes provoked in the cell.                     NSF FORM 1358 (1/94)     3",
