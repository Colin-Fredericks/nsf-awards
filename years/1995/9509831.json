 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this `applied algorithm` project is to  continue  the establishment and study of the  interrelationships between formal language  theory and the  structure and behavior of the informational macromolecules.  The  formal representation of recombinant behaviors exhibited  by double stranded DNA  in the presence of specified sets of  enzymatic activities is of crucial  interest.  This project  includes the continued investigation of splicing  systems and  the languages they define.  The fact that DNA occurs  naturally in  both linear and circular forms, which interact  through recombination, has  motivated the initiation of a  unified theory of interacting linear and circular  words.  This project includes further development of this theory  with emphasis  on splicing.  A treatment of languages of  bi-infinite words and semi-infinite  words is made, which  will initiate the integration of these theories with the  theories of languages of circular and finite words.  This  project directs  special attention to the sofic shifts, which  are a class of languages of  bi-infinite words that play a  major role in dynamical systems.    This project  is significant in that it establishes and  clarifies relations between formal  language theory and  molecular biology. It develops an additional source of  suggestive problems and imagery for formal language theory.  Also, over a time  scale of decades, it is expected to  suggest questions and contribute precision  to biochemical  thought about informational macromolecules and their  behavior.  Additionally, the project provides new problems  and approaches to the study of  symbolic dynamics.  This  project combines theoretical computer science,  biology and dynamical systems in a mutually stimulating and  reinforcing way.",
