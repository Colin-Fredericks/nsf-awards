 "awd_abstract_narration": "Object-oriented languages offer one promising approach to  making programs easier to write and easier to modify and  extend. Unfortunately,  object-oriented language constructs  often incur a substantial run-time cost. To  improve the run-time performance of object-oriented languages, previous  research applied intraprocedural class analysis and compile-time class  prediction to determine the actual classes of  arguments to a dynamically bound  call at compile-time,  thereby statically binding the call to the target  procedure  and enabling inline expansion to eliminate the overhead of  the call.  This work was performed primarily in the context  of purely object-oriented  languages. The goal of this project is to extend previous  work in three directions. First,   the scope of  analysis will  be expanded to the whole application program. This  necessitates  developing and evaluating techniques for  constructing call graphs for  object-oriented languages and  performing interprocedural class analysis.  Second,  profile information  will be incorporated into the analysis and  optimization process. In particular, profile information can  provide much more  accurate class prediction information than  can static estimation techniques.  Third,  procedure specialization will be selectively applied to the optimization of  object-oriented languages. The goal will be to investigate the relative trade-offs in  cost and benefit among inline expansion, procedure  specialization, and  interprocedural analysis for object-oriented languages. The  suitability of these  techniques across a range of object-oriented programming  languages, both pure and hybrid, will be evaluated in this effort.",
