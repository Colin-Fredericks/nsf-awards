 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522125  Maragakis  Railway bridges are a critical  component of the transportation  infrastructure.  Many of them are  located in densely populated areas  with high seismic risk.  A basic  knowledge of the seismic response  characteristics and performance of  these structures is important. An  important feature of railway bridge  dynamics is the rail-ties-ballast  system which extends over the  adjacent roadbed and probably  provides additional strength to the  structures.  A recent dynamic test  of a ballasted railway bridge sheds  some light into the complexity of  the dynamic interaction involved in  rail-ballast systems.    In this project a series of  identification studies will be  performed by using the available  field data in order to identify  important stiffness parameters of  various elements of the bridge.  The data from the failure tests  conducted at the University of  Nevada on ballasted and unballasted  systems will be used for the  development of failure elements and  their incorporation into nonlinear  models.  The developed models will  be used for the prediction of the  response of typical railway bridges  to earthquake excitations.  A study  of these responses will indicate  needs for retrofitting.    This project will improve the  capability of modeling the  nonlinear dynamic response of  railway bridges which are a  critical component of the nation's  transportation networks.  ***",
