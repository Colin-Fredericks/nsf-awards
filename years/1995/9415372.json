 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student at City University of New York.   The project analyzes the development of the alpaca knitwear industry in highland Bolivia, where hand-knitting for export has become an important source of employment for local women.   The project will examine how home-based production has provided a based around which women have organized, and how knitting has affected the status of women in the community.  The project will examine the impact of development projects working with knitters.  The research will advance our understanding of the effects of intensification of artisan production on women's status and workloads.  Methods include participant observation, structured interviews with a sample of workers and their households, and analysis of development agencies and wholesalers in the artesian knitting industry.  This research is important because many development projects are similar to this, providing income-generating skills and outlets for women in agrarian or developing economies.   Understanding the impact of the development on the household lives of women will provide valuable information to development planners.",
