 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johansen  Mayville State University, located in North Dakota, serves a small community in the  agrarian Red River Valley region of the State.  Built in 1957, the Science Building,  housing the Chemistry Department, remains as initially constructed without any  modifications.  Currently dedicated research and research training facilities are  unavailable for faculty and students to pursue their research interests.  ARI funds, in  combination with State funding, will be used to convert a small laboratory, a dark  room and a chemical storage area, to dedicated research and research training space.   Electrical and plumbing systems will be upgraded and the ventilation system improved  to maintain the level of research activity.  In order to support experiments conducted  in the areas of organometallic, analytical, and physical chemistry, fume hoods and a  bench, measuring the length of the room, will be installed.  This renovation project is  integral to the Department s efforts in delivering a quality undergraduate research  program.  With  62% of the student population from small rural areas in eastern  North Dakota and western Minnesota, and approximately half of the students majoring  in chemistry are women, this project will have a significant impact on the  undergraduate research experience at Mayville State.",
