 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division in support of  the research of Dr. Dennis Dougherty at the California Institute of Technology.  The research  will continue Dougherty's efforts on the design, synthesis, and characterization of model spin-  coupled and di- and tri-radicals based on complex heterocycles and/or radical ions where the  spin-containing moieties are connected by a ferromagnetic coupling unit which ensures that any  two or more spins linked through it will experience high spin ferromagnetic coupling rather than  low spin antiferromagnetic coupling.  Meta-phenylene will be the primary coupling unit.   Radical systems which have high spin ground states and a large energy gap to low spin excited  states will be candidates for assembly into highly cross linked organic networks with controlled  topologies to ensure favorable magnetic coupling.  Strategies for building extended networks will  involve synthesizing closed shell polymers or networks, fully characterizing them, and then  introducing spins by a chemical or electrochemical doping procedure.  Magnetic properties will  be characterized by variable temperature SQUID magnetometry and electron paramagnetic  resonance measurements.    This highly interdisciplinary research addresses fundamental issues of spin-spin interactions in  simple model polyradical systems and how they can be applied to extended bulk organic  magnets.  Critical to the success of the project will be band gap engineering which will assure  high spin ground states at ambient conditions.  Magnetic materials are ubiquitous in modern  technology.  Organic magnets will find potential applications in light weight motors and  information storage systems.",
