 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521052  Olsen    In recent years, the design and use of compact transmission lines  has become more common for reasons related to aesthetics, power  transmission efficiency and environmental concerns.  Hardware on  these compact lines is exposed to higher surface electric fields  than on lines of more conventional designs.  Thus, corona which  is responsible for a number of undesirable effects, is a more  important design criterion for hardware to be used on new and  upgraded lines.  In this work, it is proposed to develop a new  methodology for the design of such hardware.  The first part is  to develop an appropriate criterion for predicting the initiation  of corona streamers on conductors with curvature in two  directions.  To do this, a theory described in this proposal will  be calibrated using a set of carefully controlled corona  initiation experiments.  The second is to incorporate this theory  as an optimization criterion in a computer program to design  hardware.  Finally, a number of hardware designs will be  developed and tested against those developed with simpler  existing criteria.  ***",
