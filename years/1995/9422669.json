Its theme is \"Crossing Boundaries,\" and it focuses on introducing graduate students and  other new entrants to the varied strands of research and analysis in the law and society field.  It pays attention to the core debates and questions about boundary-crossing   that serve to integrate the field.  Publication of materials prepared for the institute will extend the impact of the effort.  Another important purpose of the seminar is to increase the cultural diversity of the field through the recruitment to the institute of scholars representing groups traditionally underrepresented in the law and society field.  %%%  This proposal supports a mentoring activity to assist in the develop of scientists in the law and society field.
