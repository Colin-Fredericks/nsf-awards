 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505343  Hairston       Dr. Hairston requests funding for a Small Grant for  Exploratory Research (SGER) for a project which has great potential  to move research on chaos to a new arena: real experimental  validation of methods for detecting nonlinearity and chaos.  The  ultimate goal is the development of methods for determining whether  chaos underlies the dynamics of natural populations.  In this  project, real organisms will be used to create data sets that  demonstrably exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics (either chaos or  complicated periodic oscillations).   These data will be used to  experimentally test existing and new methods for characterizing  complex dynamics.        The experimental system is a single-state chemostat culturing  rotifers and their algal food with variable supply rate of the  nutrient limiting algal growth.  There is experimental evidence  that this system can exhibit predator-prey oscillation.   Mathematical theory suggests that such oscillations can be driven  into complex mode-locking oscillations, and eventually into chaos,  by pulsed or periodically varying nutrient supply rate.       SGER funding will be used for a one-year pilot study to  demonstrate the feasibility to:  construct and maintain the  experimental system; vary conditions to obtain useful population  dynamics; and conduct experiments.  These will be the first studies  in which statistical methods, intended for use on natural  populations, are validated through experiments on real organisms.   This represents a major step towards reality, compared with  conventional tests using simulated data.",
