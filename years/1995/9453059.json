 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550710  Miller  The primary goal of this RIMI proposal is increased entry and  retention of minorities into the environmental engineering program  at Wayne State University (WSU).  The project proposes combining  existing research strengths in modeling and remediation of soil and  groundwater contamination within the Departments of Civil and  Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Chemical Engineering (ChE) in  order to reach this goal.  Faculty from these Departments will  combine efforts to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to the  problem of soil and water pollution from ruptured or leaking waste  containment systems.  The scope of the research is purposely broad,  in order to involve the minority students/researchers in a number  of focuses research areas, each relating directly to pollution  resulting from land-based waste containment systems.  The WSU  research experience will be enhanced through a summer internship  program at The University of Michigan.  In addition, industrial  internships will be used to increase the number of minorities  impacted by this program.  Such practical research training will  significantly increase student retention in this program.  ***",
