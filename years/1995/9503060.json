 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a one-year dissertation enhancement grant to Mr.  Mark Erdmann, a graduate student at the University of  California at Berkeley, to conduct  research for his Ph.D.  study to develop a method for monitoring the health of  coral reefs in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia.   Coral  reef ecosystems throughout the world, particularly the  fringe reefs of southeast Asia, are rapidly deteriorating  under the influence of marine pollution.  There is a need  for efficient, inexpensive means of monitoring the health of  reefs that can be easily used by local participants.  A  bioindicator is an inexpensive means to monitor the health  of coral reef communities. This research can potentially  yield major benefits for the conservation of coral reef  communities in this region.  Mr. Erdmann has conducted  research in the Western Pacific area and stands to gain a  good deal  more international experience and field expertise  in the course of carrying out  this study.",
