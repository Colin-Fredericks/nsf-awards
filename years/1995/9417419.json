 "awd_abstract_narration": "Khosla  9417419  Our research focuses on understanding the relationships between  structure and function of natural and designed biosynthetic  enzymes.  Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are examples of these  enzymes.  They catalyze the biosynthesis of polyketides (a  structurally diverse family of bioactive natural products) via  repeated condensations between carboxylic acid derivatives.  After  each condensation, the added  -keto group is suitably reduced.  It  is the controlled variation in chain length, choice of chain-  binding units, extent of each reductive cycle, and regiospecificity  in cyclization that leads to the variation among naturally  occurring polyketides.  Our work seeks (i) to understand how PKS  structure controls catalysis, specificity, and subunit assembly,  and (ii) to develop biosynthetic rules for the rational design of  novel polyketides.  Towards this end, we have recently generated  and characterized several novel polyketides by using genetic  engineering.  On one hand, this knowledge leads to new insights of  molecule reconstruction and opens the possibility of expanding  nature's repertoire of polyketide compounds.  The present research  extends studies on a group of PKSs involved in aromatic polyketide  biosynthesis, which exhibit four principal catalytic degrees of  freedom.  The structural determinants of these degrees of freedom  will be defined.  %%%  Molecular biology owes much of its appeal and technological power  to the elucidation of mechanisms for DNA, RNA, and protein  biosynthesis.  In particular, these biosynthetic mechanism have in  common the use of \"template\" molecules that determine the structure  of the product molecule. However, it is well-known that DNA, RNA,  and proteins are not the only biomolecules synthesized by iterative  mechanisms.  An examination of the molecular diversity of a number  of natural products leads one to speculate that the equivalent of  a genetic code must also exist for these molecules.  However, the  apparent absence of \"t emplates\" has frustrated attempts determine  how compound structural specificity is achieved along these  biosynthetic pathways.  Our work uses the complementary tools of  genetics and chemistry to unravel the structural and mechanistic  basis for molecular diversity in one family of natural products:  the polyketides. The research directions proposed here seek to (i)  understand how PKS structure controls catalysis, specificity, and  subunit assembly, and (ii) develop biosynthetic rules for the  rational design of novel polyketides.    This project is funded jointly by the Metabolic Biochemistry  Program (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and the  Organic Synthesis Section of the Organic and Macromolecular  Chemistry Program (Division of Chemistry).  ***",
