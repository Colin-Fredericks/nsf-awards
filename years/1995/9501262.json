 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Theoretical   and Computational Chemistry Program at NSF, Kirk Peterson at the   Chemistry Department of Washington State University will study gas phase   processes that involve halogenated molecules which are found in the upper   atmosphere. The focus of the work is on reactive species which contain   chlorine and, in particular, bromine atoms. Highly accurate ab initio   electronic wavefunctions and energies are to be used to characterize the   thermodynamics, spectroscopy, and photochemistry of these molecules. The   wavefunctions are computed using coupled cluster theory and   multireference configuration interaction methods.  Since the discovery of the seasonal drop in Antarctic ozone levels,   accurate ab initio theoretical work has contributed to the understanding   of the atmospheric chemistry relevant to ozone depletion. However, nearly   all this work has focused on fluorine and chlorine compounds and bromine   compounds have been neglected. Yet, stratospheric bromine chemistry is   important because bromine species may account for 25% or more of the   Arctic and Antarctic ozone loss. Further, the concentration of bromine   molecules is expected to increase in the future. The work being supported   by this award is leading to a better understanding of these important   bromine reactions, a necessary precursor for their control.",
