 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clark Atlanta University will sponsor a four-week Summer Science  Camp for fifty seventh and eight grade students each summer for the  three-year period, 1996-1998.  The goals of the Clark Atlanta  University (CAU) Summer Science Camp (SSC) Program are to provide  a foundation and support to promote the development for a lifelong  interest in the sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM) for all  of its participants and to encmurage participants to consider  careers in SEM.  Program participants, selected from elementary and  middle schools in Metropolitan Atlanta, will enroll in an academic  enrichment experience that includes interdisciplinary science,  computer applications, mathematics, and communications skills.   Instruction will emphasize problem solving and critical thinking  while focusing on real life situations.  In addition to classroom  experiences. participants will interact with research scientists in  their laboratories and in career awareness seminars and discussion  groups.  Weekly field trips will round out the academic experiences  of the Program.  Follow-up activities during the academic year  include workshops each semester for program participants and their  parents, an awards program at the end of the school year, a  mentoring program in which participants will be matched with  undergraduate or graduate student science majors who will serve as  their mentors, and two newsletters each semester that highlight the  accomplishments of the participants and Clark Atlanta University  Scientists.  ***",
