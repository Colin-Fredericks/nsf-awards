 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415331 Fultz   In this research, Mossbauer diffraction is applied to powder structure characterization.  Hyperfine interactions cause the scattering factor of an 57iron atom to change strongly for slightly different gamma ray energies.  This could provide a basis for unique chemical selectivity in diffraction experiments.  The chemical selectivity could be used to tune a gamma ray to the specific chemical environment of an 57iron atom and determine a specific diffraction pattern from that chemical environment alone.  The experimental work attempts to measure the face-centered cubic and simple cubic diffraction patterns from two iron sites in DO3-ordered 57iron aluminide.  Preliminary experimental results have been encouraging and have provided practical parameters for the this work.  If these first experiments are successful, measurement will be made on the arrangements of antisite atoms in partially-ordered 57iron aluminide and in a B2 57iron - rhodium.  In a parallel effort, the timing capabilities of the position-sensitive detector will be tested.  If the detector can be operated with both time and positron resolution, later experiments may be performed at a synchrotron radiation facility. %%% To date, materials science has relied heavily on x-ray, electron, and neutron diffraction to characterize the structure of powders.  Mossbauer diffraction, which occurs by scattering of gamma rays from nuclei, is explored as an additional useful technique for powder diffractometry.   ***",
