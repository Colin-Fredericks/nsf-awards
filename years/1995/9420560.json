 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420560  Rezayi  Numerical work is proposed to investigate some outstanding problems  in the phonomenon of the fractionally quantized Hall effect, which  is observed in a two-dimensional electron gas subject to a  transverse magnetic field.  The electron layer is formed at the  semi-conductor interface of a high quality gallium-arsenic  heterostructure semi-conductor device.  The proposed research  addresses the nature and properties of the Fermi-Liquid state  formed at even fractions of the lowest Landau level occupation,  novel parafermion quantum Hall states and the physical conditions  which stabilize them, edge states, the quantum fluid to classical  Wigner crystal transition, and optical properties of quantum Hall  state.  %%%  This research is aimed at understanding the behavior of a  system of electrons (carriers of electric current) confined  spatially to a plane and subject to a perpendicular magnetic field  as prepared in gallium-arsenic heterostructure devices.  Under  suitable conditions the electrons exhibit the phenomenon of  Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.  The phenomenon results from the  condensation of electrons into a highly collective state with the  little semblance of their initial individual characteristics.  This  is the subatomic realm of quantum mechanics - an area of  considerable scientific interest.  In addition, the quantum Hall  effect has potential technological applications in semiconductor  industry.  This RUI research will be carried out at  California State University, Los Angeles - a predominantly  undergraduate minority institution - and will involve both  undergraduate and Master's level students.",
