 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the investigators will study tail current  disruption during substorms by making use of multisatellite  observations.  Tail current disruption plays an important role in  releasing magnetic energy which has been stored in the near-Earth  tail before a substorm onset.  Recent observations have shown that  tail current disruption initiates in the near-Earth magnetotail and  then expands both azimuthally and radially, corresponding to the  expansion of substorm activities at the ionosphere.  Thus, the  spatial expansion of tail current disruption is one of the most  essential features associated with substorms.  The main objectives  of the project are (1) to find the dependence of the spatial  developmental of tail current disruption on tail magnetic  configurations, and (2) to find magnetic conditions that are  necessary for triggering the (local) onsets of tail current  disruption.  To achieve these objectives the investigators will  focus on preonset magnetic conditions .  Data to be used include:  magnetic field data from geostationary satellites and elliptically  orbiting satellites.  Magnetic signatures will be interpreted in  terms of the tail field configuration and the enhancement in the  tail current intensity.  This study is the first attempt to  statistically examine the mechanisms of the trigger and the spatial  development of current disruption in terms of preonset magnetic  configurations.  The understanding of such mechanisms is one of the  main goals of magnetospheric physics.  The results of this project  will put important constraints on future theoretical and  observational studies of substorm physics, and will be useful as an  input for more global studies, such as coordinated ground and  satellite data analyses and global simulations of magnetospheric  substorms.",
