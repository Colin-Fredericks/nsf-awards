 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500232  Ramani   This is an Engineering  Research Equipment Grant to purchase an injection molding machine and induction heating unit.  The equipment will be used in several projects, including thermoplastic polymer structural bonding, in-situ joining of thermoplastics and their composites to metals in net-shape processes, that includes injection molding, filament winding and shrink fitting, and incorporation of induction heating to increase process speeds.  The primary objective of this research is to develop in-situ processes to join thermoplastic composites to metals in net-shape processes.  The residual stresses will be modeled as a function of the process parameters.  The surface preparation, contact pressure during consolidation, heating and cooling rates, hold times at melt and recrystallization temperature, effect of bond line thickness and uniformity, and anodization to increase durability will be included in the process development cycle.  Induction heating will be used to transiently and preferentially heat the metal surface for bonding.  The results will be applied to filament winding and injection molding.  Known characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will be used to evaluate the polymer morphology and structure at the interface.  Cooperative arrangements have been made with an industrial partner  to do scale up testing and mechanical strength evaluation of the joints between polymer and metal.   The results of this research will be applied to bio-medical, automotive and aerospace industries.  It is anticipated that this innovative joining between plastics and metals will lead to major reductions in production cycle time which can reduce the total cost.  Further new design features can be incorporated taking into account in-situ joining capabilities.",
