 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521543    Temperature regulation is very important for many organisms,  because   rates   of   biochemical   reactions   vary   with  temperature.   Careful  thermoregulation   is   particularly  important  to  flight performance.  Flying  bees  have  been  thought  to  regulate  temperature of  their  thorax,  which  houses  their flight muscles, by varying rates of convective  and  evaporative heat loss.  Recent studies,  however,  show  that  flying bees reduce rates of metabolic heat  production  as  air  temperature increases.  Because metabolic  heat  is  produced mainly by the activity of the flight muscles, power  output  for  flight may also change with temperature.   This  research  will  measure flight performance,  water  balance,  evaporative water loss and metabolic rate in freely hovering  honey bees over a range of air temperatures.  The data  will  be used to construct quantitative heat and water budgets for  thermoregulation  in flying bees.  It  will  result  in  the  first  comprehensive  models of   thermal  effects  on  heat  balance,  water balance and flight performance  in  insects.  The  research  will increase understanding of  environmental  constraints  on  the distribution, abundance,  and  activity  patterns  of biologically and economically important  flying  insects.",
