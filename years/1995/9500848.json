 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a conference on the interaction between the fields of Lie algebras in positive characteristic, quantum groups, and  Lie superalgebras.  In the last several years, there have been important connections between the representation theory of Lie algebras in characteristic p and the representation theory of quantum groups.  The relation between Lie algebras in prime characteristic and Lie superalgebras dates back to the 1970's, but is still not fully understood.  These problems will be discussed at this conference.  The time and place for the conference are chosen to honor Professor Richard E. Block upon his retirement.  His work has had a deep impact on the subject.  This conference is concerned with a mathematical object called a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of sperical motion.",
