 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Janet E. Del Bene at the Department of Chemistry, Youngstown   State University, and Professor Willis B. Person at the Department of   Chemistry, the University of Florida, are supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program at NSF. This support is   for a joint theoretical and experimental research program to   systematically study the intermolecular interactions in a number of   hydrogen bonded complexes. Professor Del Bene is determining very   accurate ab initio wavefunctions for the complexes and using these   wavefunctions to obtain structures, binding energies, and vibrational   frequencies. Professor Person is performing measurements of the infrared   spectra for these complexes in solid rare gas matrices. The theoretical   and experimental efforts are closely coupled and coordinated and this   joint effort provides a level of understanding of the infrared spectra   and bonding properties that could not be achieved by either effort alone.   The focus of the work supported by this grant is to elucidate the   structural and vibrational properties of complexes with strong hydrogen   bonds. A range of strengths of the proton donors and acceptors are   systematically considered for the complexes being studied.  Hydrogen bonding is an extremely important phenomenon which occurs   widely; it determines the properties of a large number of systems ranging   from condensed water to complex biomolecules. Despite extensive studies   of hydrogen bonding, there are important open questions about the   significance and interpretation of the experimental infrared spectra and   about the theoretical understanding of the bonding character. In   particular, there are questions about the degree of proton transfer in a   given complex and the consequences of this transfer for properties of the   complex. Professors Del Bene and Person are bringing special   qualifications to resolve these difficult questions especially because   they are able to directly relate Professor Person's experimental   observations to Professor Del Bene's theoretical characterization of the   bonding character.",
