 "awd_abstract_narration": "The classical theory of NP-completeness shows that many  optimization problems of practical interest are hard to solve: i.e.,  NP-hard problems that have no polynomial-time algorithms (assuming P   is not equal to NP).  A popular method for dealing with such an NP-complete   problem is to try to compute approximate solutions: i.e., solutions   whose cost is within some multiplicative  factor of the cost of the   exact solution.  The focus of this project is to demonstrate   that computing approximate solutions for NP-hard problems  is no easier than computing exact solutions.  The underlying idea   which is exploited, is that of a new probabilistic definition of   the NP complexity class, a definition  based on probabilistically   checkable proofs (PCP's).  Some of the  major goals of the  project include: (1) To better understand the approximability of NP-hard  optimization problems (including cataloging the hardness  of approximation of  many problems, improving existing  results about the hardness of approximation,  and  understanding the limitation of these techniques); (2) To develop  further connections between the theory of  PCP's and cryptography; (3) To   improve existing ways of representing data by error-correcting codes;  (4) To simplify the techniques used in the proof of this new  definition of NP.  The Educational Component of this CAREER Grant includes: (a) Development  of CORE undergraduate computer science courses (including Theory of Computation  and Applied  Discrete Mathematics); (b) Development of a graduate  computer science course and a corresponding text dealing with PCP's   and (approximate) complexity theory.",
