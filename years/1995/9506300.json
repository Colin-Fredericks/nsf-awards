Porphyrins  interact with DNA by several modes.  Porphyrins intercalate, groove  bind, and may bind in novel, currently uncharacterized modes.  Some  porphyrins form non-covalent complexes with DNA while others are  reactive, causing strand scission, base release and other  reactions.  One attractive aspect of porphyrins is the systematic  manner in which DNA mode of binding and reactivity vary with  porphyrin shape, metal center, charge and additional structural and  physical properties.  These parameters are easily manipulated  because techniques for elaboration of porphyrin structure are  extensively developed.  However, no detailed 3-D structures of DNA-  porphyrin complexes have been determined thus far.  The goal of  this proposal is to determine 3-dimensional x-ray structures of  DNA-porphyrin complexes.  Initial work will focus on previously  obtained crystals of the following DNA-porphyrin complexes: (1)  (Cu)TMPyP4 - CGATCG, (2) (Cu)TMPyP4 - CGATICG, (3) (Cu)TMPyP4 -  CGATCG - K2PtCI, (4) (Cu)TMPyP4 - CGATCG - SmCI3, (5) (Cu)TMPyP4 -  ICGATCG, (6) (Ni)TMPyP4 - CGATCG, (7) (Pd)TMPyP4 - CGATCG, (8)  (Cu)TMPyP4 - CGCG,  where IC= 5-iodoC and TMPyP4 = meso-(4-(N-  tetra-methylpyridyl))porphyrin .  X-ray intensity data has been  obtained from several of these crystals and structure solution is  in progress.         Teaching Philosophy.  Georgia Tech is a combined research and  teaching institution.  Training pof undergraduates, graduate  students and post-doctoral associates is an essential part of the  PI's research program.  The PI's goals are to teach and conduct  research in an academic environment.  Motivation for classroom  teaching is enjoyment, intellectual challenge, and to gain and  maintain breadth of knowledge that  research alone does not  necessarily foster.  The PI has developed new curricula for several  courses.  His teaching philosophy is to excite students by  incorporating the latest techniques and results into the  curriculum.   %%%  Porphyrins and porphyrin-like molecules are brightly colored,  biologically critical molecules that give color to hemoglobin and  chlorophyll.  Porphyrins can interact by several modes with DNA,  the genetic material.  A molecular understanding of DNA-porphyrin  interactions will facilitate design of a host of technologically  useful molecules such as new artificial nucleases, structural  probes and conjugates, biomaterials and nano-devices.  Porphyrins  sometimes intercalate, sliding between base pairs and increasing  the length of DNA.  Under other conditions porphyrins bind in the  DNA grooves.  In some instances porphyrins may bind to DNA by  novel, uncharacterized modes.  Certain porphyrins are reactive,  causing DNA strand scission, base release and other reactions.  DNA  mode of binding and reactivity vary with porphyrin shape, metal  center, charge and additional structural and physical properties.   These parameters are easily manipulated.  However, thus far no  detailed 3-D structures of DNA-porphyrin complexes have been  determined.  X-ray crystallography is a method by which molecules  can be visualized in atomic detail.  For this work, x-ray  crystallography will be used to visualize complexes of DNA with  porphyrins.  Crystals of DNA-porphyrin complexes will be grown and  a beam of x-rays will be directed through each crystal.  The atoms  of the crystal scatter the x-rays.  After collection and proper  processing of the intensities of scattered x-rays, the positions of  the atoms of the DNA and of the bound porphyrin molecule can be  reconstructed.  ***",
