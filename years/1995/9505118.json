 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505118  Blass       The research project of Andreas Blass is in four areas: (1) Cardinal   characteristics of the continuum, including both the general theory of   such characteristics (involving Galois-Tukey connections) and the detailed   study of particular characteristics, especially the recently introduced   evasion and prediction numbers. (2) Applications of set theory, especially   in the theory of abelian groups. (3) Semantics of linear logic, especially   game semantics and its variants. (4) Logic of topoi, particularly the   logical properties of geometric morphisms.  The research project of Glen   Whitney concerns interpreting general recursive definitions, especially in   non-determinisitic and concurrent contexts.  Specific questions include:   (1) Finding a universal class of structures with a recursion operation, so   that every structure will be contained in one from this class. (2)   Comparing proposals for the semantics of concurrent programming languages.   (3) Seeking connections with fixpoint logics used in finite model theory.   (4) Extending the current theory to allow more detailed modelings of   parameter and message passing between subprograms.          Both the formal language of recursion FLR, which Whitney will  study, and Girard's linear logic LL, one of Blass' research topics, can   serve as mathematical models of certain aspects of computing.  FLR models   recursion, i.e., programs using subroutines identical to the programs   themselves.  Whitney's project is directed toward improved understanding of   recursion in the context of parallel computing, i.e. computations done   collaboratively by many machines operating simultaneously.  LL models data  types; its game semantics models the situation where accessing data   involves more of an interaction (access protocol) between the provider and  the user of the data than mere transmission of data.  Both theories are  currently at the stage of mathematical exploration, but it is hoped that  the information obtained w ill be of use in the design of future programming  languages and in the formal verification of correctness of programs.   Cardinal characteristics of the continuum are a way to exhibit and clarify  the combinatorial content of difficult problems from various areas of  mathematics -- originally topology and analysis, more recently algebra as  well.  They provide connections between these different areas and thus  allow progress on a problem in one area to be applied in another.  In  addition, they make these problems amenable to treatment by the methods of  modern set theory.  The final topic in Blass' proposed research, topos  theory, also serves to connect apparently disparate areas, mostly within  mathematical logic.  The particular topic of geometric morphisms of topoi  combines ideas from set theory, from information systems (introduced as a  model of computation), from sheaf theory (a part of topology), and from  constructive logic.  ***",
