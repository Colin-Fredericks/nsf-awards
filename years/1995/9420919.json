Participation will be 200 to 250 scientists (including speakers  and moderators), selected on the basis of their expertise and  interest in this area, and their expected contribution to the  success of this scientific program. Intracellular protein  degradation in eukaryotes is clearly a complex process involving  multiple systems and  pathways. In part, this reflects the  various types of turnover that must be effected by cells. Some  mechanisms are clearly highly regulated and involve the turnover  of the specific proteins and enzymes in a carefully programmed  fashion, whereas other mechanisms respond more generally to  classes of proteins such as internalized ligands or incorrectly  folded or damaged proteins. As compared, for example, to  synthetic processes, relatively little is known about either the  proteases involved or the signals that identify their prospective  substrates. This meeting will focus on the elements in protein  structure that are thought to play key roles in the regulation of  both general and programmed protein turnover and the proteases  that are likely to be involved. The presentations and discussions  will range from evaluations of the structure and functional   relationships of individual components to physiologically  relevant responses that are known to involve  programmed  turnover. Recent advances from a variety of laboratories indicate  that this is a particularly good time for an analysis of our  current understanding of protein degradation signals and  mechanisms and to evaluate future directions.   %%%  This meeting on Mechanisms of  Regulated Intracellular Protein  Degradation will serve as a catalyst for stimulating the interest  of scientists who may already have the tools in hand to approach   these problems with a focus on those young scientists who are yet  to initiate a major area of independent research.  ***",
