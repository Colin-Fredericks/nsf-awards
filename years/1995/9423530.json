 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a 3 year program to assess the  variation in the snow accumulation rate in northern  Greenland. Previous work has shown that isotope records from  shallow ice cores can be used to identify interannual and  perhaps seasonal cycles of snow temperature and  accumulation.  In order to assess seasonal and interannual  variability, the isotope temperature record requires  calibration from in situ meteorologic measurements.  On-  going remote sensing research appears to show that  interannual trends in brightness temperature can be used as  proxy data for annual accumulation but this work requires  calibration from ice core data in northern Greenland.  Combining stable isotope measurements, remote sensing, and  surface energy balance data will allow an assessment of how  interannual and seasonal processes affect the magnitude and  variability of snow accumulation.  Meteorologic data  collection stations will be established and five shallow ice  cores will be drilled in a 400 km2 area around each of two  stations, one in northeastern and one in northwestern  Greenland.  Argos satellite links will provide data  transmission capability from each remote site.  Grain size  and temperature profiles, sublimation, and energy balance  will be calculated using a one-dimensional energy and mass  flux model.",
