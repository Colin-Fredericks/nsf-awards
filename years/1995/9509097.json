 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509097  Csernansky  Protein kinase C (PKC) is an important enzyme involved in  proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in many cells.   Preliminary experiments were performed examining the subcellular   localization of PKC isozymes in mouse pure neuronal cultures  deprived of serum, a model of apoptosis.  One isozyme, PKC-delta,  is selectively translocated to the nucleus during serum deprivation  injury in neurons.  The hypothesis that translocation of PKC-delta  is an early, and possibly critical event in the development of  serum deprivation injury will be tested.  Immunoblots will be  performed on total and nuclear protein fractions from pure neurons  to confirm that translocation of PKC-delta protein is observed when  PKC-delta immunoreactivity appears in the nucleus.  PKC kinase  activity will be evaluated for the total and nuclear neuronal  protein fractions to determine whether there is a change in nuclear  PKC activity during serum deprivation.  Nerve growth factor  deprivation-induced apoptosis in PC 12 cells will be used to  determine whether translocation of PKC-delta is critical for the   development of apoptosis in other model systems.",
