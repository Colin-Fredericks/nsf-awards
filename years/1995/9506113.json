Electron microscopy and digital  image analysis are being applied to two-dimensional (2-D) crystals  generated from isolated fungal outer mitochondrial membranes to  determine the 3-D shape of the VDAC channel in two different  conformations (and complexed with an endogenous modulator protein)  at a resolution of about 2nm.  Information about the structural and  functional topography of the VDAC protein also are provided by  sequence-specific antibodies and by partial proteolysis  experiments.  Regions of the channel polypeptide that are most  likely to form transmembrane  -strands are being identified by  applying a novel algorithm for local multiple-sequence alignment  (the Gibbs sampler) to sequences of VDACs and distantly related  bacterial channels (several of which have known atomic structure).   These varied kinds of \"low-resolution\" structural information will  be used to construct a self-consistent folding model for the VDAC  polypeptide.  At the same time, systematic attempts will be made to  grow bigger 2-D and 3-D crystals of the VDAC channel, suitable for  higher resolution structure determination by electron and/or x-ray  diffraction.  These crystallization attempts have been made  possible by recent success in expressing the mitochondrial protein  in bacteria at levels over 100-fold greater than are possible with  fungal cultures.  %%%  The cell and its internal compartments are bounded by membranes  composed of lipids and proteins.  The lipids form a bilayer sheath  that is impenetrable to polar ions and molecules.  Proteins make it  possible for the different compartments to communicate, i.e.,  exchange material.  For example, some proteins form channels,  water-filled passageways across the membrane bilayer which open and  close (or gate) in  response to different stimuli.  The basic  structure of channels and the molecular mechanism(s) of their  gating are only poorly understood.  In this project, we are  studying a channel that occurs on the surface of the intracellular  organelle that is the cell's powerplant, the mitochondrion.  The  channel is switched by transmembrane electrical potentials between  states with different degrees of openness, and this gating appears  to be controlled by other proteins in the mitochondrion.  Using  electron crystallography and other biophysical and biochemical  approaches, this research will determine the three-dimensional  structure of the channel in different states, in order to  understand how it is formed and how it opens and closes.  ***",
