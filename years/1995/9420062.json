 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to charaaterize the diatom  fossils in drill core recovered by the Cape Roberts  Project (CRP).  The CRP is a major program within the  international Antarctic earth science community, designed  to sample Antarctic continental margin strata of late  Cretaceous through Paleogene age (30 million to 100  million years ago).  Drilling operations will include  continuous coring from a sea ice platform at four sites on  the flank of the Victoria Land basin in the western Ross  Sea, during two drilling seasons.    This particular project involves initial field-based  paleontologic analysis of siliceous microfossils in Cape  Roberts cores.  Core sections will be ferried to the Crary  Science and Engineering Center for immediate analysis.  Diatoms and other siliceous microfossils will provide  rapid age and paleoenvironmental information during  drilling operations.  Each season will include preparation  of a preliminary biostratigraphic/paleoenvironmental  report based on siliceous microfossils. This report will  become part of the CRP Initial Reports volume, which will  include the preliminary results from other microfossil  groups, lithostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic, and  other analyses.    Analysis of diatoms and other siliceous microfossils in  CRP cores will greatly aid in the development of an  integrated biostratigraphy for this poorly-known interval  in the southern high latitudes.  Diatoms will provide  evidence of envirolmental changes in water depth, primary  productivity, presence/absence of sea ice, et cetera.  CRP  cores will provide an excellent opportunity to study  adaptation of diatoms to strong polar seasonality and  diatom evolution.  They will also offer the possibility of  gaining a bipolar perspective on Paleogene high latitude  phytoplankton evolution, by integrating CRP studies with  ongoing studies of Paleogene siliceous  microfossils in  Arctic strata (for example, Ocean Drilling Program Leg  151).",
