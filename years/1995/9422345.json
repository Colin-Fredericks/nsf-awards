 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zubrow    Under the direction of Dr. Ezra Zubrow, Ms. Shannon Fie will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. The goal of her  research is to understand how intra-regional exchange served to  integrate three prehistoric \"Woodland\" populations in the  Illinois Valley and to accomplish this goal she will analyze  ceramic remains from a number of archaeological sites. Because  ceramics contain both technological and stylistic markers which  help scientists to determine point of origin, analysis of such  data allow one to reconstruct trade routes and to determine both  direction and intensity of interaction. On this basis a social  network can be reconstructed. To accomplish this goal, MS Fie  will focus her attention on non-elite ceramics which were used  for everyday purposes and are more common that their finely  worked counterparts. She will establish a regional database of  clay sources and determine the chemical and mineralogical  composition for each deposit. She will then subject  archaeological materials to petrographic and neutron activation  analysis to group sherds by both clay source and source of  manufacture.    The sites which MS Fie will examine all form part of the Hopewell  phenomenon. Approximately 2,000 years ago the first large scale  complex societies arose in the American midwest. Hopewell peoples  constructed large and impressive earthworks, and traded widely in  exotic goods which originated in many parts of North America.  While many ceremonial centers have been studied, archaeologists  still have little understanding of how Hopewell groups were  organized and interacted on a local level. The ceramic study  which MS Fie will conduct, promises to shed new light on this  question.    This research is important for several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of how complex societies arise and will provide  new insight into an important aspect of American prehistory. It  also will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
