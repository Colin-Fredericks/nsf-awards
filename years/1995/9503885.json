 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503885  Meyer    This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award supports  travel expenses for graduate students from the laboratory of  Dr. Thomas Meyer, Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to  the laboratory of Dr. N. Katz, Universidad Nacional de  Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.  Three visits of two month  duration are supported.  The Argentine side, in turn, will  support three two month long visits by scientists from Dr.  Katz' lab to the Univ. of North Carolina.  Some expendable  research supplies and publication costs are also supported  under this award.    The area of investigation is an important one, both as it  relates to the basic understanding of photochemistry/physics  and to more practical areas, such as solar energy  conversion. The work will involve investigations in  intramolecular electron transfer in a series of mixed-  valence dimers containing Re(I, II) and Mo(I,0).  These  complexes will be designed such that the redox potential of  photoinduced Re to Mo electron transfer  can be varied by  ligand modifications.  In all cases the driving force will  be greater than the reorganizational energy, so that the  process occurs in the Marcus \"inverted region\".  These  studies will complement and extend Meyer's research on metal-  ligand charge transfer in the inverted region , which has  centered on monometallic complexes.    Operationally, the strengths of the North Carolina and the  Argentine groups will be efficiently utilized.  While the  design of the compounds is a joint responsibility,  preparative work will be carried out in Tucuman, where the  laboratory and personnel have much synthetic expertise.  The  complexes will then be transported to Nopth Carolina, where  the photochemical experiments will be carried out, using  Meyer's highly specialized laser facilities.  In order to  produce a coherent research team that effectively combines  the individual talents of the two research groups, the  research plan contains a detailed schedule for the  interchange of workers b etween the U.S. and the Argentine  laboratories.  ***",
