 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Wood from University of Delaware is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his   experimental thermodynamic research on aqueous solutions at high   temperature.  Wood will measure electrical conductance of aqueous   solutions of a variety of salts at temperatures from 350 to 425 degrees   Centigrade and pressures up to 28 MPa in order to determine ionic   association constants.  In collaboration with scientists at Oak Ridge   National Lab Wood plans to construct an instrument capable of extending   these measurements to 650 degrees Centigrade and 300 MPa.  The ionic   association constants thus measured, together with heat capacity and   volumes of a variety of salts and nonelectrolytes near the critical   point, will be used to construct accurate models for aqueous salt   solutions near the critical point for water.  Wood will also use this   data to develop model classical Hamiltonians for use in performing   simulations in extrapolated regions of temperature and pressure.  High temperature aqueous solutions play an important role in a wide   variety of industrial and natural processes.  Examples of these processes   are mineral transport, deposition and alteration, hydrocarbon formation,   migration and accumulation, electric power boiler corrosion, and   hydrothermal reservoir utilization.  There is also interest in using   supercritical water as a reaction medium for oxidative degradation of   hazardous waste, conversion of coal to gasoline, and as a reaction medium   for organic synthesis to replace conventional organic solvents.  Wood's   research will help to provide a basic understanding of ionic solutions at   high temperatures and pressures which is fundamentally important to the   efficient development of industrial uses of supercritical water",
