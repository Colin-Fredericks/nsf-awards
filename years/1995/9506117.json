 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506117  Evans  This proposal seeks to develop further the technique of time-  resolved solid-state NMR spectroscopy, a method introduced recently  by this laboratory for the structural investigation of fast  reactions, particularly enzymatic reactions, as a function of time.  The overall goals are to (1) design, build and test an new type of  apparatus for rapidly freezing enzyme-substrate (or for that  matter, any two reactants or substrate and catalyst) in 100  microseconds or less, and (2) develop new pulse-sequences for  measurement of selective distances from dipolar coupled spins  within transient species by time-resolved rotational-echo double  resonance (REDOR) solid-state NMR.  The development of these new  methods will be important not just in extending the time-resolution  and structural information that time-resolved solid-state NMR  spectroscopy can currently provide, but also for setting the stage  for the delineation of the molecular events of enzymatic catalysis  and culminating in the making of a \"movie\" of an enzyme in action.  %%%  Enzymes are the agents responsible for carrying out the majority of  the chemical transformations in the living organisms.  The purpose  of the work funded by this proposal is to develop methods, based on  the structural technique Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy, to determine the molecular details of an enzyme in  action.  Thus the ultimate goal is to define in three dimensions  the exact position of all the atoms at the site where the enzyme  carries out its chemistry, and follow them as a function of time.   The methods being developed are a completely novel approach to this  problem, and the consequences of solving this are significant for  an intellectual understanding of how enzymes work.  Such knowledge  could eventually be used to develop novel drugs, herbicides or  pesticides.  ***",
