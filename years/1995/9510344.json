 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of  materials chemistry and has significant implications for  biotechnology.  During the tenure of this eighteen-month standard  grant, Professor Tam-Chang and her students at the University of  Nevada, Reno will carry out preliminary experiments necessary to  implement a major research program in biosensor technology based on  molecular recognition by self-assembled monolayer-resident  receptors and complementary luminescence detection.   Alkanethiolate-tethered ruthenium and osmium complexes will be  prepared and incorporated into self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of  alkanethiols on gold surfaces, and their chemiluminescence and  electrochemiluminescence properties characterized.  Mixed SAMs in  which tethered methylphosphonate oligonucleotide analogs of DNA  sequences of interest are also incorporated will be prepared and  the extent to which double-stranded DNA interacts with the tethered  analog and alters the luminescence from the ruthenium and osmium  complexes will be determined.  The objective of this Research Planning Grant project is to explore  the luminescence properties of SAMs containing ruthenium and osmium  complexes, and to utilize that experimental platform as the basis  for new sequence-specific DNA sensors.  This interdisciplinary  project could give rise to sensor technology with important  biotechnological, environmental, and clinical applications.",
