 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal DMS 95-05043  Principal Investigators:  Stephen M. Stigler,   Xiao-Li Meng  Institution:  University of Chicago  Title:  Model-based Statistical Inference and Data Analysis    Abstract    The investigators study topics that concern the construction and   investigation of statistical models involving latent structure   for the analysis of complex data sets.  Stigler's research involves   models for communications networks where the available data is in the   form of frequency counts of directed transactions.  The models studied   depart from standard linear models for paired comparisons in that   they are not transitive  - they exhibit cycles - and they incorporate   departures from standard multinomial models for the dispersion of   counts.  Meng's research involves frequentist properties of Bayesian   procedures, and is related to his research on multiple imputation   methodology, a general and efficient inferential tool for handling   the complex problem of nonresponse in sample surveys, especially   those that produce public-use data files which will be analyzed by many   users.  Meng will seek to establish robust frequentist properties of   Bayesian procedures in multiple imputation inference, with specific   reference to confidence validity under uncongenial multiple imputation   inferences, frequency evaluations of posterior predictive p-values,   and unbiased imputations and single observation unbiased priors.    The research is of two parts.  One part studies the nature of scientific   communication, seeking to build statistical models to understand better   the relationship between theoretical research and applied research   (in particular the degrees to which they influence each other), and   the relationships between different fields of science (for example,   do different but related disciplines necessarily form a hierarchy,   or do they exhibit more complicated patterns of \"trade\" in ideas.)    The other part involves the construction of statistical models for   analyzing  survey results when nonresponse is a problem.  All surveys   may be susceptible to bias when potential respondents decline to   participate for reasons related to the answer they would have given,   and the methods studied will ameliorate this problem for complex surveys   such as the U. S. Census, where it is desirable to prepare public-use   data files that address this problem and are not overly sensitive to   the statistical assumptions made.",
