 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510284  Stone    This work is supported by a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists   and Engineers Award.  A major area of current interest in the field of   dynamiaal systems is the understanding, prediction, and modeling of   complex spatio-temporal dynamics.  With the advent of high-speed, large   capacity computers, more complex methods from statistics have become   practical in the analysis of data from dynamical systems.  One of the goals   of this project is to compare and contrast two methods, Karhunen-Loeve   (KL) decomposition and Archetypes, in their application to several   experimental dynamical systems, both physical and numerical.  Another   goal is to propose a method that builds on Archetypal analysis for data with   translating coherent structures, by finding archetypes that move with the   traveling structure, in an objective manner.  The shape of the structure itself   is extracted (or possibly shapes, if the structure itself is varying as well as   translating) as well as information on how the structure is moving across the   spatial domain.  A third goal is to determine the feasibility of using   archetypes as a basis upon which to perform a Galerkin projection of the   governing equations (when they exist), for modeling purposes.      The National Science Foundation's mandate to ensure the vitality of the   Nation's scientific enterprise includes concern for the quality, composition,   distribution and effectiveness of the human resource base in science and   engineering.  Within this context, the Foundation is committed to enhancing   the current rate of participation of women in science and engineering   careers, in general, and as active participants in all of its programs.    Research Planning Grant awards are made: (1) to help increase the number   of new women investigators participating in NSF's research programs; and,   (2) to facilitate preliminary studies and other activities related to the   development of competitive research projects and proposals by  women who   have not previously had independent Federal research funding.  Research   Planning Grants are one-time awards that may be used for preliminary work   to determine the feasibility of a proposed line of inquiry, and/or for other   activities that will facilitate proposal development.",
