 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on design techniques for circuits with a power  supply voltage of 0.5V.  Innovations in technology, circuits, and  architecture are being explored.  Issues being pursued in the  design of low-threshold devices are: when to shut down and  efficient shutdown.  Leakage currents are a major power drain in  using low-threshold devices.  Thus, techniques to efficiently  detect and power down idling hardware are being devised.  The  potential of using adaptive supply voltages to exploit time-varying  computational requirements is being investigated.  Studies of the  fundamental limits of reducing energy per computation are being  developed into a general theory of DSP algorithms which can use  dynamic power supply voltages.  Such algorithms change  computational complexity dynamically, thus saving power.  Circuits  which operate at supply voltages less than 0.5V are being  fabricated.",
