The objective  is to study the symbiosis between mycorrhizal fungi and plant  species belonging to the genus Atriflex in order to better  understand the effect of desertification on the plant and  microbial communities, as well as the natural disturbance regime,  in the arid regions of Chile.  A descriptive analysis of the  plant-microbe communities currently undergoing desertification  will be compared to that of a protected site in the same region.  Two integral components of arid ecosystems will be studied:  plant-microbe communities, and small scale disturbances.  Descriptive studies of the plant, fungal and microbial  communities will be linked together with spatial analyses of  animal disturbance, along with experimental studies of the effect  of the disturbance on plant-microbe interaction.  This complete  analysis will yield much more information about desertification  than a single study of the system.    Desertification is the process by which the productivity and soil  quality of ecosystems are significantly reduced.  As a result of  mining and farming activities, much of the arid land of Chile has  been subject to desertification.  The effects of this process on  arid lands can be devastating, nearly eliminating the ground  forage for livestock and other animals.  The aim of this study is  to determine the specific processes of desertification that are  causing the loss of soil fertility and thus, plant community  diversity, with the ultimate goal of reversing or halting the  desertification process.  ***",
