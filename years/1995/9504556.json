 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9504556 Goldstein   The investigator intends to continue his  analysis of Bohmian mechanics, which defines a deterministic  dynamical system involving a novel combination of ordinary and  partial differential equations having remarkable properties. The  proposed research involves (1) an analysis of the possibility of  relativistic extensions of Bohmian mechanics, (2) comparisons of  Bohmian mechanics with the major competing alternative  formulations of quantum theory, and (3) an analysis of the  foundations of statistical mechanics from a Bohmian perspective.    The importance of the proposed research lies in the following  observations: 1) The foundations of quantum theory, the most  fundamental of all physical theories, continue to be mired in  confusion and incoherence some sixty-five years after its  inception. 2) Bohmian mechanics is the natural embedding of  Schroedinger's equation, which is the mathematical core of almost  all interpretations of quantum theory, into a clear, precise  physical theory. It emerges if one merely insists that this  equation be directly relevant to the motion of particles. In  other words, Bohmian mechanics arises, roughly speaking, from  Schroedinger's equation when (perhaps naively) we insist upon the  simplest ontology---particles described by their positions---and  seek a natural law of motion for this ontology. 3) All the  mysteries of quantum theory find a compelling explanation in  Bohmian mechanics---in effect, in the obvious ontology evolving  in the obvious way! 4) An appreciation of Bohmian mechanics can  be the source of enormous flexibility and clarity when one  attempts to apply quantum theory in new directions---for example,  to understand the implications of macroscopic interference  effects---and to new domains, such as quantum cosmology. 5) The  underlying principle behind the value of Bohmian mechanics is  that it really does help to formulate physical theories with  sufficient clarity that they can genuinely be understood.",
