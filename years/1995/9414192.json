 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414192    Purchase of a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer    The Department of Chemistry at Princeton University requests  funds from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and  Facilities program for the purchase of a nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  Currently, the only high  field NMR spectrometer at  Princeton University is a seven  year old JEOL GSX-500.  This spectrometer is the critical  limiting factor to the following projects involving  Chemistry faculty members and their groups.    * Warren S. Warren    Recent demonstrations of intermolecular coherence transfer  between proteins and bulk water in solution open us a  variety of novel applications to enhance signals in  biomolecular NMR and imaging.  600 MHz data on a modern  spectrometer with high sensitivity probes and fast gradient  pulses (done in collaboration) have proven the importance of  the technique.  500 MHz data with the existing spectrometer  are essentially useless for these studies.    * Dan Kahne    Multi-dimensional NMR is used extensively in a major project  directed towards understanding DNA-carbohydrate  interactions.  500 Mhz spectra show severe spectra overlap  in these systems, which have been shown to be substantially  reduced in 600 MHz spectra.    * Michael Hecht    Systematic design and synthesis of novel proteins for  compartive studies of structure and properties depend on  multi-nuclest, multi-dimensional high-field NMR for complete  assignment and solution structure determination.  600 Mhz  studies have been started in collaborative work.    * John T. Groves    Extremely high sensitivity proton NMR is required for  structural investigations of small molecules dissolved in  phospholipid membranes, and for studies of kinetics of  transmembrane ligand exchange.  The current 500 Mhz is not  sufficiently sensitive for much of this work, which is part  of a broad program to study the function and dynamics of  cellular membranes.          * Jannette Carey    Studies of protein folding and s tabilty and the relation of  these properties to ligand-binding activity require access  to multi-dimensional NMR capabilties with the dispersion  afforded by a modern 600 MHz spectrometer.    These research areas, spanning biostructural and physical  chemistry, present an extremely diverse set of requirements  that can only be met by a 600 MHz spectrometer.  Moreover,  the addition of a second high field would provide necessary  capacity for less restrictive utilization of the existing  500 MHz spectrometer.",
