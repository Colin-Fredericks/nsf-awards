The NNUN is supported by three directorates (ENG, MPS, BIO) and provides a pooling of specialized skills and instrumentation into distributed user facilities (i.e. a network') to facilitate world-class research/education across a wide range of user disciplines.  The NNUN is  a unique experiment to provide researchers access to sophisticate equipment  for the purpose of innovative discovery in the area of nanostructure materials and devices.  The network provides leading edge research tools in the area of nanostructures to explore the frontiers of knowledge' for an extended user community which would here-to-fore have had little opportunity to participate in the process.  The proposal request support for the acquisition of major state-of-the-art equipment {Electron Beam Lithography System, Support Equipment, Plasma Etch System, Magnetron Sputtering System and Chemical Vapor Deposition  CVD  reactor enhancements to improve research and eduction over the network for both graduates and undergraduates, scientists and engineers, and promote partnerships between academic researchers and private sector instrument developers.",
