 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daniel  IBN-9511681      Insect  flight is a highly efficient mode of locomotion. Interest  in  studies  of insect flight arises partially from the  need  to  develop new design criteria for artificial robotic systems.  This  research  project focuses on the development of  computer  models  for  flight and flight control in insects. The goal of this  work  is  to better understand how sensory feedback from the wings  and  pattern-generating circuits in the central nervous system  govern  flight performance. The current approaches of studying any single  component  of  insect flight (muscle mechanics, aerodynamics,  or  neural  control)  alone cannot be used as predictive  models.  In  this   work,   mathematical  and  experimental   approaches   are  incorporated into the models in order to understand  the  physics  of  force  production by muscles and the physics  of  aerodynamic  lift  and thrust generation by wings. Computer models will  solve  these  problems  of  physics  simultaneously  to  predict  flight  performance in the moth Manduca sexta, the tobacco hornworm moth.  This group of researchers couple these processes in developing  a  novel   biological  and  engineering  approach   for   a   priori  predictions  of  flight  dynamics  in  response  to  a  suite  of  physiological  and  physical parameters. By this  method  we  can  better  understand the physics, physiology and control of  flight  dynamics.",
