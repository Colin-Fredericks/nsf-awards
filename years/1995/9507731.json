 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural anthropology from the City University of New York.  The student will study the factors leading to the expulsion of some rural Mayan Indians from their traditional communities in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.  The student will measure the impacts of proselytization, political conflict, poverty, marginality, illness and alcoholism as causes of religious conversion in this one community.  Using a combination of a survey of a community of resettled Indians, ethnographic research in their community of origin as well as their community of residence, the student will estimate the strengths of the distinct factors leading to religious conversion as well as the importance of conversion compared with political factionalism in the expulsions.  This research is important because it will add to our expertise about this important area of the world, as well as shed light on the multiple factors leading to religious changes, local community conflict and urbanization in an under-developed society.  This case study will be valuable for the construction of general theory on these issues.",
