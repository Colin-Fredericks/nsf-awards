 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, bright luminescence was reported in GaN films with high  crystalline defect densities.  This result is puzzling since  crystalline defects usually quench luminescence.  That defects can  exist in light emitting devices without severe degradation of the  light output is very unusual and merits further study.  Dr. Palmer  will carefully examine the relationship between crystalline defects  and optical properties in GaN.  Samples will be grown by MOVPE at  NTT Optoelectronics Laboratories by Dr. T. Matsuoka, and  characterized (TEM, X-ray for crystal quality; PL for optical  properties, C-V and Hall effect for electrical properties; DLTS for  non-radiative defects) by Dr. Palmer working with graduate and  undergraduate students.  As part of this research, a graduate  student will be sent to Japan to:  visit Dr. Matsuoka's laboratory  and learn more about the growth of III-V nitides, visit other  Japanese laboratories actively involved in III-V nitide research,  and attend and present results at an international conference to be  held in Japan.    Interactive activities include:  organizing a seminar in which  prominent women in engineering and the physical sciences speak  about their work; teaching a challenging (required) upper division  undergraduate course, \"Introduction to Semiconductor Devices\"  during the spring term; and sponsoring an undergraduate woman  research intern through the host institution's Women in Engineering  Program (WEP).",
