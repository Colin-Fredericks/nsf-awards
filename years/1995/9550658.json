 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550658  Weiler  The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography proposes to hold  a workshop on the use of emerging computer technologies and aquatic  science data bases as undergraduate teaching resources.  These  tools enable any student with access to the internet and the  appropriate software, regardless of geographic location, to both  access and manipulate some the exceptional data bases presently  available through the Internet or on CD ROM.  The interactive  capability of Mosaic will enable students to ask their own  questions and manipulate data sets in ways of their own choosing,  and on a scale not possible with traditional student laboratory or  field experiments.  This is an exciting and challenging new way to  introduce students to the power of the scientific method.  The  workshop will bring together educators and data base managers to  discuss the emerging technologies in the context of undergraduate  teaching, to obtain hands-on experience with some of the existing  data bases, to develop a resource guide aquatic science information  presently available on CD ROM and the Internet, and to develop  recommendations on how best to assemble or enhance resources for  use in interactive hands-on undergraduate aquatic science  education.  Facilities will also be provided for materials used for  undergraduate aquatic science education and for sharing slide and  video materials used for undergraduate courses.  The workshop, to  be held in conjunction with the Society's annual meeting (June 11-  15, 1995 Reno, Nevada).",
