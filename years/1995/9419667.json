 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative Biology Core, consisting of a phosphorimager, a CCD  camera/image analysis system, and a spectrofluorometer with  stopped-flow capability will be established for the use of biological  scientists in the College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt University.  The main objective in the establishment of this resource is to enable  the participating scientists, and the undergraduate, graduate, and  postdoctoral students in their laboratories, to obtain quantitative  data, currently unobtainable due to the lack of access to appropriate  equipment.    The phosphorimager will allow quantitation of data presently collected  by autoradiography. Autoradiography is an inherently non-quantitative  technique. Exposure of a grain of film emulsion requires two photons.  Such two-photon processes under-report low levels of activity, because  at low levels, a high proportion of emulsion grains will have  interacted with only one photon and therefore remain unexposed on  development; and they under-report high levels of activity, because a  high proportion of photons interact with grains that have already been  fully exposed. Sensitivity to the low end can be enhanced by pre  flashing the film, but whether pre-flashed or not, the linear response  range is narrow, perhaps one log. In contrast, the proposed  phosphorimager can collect quantitative data over a four log range, and  collect it an order of magnitude faster than exposure of film. This  instrument will be applied to a wide range of studies, for example, the  quantitation of radiolabeled DNA, RNA, and proteins separated on gels.    The CCD camera/image analysis system will allow quantitation of data  presently collected qualitatively by photomicroscopy. For example,  immunofluorescence localization studies can be carried out on this  system with a resolution approaching that of confocal microscopy at a  fraction of the cost. A software-controlled stepper motor can be used  to acquire images from sequential optical planes, effectively optically   sectioning the specimen. Digitization of each field allows quantitative  analysis of the fluorescent marker in that field, which, combined with  the optical sectioning, results in quantitation within a predetermined  volume within the specimen. This facility will be employed in  immunolocalization studies in yeast, transgenic Drosophilia at various  developmental stages, Ascidian larvae, Dictyostelium cells, and  mammalian neuronal cells and tissues, and in studies of the assembly of  microtubules in vitro.    The spectrofluorometer will allow collection of quantitative  fluorescence intensity and kinetic data not currently accessible with  equipment available in the College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt.  For example, utilization of the stopped-flow accessory with the T-  format spectrofluorometer configured with excitation and emission  polarizers, for simultaneous acquisition of parallel and perpendicular  emission with polarized excitation, will allow real-time acquisition of  the association kinetics of nascent RNA transcripts with proteins that  make up hnRNP particles, peptide ligands with their cell surface  receptors, and regulatory proteins with Ca++-release channels, and of  tubulin into microtubules.",
