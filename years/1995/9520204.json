 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520204  Sitar  The January 17, 1995, Hyogo Nanbu Earthquake in Japan caused  extensive damage in the port city of Kobe, in adjacent  Osaka, and even in more distant Kyoto.  Over 5000 people  died, with thousands of dwellings and other structures  destroyed, and with close to 300,000 people displaced.  Preliminary damage estimates  place this event as the most  costly natural disaster in Japan in this century.  The  geologic setting, topography, and the level and the type of  development in the affected area suggest that there is a  great similarity to the San Francisco Bay area, and  specifically to the region along the Hayward Fault.  It is  also apparent that the geotechnical aspects of the  earthquake are quite significant.  Experience from the two  most recent California earthquakes, Loma Prieta and  Northridge, shows that it is critical that as much  information as possible be gathered and documented in the  immediate aftermath of an event, since the geotechnical data  is often highly perishable.  The objective of this research  effort is to perform a geotechnical reconnaissance of the  affected region, and to gather and document as much data  associated with the geotechnical aspects of the earthquake  as logistically possible.  Particular focus is directed  towards assessing the following: (1) liquefaction and ground  compaction, and associated ground displacement, (2) effect  of local soil conditions on ground surface shaking  characteristics and damage patters, (3) seismic response of  natural slopes, (4) the seismic response of earth  structures, and structural fills, (5) the influence of soil  conditions on the performance of port facilities, and (6)  the effect of surface rupture on damage to structures and  lifelines.  The reconnaissance is being planned in  cooperation with the leading geotechnical earthquake  engineers in Japan.  The team will promptly report its  findings tot he U.S. research community; especially via new  Internet Mosaic servers at the University of Southern  Ca lifornia and the University of California at Berkeley -  servers set up specifically to share information within the  geotechnical earthquake engineering community.  ***",
