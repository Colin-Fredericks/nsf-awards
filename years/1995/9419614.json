 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a shared equipment proposal for the acquisition of a high  performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC). HPLC provides a major  improvement over conventional chromatography by increasing resolution,  improving yields, and decreasing elution times and volumes. HPLC  separations are applicable to virtually any class of compound,  including small organic molecules, lipids, nucleic acids or  macromolecules such as proteins, due to the diversity of available  columns.    The requested HPLC consists of the basic components required to provide  a fully functional and highly versatile semi-preparative system. The  unit includes an IBM 486 computer with the appropriate software for  control of the individual HPLC components and data analysis; a single  two solvent pump system capable of gradient formation; a manual sample  injector; a Diode array detector for monitoring elution of a wide  variety of molecules  the Diode array permits the user to scan multiple  wavelengths during an experiment, which will allow the researcher to  determine if the eluted fraction is pure or not ; the Quick Res  software for analysis of co-eluting compounds; and an initial  assortment of HPLC columns to allow separations based on different  physical properties.    The requested instrument will enhance and modernize facilities  available for research and teaching in the department of Biochemistry,  Microbiology and Molecular Biology in addition to being available to  other faculty and students outside of the department. The HPLC system  will directly benefit several faculty research projects such as: 1) the  metabolism and degradation of tetracycline and hydrocarbons by  bacteria; 2) mechanisms regulating mammalian proteolytic enzymes, in  vivo and in vitro; 4) post-translational modification as a regulatory  mechanism in signal transduction processes in Dictyostelium; 5)  purification of phenolics and hormones; 6) studies of the intermediate  and slow blocks against polyspermy and embryonic stress tolerance in  f ucoid algae and 7) the regulation of membrane lipid and fatty acid  composition and the metabolism of these molecules in a variety of  eubacteria, eukaryotes and plants. The graduate and undergraduate  curricula in Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Biology at the  University of Maine include several laboratory courses that will also  be enhanced by the availability of a HPLC system. Proposed uses include  purification of monoclonal antibodies for Immunology; separation and  isolation of DNA and polymerase chain reaction products for Molecular  Biology and Bacterial Genetics; purification of proteins and peptide  mapping in Biochemistry; and characterization of membrane lipids from  several microorganisms for Bacterial Physiology. The inclusion of HPLC  within these courses will provide our students with an important  experience in using current methodologies. Such skills are commonly  required and are greatly beneficial for ensuring their competitiveness  for post-graduate studies, research jobs or careers.",
