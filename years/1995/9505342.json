The topics are: (i) Effect of viscosity on shock propagation  for hyperbolic conservation laws. (ii) Fluid-mechanic limits for discrete  velocity models for Riemann data. (iii) Formation of shear bands at high  strain rates. The proposed techniques are from the domain of qualitative  theory of partial differential equations, with the use of computational tools  when necessary to guide the theory. The proposed problems vary from concrete  models for specific phenomena, to general theory hyperbolic systems of  conservation laws, to developing techniques for studying the transition from  discrete to continuum theories.   The theoretical understanding of structures  such as shock waves and shear bands is critical for designing improved  algorithms in technological applications where such phenomena are dominant.  Shear bands are regions of intensely localized strain that appear during high  speed deformations of metals and often precede rupture. Shear bands play a  major role in ballistic penetration of metals and in various manufacturing  processes involving metals.",
