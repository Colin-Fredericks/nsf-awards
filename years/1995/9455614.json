The specific objectives are: 1) To develop a complete set of course  materials for BACCII, an already-existing iconic programming  environment under ongoing development at Texas Tech University, and  use them in the first two computer programming courses. For this  project, the first course is an introduction to procedural  programming, software engineering, and C, while the second course  teaches concepts in object-oriented programming, data structures  and C++. 2) To determine whether iconic environments (and BACCII in  particular) can be used to more effectively teach procedural and  object-oriented programming concepts in the first two courses,  while still allowing students to learn the syntax of text-based  languages such as C and C++. The grant would test out the course  materials at Texas Tech, while a possible later grant would allow  for pilot programs to be started at five higher education  institutions. Data would be collected and evaluated not only for  the general student population of each course, but for various  groups such as women, underrepresented minorities and future  teachers. 3) To advance research in the area of using iconic  programming languages as learning environments. The results of the  data will allow for an evaluation of how future iconic languages  for learning programming skills should be developed. If it can be  demonstrated that iconic languages perform significantly better  than text-based languages in the learning of programming skills for  a wide variety of schools and student groups, it could  revolutionize how software development techniques are taught.",
