 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buchanan  95-54236    The project objective is to demonstrate that a well planned scaleable shared municipal network infrastructure can serve an extremely broad constituency and provide mathematics, science, engineering and technology education and thus empowerment to a broad range of Memphis citizens with educational backgrounds ranging from low literacy to postgraduate.    We will continue to encourage and facilitate the direct delivery of information to populations which are very diverse, choosing particularly those whose needs are carefully matched to resources available to us. In addition, a new emphasis will be placed on training teachers, subject matter experts and community leaders in the efficient use of network resources as tools for empowerment. We will train these various constituencies to be both providers and consumers of network information.    We will convert our virtual network consisting of bandwidth obtained from each MECCA member's Internet connection to a true Municipal Area Network based on a single mode fiber ring which is accessible to essentially all parts of the city. We will use switched Ethernet technology as a precursor to Asynchronous Transder Mode and Broadband ISDN technology. Educational activities highlighting mathematics, science and technology will take place to and from various points on the network. Specific projects include (1) Network infrastructure support of a two university graduate biomedical engineering joint instructional and research effort (2) Network assisted disease prevention/health and wellness education, (3) A training and resource center available to various entities in the city but emphasizing teachers and senior citizens, (4) Senior citizens connectivity and cross-generational activities involving seniors and K-12 students, (5) Seminars, workshops and conferences which highlight client-server and other network based activities and (6) Joint biological science efforts between the University of Tennessee, Memphis and LeMoyne-Owen College. Oth er partners have already been funded or will seek their own resources to utilized this shared municipal network infrastructure. These include the LeMoyne Gardens Housing Project and the One Room Drop-In School for educational activities, the Mid South Community Network, proposed by members of the United Way of the Mid South as a way to provide citizen access to social service agencies, the Memphis Public Library and Information Center and several potential projects involving the portion of the network serving the Medical Center community.",
