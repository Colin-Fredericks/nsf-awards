 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528686  Shehar   Carbonaceous materials, because of their resistance to molten salt and high temperature conductivity, are used as electrode and cell lining materials in commercial molten salt electrolysis cells.  An important industrial application is in Hall-Heroult cells used to produce aluminum.  These materials can cause pollution and health problems because of the evolution of sulfur dioxide and other materials when the carbon sources and binders are baked during fabrication or in use as electrodes or cell liners for bauxite conversion, where they can evolve fluorine or cyanide.  This research will investigate micropyretic synthesis as a way to avoid much of the pollution during electrode fabrication.   The process involves the use of an exothermic chemical reaction to simultaneously synthesize and sinter the desired part.  Because of their superior microstructure, these materials can reduce the oxidation rate for electrodes and cell walls during operation in a cell.   The work will investigate the fundamental nature of the micropyretic microstructure of the carbonaceous materials, new micropyretic sources and ways to increase the flexural strength, and to quantify the environmental impact of micropyretic electrodes and linings in Hall-Heroult cells.     The impact of the research will be avoidance of sulfur dioxide emissions during electrode fabrication, a key part of the aluminum conversion cell, and reduced rates of emissions during the operation of these cells.  ***",
