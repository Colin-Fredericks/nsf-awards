 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project attacks two problems that involve teaching high  school mathematics.   (1) College Algebra is the first math  course for students with a wide range of mathematical skills.    They have all seen the material before, and many did poorly, so  some are bored, others flounder, and many become discouraged and  reinforced in their dislike of math.   This project converts this  course into a multimedia computer lab course, where students work  individually or in small groups on interactive workbooks that may  contain focused exploratory environments, video clips,  simulations, explanations, and exercises.   These books are being  written using ToolBook and the computer algebra system MathKit  and put on CD-ROMs.   Instead of lecturing, instructors are  available in the lab for individual help and guidance.   Students  are able to work on modules at their own pace, taking proficiency  exams when they are ready.   (2) The University also trains  future teachers of school mathematics, and among the courses they  take are Geometry and Teaching Math in the Secondary Schools.    Before this project, such preservice teachers had very little  experience with using computers, except as word processors.   But  proficiency with using a computer as a tool for learning math is  strongly endorsed by the NCTM Standards and is now expected by  state education agencies.    Both of these courses are being  renovated and offered in a multimedia computer classroom, making  extensive use of tools such as Geometer's Sketchpad, LOGO, TIM,  ToolBook and MathKit.  To support these reforms, the university  is purchasing 29 networked multimedia computers with a server and  several machines for instructors who are developing materials for  these innovative courses.",
