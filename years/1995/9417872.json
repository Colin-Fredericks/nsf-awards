 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417872     Osleger    The proposed research intends to investigate the Mid-Cretaceous  (Albian) Coahuila carbonate platform of northeastern Mexico, a  laterally-extensive, passive-margin platform that represents the  final major episode of carbonate sedimentation in the Gulf Coast  region.  The first objective of the proposed research is to  determine the history of Mid-Cretaceous relative sea-level changes  at time scales ranging from 104 to 106 years.  This aspect of the  project will involve the use of high-resolution sequence  stratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy to document cross-platform  relationships and interpret the temporal evolution of the Coahuila  platform.  The second objective is to determine the extent to which  Milankovitch-scale cyclicity is developed in Albian shallow-marine  carbonates of northeastern Mexico; Milankovitch periodicities have  been unequivocally recognized in coeval Albian deep-sea sediments  in Italy.  The third objective is to use the observed field  relationships to constrain two-dimensional computer models so that  rates, frequencies, and magnitudes of accommodation change through  Albian time can be quantitatively estimated for northeastern  Mexico.  The proposed cyclostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic  research is part of a larger-scale collaborative effort on the Mid-  Cretaceous of northeastern Mexico currently underway involving a  multidisciplinary team of biostratigraphers and  magnetostratigraphers associated with Project Albicore of the  Cretaceous Resources, Events and Rhythms working group.  The proposed research is expected to result in several major  contributions.  More precise global correlations of Albian  depositional sequences should be possible after the  cyclostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic results are  integrated with the refined chronostratigraphic resolution attained  by the collaborative researchers.  The improved geochronometry,  representing the merger of detailed sequence stratigraphy and  computer modeling with bio - and magnetostratigraphy, will permit  the quantitative estimation of rates and durations   of global  processes, and enhance interpretations of the regional- to global-  scale mechanisms governing sequence deposition (tectonism, eustasy,  environmental change).  A further application of this  interdisciplinary research on the relatively-uninvestigated  Coahuila platform is that a new model will be developed for  comparison with other Albian platforms worldwide, including the  economically-significant carbonate platforms of the Middle East.",
