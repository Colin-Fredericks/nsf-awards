 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy conservation is an important problem in battery  powered portable computers.  The objective of this  project is to investigate    software system techniques for conserving energy, using the  knowledge about current workload  and application  requirements.    More specifically, the project will:   (1)  Develop a systematic approach for evaluating energy  conservation techniques  whether they are implemented in  hardware or software. The evaluation will guide  the energy  driven hardware and software design.    (2) At the operating system  level, develop techniques to  control the devices using the mechanisms provided  by the  hardware to modify the behavior of common services for lower  energy  consumption.    (3) At the architecture level, design memory architectures  to  permit trade-off between performance and energy  consumption.    (4) Develop  file systems that exploit information about  applications' usage patterns and  the availability of low-  power solid-state memory.   (5) At the application  level, design program interfaces for  conveying information to operating system  about the usage  patterns and performance requirements.    A combination of  simulation and actual implementations will  be used to evaluate the techniques  described above.    The educational component of this CAREER project will  include the development of laboratory-oriented operating  systems courses for  both undergraduate and graduate  students. In addition, undergraduate students  enrolled in  independent studies will be encouraged to participate in the  research and development of software tools.",
