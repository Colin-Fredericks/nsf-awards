 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of mass, momentum and energy at the magnetopause  often occurs in a patchy and time-dependent manner, where MHD  mesoscale physics is important.  The proposed research is to study  the MHD mesoscale physical processes using a recently developed  macroparticle concept.  In particular, the theory of driven  reconnection as a process which occurs due to the dynamic  interaction of the solar wind and the magnetosheath with the  mangetosphere will be developed.  This model will be used to  quantitatively determine the threshold for the onset of  reconnection, the statistical distribution of mesoscale events, and  the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling parameters.  When the inhomogeneities of the plasma density, velocity and  magnetic field are taken into account, the interaction of  magnetofluids can be described as the interaction of a number of  localized filaments having a relative velocity and carrying  different magnetic fields.  The interactions between these  filaments and between the filaments and the ambient magnetic field  play a key role in the transport processes.  A macro-particle  description involving compressional and shear Alfvenons in cold  plasma limit has been introduced to describe these localized  filaments (Song and Lysak, 1994a).  The properties of these  Alfvenons, such as their magnetic dipole moment and polarization,  have been described and it has been shown that their interaction  can lead to an onset of reconnection depending on the IMF as well  as on the dynamic pressure impinging on the magnetopause.  The objective of this proposed research is to extend the concept of  Alfvenons, which provides a theoretical basis for patchy and time-  dependent driven reconnection, and to pursue further the  quantitative evaluation of the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling  parameter and the statistical prediction of the transient magnetic  field events.",
