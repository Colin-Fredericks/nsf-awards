 "awd_abstract_narration": "TITLE: and MIMD/SIMD Architectures    Parallel computing applications differ widely in the type of  computational paradigm that is best suited to efficiently  exploit their  parallelism.  Current software systems for  parallel hardware support only  single-paradigm computing.  The objective of this research project is to  investigate  system-level support for efficient multiparadigm parallel  computation.  Previous work on coordination languages and  multiparadigm  sequential programming languages form a solid  foundation for this research,  although significant new ideas  are required.  Although current high-performance  computer  architectures are moving toward a combined MIMD/SIMD  organization,  very little software and system support exists  for such hybrid computer  architectures. This research will  thus also focus on aspects of multiparadigm  computing for  massively parallel SIMD and MIMD/SIMD machines, including  the  Rewrite-Rule Machine as a testbed architecture.  The  research results will  enable future systems designers to  better appreciate the engineering trade-offs  to efficiently  support multiparadigm computing in a parallel environment.  The  results of this research are expected to enhance the  future programming ease of  high-performance massively  parallel computing systems.",
