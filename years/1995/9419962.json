 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419962  Isbell  This award supports a project to investigate the Upper  Carboniferous (?) and Permian glacial diamictite, basinal shale,  and fluvial coal-bearing strata in the central Transantarctic  Mountains that accumulated in a major sedimentary basin that  formed along the Paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana.  The basin  contains 1.5 km of upper Paleozoic strata.  At the time these  rocks were deposited, Antarctica was centrally located within the  Gondwana continent, and occupied a position near the Permian  South Pole.  Glacial deposits suggest conditions similar to the  present.  Within post-glacial strata, coal, fossil plants, and  the deposits of large prograding clastic wedges record a dramatic  change in  climatic and tectonic conditions.  Although Upper  Carboniferous and Permian rocks in the central Transantarctic  Mountains contain an abundance of information, they are primarily  nonmarine and lack invertebrate fossils.  Due to a present lack  of time control within these strata, the basin's geologic history  consists of numerous local mosaics.  Until time control is  obtained, the significance of events recorded within these local  sections will remain  speculative.  This study will examine Upper  Carboniferous (?) and Permian strata in the Shackleton Glacier  area in order to establish time control within the depositional  basin.  Sequence stratigraphic techniques, along with palynomorph  analysis, will be applied to the study of these rocks.  These  tools will help to constrain the location and timing of  regionally significant depositional, climatic, tectonic, and  paleoecologic events within Antarctica.",
