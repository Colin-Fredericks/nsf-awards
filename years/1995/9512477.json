 "awd_abstract_narration": "Request is made in this application for Biophysical  Instrumentation for the characterization of proteins. The instruments  are: a BIALite biosensor (Pharmacia), Isothermal Titration and  Differential Scanning Calorimeter (MicroCal), Dynamic light scattering  instrument (Protein Solutions, DLS), Stopped flow attachment (SLM, SF),  and Image Analyzer (Appligene, IA). These state-of-the-art instruments  allow characterization of the size, shape, and interactions of proteins  in rigorous, thermodynamic ways not previously readily accessible. The  group of instruments complement each other and represent a broad,  unified approach to studying the physical chemical properties of  interesting and important proteins. The Biosensor directly measures  protein-protein or ligand-protein interactions in real-time. The  Calorimeter measures the thermodynamics of ligand binding (ITC) and  denaturation (DSC) of proteins. The DLS provides direct determination  of the hydrodynamic radius of native proteins in solution. The SF  attachment will enable fluorometric kinetic measurements in the msec  region. The IA will facilitate quantitation of proteins on gels for  purity assessment, interaction analysis, record keeping, and  publications.          The major focus of the group of four investigators applying for  these instruments is the study of function related to structure in a  diverse set of proteins. The requested instruments are needed by this  group of senior and junior investigators to strengthen the physical  chemical basis of the structural studies that are being done. The  department currently contains a protein sequencing core facility, a  molecular graphics computing center, and a spectroscopic laboratory  (circular dichroism and flourescence). The five new instruments will  complement these facilities and enable the goals of characterization of  proteins and protein-protein interactions to be greatly enhanced with  this modern technology.          The four protein systems under study are: nerve  growth factor  (NGF), its receptors, and related neurotrophins; phosphofructokinase  (PFK) from several species; yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase; and  isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) with evolutionarily related  dehydrogenases. All four of the investigators heavily utilize site  specific mutagenesis. The characterization of the molecular weight of  the native state (by DLS) and the polypeptide chain (with the  assistance of IA) of mutant proteins is extremely important for  understanding the affects of individual amino acid residues on  function. Direct determination of the thermodynamics of ligand binding  to PFK and IDH will be greatly facilitated with the ITC calorimeter.  Direct studies of association of NGF with its receptors and the  association of the subunits of the ATP synthase will be possible with  the Biosensor. Characterization of the stability of native and mutant  proteins in all four systems willbe possible with the DSC calorimeter  and complement previous results of the stability of NGF from so~vent  denaturation. Rapid kinetic studies of ligand binding to IDH, PFK, and  the NGF receptor will be achievable with the SF attachment to the  currently existing SLM fluorometer and may be critical in the studies  of the catalytic site of PFK, IDH, and ATP synthase.          No other access to instrumention of this type currently exists at  FUHS. These instruments will also be made available to other  investigators in the school and will probably be more broadly used than  currently described.",
