 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the CONACyT Initiative funds a joint research project  between two groups: the Robotics Laboratory of the Department of  Computer Science at Stanford University and the Center for  Artificial Intelligence at ITESM in Monterrey (Mexico). There have  been several mutually beneficial exchanges (visits, courses,  research) between these two groups over the last four years.  The  purpose of this project to expand this cooperation, not only in  basic research, but also on applications such as manufacturing and  robot-assisted surgery.  The technical goal of this project is to  integrate object-tracking techniques from computer vision and  motion-planning techniques from robotics, in order to build a new  tool, called the Intelligent Observer (IO for short), that will  facilitate collaborative experimental research among geographically  dispersed groups. While this project builds upon the two groups'  strength in vision, planning, control, and robotics, the resulting  Intelligent Observer will be a tool to enhance their future  research capabilities in these domains. This tool will be used  interactively by people at one or several geographical locations to  observe and participate in an experiment implemented at another  site.  The hardware of the IO will consist of one or more vision  sensors mounted on mobile platforms available at the experimental  site.  The software of the IO will accept high-level commands input  by the users on their workstations, plan and control the motions of  the platforms to allow the vision sensors to acquire enough visual  information to meet the users' requests, apply image understanding  techniques to extract information pertinent to the users' requests,  and for each user, provide a pertinent graphic rendering of the  experimental scene on a display.  In addition to facilitating  remote collaborations in research, the IO technologies should also  benefit operations such as telepresence, teleconferencing,  surveillance, and interactive TV.",
