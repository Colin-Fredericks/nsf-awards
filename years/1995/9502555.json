The research component concerns three theoretical  projects investigating helium 4:  the properties of films at  submonolayer coverages; the hydrodynamics and phase  transitions in a novel, low temperature state; and the  description of devices using lithographic technology to  pattern helium films.  Also planned is theoretical support  for ongoing experiments on two dimensional electron gasses  at the institution of the Principal Investigator.  The  teaching component is the revision of the Introductory  Physics course for majors, including the integration of  computers into the curriculum.  %%%  This CAREER grant contains two parts:  research and  teaching.
