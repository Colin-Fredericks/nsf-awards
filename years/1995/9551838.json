 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project adds equipment to support a restructured General  Biology course for science majors.   Over the past two years, the  Biology Department has successfully revised the two-semester  General Biology course to focus around themes, to be less lecture  intensive, and to emphasize student-directed research projects.    Enrollment has increased from an average of 54 students per  semester to 80, and the retention rate of biology majors has  increased.   While development of an experiential, investigative,  hands-on approach to science has been successful, labs had  insufficient equipment to support the semester-long research  projects that had been integrated into the course structure.    This project creates six workstations for use by each of the lab  sections of 20 students.   Each workstation is used by teams of  three to four students.   Each team is provided with a Ph meter,  a spectrophotometer, stereo microscopes with dual illumination, a  top loader balance, and a Macintosh Power PC.   In addition, a  new incubator and two growth chambers are available to all  project teams and, when not in use, to other biology majors  conducting research projects.",
