 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics departments in the nations's doctoral institutions  represent a powerful resource for fulfilling important national  needs.  From improving quantitative literacy to training scientists  and engineers, from connecting universities and industries to  educating the next generation of mathematics teachers, these  departments have the potential to make a real difference in areas  that extend well beyond their own majors and boundaries.   Universities have become vitally engaged in efforts to assess their  role, exploring new thinking about scholarship, reform in  curriculum and teaching and the relationship between undergraduate  teaching, graduate training and research.    Since nearly every student who enrolls in a university takes a  mathematics course at some point, mathematics is strategically  positioned--even obligated--to affect the role of the university  and improve in teaching, learning and scholarship.    This project will identify critical issues related to quality  mathematical experiences for undergraduate students in doctoral  institutions, set strategies for implementation of the  recommendations of recent reform reports and develop a continuing  agenda enabling mathematics departments to assure quality  undergraduate and graduate programs at doctoral institutions.  The  project will highlight activities that work in departments across  the country, engage both faculty and administrators in dialogues  about programs and resource needs, and give departments the  information and means necessary to replicate or adapt successful  programs.",
