 "awd_abstract_narration": "94109067  Zwollo  B-cell-specific activating protein (BSAP) is thought to play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of several B-cell-specific genes, including (CD19, CD20, V(pre-B) IgH, Ca, and blk.)  BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene, a member of the Pax gene family of homeodomain class transcription factors.  In this project, the molecular nature of Pax-5 gene transcripts and proteins will be investigated in mouse spleen and B-cell lines.  Preliminary results have revealed that at least two alternative splicing products are present within the murine B-cell population.  The presence and structure of those, and any additional alternatively spliced Pax-5 isoforms in vivo will be investigated.  To study the structure/function relationships of the different Pax-5 isoforms, the following basic questions will be addressed:  1) What is the structure of the different isoforms?  2) How do the different isoforms effect in vivo transcription?  3) Can the different isoforms interact with their DNA target, the BSAP-binding site?  4) When are the different isoforms present during B-cell development ?  5)  Which areas on the Pax-5 isoforms are involved in protein-protein interactions?  These studies will increase our  understanding of the functional roles that Pax-5 plays during B-cell development, as well as contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation throughout B-lymphocyte development.  %%%  B-lymphocytes or B-cells are responsible for producing circulating antibodies in response to antigen stimulation and are an essential component of the immune response. B-cell-specific activating protein (BSAP) is thought to play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of several B-cell-specific genes.  BSAP is encoded by the Pax-5 gene, a member of the Pax gene family of homeodomain class transcription factors.  In this project, the molecular nature of Pax-5 gene RNA transcripts and proteins will be characterized in mouse spleen and B-cell  lines, and the structure/function relationships of the different Pax-5 gene products will be determined. These studies will increase our  understanding of the functional roles that Pax-5 plays during B-cell development, as well as contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation throughout B-lymphocyte development.  ***",
