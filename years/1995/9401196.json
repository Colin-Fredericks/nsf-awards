 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401196  Kirk       Paul Kirk and Eric Klassen intend to develop powerful tools  to compute and analyze gauge-theoretic invariants of  3-dimensional manifolds, particularly Chern-Simons invariants and  the spectral flow of the signature operator, with an emphasis on  manifolds with boundary.  The techniques to be used include the  theory of boundary-value problems for Dirac operators, Massey  products in differential graded Lie algebras, and the  representation theory of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.       Over the last decade, gauge theoretic topology has grown  into one of the most important current fields of mathematical  research.  It involves an interaction of ideas from topology,  analysis, differential and algebraic geometry, and theoretical  physics.  The exciting techniques resulting from this interaction  have been used to answer fundamental questions about 3- and  4-dimensional manifolds which had been completely resistant to  pre-gauge theory methods.  The research to be undertaken forms  one of the basic ingredients of both the 3- and 4-dimensional  theories; it will provide information important for cut-and-paste  methods in the 4-dimensional Donaldson theory, as well as  providing computations for 3-dimensional topological quantum  field theory.  ***",
