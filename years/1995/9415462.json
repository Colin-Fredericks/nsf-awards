 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cowgill    Under the direction of Dr. George Cowgill, Ms. Vicki Cassman will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze  remains from three prehistoric cemeteries located in Arica, Chile  and which date from the period between A.D. 300-1200. Because of  the hot and dry climate human remains as well as delicate  cultural materials are extremely well preserved, and in addition  to ceramic vessels, these prehistoric graves contain abundant  textiles. Decades of archaeological research have indicated that  this lowland coastal area of Chile has served at least once and  perhaps repeatedly as the destination for groups of individuals  who moved westward out of the Andean highlands. Ms. Cassman  wishes to understand the long-term mechanisms of culture contact  and to determine how, over long periods of time interactions  developed between host and immigrant groups. She will use  stylistic analysis of both interred bodies and included grave  goods to achieve this goal. Textiles play an important role in  traditional Andean cultures and a great deal of effort goes into  their production. Cloth, with its distinctive designs, serves not  only utilitarian and decorative purposes, but also functions as  an ethnic marker. The designs it contains and the manner in which  it is woven reveals both the status and ethnic identity of its  wearer. Therefore it provides an excellent medium for the  analysis of cultural process.    The Andean and Coastal region of Western South America is marked  by strong latitudinal zonation. Resources change dramatically  with height and different groups both historically, and  presumably prehistorically adapted different strategies to assure  an adequate supply of different goods needed for survival. In  some cases this was achieved through trade, in others through  conquest and in others through colonization. Archaeologists wish  to understand the range of strategies and to determine the  situations in which different approaches were employed. Through  the use  of mortuary analysis, Ms. Cassman will have a uniquely  rich data base to examine this question. The results will be of  interest to many archaeologists. The project will also assist in  the training of a promising young scientist.",
