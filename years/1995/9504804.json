 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Andrei Tokmakoff  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Tokmakoff received his doctoral degree from   Stanford University under the supervision of Professor Michael Fayer.    Dr. Tokmakoff  will continue research at the University of Chicago under   the sponsorship of Professor Graham Fleming.  His postdoctoral research   will target the study of solvent modes in water, aqueous solutions, and   other complex liquids.  Femtosecond visible pulses will be used to   understand low frequency modes and structural evolution of liquids with   5th and 7th order nonlinear Raman spectroscopy and linear Raman-induced   Kerr effect experiments.  Theoretical advances will be made in the   description of high-order nonlinear experiments, particularly in the   description of the influence of orientational motion on coherence   experiments.  The research will contribute to our understanding of the   concepts and techniques of ultrafast spectroscopy of condensed phase   chemical systems.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
