 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417225  Lowe      This award partially supports the travel expenses for Dr. Rex L.  Lowe and a graduate student from the Department of Biological  Sciences at Bowling Green State University, Ohio, to conduct  cooperative research with Barry J. F. Biggs, Ecosystems   Scientist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric  Research, located in Christchurch, New Zealand, over a two  year period.  The research will focus on mechanisms that regulate  spatial and temporal differences in the structure of periphyton  communities in stream ecosystems.    Disturbance, as used in ecological studies, denotes an event  causing disruption in an ecosystem, community, or population  structure and changes resources, substrate availability, or the  physical environment.  The ability of a community to resist the  effects of a disturbance is referred to as resistance and the  ability of a community to recover to some predetermined state is   termed resilience.  This study will examine resistance and  resilience factors regulating benthic algae communities in  twelve New Zealand South Island streams, six on the west coast  (high disturbance) and six on the east coast (low disturbance).    The laboratory-based experiments will be conducted at the  University of Michigan Biological Station Stream Research  Facility which provides numerous replicated artificial stream  channels.  The laboratory experiments are designed to examine  variables which appear to have a strong regulatory influence in  the natural New Zealand streams.  Most of the New Zealand  streams are fully protected (within the New Zealand National  Parks and Reserves System), and provide a unique natural outdoor  stream environment where one can investigate streams with similar  or contrasting physical, chemical and biological traits.    Support for the visit by Mr. Biggs to the University of Michigan  facility is provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Research,  Science and Technology under the U.S.- New Zealand Cooperative  Science Progra m.",
