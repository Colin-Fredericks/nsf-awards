 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS 9504918   PI:  Song Yang  Institution:  Texas A&M  Title:  Weighted Empiricals in Regression with Survival Data     Abstract:      This research involves various semiparametric regression models,   with right, double or interval censoring. These models include   the commonly used multiplicative hazard model and the log   transform of accelerated life model, the relatively new frailty   model, and the rarely studied multiplicative odds ratio model. In   all these models, the covariates are allowed  to be   time-dependent.  The weighted Nelson-Aalen hazard function and   Kaplan-Meier survival function are defined via weighted   empirical processes and some self consistency equations.   Various estimating equations and estimating functions are   established using these weighted functions. Some classes of the   regression estimators, including the rank, minimum distance and   M-estimators, are then  obtained and analyzed.         The  efficiency and robustness of the estimators   and some goodness-of-fit tests of the models is studies, as well as the   practical issues on computing these estimators.     The models and related statistical problems studied in this   research have applications in areas such as medical follow-up   studies and industrial reliability tests. In situations involved   in those areas, the available data are often incomplete due to   various censoring.  The censoring is attributed to  the conditions   of the patients or machine operating systems and is  influenced by   factors such as treatment, age, stress, and  load. These influences can   be formulated by some of the models in this research. Through studies   of these models and related statistical problems, the conditions of the   patients or operating systems can be better understood,   predicted, and controlled.  Compared with the existing research  literature, the new methods in this research  will require   different or more sophisticated computing algorithms.   Implementations of these methods provide  a background to, and are   facilitated by, efficient coding and high performance computing.",
