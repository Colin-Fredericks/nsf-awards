 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400945  Lewis       Lewis will investigate a number of problems related to  embeddings of continua in manifolds and other spaces with a  uniform structure.  Techniques involving inverse limits,  accessibility, and prime end structure will be studied.  He is  seeking characterizations of when various inverse limits can be  embedded in the plane and when homeomorphisms of continua can be  extended to homeomorphisms of the plane.  He is also  investigating continua with the property that all of their  nondegenerate proper subcontinua are equivalently embedded, or  which admit rigid embeddings in the plane, and various  homogeneous embeddings in real 3-space.  Determining the  existence of an indecomposable continuum which is almost  homogeneously embedded in the plane will be important in the  study of dynamics.  Questions relating embeddings and extensions  of maps to computation of Hausdorff dimension and to attractors  and cofrontiers are among dynamic topics related to this  project.       Lewis hopes to narrow the currently large gap between known  theorems and existing examples in the theory of continua by  broadening the base of the theory and looking for generic classes  of examples and construction techniques.  Recent work in discrete  dynamics indicates that considerations of embeddings and  extensions of maps are crucial in identifying which sets can be  attractors or closures of orbits, how sensitive dynamic  properties are to perturbation, and what type dynamics is  possible or even generic.  These investigations should yield more  information about the continua themselves and new ways of  approaching problems which until now have proven slow to yield to  attacks.  Possibilities for new approaches lie in the areas of  decompositions, homogeneity, characterizations of spaces, and  investigations of subcontinua.  ***",
