Girls of this age, who are beginning to lose confidence in their ability to solve  mathematical problems, need an extra boost in order to stay in the science-math-engineering  \"pipeline.\"  The clubs are to involve girls working with their classmates and teacher on  investigations that:  (1) introduce them to the realm of mathematical thinking (logic, visual-  spatial reasoning, statistics, number theory) which extends far beyond the arithmetic that is  traditionally emphasized in these grades; (2) are conductive to multiple approaches,  interpretations, and solutions and that promote discussion about these approaches; (3) require  strategy and team working; (4) incorporate appropriate technology, including building materials,  calculators and tool-based software.  A collaboration with teachers and volunteers from the  business community is proposed to implement several model math clubs during the course of the  project.  The clubs are to meet for at least one hour per week during the semester, and initially  will be led by a classroom teacher working with a TERC staff member to link club activities  with classroom work.  Thus, the clubs should provide teachers with a means of deepening and  extending their own mathematical understanding as they explore new investigations that can later  be modified and introduced during the regular math class.  During the second round of  implementation, clubs are to be co-led by the teacher and a volunteer from a local business, who  will serve as a mathematically-skilled role model for the students.  Another important element  of the club is parent involvement.  Parents (especially mothers) need to know how they can  encourage and support their daughters mathematically, and to experience the excitement of  working on meaningful mathematics problems wit h their daughters.  The clubs are to be based  on Investigations in Number, Data and Space, a new K-5 curriculum, developed at TERC and  published by Dale Seymour Publications.  This curriculum is specifically designed to reach a  diverse group of learners, enabling all students to find their own passions reflected in the  activities, and encourage deep and thoughtful mathematical work across an extended period of  time.  ***",
