Miller  IBN 9418077  University of Illinois-Champaign    Exocytotic Signalling Through Sperm Receptors for Eggs    The overall goal of these studies is to gain a clearer  understanding of the process of fertilization at a molecular  levelwhich will result in a greater ability to increase or decrease  fertilization rates.  In order to manipulate this process,it is  imperative that we identify receptors on sperm and eggs that  interact to allow sperm to bind to eggs.  These studies build upon  previous work that has identified a receptor on mammalian sperm  that binds an egg coat glycoprotein.  ZP3 is a glycoprotein found  in the egg coat that binds to beta 1,4-galacotosyltransferase  (GalTase) that is found on the surface of sperm.  Following  binding, ZP3 causes sperm to release the acrosome, an enzyme-filled  vesicle whose contents digest a pathway for sperm through the egg  coat.  The acrosome reaction is required for fertilization.   However, the mechanisms by which ZP3 induces the acrosome reaction  are not understood.  The lack of progress has been primarily due to  a gap in our knowledge of ZP3 receptors and signal  transduction molecules.  With the recent discovery that sperm  GalTase serves as a specific receptor for ZP3, signaling  events following binding may now be studied more rationally.   Importantly, recent evidence suggests that aggregation of sperm  GalTase by ZP3 elicits the release of the sperm acrosome.  Thus  GalTase may act not only to bind ZP3, but also as a receptor to  initiate signaling mechanisms leading to the acrosome reaction.  Because it is difficult to study signaling during the acrosome  reaction in sperm, an analogous model system will be used that can  be made to express GalTase, Xenopus laevis oocytes.  Both sperm and  oocytes release vesicles (acrosome or cortical granules) in  response to appropriate activators.  For a variety of technical  reasons, vesicle release in Xenopus oocytes is easier to study. In  these experiments it is proposed to: 1).  confirm that GalTase  binding in sperm results in signal transduction and release of the  sperm acrosome, 2). determine if Xenopus oocytes expressing murine  GalTase on their surface specifically bind ZP3, 3). ascertain if  GalTase initiates signaling events in Xenopus oocytes, causing  release of vesicles, and 4). determine which cytoplasmic amino acid  residues in GalTase are required for GalTase-induced egg vesicle  release and to investigate which signaling molecules they activate.  Collectively, these specific aims will determine if GalTase is  simply a non-signaling adhesion molecule or if, like some other  adhesion molecules, it also transmits a signal intracellularly.   These studies will identify important signals during vesicle  release.  These aims will also determine the feasibility of  studying acrosome release using a new and innovative system.  This  system should allow a clearer understanding of how a sperm receptor  for the egg receives a cue from the zona pellucida and initiates  the process of the acrosome release.  ***",
