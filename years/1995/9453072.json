The project is  designed to provide the more than 20 thousand K-12 science  teachers and administrators attending the 1995 annual conference  of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) with  information that promote inclusion of students with disabilities  in precollege science education.  The dissemination activities  are to be conducted at the Convention Exhibition Area during the  1995 NSTA Conference in Philadelphia.  Project participants have  extensive experience and expertise in science education for  students with disabilities.  Members of the Science Association  for Persons with Disabilities (SAPD) will assist in staffing the  exhibit.  (Many of these experts have disabilities.)  Project  participants will accumulate and reproduce materials for  distribution at the meeting.  Other materials will be exhibited  and requests for copies will be taken and subsequently mailed.   Records of the materials disseminated and other activities  including on-site interactions during the five days of the  exhibit will be maintained and reported.  The project should  result in heightened awareness of K-12 science teachers to the  abilities of students with disabilities to perform successfully  in precollege science, and knowledge regarding the availability  of resources should result in increased inclusion of these  students in science education.***",
