 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this CAREER research proposal is the design,  semantics, and implementation of ATDCC, a language for a network  of  asynchronously communicating reactive programs.  Reactive  systems are tightly  coupled, event-driven systems that react  continuously with their environment at  a rate controlled by the  environment. Asynchronous systems are those in which  processes  are loosely coupled and communication can take arbitrary amount  of  time.  Complex applications, arising commonly in practice,  typically require  the combination of both these ideas, thus  motivating ATDCC.  ATDCC is expected  to have the following  advantages: (1) support for hierarchical construction of  programs/specifications; (2) good foundational properties; (3)  efficient  implementation as a network of asynchronously  communicating automata; (4)  verification of safety properties,  including real time constraints.  This  research is aims towards  the creation of a complete programming environment for  modeling  and analyzing complex electro-mechanical systems.    This CAREER  project includes active involvement in education, in  conjunction with the  research program.  The research program  itself involves the participation  of students, who will  benefit from the exposure to industrial  experience.  The  education plan includes course and curriculum development, for  both graduate and undergraduate students, incorporating current  research in the  general area of interest in the project.  An  undergraduate parallel programming  laboratory is planned to  collaborate, disseminate and share resources with  institutions in  the Chicago area.  The laboratory and curriculum development  are  intended to lead to undergraduate participation in research.",
