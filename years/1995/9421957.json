High-quality, superconducting  films of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide are grown in-situ in four  different crystallographic orientations, and layered, in most  cases in-situ, with normal metals ( superconductors above their  superconducting transition temperature), insulators and  ferromagnetic metals.  Our primary goals are to establish the  existence and magnitude of a proximity effect in these materials,  perform proximity electron tunneling spectroscopy to extend our  knowledge of the intrinsic gap parameter properties and to study  the spin transport across the superconducting interface.  The  latter measurements will be performed in collaboration with  scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D. C.  %%%  Technical Abstract:  This is an experimental research project  directed at measuring electronic and spin transport across  interfaces to high-temperature superconductors.  These  experiments will be performed on four different crystallographic  orientations of the high-temperature superconductor yttrium-  barium-copper-oxide.  High-quality, crystallographically oriented  superconducting films are grown and layered with a variety of  materials, including insulators, normal metals and magnetic  materials.  Our primary goals are to understand the leakage of  superconducting pairs into a juxtaposed normal metal, determine  details of the intrinsic superconducting state and to measure  spin transport across the superconducting interface.  The spin  injection experiments will be done in collaboration with  scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory.  ***",
