 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503304  Dickinson    This award is for the acquisition of surface electron  spectroscopy instrumentation to serve a number of faculty and  students at Washington State University who are working in the  area of advanced materials research.  The specific  instrumentation requested is an electron spectrometer (ES),  combining an Auger Electron Spectrometer (AES),  X-Ray  Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS), and Ultraviolet Photoelectron  Spectrometer (UPS), including the necessary vacuum system,  electronics, and data acquisition/data presentation system.  This  facility will  provide new capabilities at Washington State  University not presently available.  The research that will  benefit from this instrumentation includes efforts in thin film  synthesis and processing, surface modification, laser surface  interactions, tribology and fracture, and characterization of  materials on an atomic level.  AES/XPS allows both qualitative  and semiquantitative analysis of surface composition and,  combined with UPS, provides critical information about electronic  and chemical structure.  A key requirement at WSU is that the  facility be configured for both direct use by experiments and for  routine surface analysis.  To achieve this dual purpose, we will  purchase a complete spectrometer with two load lock sample  introduction ports and temperature controlled sample stage.  Because many of the users require unique vacuum experiments  and/or sample preparation and treatment in a controlled  environment, we will build a flexible experimental/sample  preparation treatment chamber to be attached to the main analysis  chamber.  The use of this second chamber will be scheduled in  large time blocks (about 3-5 weeks) to allow different users to  clean, configure, and use this system to their best advantage.  This combination allows the capability of performing experiments,  growth studies, and/or in situ sample preparation with  accompanying surface analysis under UHV conditions.  Simultaneously, without conflict,  samples can be introduced  into  the analysis chamber from the outside for routine analysis.    Acquisition of this capability is essential for research  activities in a number of departments within the University,  including Physics, Chemistry, Mechanical and Materials  Engineering, Geology, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical  Engineering.  This activity is organized under two crosscollege  organizations.  The Center for Materials Research and the  Materials Science Program have been recently established to  address the interdisciplinary nature of Materials Science.  The  Center for Materials Research consists of 20 senior participants  from 6 different departments and was formed with the purpose of  encouraging collaborative, crossdisciplinary projects in the area  of materials science and engineering and applied condensed matter  science. The Materials Science Program is the graduate  educational arm of the materials science thrust at Washington  State University; the Program was initiated in the Fall of 1990  and is the most recently created Ph.D. program in the University.    In the projects described below there are a total of 21 graduate  and postdoctoral students whose research will directly benefit  from the acquisition of this ES system. There are an additional  12 students involved in other projects described in this proposal  whose research would significantly benefit from these surface  analysis techniques.  It is anticipated that other graduate  students and faculty will be attracted to use this  instrumentation once it is acquired and demonstrated. The AES/XPS  system would also provide substantial benefit as an instructional  instrument for both graduate and undergraduate students impacting  at least 10 additional students.",
