 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523456  Sirkis         This proposal describes the development of a sensor system  capable of remotely monitoring the progression of decay in wood  utility poles used to support overhead transmission lines in  power distribution networks.  This shall be done by detecting one  or more of the following chemical/biological metrics of decay:  (1) presence and/or concentration of decay causing fungi, (2)  end-products of metabolic growth of the decay causing fungi, (3)  decrease in critical nutrients required to support fungi  metabolic growth, (4) increase in enzymes, (5) decrease in the  ratio of carbon to nitrogen, and/or (6) decrease in pH. Detection  of these chemical metrics of decay shall be accomplished by  developing a multifunctional integrated optic-based sensor system  that utilizes Bragg gratings etched into planar waveguides.  Part  of the waveguide will utilize Bragg grating with an upper  cladding fabricated from chemical species.  As binding occurs,  the propagation constant of the waveguide changes, resulting in  corresponding changes in the Bragg wavelength.  Highly sensitive  interferometric-based demodulation schemes will be developed to  monitor the chemically-induced changes in the Bragg wavelength.   A higher order Bragg grating located on the same waveguide will  be used aid optically probe the cellular structure in order to  monitor pH and/or florescence indicative of the targeted  metabolic by-products of decay.  The sensor technology we propose  offers (1) high rejection of electromagnetic noise, (2)  compatibility with optical fiber telemetry so that sensor data  can be transmitted simultaneously with communications signals  thereby making possible remote pole inspection, (3)  multiplexibility so that many sensors can be fabricated into the  same planar waveguide, and many planar waveguides can be located  along the same optical fiber lead, and (4) manufacturing  processes similar to those used in the microelectrics industry  thereby making possible sensors amenable to l ow cost mass  production.  ***",
