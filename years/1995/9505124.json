It is well known  that existing resampling schemes perform very poorly under   such dependence structures. Two new resampling   schemes for long-range dependent data are investigated.   These schemes are  a sampling-window   method based on subsamples of the data and a bootstrap  method based on finite Fourier transformations.   Their   effectiveness in different inference problems is examined.     The phenomenon of long range dependence, such as the   concentration of  an air-pollutant in a city observed at closely   located sites, occurs when the data are highly correlated.  This   sort of data has a high level of variability, even after averaging.    The research involves developing suitable resampling  schemes for long-range dependent data that will provide good statistical  estimates.   The research has direct applications in Hydrology,   Geology, Economics, and Environmental problems.",
