 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the fabrication of high-power circulators. Ferrite junction circulators that operate under high power conditions are currently narrow band devices, since they are necessarily biased above ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). In order to increase the frequency bandwidth and still operate at high power Massachusetts Technological Laboratory  proposes to fabricate circulators in a six-port geometry. In a six-port design the ports are alternatively connected to open circuits which serve as stub-tune capacitors. In preliminary calculations, it has been shown in six-port design that it is possible to achieve a bandwidth of 15 % of the central circulation frequency. This is compared to a conventional junction circulator biased above FMR where the bandwidth is approximately 5% of the central frequency. High-power wide-band circulators capable of handling a few hundred kilowatts are currently needed in the design of R/T modules deployed in front of power transmitters. Researchers believe that the proposed work will have potential for both military and commercial applications.",
