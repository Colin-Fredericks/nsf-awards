 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454341  Goldberg    This five year national project will promote a deeper understanding  of physical science among elementary school teachers and enhance  the  pedagogical and computer technology skills of secondary school  physics and physical science teachers. This will be accomplished  through a set of constructivist-oriented workshops that feature  specially designed computer programs. In Phase I, year-one,  computer programs for four physics topics (SERIES I): Light,  Electric Circuits, Static Electricity and Magnetism will be  refined. Five additional topics: Small Particle Model of Matter,  Color and Vision, Heat and Temperature, Force and Particle Motion  and Wave Motion (SERIES II)  will be developed. These all focus on  the development of \"powerful ideas\"; a set of which form a  conceptual framework. In Phase II, Year-2, elementary school  teacher workshops with SERIES I & II materials will be held. Each  workshop with 5-days of intensive instruction for one topic will be  grouped with others to provide a minimum of 15-days plus one day of  follow-up. Concurrently, but separate from the elementary school  teachers, secondary school science teachers will attend a single  workshop of 12-days plus a two 2-day follow-up session. These  secondary school teacher workshops will help teachers develop a set  of learning strategies using the computer materials and low-tech  materials to create a constructivist-oriented classroom . A total  of 72-teachers will participate in these training programs.    In Phase III the training of the elementary and secondary school  teachers in the use of these materials will continue both at the  San Diego site and sites across the nation. For the latter, 24  geographically distributed leadership teams: a university faculty  member, a high school physics or physical science teacher and an  elementary teacher, will participate in a six-week training program  at SDSU during each of two summers. Two sessions will be held each  summer, each accommodating 12-teams.  After the first summer of  training each leadership team will be fully supported, with monies  and senior personnel guidance, to deliver their first second tier  workshop of 1-week duration.     During Phase IV each leadership team will provide second tier  workshops which have a minimum of 3-weeks enhancement for a  teacher. A minimum of 1-workshop for each of three years is  required. Partial support for these is provided on a reimbursement  basis. These second tier participants may earn graduate credit  for  these workshops.",
