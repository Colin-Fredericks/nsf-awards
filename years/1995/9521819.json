 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521819  FAUTIN   Sea anemones are important members of marine ecosystems.  They occur at all depths, from deep-sea vents to coral reefs, where they can displace or replace hard corals under some conditions.  In fact, studies of anemones in this latter context are important for understanding the effects of global change on corals and coral reefs.  Dr. Fautin is one of only five systematists in the world dealing with sea anemones and she is the only one in North America.  She will remedy this situation by training one MS student, two PhD students and a post-doctoral fellow.  A database of anemones of the world will be developed, including digitized images of species and electronic keys that can be utilized by non-systematists as well as systematic researchers.  Both morphological and molecular data will be utilized in the monographic treatment of these organisms.   This award will support the training of new practicing systematists dealing with sea anemones.  Our knowledge of this neglected element of marine biodiversity will be markedly increased and the information resulting from this project should be of use to researchers studying marine community ecology, population biology, global change, biogeography, etc..  Knowledge of relationships among species for this group has potential economic value as well, since sea anemones have been a focus of research involving bioprospecting for pharmaceuticals, such as anesthetics.",
