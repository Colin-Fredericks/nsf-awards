The focus is  on metallic systems, including transition metals and rare  earth metals.  The magnetic order and the surface atomic  moments of transition metals of the 3d, 4d, and 5d series  will be studied by spin-polarized electron energy loss  spectroscopy.  The magnetic domain structure of gadolinium  films below and above the bulk Curie temperature will be  investigated by spin polarized secondary electron emission  microscopy.  Magnetic ordering phenomena in  antiferromagnetic films will be studied by preparing  multilayered materials which include thin ferromagnetic  layers between the antiferromagnetic layers.  The research  is focused on fundamental magnetism issues, but the results  will also be of much broader interest, particularly in the  context of information storage technology.  %%%  This research project investigates ultrathin multilayers of  magnetic metals.  The magnetic behavior of the multilayers  depends on the thickness and composition of the various  layers--in ways that are incompletely understood.  The  experimental approach involves study of the interaction of  magnetic electrons with the thin films.  The scattering of  the magnetic electrons by the materials can be analyzed to  deduce important information about the magnetic state of  the films.  The materials are of fundamental interest, and  have great technological relevance in the context of  information storage technology based on hard drives, and  related devices.  ***",
