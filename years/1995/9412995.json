 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Caribbean Marine Research Center (CMRC) is one of six  National Undersea Research Centers.  CMRC's marine field  station on Lee Stocking Island (LSI) in the Exuma Cays,  Bahamas comprises 28 buildings, a 915-meter airstrip, nine  research vessels, wet and dry submersibles, and  recompression chamber and an underwater habitat.  The  station affords access to a pristine marine environment with  a diverse array of tropical habitats including shallow and  deep coral reefs, grassbeds, sand flats, mangroves,  submerged carbonate terraces, subsea caves, blue holes,  tidal channels and stromatolites, a unique bio-geological  feature.  During 1993, 131 visiting scientists and students  conducted research in the fields of benthic ecology,  invertebrate biology, fisheries ecology, oceanography, coral  reef ecology, paleo-oceanography, macroalgal ecology,  aquaculture, global climate change, coral bleaching and  marine geology.  In addition, a limited number of field  courses and workshops were held at LSI.  However, the  station is hindered by a paucity of accommodations for  visiting scientists, and the lack of a suitable lecture and  workshop facility, which prevents CMRC from meeting numerous  requests to conduct field courses, workshops and research.  The proposed partnership between CMRC, The College of  William & Mary (W&M), and NSF would significantly enhanced  the utility of one of the most productivity marine field  stations in the Caribbean.  Specifically this project will  provide for the construction of a dormitory and  lecture/workshop building at LSI.  Key contributions by CMRC  include property for the facility, support services, and  administrative framework for coordination of activities, and  maintenance of the building over the facility's lifetime.",
