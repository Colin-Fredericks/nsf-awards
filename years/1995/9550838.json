 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this grant, the university is purchasing lasers and  associated spectroscopic equipment.   The approach in the project  is to combine the strengths of the chemistry and physics  curricula and to take advantage of the small class sizes  characteristic of the university.   In the upper-division  courses, equipment is shared between the two departments and  students from the two departments collaborate with each other.    An excited state lifetime experiment is being performed by both  sets of students.   In addition, chemistry students are exploring  molecular rotations, light scattering, and vibrational  spectroscopy.   Using essentially the same equipment, physics  students are studying the properties of laser light, measuring  the speed of light, exploring nonlinear-optical phenomena, and  characterizing dispersion in optical fibers.  The project also  affects lower-division students.   A new course, designed for  non-science-majors, centers on holography.   In this four-credit  course, containing both a lecture and laboratory component, the  nature of light is discussed along with introductory optics,  principles of measurement, physiology of vision, and quantum  versus classical effects.   In addition, a historical perspective  on many of these topics is presented.  Chemistry majors are  required to submit a senior research thesis based on experimental  work.   The equipment purchased expands the areas of research  accessible to these students.",
