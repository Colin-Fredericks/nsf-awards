 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553460  Stith  The Ohio State University Physics  Department is submitting a proposal  to the National Science Foundation  under the NSF Graduate Research  Traineeship Program. Our proposal  is that five Graduate Research  Trainees be funded each year for  five years. These students will  work to earn PhD's in physics with  specialties in physics education  research. Their training will focus  on the theory and methods of  teaching and learning in physics  and on the use of technology to  enhance that learning. These  efforts will involve collaborations  with several private companies. The  five specific objectives of our  proposal are as follows.  A) To produce PhD physics graduates  who develop the research and  teaching skills and the knowledge  about cognition and learning that  will prepare them to lead future  efforts to improve science  education in the United States.  B) To produce PhD physics graduates  who gain the knowledge and develop  the skills to produce and implement  effective systems of learning based  in part on the use of technology.  C) To increase the number of  talented PhD physics graduates from  traditionally underrepresented  groups who have this knowledge and  these skills.  D) To increase the number of PhD  physics graduates trained in all  areas of physics who also have the  knowledge of physics education  research to implement new forms of  instruction in the education  systems in which they may work in  the future.  E) To help produce a positive  systemic change in the learning  system of a state university with  over 50,000 students --a change  that better prepares these  undergraduate students for the  twenty-first century information-  age workplace.  We propose that the five Graduate  Research Traineeships be funded in  physics at OSU each year for five  years. The cost to the NSF for  these Traineeships will be $112,500  per year. Ohio State University's  matching contribution of $27,000  per year will be realized by paying  the tuition of the NSF support ed  trainees in excess of $8400 per  year and in $100 per year of  miscellaneous support and travel  for the trainees.",
