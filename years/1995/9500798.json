 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500798  Sussmann  Research will be carried out on nonlinear control theory,  continuing the principal  investigator s previous work in this area on a broad class of  problems in optimal control,  applications to robotics, feedback stabilization, and  nonholonomic motion planning.  The  methods used will be those of differential geometric control  theory, nonsmooth analysis, and  the theory of real analytic maps and their associated  stratifications.  Necessary mathematical   tools will be developed to solve a number of open problems in the  areas of optimal control,  controllability, and realization theory.  In particular, recent  results of the principal investigator  on the Pontrayagin Maximum Principle for systems of vector fields  will be extended, with the  goal of proving a general Maximum Principle for systems of  differential inclusions under  minimal hypotheses.  The question of the regularity of optimal  trajectories will also be  addressed.    The proposed research fits within the general framework of  control theory, which is  concerned with design problems in which some components of a  dynamical system are  accessible to a controlling agent that can modify them so as to  alter the system s behavior.    The object is to control the system so as to achieve a desired  behavior, or meet some  specifications.  Situations of this kind occur everywhere in  engineering as well as in all of the  physical and biological sciences, and many apparently different  problems turn out to have  common structural features from the mathematical point of view.   The purpose of the  mathematical theory of control systems is to study these features  in a systematic way and to  develop techniques for solving particular design problems, such  as causing a robot arm to  carry out a particular task, or keeping an antenna focused.  The  issues considered in this  project deal with (a) optimal control, in which the goal is to  determine how to control a system  so as to optimize some criterion; (b)   stabiliz ation, where the  object is to drive the system  towards some desired operating point and keep it there; and (c)  motion planning, where it is  sought to find a control strategy that will cause a system to  move along some prescribed  path.  ***",
