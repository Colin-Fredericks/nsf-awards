 "awd_abstract_narration": "To linguistically represent and encode the visual world  (i.e., to talk about what we see) requires a crucial interface  between language and spatial cognition. Signed languages can  provide unique insight into this interface because physical space  is used directly to encode linguistic and spatial relations.  American Sign Language (ASL) differs from spoken languages in  that it is expressed with the hands in space and perceived by the  visual system. Thus, ASL also presents an opportunity to explore  how the modality in which a language is conveyed affects the  nature of grammatical encoding (e.g., how languages express  different linguistic relations) and the nature of language  processing (how people interpret and produce language in real  time). Currently, very little is known about language processing  in ASL, and the proposed studies will be some of the first to  investigate how a visual language is perceived and understood  on-line. The studies explore the ramifications of using space for  expressing linguistic contrasts in referential and spatial  domains. Specifically, the experiments focus on the use of space  to express coreference relations, frames of reference, and  spatial information. The major goal of the research is to explore  the grammaticization of space in sign language and its impact on  language processing.   The project contains two primary lines of inquiry: 1) on-line  tracking of spatial anaphora and 2) the use of space to represent  space. The first group of experiments explore how signers  understand and maintain the association between referents and  their spatial loci during real time processing. The results of  these experiments will provide insight into the nature of the  processing mechanisms required for sign language and will help  determine what aspects of referential processing hold across  language modalities.  The second line of experiments investigate the consequences of  using space to represent space by investigating how deaf signers  create spatia l mental models from signed discourse, how signers  chose a spatial reference frame, and how signers integrate  physical signing space with a mental representation of space.  These experiments will illuminate how physical space is  manipulated linguistically to communicate locative information  and will clarify how such spatial structure is interpreted during  processing. Together, these results will elucidate the nature of  the interface between language and spatial cognition.",
