 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, part of the joint ONR/NSF Program on Interfaces to   Superconductors and supported by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials   Research, and Electrical and Communications Systems, Professors Chang and   Marks of Northwestern University are studying the properties of   interfacial growth regions between films of high-temperature   superconducting (HTS) materials and insulating metal oxides.  Atomic   layer epitaxy (ALE) will be employed using a pulsed organometallic beam   epitaxy system which is capable of growing metal oxide films with atomic   layer precision but is also adaptable to large-scale low-temperature   conformable metal oxide films growth as required in manufacturing.    Superconductor/insulator heterostructures will be investigated under a   variety of growth conditions and microstructures and interdiffusion   properties will be evaluated by a variety of physical techniques,   including various electron and atomic-force microscopies.  Surface   chemical processes will be directly monitored as a function of growth   conditions during ALE.  Improving the nature of interfaces in high-temperature superconducting   materials and insulating metal oxides is a crucial barrier which must be   surmounted before HTS materials can be successfully incorporated on a   large scale into electronic device technologies.  This study will provide   the information needed to fabricate key structures for HTS-based   electronics and an accurate evaluation of the potential of different   growth techniques in this arena.",
