 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453092  Koch    The work proposed addresses attitudinal and educational barriers faced by girls with severe  disabilities, grades K-8, in preparing them to undertake demanding courses of study leading to  career options in science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM).  The project involves the  collaborative efforts of the University of Minnesota General College, the Minnesota State  Department of Education, the Minneapolis Public Schools, the St. Paul Public Schools, and the  Parents Advocacy Coalition for Equal Rights.  In order to promote traditional self-determination  characteristics of assertiveness, creativity, self-advocacy, and decision making, this project seeks  to achieve its goals through a focus on the computer-based technologies which support self-  determination skills, taking full advantage of powerful computer technologies, both extant and  emerging.  This should provide a structure through which girls with disabilities can take more  autonomous roles in their education, social lives, and educational, occupational, and  independent-living decision-making.  The project targets girls in elementary and junior high  grades in view of the need to make early adaptations and decisions, especially regarding  mathematics course success to permit students to be in a position to pursue rigorous secondary  and postsecondary courses of study in relevant fields.    The project is focused upon:  (1) aggressive training in state-of-the-art and emerging adaptive  computer technology which makes the learning and doing of science, engineering, and  mathematics more possible for persons with severe disabilities; (2) peer training, with mentor  and role model interactions; (3) immersion via telecommunications in opportunities to interact  with other girls with disabilities, as well as with mentors and school personnel; (4) training of  school-based personnel to better ensure early, meaningful accommodations in SEM courses and  co-curricular activities; and (5) aggressive dissemination to promote ch ange in the ways in which  the futures of girls with disabilities are imagined by the girls themselves, their families, and  those charged with their education and futures planning assistance.  The project builds on a  history of successful collaboration among the participant entities in serving the needs of students  with disabilities.  It addresses the fact that these girls face barriers of gender and disability, and  thus often are blocked from pursuit of study and careers in SEM, growing up to become women  with disabilities--currently the most underemployed segment of our population.  ***",
