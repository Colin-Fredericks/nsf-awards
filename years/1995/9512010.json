 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objectives of this project are to build and make available for secondary analysis a collection of social and behavioral science data sets with racially and ethnically diverse samples, to publicize the availability of those data sets, and to encourage the multi-disciplinary use of the data for new studies of psychosocial, cultural, economic and behavioral factors in relation to adaptive and maladaptive development and individual productivity.  This new collection will be added to the current holdings of the Henry A. Murray Research Center of Radcliffe College, an archive with over 200 data sets.  A distinguished project advisory committee will help Murray Center staff identify and evaluate studies for the archive.  The Murray Center is the only data archive in the country that offers a comprehensive collection of longitudinal studies, the only archive that makes available original records, and the only archive that enables longitudinal follow-up of an existing sample. The data sets will be thoroughly cleaned, organized and documented for ease of use by new investigators.  The availability of the data sets will be widely publicized, and several programs will enusre that the data are used well for high quality new research.  The data are available without charge to researchers at all levels. As a result of its  multidisciplinary focus and it's potential contributions to the research of many investigators, this project will yield substantial theoretical advances in the social and behavioral sciences as well as providing data that will inform social policies.      The kind of data necessary for significant progress in the social and behavioral sciences is becoming ever more difficult and expensive to gather.  For example, no longer content with simple laboratory investigations, the field of psychology is increasingly turning to multi-faceted longitudinal investigations conducting in real world settings with diverse subject populations.  Yet the resources for conducting this research conti nue to dwindle.  The present project addresses this conundrum by building and making available for secondary analysis a collection of social and behavioral science data sets with racially and ethnically diverse samples.  Moreover, the availability of the data sets will be widely publicized, and several programs will ensure that the data are used well for high quality new research.  The data are available without charge to researchers at all levels. As a result of its multidisciplinary focus and it's potential contributions to the research of many investigators, this project will yield substantial theoretical advances in the social and behavioral sciences as well as providing data that will inform social policies.  In particular, this project is  highly relevant to the Human Capital research agenda, with data pertinent to questions of how education,  disadvantage, families, and the workplace contribute to the realization of people's potential to be productive citizens.",
