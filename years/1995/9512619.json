The College is committed to the quality of its education and research programs in the environmental sciences which are enhanced by its strategic location and proximity to the Mullica River and the Atlantic Ocean.  In 1993, in direct support of Marine, Biological and Environmental Sciences, the College purchased approximately 7 acres of land on the Nacote Creek, which is part of the intercostal waterway system, to develop an Environmental and Marine Science Field Station.  The Nacote Creek site is within the nominated Mullica River-Great Bay Estuary National Research Reserve which is characterized by freshwater wetlands and saltmarsh natural habitats.  Aqueous natural habitats are also very common, ranging from high salinity open water bays and lagoon environments, to extensive tidal channel and pond development in variable salinity wetlands, and to fres hwater stream systems leading from the uplands.  Stockton has invested significantly in adapting existing buildings to teaching purposes.  An NSF-ARI is directed at increasing the research capabilities.  The next step is to construct a new facility with state of the art teaching and research capacity.  This project will assist in the developing a plan and architectural design for the new building.
