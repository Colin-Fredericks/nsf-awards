 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to study trace fossils in the  Permian and Triassic portions of the Beacon Supergroup in the  central Transantarctic Mountains.  The sedimentary sequence in  the central Transantarctic Mountains indicates that during the  Permian and Triassic this portion of the paleo-Pacific margin of  Gondwana was successively covered by a continental glacier  (Pagoda Formation), flooded by an inland sea (Mackellar  Formation), blanketed with sediment deposited by rivers flowing  across a sandy braid plain (Fairchild Formation), and covered  with sands and silts deposited in braided river channels and  floodplains (Buckley and Fremouw Formations).  This sequence of  events was induced by amelioration of the climate and changes in  tectonic regime.    Although the rich floras of the Buckley and Fremouw Formations  and well preserved vertebrate fauna of the Fremouw Formation are  the subject of continuing extensive studies, little is known  about the benthic fauna that inhabited the widespread inland  waters throughout the Permian and Triassic and its response to  climate change.  The animals themselves are not preserved as  fossils, but biogenic structures, including both trace fossils  (ichnofauna; discrete tracks, trails and burrows) and ichnofabric  (general disruption caused by biologic activity), give  information about the benthic fauna that produced them.  This  information includes: 1) the size and general body plan of the  producers, giving keys to their identity; 2) an approximation of  the faunal diversity; 3) the behavior of the producers; 4) the  environmental preferences of the producers; 5) the use of trophic  and spatial resources by the producers; and 6) the activity and  abundance of the benthic fauna relative to physical and  depositional processes, as reflected by ichnofabric.    In this study, the trace fossils and ichnofabric in diverse  subaqueous facies within the Mackellar, Fairchild, Buckley and  lower Fremouw Formations will be described and interpreted t o  develop a picture of the Permian and earliest Triassic benthic  aquatic fauna and its response to climate change.  Trace fossils  and their sedimentological context will be described and  photographed in the field, representative specimens will be  collected for laboratory study, and the extent of sediment  disruption by animals will be evaluated.  Samples will be cut and  polished in the laboratory to elucidate trace morphology and  enhance ichnofabric.    Very little is known about ancient nonmarine aquatic benthic  communities and ichnofaunas, in spite of the fact that these  habitats have been occupied since the Paleozoic.  Recent work  suggest that major changes in these communities occurred during  the Permian and earliest Triassic when burrowers became more  abundant.  This study will provide rare documentation of  ichnofaunal (and indirectly faunal) distributions in diverse  aquatic environments at a crucial time during evolution of  aquatic benthic communities, and will uniquely address the  question of how aquatic benthic faunas responded to climate  amelioration after glaciation.    Equally important, data collected will be used to assess the  ichnofaunal similarity in correlative units between Antarctica  and other Gondwana continents, particularly South America and  Africa, and to test hypotheses regarding differences between  ichnofaunas found in equivalent depositional regimes in marine  and nonmarine environments.",
