We recently   presented new local  alignment algorithms (Lawrence et al. 1993,  1994) based on Bayesian   modeling and  Gibbs sampling. In this project, we propose to  develop several extensions   of our original Bayesian model  to accommodate various practical  situations, and to   investigate several statistical problems arisen from our study of  the alignment problem. On   the applied side, we wish to accomplish the following: (1) relax  the existence assumption   and develop Bayesian models to simultaneously detect and align  the common  multiple   motifs in the sequences; (2) combine the idea of Markovian  structure modeling of   sequence data (e.g., hidden Markov Model) with the block-based  method of Lawrence et.   al. (1993) to enhance the alignment of multiple motifs; (3)  modify and apply  the   methodology developed previously and in this project to several  other important biological   problems: the detection of subtle sequence signals in noncoding  DNA region; the   prediction of protein secondary structures; and the combination  of threading and alignment.   On the theoretical  side, we attempt to (4) understand the nature  and potential of predictive   updating in connection with the bootstrap,  the Bayesian  bootstrap, and general   nonparametric problems; (5) develop model selection criteria that  are useful for   determining pattern width in alignment problems; (6) study the  influence of prior   specifications  on the results and frequency properties of these  results in  Bayesian   classification problems; and finally, (7) study convergence  properties of several sampling   algorithms.    During  the award period, I will develop my own styles on teaching  introductory probability   and statistics courses with an emphasis on statistical thinking,  and get involved in a   program designed to attract talented undergraduates into our  field. I will also make an effort   to develop new graduate level courses on  current research areas  such as image processing,   missing data, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, genetics and biology. My  guideline for directing   graduate students is: independence, connections, and creativity.            9501570  Liu    Abstract (nontechnical)    A wealth of data concerning life's basic molecules, proteins and  nucleic acids, has emerged   from the biotechnology revolution. The human genome project has  accelerated the growth   of these data. Multiple observations of homologous protein or  nucleic acid sequences from   different organisms are often available.  However, since  mutations and sequence errors   misalign these data, multiple sequence alignment has become an  essential and  valuable    tool for  understanding the structures and functions of these  molecule, aiding efforts at   protein modeling,  structure prediction and engineering; and   shedding light on molecular   evolution and phylogeny construction in molecular systematics.  Traditional algorithms for   finding such alignment are either too computationally expensive  so as to limit their   applications or too heuristic so that the sensitivity to subtle  patterns is lost.  We recently   presented new local  alignment algorithms (Lawrence et al. 1993,  1994) based on a    probabilistic model of the sequences and a  stochastic simulation  technique  called the   Gibbs sampler. In this project, we propose to develop several  extensions of our original   probabilistic  model  to accommodate various practical  situations, and to investigate several   statistical problems arisen from our study of the alignment  problem. On the applied side,   we wish to accomplish the following: (1) relax the existence  assum ption and develop    more general mixture  models to simultaneously detect and align   common  patterns in   multiple homologous biological sequences; (2) investigate the  connection between our   method and  other successful approaches such as the hidden Markov  modeling; (3) modify   and apply  the methodology developed previously and in this  project to several other   important biological problems: the detection of subtle sequence  signals in noncoding DNA   region; the prediction of protein secondary structures; and the  combination of threading and   alignment. On the theoretical  side, we attempt to (4) understand  the nature and potential   of the  predictive updating, a new  iterative simulation method,   in connection with the   bootstrap,  the Bayesian bootstrap, and general nonparametric  problems; (5) develop model   selection criteria that are useful for determining pattern width  in alignment problems; (6)   study the influence of prior specifications  on the final  alignment results; and finally, (7)   study convergence properties of several stochastic simulation   algorithms.
