 "awd_abstract_narration": "For health care reform to achieve increased access while constraining cost increases, we need a system for making decisions about the use of new technologies and other services that is widely perceived to be fair.  Reforming an institution requires a thorough knowledge of how it works, however.  Currently, decisions by HMOs and other insurers to limit the use of new technologies are controversial and mysterious; we know little about how they are or should be made.  This project undertakes the empirical and ethical analysis necessary to understand existing processes and improve them.  The three year interdisciplinary project is being carried out by a philosopher, a psychiatrist with clinical and managerial experience in an HMO, the Program Coordinator for an HMO committee involved in decisions about new technologies, and a medical anthropologist with expertise in using ethnographic methods in medical contexts.  With other support, the team is surveying an association of HMOs to determine the methods in use for making decisions about new technologies and conducting an in-depth study of decision-making by the Committee on Appropriate Technology at the Harvard Community Health Plan.  With interviews, participant observation, and analysis of documents and videotapes, this support will allow the study of `focal cases` that reveal how three major collaborating HMOs and the Oregon Health Resources Commission make decisions on the same new technologies.   In consultation with collaborating HMOs, the team will then develop guidelines for an improved and morally acceptable process.  It will disseminate the results through associations of HMOs and through appropriate journal publications, as well as a monograph.  Finally, using interviews, it will assess the impact of a publicly accountable procedure in HMOs on research and development attitudes of producers of medical technologies.   A morally acceptable, publicly accountable process for making decisions about new technologies in HMOs and other insurers can be generalized into a model for making other decisions limiting the use of beneficial services; the result may also be generalizable to other contexts of decision-making about the dissemination of technologies.  The project will interest health policy makers and implementers as well as scientists and engineers involved in research and development decisions.",
