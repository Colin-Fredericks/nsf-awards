 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511764  Laurent    Although brains and computers are thought to be quite similar,  the mechanisms which they use to encode and store information are  fundamentally different. This is partly because computers were  developed by engineers using tools of formal logic to solve  rather limited sets of problems, while brains were developed over  millions of years with selective pressure of evolution as the  only engineer. Indeed, brains evolved to increase the chances of  survival of their \"owners\", and thus primarily to facilitate the  detection of prey, predators and mates. Consequently, they  succeeded in solving the very complex problems of pattern  recognition, problems which present computers are notoriously  poor at handling. How do we recognize something as complex as a  face or an odor, how do we store their infinite number of  possible appearances, how does our brain represent them with  neuronal activity patterns? To understand this, we must  understand coding in the nervous system; we need to determine the  rules that underlie stimulus representation in the brain.  Conventional views of coding by the brain hold that information  resides in the average number of impulses produced per unit time  (rate coding); the role of relative timing of impulses produced  by groups of neurons has not been carefully evaluated. The work  of this young scientist focuses on circuits that process smells.  Experiments are designed to determine whether the relative timing  of neuronal impulses (temporal coding) is a potential carrier for  information.",
