 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500577  Wierdl      The investigator will work --- possibly in collaboration with several   other researchers ---  on questions in almost everywhere convergence   that come out of some recent results in this area. Some of these   questions concern the almost sure convergence of averages of   measurements made on a stochastic process at a random sequence of   times that is  chosen in advance. Other questions concern subsequence ergodic  theorems for subsequences coming from members of Hardy fields, along   bases for the integers, and along sequences with big gaps.      Ergodic theory grew out of statistical mechanics, the statistical   description of matter. This latter means, for example,  that instead   of describing the behavior of each individual water-molecule in a cup   of water, one is satisfied with finding the AVERAGE speed, energy etc.   of the molecules. But then the fundamental question arises: HOW can we   measure the average speed or energy.  It is clearly impossible to measure the speed of each individual   molecule and then take the mean of the data. The   ergodic theorem says that it is enough to select   a SINGLE molecule, measure its speed in each second, and if  we make enough measurements and take the average of the data the   number will be basically the average speed of ALL the molecules in the   cup of water. This amazing theorem has one drawback: it requires that   the measurements are taken EXACTLY at every second. But in practice,   the measurements might be made at,say, 1.1, 2.4, 2.9 .... seconds   instead of at 1, 2, 3 ... seconds. Obviously, we would like to know   whether we still can compute accurately the  average speed from the   measured data. The proposed work addresses this VERY difficult   question from various point of view (depending on WHAT causes the   imperfect timing of measurements).  ***",
