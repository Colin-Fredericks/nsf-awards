Regionally, 700 teachers from the  San Francisco Unified School District and the San Mateo School  District and 20 others are included; nationally the project brings  50 TE-workshop providers, attending as teams, into the program as  teacher-leaders.  The four integrated levels of the project are:         *    a 100-hour introductory Teacher Institute where teachers            receive instruction science content as well as an            introduction to inquiry based learning,       *    a 90-hour Advanced Theme Based Institute with Follow-up            Sessions where teachers grapple with issues of theme-            based teaching and implementing standards-based systemic            reform,        *    a program of Leadership Development for Teacher Leaders            who design and implement professional development            workshops in the Bay area and around the nation, and        *    follow-up Workshops in all areas plus a Teacher            Networking Program to provide an outgoing community of            support.    Each year of the project 4-teachers who are alumni of the Teacher  Institute will leave their classrooms for 1-year and become  Teachers-In -Residence at the EXPLORATORIUM.  These teachers-In-  Residence will work with the EXPLORATORIUM on a long term basis to  sustain the Teacher Institutes.",
