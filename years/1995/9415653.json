 "awd_abstract_narration": "Popper  9415653    As our theoretical understanding of the structure and evolution of  stars advances, greater and greater demands are made on the  reliability and accuracy of the fundamental properties of stars --  their masses, radii, and temperatures.  This proposal will advance  our empirical knowledge of these properties into the relatively  unexplored realm (because of strong selection effects) of stars  less massive than the Sun down to about 0.6 solar masses.  The only  source of information on fundamental properties of normal stars  accurate enough to test modern theories of stellar structure and  evolution is detached eclipsing binaries.      Several factors provide the wherewithal to overcome the  difficulties posed by the selection effects, which result from the  low luminosities and small sizes of the less massive stars.  First  is the availability of the Hamilton eschelle-CCD spectrometer at  the Lick Observatory, which is unsurpassed for the effective  observation of spectra of double-lined eclipsing binaries down to  about the 12th magnitude.  Second is the availability of efficient  computer programs (IRAF programs in this case) for obtaining  reliable radial velocities of both components in the spectrum.   Even though the lines in the crowded spectra are washed out   by axial rotation and badly blended, cross-correlation of the  binary star spectrum with one from a star of known velocity does  the trick.  Third is the availability of computing equipment (now  routine) for rapid application of the programs.      The resulting masses in the new realm, obtained from analysis of  the binary star orbits, will be essential in a wide variety of  problems in stellar astronomy.   ***",
