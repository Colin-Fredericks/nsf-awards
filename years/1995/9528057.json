 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528057  Luco  This project uses the extensive seismic response data recorded  within the Hualien, Taiwan, 1/4-scale model of a nuclear  containment structure to validate a set of mathematical models  and computer codes. These mathematical models and computer codes  are used to calculate the seismic response of important  structures when the effects of the interaction between the  structure and the surrounding soil are significant.    The Hualien experiment is being conducted by a consortium of  organizations including the Electric Power Research Institute  (EPRI) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the U.S.  and institutions from Taiwan, Japan, Korea and France. The first  task of the project is to predict the seismic response of the  containment model on the basis of ground motions recorded on the  free-field ground surface away from the structure. In a second  task, the predictions are compared with the observations to  obtain an overall assessment of the current capability to model  the seismic response of structures partially embedded in soils,  when soil-structure interaction effects are important. Finally,  identification techniques are used to infer from the recorded  data some of the characteristics of the structure and the soil.  ***",
