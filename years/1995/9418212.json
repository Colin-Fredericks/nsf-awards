 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418212  Osmond    Egypt is attempting to expand development in oasis areas in the Western Desert through enhanced utilization of ground water from the Nubian aquifer. This large aquifer has been characterized as a classic artesian system, with permeable sandstone water-bearing horizons only a few hundred meters beneath the shales and limestones at the surface.  Extensive pumping has lowered the potentiometric surface, and it is important to know to what extent the ground water is replenishable by recharge in the highlands to the southwest,  Light element isotopic studies have shown that some of the ground water reached the aquifer during periods of wetter climate such as may have occurred 8,000 years ago.  The pumping of this  ground water is non-renewable mining.     The use of U isotopes to determine water was developed at FSU and can be applied to the proportions of ground water  by source.  Field trips to the oasis areas and review of the available isotopic data confirmed the view that the Nubian aquifer is ideally suited for the analysis of mixing sources by uranium isotopic methods.    Approximately 120 five-liter samples will be collected from the six major oasis areas during four field trips over a two-year time span.  The field work and basic preliminary sample treatment steps will be done by Egyptian.  The isotopic measurements and data analyses will be conducted at FSU.  At least one Ain Shams graduate student will work as an exchange scholar at FSU.  Annual exchange visits by both FSU and Egyptian scientists are envisioned and will promote scientific research and graduate education at Ain Shams University as well as FSU.  Finally, the research will provide invaluable information for Egyptian hydrologists in the formulation of plans for utilization of the ground water resources in the Sahara desert.",
