The Division of Materials  Research, Division of Advanced Scientific Computing, and  Division of Mathematical Sciences are all supporting this  research.  The investigator is collaborating with  researchers at Sandia National Laboratory and Los Alamos  National Laboratory, and the computing will take place on  the University of New Mexico parallel supercomputer located  in Kihei, Hawaii.  The project focuses on the microscopic  properties of copper and aluminum grain boundaries and  defects, and the impact of substitutional impurities and  vacancies on the chemistry of these intergranular  interfaces.  The work is motivated by the failure of Cu and  Al interconnects used in semiconductor chips.  These  problems arise from a phenomenon called electromigration in  which the electron wind caused by high current densities  results in the formation of voids that diffuse and aggregate  along grain boundaries, ultimately forming cracks in the  metal and leading to catastrophic failure.  These  calculations represent some of the largest ab initio  materials calculations ever attempted.  The investigator is  writing the parallel molecular dynamics code using the  portable, parallel C++ class library that she has developed  in collaboration with the Object-Oriented Particle  Simulation Project at the Los Alamos Advanced Computing  Laboratory.  The defect physics is coupled across quantum  and mesoscopic length scales through successive ab initio  refinements of the interatomic forces used in dynamic  simulations.  %%%  This project is part of the Computational Approaches to Real  Materials (CARM95) program.

The project is motivated by the failure  of copper and aluminum interconnects used in semiconductor  chips.  The project simulates defects in these materials and  how they evolve in the presence of high electric currents,  eventually leading to failure resulting from small cracks.  These calculations represent some of the largest first-  principle materials calculations ever attempted.  A better  understanding of the atomic-level principles that apply in  the simulations will help to design interconnects that have  improved properties.  ***",
