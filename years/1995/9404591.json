 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404591  Zeidan       A general optimal control problem is considered in  which the control and/or state constraints are of the form  of an inclusion in a convex set.  The accessory problem when  the data functions are differentiable with Lipschitz  derivatives will be derived.  A new term is expected to  appear and hence, this is a generalization of the envelope-  like effect (introduced by Kawasaki). The results will be  expressed only in terms of the original data.  New second-  order necessary conditions for strong local minimality of  the above problem form the second part of this project. This  is a long-standing problem. The key idea of this research is  based on suitably modifying the time transformation,  introduced by A. Ya. Dubovitskii and A. A. Milyutin, in  order to obtain a new problem to which the second-order  necessary conditions for weak local optimality (developed in  the first part of the proposal) could be applied.  The third  part of this project is to develop the sufficiency theory  for the case when pure state inequality constraints and  control set constraints are present.  This research involves  a modified Riccati equation and the study of connections  between the three concepts:  Riccati equation, coupled  points, and positive definiteness of the second variations.       This project lies at the heart of optimal control  theory, a subject which was developed in the 1950's mainly  to deal with problems emanating from engineering,  natural  resources, and economics. This field, which is a branch of  optimization, could be described as follows:  Find a  candidate that produces the smallest cost (or the largest  return) while meeting given requirements.  The latter are  referred to as constraints.  \"First order optimality  conditions'' serve to produce a list of possible candidates  for the smallest cost.  In practice, many of them do not  furnish the least cost.  Hence, there is a need for another  test to screen the candidates and to obtain a short list.  This test evok es what are known as \"second order  conditions''.  In this project, second-order optimality  conditions for optimal control problem with very general  constraints will be derived.  In fact, several recent  problems in aerospace science, industrial process control,  robotics and mathematical economics can be formulated as  optimal control problems with such general constraints  (state and/or control set).  However, in this complicated  setting no satisfactory second order conditions are  presently available.  Thus, when accomplished, this research  will provide new tools to assist engineers and economists in  the selection of optimal strategies.  ***",
