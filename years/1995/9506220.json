 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506220  Schedl    Arrest of the cell cycle in prophase of meiosis I is a conserved  feature of oogenesis in essentially all multicellular animals.  Oocytes in organisms from starfish to humans maintain this arrested  state until ovulation by a mechanisms that is not well understood.  This proposal introduces a genetic strategy for isolating and  characterizing molecular regulators of meiotic prophase cell cycle  arrest. Recent genetic screens performed in the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans have identified mutants where oocyte arrest  in diakinesis of MI prophase fails to be maintained. In oar-1 and  oar-2 mutants (oar= oocyte meiotic prophase arrest defective),  oocytes leave arrest and endomitotically replicate their DNA.  Strategies have been developed to distinguish Oar mutants from  other mutants producing endomitotic oocytes. Importantly, a mutant  has been obtained with a phenotype opposite to Oar; olk-1 (olk=  oocyte arrest lock) oocytes maintain arrest under conditions when  arrest is usually lost. It is likely that the pathway for  maintenance of meiotic arrest defined by the oar and olk genes  involves cell cell communication from the soma to the oocyte.  Analysis of oar-1 is consistent with the conclusion that a cell  cell signal is needed to maintain meiotic arrest; cloning reveals  that oal-1 encodes a Sec61p gamma protein known in other systems to  facilitate protein translocation into the ER, and mosaic analysis  shows oar-1 activity is needed specifically in the germline to  prevent loss of oocyte arrest. Oar-1 may therefore act to  translocate a transmembrane receptor to the oocyte surface for  reception of the arrest signal. This proposal will initiate a more  extensive genetic and molecular investigation of the pathway  maintaining oocyte meiotic prophase arrest in C. elegans. Dr.  Schedl will:1) Identify genes necessary for oocyte meiotic prophase  arrest using a genetic screen, 2) Genetically and phenotypically  characterize mutants in the oar collection, and 3) Genet ically  characterize the arrest \"loc-1\" mutant, olk-1.  ***",
