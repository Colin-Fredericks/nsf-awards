The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. William M. Tong to work with Dr. Paolo Perfetti  at the Instituto di Struttura della Materia in Italy.    The goal of this proposal is to fabricate metal-  semiconductor conductor junctions of atomic scale and probe  their electronic structure as a function of their sizes and  other parameters.  The tool to perform these experiment is  the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).  Small islands of  most metals can be deposited by field ionizing metal atoms  from a pretreated tungsten tip.  The electronic structure of  these junctions is investigated by scanning tunneling  spectroscopy (STS), which is essentially the IV curve of the  islands.  This study will not only allow exploration of the  relatively uncharged area of nano-island deposition, but it  will also help gain a better understanding of the Fermi  Level (FL) pinning mechanism in the near-atomic limit by  mapping out how the density of states (DOS) evolves as a  function of island size, local defects, dopant levels, and  other factors. ***",
