 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422667  Whittingham    Previous research by this investigator has established that  new oxide intercalation hosts can be readily synthesized  using hydrothermal techniques, and that changing the acidity  or the cations present in the reaction medium dramatically  determines the crystalline structure formed. By appropriate  choice of reaction medium it is proposed to form new  structures containing large tunnels or channels, similar to  those found in aluminosilicate zeolites, that will offer  unique properties for the materials chemistry. The  feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated for  tungsten and molybdenum oxides. Major emphasis in this  project will be placed on vanadium and manganese oxides, and  on a new titanium phosphate.  Because enhanced diffusion in  such materials are expected, the diffusion/ionic mobility  will be determined. The host materials also will be  characterized for their ability to be intercalated by a  variety of guest ions and molecules, and their chemical and  physical properties will be determined using x-ray,  electrochemical, and electrical measurements and the  standard analytical techniques.  %%%  Zeolitic microporous materials have frameworks containing  mostly the redox inactive elements aluminum and silicon.  From a chemical point of view it would be highly desirable  to have a framework containing, or built from, redox active  species such as transition metals. In addition, for many  electrochemical applications it would be preferable to work  with oxides rather than sulfides because of their greater  ease of handling, lower cost and for energy storage their  greater electrochemical potential. The goal of this project  is to synthesize transition metal oxide materials with open  structures, that might have some of the properties and  applications of the aluminosilicate zeolitic materials, have  novel applications and be potentially electrochemically  active.",
