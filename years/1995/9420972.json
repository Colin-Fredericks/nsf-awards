 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420972  Luh       Scheduling power systems and determining inter-utility power  transactions are important activities faced by electric  utilities.  These two activities form an integrated problem since  they are coupled through system demand and reserve requirements.   The objective is to supply reliable, economic and clean power.   This problem is becoming very important because of the  deregulation trend making the power market more competitive, and  because of the Clean Air Act making utility operating conditions  more stringent.  The University of Connecticut, with support from  Northeast Utilities Service Company, proposes to explore three  vital and closely linked areas:  (l) a Lagrangian relaxation  based fuzzy optimization approach for short-term scheduling and  transaction to handle uncertainties such as transaction and fuel  prices and system demand; (2) transaction and scheduling for a  long time horizon up to one year with the consideration of  emission constraints and transmission line capacity constraints  by using the time aggregation idea; and (3) a new class of  algorithms to optimize the concave, piecewise smooth, and non-  differentiable Lagrangian dual functions by exploring their  geometric characteristics for improved performance.  These areas  form a synergistic research program, with one area leading to the  next and supporting the others.  Our aim is to help utility  engineers make effective scheduling and transaction decisions  based on sound mathematical principles, and to advance the state-  of-the-art and practice of optimization techniques for systems  characterized by uncertainties in general and power systems in  particular.   ***",
