This meeting will focus on the regulation  and function of the cytoskeleton in various biological processes  including actin filament assembly and dynamics, motile systems,  microtubule assembly and dynamics, cell division and nuclear structure,  intermediate filaments, molecular motors and intracellular trafficking,  membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, and the cytoskeleton in development  and differentiation.  Various systems will be represented including  yeast, Chlamydomonas, Dictyostelium, Drosophila, and vertebrates.  The  fundamental importance of the cytoskeleton in cellular functions renders  the subject of interest to investigators from a wide number of  disciplines including cell biologist, biochemists, molecular biologist,  geneticist, and developmental biologists.   The cytoskeleton crosses the  boundaries of cell biology, molecular biology, developmental biology,  eenetics and biochemistry; it is very important to bring people working  in diverse areas together in one location where they can discuss ideas  and develop communication.  In consequence of this diverse background  and emphasis, the meeting will encompass sessions which are focused  primarily by biological function.  Every attempt will be made to present  as many of the experimental approaches being used to study the role of  the cytoskeleton in cellular functions using biochemical, structural  (crystallography, NMR), molecular, immunological, and genetic  techniques.  %%%  This is a meeting which will focus on the regulation and function of the  cytoskeleton in various biological processes including actin filament  assembly and dynamics, motile systems, microtubule assembly and  dynamics, cell division and nuclear structure, intermediate filaments,  molecular motors and intracellular trafficking, membrane-cytoskeleton  interaction , and the cytoskeleton in development and differentiation.  It is scheduled to be held at Cold Spring Harbor, April 26th-30th, 1995  and is expected to attract about 300 scientists from a wide range of  specialties including cell biology, biochemistry, molecular biology,  genetics, ald developmental biology.  In such a crossdiscipline topic,  it is very important to bring people with these diverse backgrounds  together so that they can discuss ideas and develop communication.  In  consequence of this diverse background and emphasis, the meeting will  encompass sessions which are focused primarily by biological function.  The meeting is intended for students and postdoctoral fellows as well as  established investigators. Funding is only requested for student and  post-doc travel. All applicants will be expected to submit an abstract  of which approximately 60-70 will be selected  for a 10-20 minute  platform presentation along with 16 invited speakers. It is intended  that all other attendees will have the opportunity to present posters.  Abstracts will be collated into a booklet available to all participants,  but proceedings will not be published.  ***",
