 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to initiate a series of  laser-based experiments that are integrated into the physics and  chemistry programs.   This is accomplished by setting up a joint  laser laboratory for physics and chemistry that is solely  dedicated to housing lasers and related instrumentation.    Through the integration of laser-based experiments into the  undergraduate physics and chemistry curricula, students learn how  (1) to operate and characterize pulsed, continuous-wave (cw),  fixed frequency, and tunable lasers; (2) to investigate atomic  and molecular species using state-of-the-art techniques in linear  and nonlinear laser spectroscopy; (3) to utilize advanced  instrumentation and detectors such as digital storage  oscilloscopes, fiber optics, linear photodiode arrays, and  scanning monochromators; and (4) to use a computer-interfaced  data acquisition system to both control an experiment and to  collect and analyze data.   The new experiments are designed to  be well-suited for undergraduate instruction in that they teach  important skills in laser spectroscopy, require a level of  analysis that is amenable to students, and provide \"hands-on\"  experience with lasers, instrumentation, and computer-interfaced  data acquisition.",
