 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311077  Balch         This project will address the magnitude of the  calcification relative to the organic production in the  Arabian Sea as part of the U.S. JGOFS program.  Geological  and geochemical evidence points to calcite dominating the  burial of carbon in this very productive region.  However,  no direct estimates of calcification exist at time scales  compatible with standard photosynthesis measurements.  Indirect estimates based on vertical changes in alkalinity  and TCO2 suggest that euphotic zone calcification rates will  be on the order of 0.3-0.4 gC m-2d-1 during the SE monsoon  as compared to primary production of 1-2 gC m-2 d-1.  Indirect estimates based on  sediments accumulation rates  give very similar predictions.  In terms of carbon burial,  however, the organic carbon is preferentially remineralized  such that the regional organic carbon deposition is 2.65x10  5 tonnes C yr-1, less than a tenth of the calcite burial of  3.6x10 6 tonnes C y-1 over the northern Arabian Sea.  Such  indirect estimates of calcite production require broad  assumptions which need to be validated with empirical data.  Direct isotope estimates of calcification are essential to  understanding the magnitude of the production rate of  calcite, measured on time scales compatible with standard  primary production measurements.  Equally important will be  the comparison of the estimates of calcification with  geochemical estimates made by others in the program.  ***",
