 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spite of their obvious potential utility, trace fossils and  ichnofabric have been incorporated only rarely into stratigraphic  analyses.  For their potential to be fully realized, a predictive  model based on all aspects of the ichnological record must be  developed within a well-constrained stratigraphic horizon.  The  purpose of this research is to document discrete trace fossils and  their distributions, record ichnofabric indices, and describe the  ichnofabric from the Cincinnatian Kope-Corryville succession.  The  sequence and cyclo-stratigraphy of these strata have received  considerable attention in the past ten years and a high resolution  choronostratigraphic study is currently underway.  As a result, a  well constrained stratigraphic framework has emerged providing an  ideal opportunity to test the utility of the ichnological record in  stratigraphic analyses.  These strata have an additional advantage;  the Ordovician represents a critical time in the history during  this time.  This study will aid in our understanding of the history  of the benthic community during the Ordovician radiation.  Dr.  Droser will also attend the Third International Ichnofabric  Workshop at the University of Lopenhagen, Denmark and participate  in field trips that include visits to similar age strata to the  Cincinnationa Kope-Corryville succession but that represent very  different environmental conditions of deposition.    The interactive activities consist of five main facets:  teaching  one graduate-upper level undergraduate seminar in ichnology;  participating in additional paleontology and departmental seminars;  actively involving students, particularly undergraduates, in  research; leading general department field trips; and leading field  trips for middle school and high school museum volunteers at the  Cincinnati Museum of Natural History.",
