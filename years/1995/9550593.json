 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550593  Hrabowski    The proposed University of Maryland System (UMS) Alliance for  Minority Participation (AMP) is a comprehensive program that is  designed to extend and increase the impact of current initiatives  to increase substantially the quantity and quality of minority  students receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, engineering,  and mathematics (SEM).  The following UMS institutions will  participate as full partners in the proposed AMP:  1) the  University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC); 2) the University  of Maryland College Park (UMCP); and 3) the University of Maryland  Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically black institution.  Additional  UMS institutions have expressed and interest in participating in  the proposed UMS AMP.  Discussions regarding additional UMS  partners for years two through five are underway.  Dr. Freeman A.  Hrabowski, III, President of UMBC, has received national  recognition for his leadership in developing innovative programs to  expand educational opportunities for minority SEM students, and he  will be the principal investigator for the proposed UMS AMP.  Dr.  Hrabowski received the National Science Foundation's 1994 Educator  Award for his outstanding commitment and dedication in the  education of minorities in the fields of science and mathematics.    Also participating in the AMP will be the following community  colleges located in close proximity of the participating UMS  institutions and that serve as the primary feeders of minority SEM  transfer students:  1) Anne Arundel Community College; 2) Baltimore  City Community College; 3) Catonsville Community College; 4)  Chesapeake Community College; 5) Howard Community College; 6)  Montgomery Community College; 7) Prince Georges Community College;  and 8) Wor Wic Community College.    In support of NSF's goals, the primary goals of the proposed UMS  AMP include the following:    1.   To produce approximately 800 minority SEM baccalaureate       recipients each year by the end of the 1999-2000 a cademic       year.    2.   To enroll at least 300 minority SEM graduate students per year       beginning in the fall of 1997.    The secondary goals of the proposed UMS AMP is to increase the  number of minority students entering SEM careers, especially  faculty positions.    The proposed AMP's design includes the following characteristics:         Strong commitment by institutional leaders to the program's       success;       Removal of financial barriers for minority students;       A Summer Bridge Component;       An Academic Year Component;       Focus on improving knowledge and skills;       Focus on motivation and support;       Focus on monitoring and advising;       Focus on academic and social interaction;       Focus on \"filter\" SEM course curricula revision; and       Involvement of feeder community colleges.",
