PROGRAMS: Oglala Lakota College and Sinte Gleska University will  develop and administer bachelor's degree programs in  Environmental Science and Software Engineering, and a  pre-engineering associate degree in science. The degree programs  will be extended to Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, and Sisseton  Wahpeton Community Colleges through a distance learning mode.  These Tribal Institutions, collectively called the Oyate  Consortium, are Tribally chartered, and serve distinct American  Indian populations - a population which is significantly  underrepresented in SEM education. The model developed can be  easily replicated in the other twenty-six Tribal Colleges.    MANAGEMENT: Core management will consist of a Principal  Investigator, a SEM Curriculum Specialist/Co-Principal  Investigator, and the Sinte Gleska Site Coordinator and Vice  President. In years two to five site coordinators from the three  other Consortium member colleges will join the team. The  Principal Investigator will report directly to the OLC President.    SPECIAL FEATURES: Oglala Lakota College and Sinte Gleska  University, the only accredited graduate and four-year degree  granting Tribal Institutions, have recently gained land-grant  college status.    The Oyate Consortium is unique because of strong collaboration  among Tribal colleges and with other universities and industry.  This initiative, the first ever for Tribal College SEM program  development, has potential for unusual impact because Tribal  Colleges are community and nation-builders with the special  mission of helping tribes which are sovereign nations, become  more self-sufficient.    Oyate Tribal Colleges are unique because they reach students who  are not served adequately by ordinary universities. These are  students who live and work on geographically isolated  reserva tions, hold cultural values not appreciated by mainstream  institutions, or who have extensive family responsibilities.    The NSF Model Institutions for Excellence initiative offers a  unique opportunity for the Oyate Tribal Colleges and their  twenty-six Tribal counterparts to reach the underrepresented  American Indian students, and to bring academic and technical  expertise to Tribal nations in ways that may make the difference  between extinction and tribal self-sufficiency.",
