To help accomplish this, a consortium comprised of the  University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Polytechnic University, Community College of Philadelphia, two  Philadelphia public schools, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) is planning to  undertake this major initiative to integrate research and real-world applications from various disciplines into the  mathematics curriculum, and to achieve more effective integration of advanced mathematics and computing into  the curricula of disciplines that use mathematics.      To begin a process to achieve this overall goal, this project consists of four parts:    I.      Creation of application modules for mathematics courses and mathematics modules                   for          other-discipline courses.  II.     Development of basic and advanced interdisciplinary courses that integrate mathematics with specific          application areas.  III.    Development of applications and laboratory-oriented courses for mathematics majors.  IV.     Development of materials for students in courses such as business, economics, psychology, and liberal           arts and humanities courses that focus on mathematical literacy issues.    Topics are chosen from a broad range of discipline areas, including biological and social sciences, as well as  engineering, business, and physics modules. These modules involve many different important mathematical topics  and techniques.  The two different types of modules which are planned allow for multiple levels of student  backgrounds. They impact multiple points of the curriculum ranging from courses for majors in fields which have  traditionally used little or no mathematics to those for lower division students in mathematics and mathematically  oriented disciplines to those for upper division mathematics majors. Several interdisciplinary courses are being  created, including one incorporating mathematics, physics, and chemistry as well as one in geographiometry. A  team of faculty are also developing a two-semester course for mathematics majors that surveys industrial uses  of mathematics via applications.  SIAM is proving expertise both in the development of the interdisciplinary  modules and courses and in broad dissemination of materials through conferences, workshops, and products.   Distribution of materials is through World Wide Web sites at the University of Pennsylvania and SIAM as well  as by commercial publication.",
