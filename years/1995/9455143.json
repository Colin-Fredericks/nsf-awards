 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to conduct a faculty workshop to be  held during the summer of 1995 at Michigan Technological University  (MTU).  The focus of these workshops is on teaching and assessment  techniques for the development of 3-D spatial visualization skills  in engineering students.  This project builds on and disseminates  the products of an NSF project in the area of Course and Curriculum  Development.  The products of this previous project are a textbook  for the development of 3-D spatial visualization ability and an  accompanying computer lab manual which utilizes I-DEAS software.    The target audience for the workshops is undergraduate faculty with  primary responsibility in teaching engineering design graphics.   Many entering engineering students, particularly women, lack  background experiences which would develop 3-D spatial  visualization ability.  Consequently, they are not prepared to  compete on an equal basis in their graphics classes. This workshop  provides engineering design graphics educators with the tools they  need to bridge this gap in the backgrounds of many of their  students.  It is estimated that with 25 participants, approximately  2500 engineering freshman per year will benefit from the use of the  developed materials and improved teaching techniques for 3-D  spatial visualization.  This improvement increases the likelihood  that the first experience of women engineering students in their  graphics curriculum is a positive experience, enhancing retention  of female engineering students.    Dissemination of workshop ideas is carried out by workshop  participants as they implement plans for change at their home  institutions in their engineering design graphics curricula. Work-  shop participants are supported in their efforts by being networked  together through e-mail and through contact with other participants  and the project coordinators at professional meetings.  An  evaluation questionnaire is completed by the participants at the  end of the works hop.",
