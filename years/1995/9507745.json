As most of the  proteins that function  in the  light  reactions  of  photosynthesis  are  embedded  in  the thylakoid  membrane,  the process by which proteins  are  inserted into this  membrane is of great importance. The investigators have  recently discovered that a chloroplast protein, 54CP,is  essential for  the integration of the major light harvesting  protein (LHCP) into  thylakoid  membranes in vitro. The main  objective  of  the present  proposal  is to test the  hypothesis that  54CP  plays  a fundamental   role  in  intrachloroplast  protein  targeting                      by  examining the function of the protein in vivo. To accomplish  this objective,  plants  are being created that are  reduced  in  54CP content  or  that  express mutant forms of  54CP  that  confer  a dominant  negative  phenotype.  Such  plants  will   allow        the  investigators to study the role of 54CP in protein  targeting  in vivo.  Defects in protein targeting will be  assessed by measuring leaf  chlorophyll content, analyzing  the polypeptide  composition of  the  chloroplast  membranes, determining  the  expression  of chloroplast  heat shock proteins, and by conducting  a  sensitive  transport  assay. Leaves will be in vivo labelled with   35S -Met and  the  distribution of specific thylakoid  proteins in  soluble and membrane fractions will be  determined by immunoprecipitation. These experiments should  reveal whether the targeting of LHCP  is strictly  dependent  on  a  54CP   pathway  and  whether   other  chloroplast   proteins   require  54CP   for   targeting.  These experiments   might  also  reveal  whether  alternate   transport  pathways can compensate for defects in the 54CP pathway. A  second objective  is  to  elucidate details of the GTP  hydrolysis  cycle required  for  54CP  function. Several  types of   experiments  are planned  in this regard. First,  mature 54CP and forms mutated  in the  guanine nucleotide  binding domain will be purified  and  the nucleotide  binding and hydrolysis activities  measured.  Second, these  proteins will be preloaded into isolated chloroplasts  and  used  to  study  LHCP trafficking in organello. If  the  proteins inhibit  transport, further biochemical studies  will be conducted to  ascertain the site of action. The  mutant forms of the protein might  form  stable complexes  with other components of  the  54CP dependent  targeting  pathway and facilitate their isolation.  The proposed  studies should advance our knowledge of the  biogenesis of  thylakoid membranes. A protein related to 54CP is found in  the cytoplasm  of  all  eukaryotes and  plays  a  role  in  directing proteins to the secretory system. Similar proteins  have also been found  in  prokaryotes  though a function has  not  been  clearly established. Thus the proposed studies  should reveal insight into the  ways  in  which 54p has  evolved and functions  in  different organisms and  organelles.  %%%  Plants contain chloroplasts, a highly compartmentalized  organelle having  an internal membrane called the thylakoid  which  converts the  energy  of sunlight into the chemical  energy stored  in  our foodstuffs.  Most  of  the proteins  that function  in  the  light reactions of photosynthesis  are embedded in this membrane. One of the major unresolved  problems of chloroplast protein transport is the mechanism  by which proteins are integrated into the thylakoid  membrane. The investigators have recently obtained evidence  from a cell free system that a chloroplast protein, 54CP, is  essential for  the integration of the major light harvesting  protein (LHCP) into  thylakoid membranes. The investigators  now propose to  test the   hypothesis   that   54CP  plays  a  fundamental                                          role   in  intrachloroplast protein targeting by examining the  function  of the   protein  in vivo.  To accomplish this  objective,  transgenic plants  are  being created that are  reduced in  54CP  content  or  express  mutant  forms of the protein that  will  interfere  with endogenous   54CP   function.  Such   plants   will  allow     the  investigators to study the role of 54CP in protein  targeting  in vivo.  These  experiments should reveal  whether the targeting  of LHCP  is  strictly dependent on a  54CP pathway and whether  other chloroplast   proteins  require  54CP   for   targeting.   These experiments   might  also  reveal  whether  alternate  transport  pathways  can  compensate for defects in the  54CP  pathway.  The proposed  studies should advance our knowledge of the  biogenesis of thylakoid membranes. A protein related to 54CP  is found in the cytoplasm  of  all  eukaryotes and  plays  a  role  in  directing proteins to the secretory system.  Similar proteins have also been found  in  prokaryotes  though a function has  not  been  clearly established..  Thus  the proposed studies should  reveal  insight into  the  ways in which 54p fits into the accurate and efficient  mechanisms which have evolved for delivering proteins to  specific intracellular  destinations.  Protein  sorting  is  an  essential process;  abnormalities lead to cell death. In  addition  to  the fundamental importance of protein  targeting in sustaining life, a basic   understanding  of  the  process  has  relevant  practical applications.  For  example,  it is  now  possible  to  introduce foreign genes  into many organisms. By understanding how organisms control  protein  sorting, it will be  possible  to  control  the  precise localization of the proteins expressed from these  foreign genes.  In  plants, such applications include the  production  of gene  products  that confer increased  resistance  to  disease  or stress,  lead  to  improvements  in productivity  and  nutritional characteristics, or enable  the synthesis of bioproducts  such  as pharmaceuticals and  raw materials f or the chemical industry. ***",
