He has been invited to present a  paper titled \"Improved Detection of Enteric Viral Pathogens and  Indicators in Oysters and their Habitat Waters.\"  The conference  plan includes field visits to commercial shellfish growing areas  and an associated research facility.  The applicant also plans on  visiting with the Australian Water Technologies Board in Sydney  to discuss potential collaborative research on coastal waste  management and related issues that affect shellfish sanitation  and otherwise impact coastal water quality.    This conference is a sequel to the 1989 and 1992 international  conferences on shellfish depuration that were held in Florida and  France, respectively.  Results associated with supporting the  applicant's participation in this Conference and related  activities in Australia are expected to include information that  can be utilized in planning the scope of future program support  of research on waste management issues of special significance to  coastal regions of the United States.  ***",
