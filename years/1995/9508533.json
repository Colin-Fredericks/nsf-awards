 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Harry B. Gray and Dr. John H. Richards, Chemistry Department,   California Institute of Technology, are supported by the Inorganic,   Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division to develop methods and materials for studying the intermediates   in the oxygen-activation chemistry of single heme proteins. A series of   kinetic studies which focus on the critical O-O bond cleavage reactions   will be carried out. Photochemical methods will be developed for rapidly   injecting electrons into the dioxygen coordinated to iron of a heme   group. According to current theories is the step which initiates O-O bond   cleavage in these enzymes. By study of the resulting excited states   information will be obtained on reaction intermediates and the details of   the O-O bond cleavage mechanism. Systems to be investigated include   heme-cavity-modified forms of myoglobin, horseradish peroxidase, and   mutants of yeast cytochrome c.     Oxygen is a powerful and readily available oxidant, yet man-made   catalysts that effectively utilize oxygen are rare. The best examples of   oxygen activation and utilization are found in biochemical systems. Iron   containing enzymes are responsible for a large portion of biochemical   oxygen activation. Nonetheless, the exact way in which these iron   containing biomolecules are able to activate oxygen is unclear. This   project is designed to probe the mechanism of the critical oxygen-oxygen   bond cleave process which must lie at the heart of the process. An   understanding of how the biological systems operate may permit new ways   of directly utilizing oxygen in a variety of laboratory and industrial   processes.",
