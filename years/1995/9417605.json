 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417605  Sheridan  The objective of this proposal is to obtain a better understanding of the physical and geochemical processes related to the giant 1964 eruption of Shiveluch Volcano, Kamchatka.  The eruptive event and products of Shiveluch, the focus of this research, will be compaped with published information and reconnaissance field work on the other major edifice destroying eruptions  Kusdach (1907), Bezymianny (1956), and Mount St. Helens (1980) .  The goal will be to understand the similarities and differences of these four major eruptions.  Field and laboratory studies will ascertain the nature of processes leading to the explosive rupture of the eruptive system and the mechanism responsible for the lateral transport of the materials.  Integrated study of the eruptive history of the entire volcano and the petrologic and geochemical character of the juvenile products will provide data to determine possible relationships among:  characteristics of eruptive events, evolution of the melts, formation of volcanic debris avalanches, and occurrence of lateral blast eruptions.  This research would improve our understanding of a very important class of phenomena that has a significant impact on volcanic risk assessment and mitigation.  Results form this study also could prove useful for long-term prediction of eruptive behavior at other dangerous volcanoes.",
