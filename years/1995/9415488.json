 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Geoffrey A. Blake of the California Institute of   Technology will engage in detailed spectroscopic studies of    intermolecular forces as revealed by weakly bound, i.e., van der Waals   and hydrogen-bonded, complexes.  These studies will encompass   experimental, computational, and theoretical investigations.  The   complexes are formed in supersonic expansions of the component gases into   a high vacuum, and the studies will focus on the far infrared region   where most of the telltale intermolecular vibrational frequencies of the   complexes are located.  Hybrid laser spectrometers that operate   throughout the microwave, millimeter, and far-infrared regions will be   used to obtain the spectra, with resolution appropriate to resolve the   rotational, tunneling,  and hyperfine structures of the vibrational   bands.  The experimental efforts are coupled to computational and   theoretical studies to extract from the experimental data reliable   intermolecular potential energy surfaces.  Systems to be investigated   include bi-, tri, and higher-order complexes composed of monomer   molecules, such as benzene-water, ammonia-water, nitrogen-water, and   carbon monoxide-water; argon-water in which the several argon atoms and   several water molecules form a complex; dimer complexes composed of water   with hygrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, and   acetylene; and larger size complexes such as  glycine-water and others of   biological importance such as those involving amino acids and   purines/pyrimidenes.     Accurate descriptions of intermolecular forces play a pivotal role in   chemistry and molecular biology.  Despite  long term interests in the   weak, i.e., van der Waals and, in particular, hydrogen-bonded,   interactions there is a paucity of reliable quantitative data that   describe these effects.  Traditional  methods for obtaining information   on the intermolecular interactions were based on the determination of the   coefficients in the virial expansion of the equation of state of a gas,   pressure broadening of spectral lines, and other classical properties.    More recently molecular beam scattering experiments have yielded useful   results.  The couplings of molecular beam techniques with those of high   resolution microwave and laser spectroscopies have provided tools by   means of which  the most detailed and exact data on weakly bound   complexes composed of two or more individually strongly bound monomer   molecules are obtained.  The investigations pursued in this project will   contribute accurate structures, lifetimes and other dynamical parameters   of weakly bound molecular complexes as well as detailed quantitative   information on their intermolecular potential energies.  This information   will lead not only to a better understanding about the cohesion of matter   in general, but also for those systems that are of practical importance   in environmental and biological chemistry.",
