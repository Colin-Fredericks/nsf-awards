Colorado State University  Title: Climate Analysis and Extended Range Seasonal Prediction    This project involves the analysis and further development of basic  scientific concepts related to extended range quantitative climatic  forecast schemes for Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane activity,  African Sahel seasonal rainfall, ENSO variations, selective  regional Asian monsoon rainfall, and the potential for seasonal  predictability in the middle latitudes.  Along with the basic  science concerning underlying mechanisms, this work seeks accuracy  at 9-14 month forecast lead times, sufficient to allow the  development and implementation of meaningful policy and mitigating  actions.  The spectrum of potential climate precursor signals will  be exhaustively explored.  Potential predictability will be studied  in the hindcast mode, principally from global data sets for the  last 35 to 45 years (primarily since 1950), but with some  extensions to much earlier data.  Similarly, statistical regression  methodology for combining predictor signals using both Least  Absolute Deviations and Ordinary Least Squares procedures will be  extensively explored.  Although surprisingly skillful seasonal  hindcast test results have been obtained, these results suggest  that greater forecast skill is possible through further analyses  with additional combinations of climate variables.  Equal emphasis  in this research is directed toward diagnostic work for greater  physical understanding of the underlying atmospheric and oceanic  processes responsible for long range precursor signals.    This research is important because it seeks to improve our ability  to predict climate variations of major economic and human safety  importance.",
