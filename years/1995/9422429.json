When people work -- the timing  of work during the day -- has received almost no attention.  This  neglect is mainly due to the paucity of data on this issue.  That  is unfortunate, since changes in the distribution of work and  leisure over time affect households' well-being.  This project  will use the only available data to examine a variety of issues  in the timing of work.  It is motivated by the apparent  substantial changes that have occurred even during the last  decade in the United States in the distribution of work hours  over the work day, and by some simple cross-section evidence for  the U.S. and Germany on the importance of young children in  affecting spouses' joint decisions about timing leisure.    The project involves an entire research agenda of studies in the  general area. It includes examining: 1) how the timing of work  changed between 1973 and 1991. The focus will be on decomposing  changes into those produced by changes in industrial structure,  demographic characteristics, and unmeasurable effects. 2)  Life-cycle variation in the timing of work and how it has changed  among successive cohorts of workers, using artificial cohorts of  workers constructed from an 1 8-year succession of Current  Population Survey data; 3) how changes in a households'  demographic structure affect timing, with a particular  concentration of the roles of marriage and fertility and with  applications to the availability of child-care arrangements,  using two-year panel data; 4) how timing varies over the business  cycle, and what these changes imply about the welfare effects of  unemployment; and 5) the impact of urban crime and urban  disamenities generally on timing, with a focus on how changes in  measurable and unmeasurable characteristics of urban areas have  altered the timing of economic activity.  ***",
