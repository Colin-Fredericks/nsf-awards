The capacity to anticipate future  events has often been demonstrated to influence ongoing  behavior.   Yet there is much about this important cognitive  ability that is not well understood.  This research program  will examine the types of situations in which animals learn  to expect predictable future events, will assess the  cognitive processes by which these expectancies develop and  will investigate the mechanisms by which these expectancies  influence behavior.  These goals will be accomplished  through experimental comparisons of the predictions made by  two prominent learning theories regarding the nature of the  experiences thought important for expectancies to develop  control over behavior.  The resulting information will  provide a much clearer picture of which types of experience  are necessary, and will thus provide important insight into  the origins of the ability to anticipate events.",
