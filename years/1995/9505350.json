The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Michael L. Sundheimer to work with Professor  Daniel B. Ostrowsky at the Universite de Nice Sophia  Antipolis in France.    This award will support the second year of a project started  under a Bourse Chateaubriand provided by the French  government.  This project involves the implementation of a  CW quasi-phasematched optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in  lithium niobate channel waveguides, beginning with  measurements of parametric fluorescence and gain.  A  resonant cavity will then be made to realize the OPO, which  will be done by affixing mirrors to the waveguide or, with  coatings applied directly to the waveguide ends.  Initial  experiments will be done with a CW Ti:Sapphire laser to  demonstrate the principle.  The driving force to-date for  such research has been the search for compact, efficient  diode-pumped blue-light sources.  Diode-pumping of an OPO  device would create a compact, tunable, all solid-state  laser source covering the important 1.3 and 1.55 um  telecommunications windows as well as providing wavelengths  useful for spectroscopy, atmospheric pollution monitoring,  and biological and medical applications. ***",
