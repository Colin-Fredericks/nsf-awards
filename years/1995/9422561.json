 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422561  Leng      This project will investigate four pairs of nation-states which  have been engaged in recurring militarized crises in the Post WW  II era:  the United States and the Soviet Union, India and  Pakistan, Israel and Egypt, and Israel and Syria.  these  rivalries account for eight of the eighteen wars that occurred  between 1945 and 1980, as well as three nuclear confrontations.   The investigation will attempt to discover whether significant  changes in influence strategies and tactics are employed from one  crisis to the next.  Event data from the Behavioral Correlates of  war project as well as attributes of participant states, their  relationship with rival states, and the structure of the  international system and regional subsystem will inform the  study.  It will identify whether lessons are learned from  preceding experiences with the same adversary, and the conditions  under which more or less effective crisis management evolves.  A  better understanding of the \"lessons\" that policy makers draw  from experience may provide an important step toward more  effective means of managing future militarized crises.  ***",
