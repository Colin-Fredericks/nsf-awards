 "awd_abstract_narration": "Management factors and organizational errors are major  contributors to the risk of failure of large complex systems  that often have severe health and environmental  consequences.  Environmental policy (both public and  private) relies on risk management to forecast  organizational and engineering performance as well as a  means for reducing risks.  Modeling in risk management,  however, rarely accounts for robust interactions among  human, engineering, and environmental systems.  Social  scientists and engineers tend to consider risk management  differently and a bridge is needed between the two fields to  take full advantage of the research of both.  This research  develops a normative risk management model (System-Actions-  Management:  SAM), involving both the technical parameters  included in classical Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) and  the organizational factors that affect them.  The research  extends earlier work on the characterization of the linkage  between classical PRA and management factors by emphasizing  the long-term dynamics of organizations and facilities.  The  resulting model will allow a more realistic and balanced  consideration of social and behavioral factors in risk  management decision making and priority setting.",
