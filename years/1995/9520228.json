Avoid use  of first person to complete this summary.  The purpose of this project is to contact the next  International Workshop on Computational Electronics to be held in Tempe, Arizona on October 30-  November 2, 1995.  This workshop is the fourth in a series and is held under the auspices of the  National Center for Computational Electronics at the University of Illinois.  The workshop will cover  all aspects of advanced simulation and modeling of electronic transport in semiconductor and  semiconductor devices,  particularly those aspects that utilize intensive computational and/or  visualization resources.  This workshop is intended to be an international forum for the discussion of  the current trends and future directions of computational electronics.   The IWCE attempts to bring  together engineers, physicists,  computational scientists, and applied mathematicians in the area of  simulation and modeling.  The proceedings of the Fourth IWCE will be published as a regular issue  of VLSI Design.  The will be an issue of approximately 300 pages, as all manuscripts will be contained  in  a single issue.  Papers will be submitted at the beginning of the workshop with regular refereeing  occurring during the workshop.  Final revised (accepted) manuscripts will be due approximately three  weeks after the workshop.",
