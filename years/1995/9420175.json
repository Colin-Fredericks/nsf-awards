 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420175  Bradshaw  This research will focus on characterizing ammonia's (NH3) impact  on the tropospheric chemistry within the remote marine atmosphere  through the quantitative measurement of gas phase NH3, \"total\" NH3  (i.e. gaseous plus particulate), and nitric oxide (NO) on board the  NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft during the 1995 Southern Hemisphere Marine  Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1).  This effort will seek  to address NH3's role within the primary ACE-1 program objective of  determining the key physical and chemical processes controlling the  formation and fate of aerosols and how these processes affect the  number size distribution, the chemical composition, and the optical  and cloud nucleating properties of these particles.  For a few  parts-per-trillion levels of NH3 that are anticipated over the ACE-  1 study regions, the Georgia Tech advanced photofragmentation  laser-induced fluorescence (PF/LIF) sensor will be used to acquire  high precision ( 10%, 2s) data with sufficient spatial resolution  to enable a detailed characterization of the small spatial scale  atmospheric inhomogeneities that are thought to give rise to bursts  in condensation nuclei (CN) production.  These unprecedented  measurement capabilities will produce data capable of yielding new  insights into NH3's role in controlling the development of CN and  the growth and activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).  In  conjunction with other ACE-1 measurements, this project should  provide a unique perspective of the relative contributions that  binary and ternary nucleation processes make toward controlling the  rate of new particle production in the remote atmosphere.  This  investigation will also provide the atmospheric community with  needed information of the spatial distribution of NH3 within the  troposphere over remote marine environments.  This large spatial  scale survey will also provide the basis for the first quantitative  assessment of NH3's role as possible source of nitrogen oxides  (N0x) i n the remote troposphere.",
