 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there have been several essential developments in the  representation theory of Lie superalgebras.  One of them is  Serganova's reduction of the Kac problem on characters of  atypical finite-dimensional gl(m+ne)-modules to the  semi-simplicity conjecture for a functor analogous to the Vogan  functor.  Another one is Kac and Wakimoto's discovery of a  striking relationship between number theory and integrable  representations of affine Lie superalgebras.  Finally, there is  the theory of triangular decomposition of arbitrary  finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras and the related theory of  generic irreducible highest weight modules developed by Serganova  and the principal investigator.  The research supported by this  award is on five different topics related naturally to those  developments:  geometry of finite-dimensional generic modules  over arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras; arbitrary  generic modules over finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras;  special (both non-generic and atypical) modules over classical  Lie superalgebras; generic integrable modules over Kac-Moody  superalgebras; and quantum superalgebras.  In most of the cases,  it is planned to use a combination of algebraic and geometric  methods.  This research is concerned with a mathematical object  called a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object  called a Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations  of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie  groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis  of sperical motion.",
