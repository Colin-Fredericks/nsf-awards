The theoretical work will involve (a) methods of evaluating model stability and instability, which will include both discrete and continuous time Markov models; (b) development of performance measures for stable models, and specifically comparison of rates at which such models achieve a stable regime; (b) detailed behavior of stochastically ordered or partially stochastically ordered models; and (d) robustness of system design against perturbations in assumptions. One application of these methods will be to MCMC methods, which  are currently revolutionizing Bayesian and computational statistics methods, and under this project it is hoped to develop on-line convergence criteria, methods of evaluating convergence rates, and ways of speeding up these algorithms. The other area of application is in the analysis of  complex network, queueing and storage systems. The specific types of such application envisaged include the currently high-priority area of manufacturing systems, and more general queueing systems with feedback, for which the stability and performance results to be developed are well suited.    In evaluating many complex systems, there are two steps where mathematical models, especially those in probability and statistics, play a critical role. The first step is in describing the system. This research addresses the modeling of ``manufacturing networks'', currently of central importance in the high-technology manufacturing sector. Here the aim is to describe the way in which items such as semiconductor components move around the various machines which work and rework components to get to a final product. As with many models, the mathematics that describes such manufacturing systems also describes other systems, such as the movement  of bits over an information network. The work proposed here will attack the vital question: when is such a system stable, in the sense of running in equilibrium rather than developing problems which cause shutdowns, backlogs or overflows. This modeling step helps define the crucial parameters that describe ranges when systems can be controlled: the second step is then in estimating such parameters, and here it is proposed to work on new simulation methods that enable such estimation to take place. These \" Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  algorithms\" have very wide applicability, but are themselves \"complex systems\", and just as with real systems, they can develop overflows and backlogs in usage: the work here should provide methods of control for MCMC algorithms leading to faster and more accurate methods of simulation. These simulation methods have found application in a huge range of areas, from pattern recognition, to agricultural experiments, to clinical and epidemiological areas, to environmental assessments: the research supported in this proposal therefore propagates to usage in very many areas indeed.",
