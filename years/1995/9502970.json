 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502970  Ortoleva       Cold sea water circulates deep into the ocean crust, is  heated, exchanges chemical constituents with the crust, and then  emerges as heated hydrothermal water.  This process has a  profound effect on the composition of the ocean crust and sea  water.  Presently much attention is focused on the hydrothermal  water exiting from hot vents at ridge crests, but a large  proportion of the water exits through sediments on the ridge  flanks.  The proponents argue that the physical, chemical, and  mineralogical characteristics of the ridge flank environment has  been characterized much better than the ridge crest environment  because the flanks are much more accessible by drilling than  ridge crests.  The research plan is to understand the fluid flow  up from basalt basement through the sediment by porous flow and  diffusion, and to determine what are the chemical changes in the  fluid and the chemical and mineralogical changes in the  sediments.  This will be done as a pilot study with existing  computer models that will generate chemical profiles based on  boundary conditions of temperature, fluid flow, and initial  physical conditions of the sediment.  Results will be compared to  chemical profiles found in four sedimented areas.  ***",
