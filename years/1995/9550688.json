 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Drew Saturday Science Academy Summer Camp will be a (4) week  residential SMET enrichment activity for (16) minority middle  school students in south Central Los Angeles.  The goal of the  program is to increase and improve the pool of qualified minority  students pursuing science, math, engineering, and technological  educational pathways.  Program objectives include: 1) Increasing  the number of students successfully completing algebra and  geometry; 2) Improving the analytical reading and critical thinking  skills of these students; 3) Involving parents by increasing their  awareness of what students need to succeed in SMET Careers; 4)  Improve computer literacy; 5) Demonstrating knowledge of  exploratory research modalities; and 6) Demonstrate increased  awareness of science, math, engineering and technological career  opportunities.  This will be accomplished using the themes of  space, flight and aeronautics in hands-on labs.  Using the approach  it is anticipated that students will be more inclined to continue  on the SMET educational pathway.  ***",
