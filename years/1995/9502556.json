 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with performance optimization of high-  speed synchronous digital circuits It addresses the application of  timing optimizations to pipelines and general sequential circuits  in high-performance systems.  The core of the research effort is  directed towards the method of retiming at the gate level.   Retiming is a sequential logic optimization technique that  repositions memory elements, namely, edge-triggered flip-flops and  level-triggered latches, within a circuits to optimize the timing  behavior of the circuit.  The use of retiming optimization methods,  chiefly device sizing, is also being investigated.    Under the educational part of this project, the PI is incorporating  CAD techniques in the undergraduate program from the sophomore  level by the use of CAD tools in teaching.  At the graduate level,  he is involved in developing courses, the supporting existing  courses, and in advising graduate students.  He is also exposing  undergraduates to his research for a better appreciation of the  state of the art, and to motivate them towards higher education.   he is also contributing towards outreach activities by focusing  towards distance education through teaching courses to sites in the  state of Iowa via television, and around the country through the  medium of satellite.",
