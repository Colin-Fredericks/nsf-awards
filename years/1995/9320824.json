 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320824  Bielak  This project investigates the seismic performance of earth and  rock-fill dams, focusing on the coupling effects between the dam  and its support, as well as on the effects of the spatial  variability of the incoming seismic waves.  Current design  methods generally assume a rigid dam foundation, whereas  observations of the behavior of earth and rock-fill dams during  earthquakes suggest that canyon-dam interaction can significantly  influence their seismic response.    The main objective is to elucidate the conditions under which dam-  canyon interaction effects are practically significant, and to  develop methods that can be used in design and remediation  practice for calculating these interaction effects.  The projects  involves computer simulations with two- and three-dimensional  models which reflect realistic conditions.  In as much as the  main focus is on gaining a clear understanding of the mechanism  by which the dynamic coupling between the dam and the canyon  affects the seismic response of the dam, attention is confined  largely to dams constructed of either dry or dense saturated  granular soils and cohesive soils that are not susceptible to  liquefaction.  Some consideration, however, is given to seismic  liquefaction evaluation for cases in which loose saturated sands  and cohesionless silts are present.  ***",
