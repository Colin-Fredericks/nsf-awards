Qualified researchers in  the basic sciences related to light sources technologies will be  brought together with world-wide experts now working in light  source research to discuss, plan and prioritize the sustained  research programs needed to achieve the major breakthroughs.  The  goals are to:  (1) educate participants from the basic research  community in the current state of the art in light source  technology and research; (2) provides a vehicle for the  participants to explore both single focused as well as  interdisciplinary research programs that would provide the basis  for the breakthroughs; (3) jointly establish specific programs and  priorities for collaborative effort and funding.    There will be approximately 60 participants.  The workshop will  take place over a two and one-half day period.  The findings and  recommendations regarding new research directions will be  documented in a workshop proceedings.  The outcome of the workshop  is expected to lead to multiple sourcing of funds for the targeted  research from both private industry as well as from interested  government agencies.  ***",
