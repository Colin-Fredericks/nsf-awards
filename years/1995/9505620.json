These limitations may be  classified into: modeling limitation, scenario limitation,  function limitation and accuracy limitation.  These limitations  must be removed or significantly improved before direct methods  can be actually used by power utilities.  A major limitation of  direct methods in the past has been the simplicity of the models  used in various direct method implementations in software  programs.  Much of this limitation will be overcome by the work  presented in this proposal.  The second limitation has been that  direct methods apply to first swing instability only.  The  proposed project will enhance direct methods in such a way to  provide useful information for identifying multi-swing unstable  cases.  A third limitation has been the accuracy and reliability  of direct methods.  This limitation will be significantly  improved by the work (BCU method) to be developed in this  research for network-preserving power system models.  This  proposal seeks, from both computational and theoretical  viewpoints, to remove or improve much of the limitations in  direct methods and make them viable for on-line direct stability  analysis of practical large-scale power systems  ***",
