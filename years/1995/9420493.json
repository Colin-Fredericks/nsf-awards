 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harris    Under the direction of Dr. John W. Harris, Ms. Paola Meneses will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological fieldwork along the Umbeluzi and Changalane rivers  in Southern Mozambique and analyze the resultant data. Previous  work conducted by Ms. Meneses indicates that this area is rich in  lithic remains associated with the Acheulean industry which  covers the time span from ca. 1,250,000 to 125,000 years ago. The  research consists of three parts. First a survey will be  conducted to locate both surface and in situ materials. This will  be followed by limited excavation to recover in place artifacts  and to establish geological context. As part of this first stage,  a geomorphological stages will be reconstructed and a  chronological sequence will be developed. Secondly, lithic  materials will be analyzed to determine formal attributes of the  assemblages and to compare these with materials from South and  Eastern Africa. Finally an experimental approach will be used to  reconstruct the lithic manufacture process. On this basis it will  be possible to map the distribution of lithic remains across the  reconstructed landscapes and determine how these were used by  Acheulean peoples.    Africa provided the geographic cradle for humans and  archaeologists wish to understand the processes which led to the  emergence of both culturally and physically modern humans.  Surprisingly little is known about the 1 million year plus time  interval  covered by the Acheulean and very few studies have  employed modern analytic techniques. Ms. Meneses work will shed  new light on how humans adapted during this interval. It will  also provide data of interest to many archaeologists. Finally,  this grant will assist in the training of a promising young  archaeologist.",
