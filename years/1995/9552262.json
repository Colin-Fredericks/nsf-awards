The  courses include Calculus I, II, and III and Differential  Equations.  The first 3 of these courses are 5 semester hours.   Differential Equations is likely to change from 3 semester hours  to 4 to incorporate more linear algebra in response to changes at  transfer institutions.  Graphing calculators have replaced  computers on projects.  They have enabled students explore  functional behavior, visualize, and program numerical techniques.   In Differential Equations, students draw by hand a direction  fields and trajectories in the x,y-phase plane for a differential  equation of the form dx/dt = f(x,y), but they will explore a  number of differential equations of this form using MacMath.  In  Calculus III, three-dimensional graphing using Theorist will  enable students to visualize vectors and analytic geometry in  space as well as partial derivatives.  Calculus I and II projects  will focus on mathematical modeling.",
