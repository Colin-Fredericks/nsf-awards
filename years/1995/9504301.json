The stable isotope 15N will be used to quantify nitrate,  ammonium and urea uptake in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, a  high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) area, during the next  mesoscale iron enrichment experiment (Iron Ex II) scheduled  for May-June, 1995.  The study will obtain accurate and  quantitative data of the nitrogenous nutrition of the  natural assemblage that will determination whether or not  iron fertilization enhances new production.  The size-  spectrum of nitrogen utilization will be determined by using  different pore-sized filters to collect particulate material  after short-term incubations, since cell size is thought to  be a major factor controlling the sinking flux of material  from the surface waters (i.e.  export production, which is  related to new production).  All nitrogen uptake rates of  total and size- fractionated samples will be corrected for  the effects of isotopic-dilution which may occur during the  experimental incubation periods, a condition which otherwise  could result in serious underestimation of calculated  nitrogen uptake rates of urea and ammonium.  The  heterotrophic contribution to total community nitrogen  uptake will be determined by utilizing size-fractionation  techniques and specific metabolic inhibitors to distinguish  between heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic  phytoplankton.  Additionally, the radioactive isotope 3H  will be used to determine the changes in heterotrophic  bacterial production as a result of iron fertilization, and  these data, together with estimates of bacterial abundance,  will provide an estimate of growth rate for the  heterotrophic assemblage.  The nitrogen uptake rates  determined for autotrophs and heterotrophs, together with  quantification of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) released  during normal 15N-tracer incubations and its effect on  traditional measures of uptake,  will allow for accurate  estimations of new and regenerated production in the  experimental ecosystem.  The experiments in this proposed  nitrogenous nutrition study are a key component in the next  mesoscale iron enrichment study, and their results will be  critical for a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem  response to iron enrichment during Iron Ex II.",
