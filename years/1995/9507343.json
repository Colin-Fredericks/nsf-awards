 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are central to biology from  both the basic and the methodological perspectives. As the  key elements in the cellular translation process they are  subjects of detailed structure/function studies in their own  right. In addition, their evolutionary characteristics make  them extremely useful as tools in other areas, microbiology  in particular. Comparative analysis of rRNA sequences has  (i) provided the secondary structure of the rRNAs; (ii) led  to the inference of the universal tree of life--a basis for  a natural microbial classification--and the discovery of the  Archaea, (iii) provided the basis for new and powerful  approaches to microbial ecology; (iv) defined targets for  much of the organism-specific probe development in medical  diagnosis; and (v) provided new methods for environmental  impact and bioremediation assessment. Such studies require  large amounts of the rRNA data, and these can be used  effectively only in the context of the appropriate database  of rRNA sequences and related data. It is not sufficient to  provide just the raw sequence data; many analyses require  that the data be organized into alignments, that there be a  phylogenetic overview, and that tools and (for many users)  ser vices be available for data handling and analysis.    In that an rRNA sequence database this useful, this  versatile, did not exist, the Ribosome Database Project  (RDP) has been established at the University of Illinois  with support from the NSF. Through its E-mail  (server@rdp.life.uiuc.edu), ftp (rdp.life.uiuc.edu), gopher  (rdpgopher.life.uiuc.edu) and World Wide Web  (http://rdpwww.life.uiuc.edu/index.html) servers, the RDP  offers aligned and phylogenetically ordered rRNA sequences  in a variety of user-selectable formats, as well as various  software for handling and analysis of the data. In addition,  services including automated sequence alignment, organism-  specific (or group-specific) probe design checking,  retrieval of user-selectable subsets o f the sequence data  and phylogenetic trees, and rRNA secondary structure  diagrams are provided.    The RDP currently maintains its data in files with formats  that are appropriate for the tools used by the RDP and by  the researchers served. As the volume of data increases, the  need for a more robust and structured system is clear. A  properly designed and implemented version of the RDP on a  database management system (DBMS) will: (i) ensure smooth  growth of the RDP; (ii) provide a uniform and efficient  interface to the RDP data for data accumulation, curation  and querying; and (iii) facilitate the addition of new modes  of access to the RDP data and services. The increased  structuring of the data is being carried out with an eye  toward linkage of the RDP's resources with other available  data, facilitating the creation of a federated database. In  addition to increasing the value of the RDP (and the data  that will be linked to it), the proposed work will explore  methods for efficient storage and retrieval of aligned  sequence data (the largest component of the RDP), and for  performing the kinds of complex queries that are used in  curating and exploiting these data.    Specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) complete a  detailed design and implementation of a DBMSbased version of  the RDP; (ii) provide the graphical user interfaces (GUIs)  necessary for the efficient curation of the data; (iii) use  the increased data structuring to further automate the RDP's  data updating and management procedures; (iv) provide all  existing user access modes through the DBMS implementation  (v) improve and expand the access modes and query  capabilities available to users of the RDP; and (v provide  the necessary \"hooks\" for integration of the RDP with other  data, initially the federation of microbial databases being  proposed by the Center for Microbial Ecology (CME) at  Michigan State University (MSU).    Given the present volume of rRNA sequence data l  approximately 3500 sequences) and  the estimated future level  (tens of thousands of sequences, or more), the RDP has  essential roles to play in biological, medical and  environmental research in the future. To fill these roles,  it is necessary to update its design without interfering  with current services. This proposal addresses this need.",
