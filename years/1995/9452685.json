 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452685  Kelly    Hampshire College seeks to initiate a summer residential Young  Scholars program for 60 students during a six week session.  The  program is called Hampshire College Summer Studies in  Mathematics.  The faculty of college professors, mathematics  majors and graduate students live in the program dormitory and  join students for meals and recreational activities as well as  for more than 8 hours of mathematics each day.  Small and lively  classes and 3 hour evening problem seminars of 15 students guided  by a professor and two assistants, will collaboratively  investigate challenging and rewarding problems from number  theory, group theory, combinatorics, probability, the fourth  dimension, graph theory, infinity, fractals, chaos, and other  active branches of mathematics.  Emphasis will be placed on the  processes of mathematical thought, discovering patterns,  formulating questions and definitions, making conjectures, and  creating proofs, rather than the simple accumulation of results.   Activities include classes for four hours each morning, evening  problem seminars, daily Prime Time Theorems, visits by pure and  applied mathematicians, a weekly program journal, computers, math  films, and field trips.  Regular contacts will seek to engage  alums and their teachers with serious mathematics and to maintain  the spirit of the Summer Studies intellectual community.  ***",
