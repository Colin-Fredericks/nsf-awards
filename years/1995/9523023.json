The research builds on a previous project which identified  several areas of potentially significant research.  These  include the effect of polymer content, effect of lime,  curing procedure and flow, type of plasticizer, and moisture  content of masonry.    This research will provide approximately 1000 test values on  brick masonry prisms constructed with a variety of latex  additives that have already been proven to have considerable  potential on increasing the tensile bond strength of clay  masonry construction.    The study will be directed into three phases.  Phase 1 will  evaluate 9 polymer types in detail (588 tests).  Phases 2  and 3 (336 tests) will focus on those 16 contributions from  the 36 mortar batches tested in Phase 1 that are shown to  provide the greatest enhancement in flexural bond strength.    The research will provide for the first time, a  comprehensive data base on the enhancement of the flexural  bond strength of polymer modified mortars.  This is in  itself significant since there is no current data available  that indicates whether or not the traditional weal link  masonry (i.e., the bond between mortar and masonry unit) can  be significantly improved through the use of such additives.  The recent enhancements in concrete strength and durability  through the use of various additives and superplasticizers  in the concrete mix, cannot be applied directly to masonry  mortars.    The potential impact of such bond strength enhancement on  the use of unreinforced masonry construction has important  implications both in retrofitting and strengthening existing  masonry construction and in the design of new construction.  ***",
