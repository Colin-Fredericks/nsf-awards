Therefore, an interdisciplinary group (computer scientists and other relevant disciplines) will evaluate and suggest fruitful directions for progress in user interfaces.  A two-day workshop will produce a summary report with analysis derived from deliberations by the steering committee.  A workshop would serve to bring together individuals from different disciplines, perspectives/schools of thought, and activities (research, product development, and so on) to identify and begin to narrow down the capabilities of desirable ordinary citizen interfaces (OCIs).  It could determine the state-of-the-art of research in CS and other disciplines, identify the questions most important to investigate next, identify what is known from research on the longer-term problems that will aid in the near-term human-computer communications de sign, and identify important long-term research issues.  Further, there is a need to promote university-industry collaboration to provide reality-checks on the utility of research and to create theoretical bases for development, enhancing the application of research.
