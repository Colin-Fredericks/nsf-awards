Ratner,  Northwestern University, Evanston, and Dr. Vadimiro Mujica,  Universidad Central de Venezuela, on theoretical approaches  to interfacial electron transfers.  The research will be on  formal and numerical investigations of the scanning  tunneling microscope (STM) currents in systems comprising  metal substrate, adsorbed molecule, and STM tip.  The  approach considers the time-dependent behavior of the  system, with the electron moving from metal through molecule  to tip.  The study will include electro/vibration  interactions, electron/electron repulsion, and complex  molecular geometry coupling, and will focus on the overall  dynamics of the process, and the calculation of the  conductance and its variations.    The research is timely and  important, both from the  fundamental knowledge and the technological point of view.  The expertise and resources of the collaborators are  complementary.  Studies will be carried out with  sufficiently realistic molecular detail allowing meaningful  comparison with experimental data, thus  providing valuable  perspectives about the interrelationship of conductance,  conductivity, and super-exchange-mediated donor-acceptance.    ***",
