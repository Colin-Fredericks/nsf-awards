 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422111  Crossin  The development of the nervous system is dependent upon coordinated  interactions among specialized cells including neurons, glia and  other types of support cells, and of these cells with surrounding  extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Cell attachment and migration  as well as neurite outgrowth, guidance, and fasciculation are all  affected by interaction of cells with components of the ECM during  both development and regeneration. This research focuses on  analyzing a specific ECM protein, called cytotactin/tenascin, and  its interaction with nerve cells and with other matrix components.   This molecule is particularly interesting because it has been shown  to promote cell growth under some conditions and to inhibit growth  under others.  The results of these studies should reveal  mechanisms of neurite outgrowth promotion by molecules present in  regenerating nerves and also promise to shed light on general  mechanisms of cellular guidance and repair occurring during  development and regeneration of the nervous system.",
