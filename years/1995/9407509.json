 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higdon       The investigator studies the numerical solution of partial  differential equations that describe large-scale ocean  circulation.  The main topic of investigation is operator splitting  for the governing equations.  These equations admit wave velocities  having widely varying magnitudes, and this situation creates  serious problems with the stability and efficiency of numerical  algorithms.  One common approach to resolving these problems is to  split the fast and slow dynamics into separate subproblems.  The  fast motions are essentially independent of depth, and it is  natural to try to model these motions with a two-dimensional  system of equations.  The slow motions would then be modeled with a  three-dimensional system.  However, if the splitting is inexact,  then the equations that supposedly model the slow motions may  actually admit fast motions, to some degree.  There then arises the  possibility that these fast motions might cause numerical  instabilities in the computational algorithm.  The main goal of  this project is to develop a stable, efficient, and accurate  operator splitting for the governing equations.  Secondary goals  are to develop open boundary conditions for limited-area models  and to examine higher-order difference methods for spatial  discretizations.       One of the major scientific challenges of the present day is  to obtain high-resolution computer simulations of global ocean  circulation over periods of many years.  Such simulations are of  great interest because the ocean is a crucial component of the  earth's climate system, so studies of possible global change must  include a careful examination of the role of the ocean.  For  example, the ocean has a great capacity to transport heat energy;  part of this transport is due to bulk transport by major current  systems, and part is due to mixing caused by smaller-scale eddies  that are shed from currents.  Comprehensive data on these processes  are difficult to collect, and it appears that an accurate   understanding of the earth's climate system will require numerical  simulations based on an eddy-resolving model of the general  circulation of the ocean.  Such simulations will present great  computational demands.  The goal of this project is to contribute  to the development of suitable numerical methods for these  computations.  This work is being performed in collaboration with  members of the physical oceanography modeling group in the College  of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Oregon State University.",
