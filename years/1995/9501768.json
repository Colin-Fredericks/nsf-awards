 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is two-fold.  First, it seeks to study the  communication characteristics of applications that can benefit from  the computing power, very large memory, and high-speed  communication of parallel computing systems.  Within this context  measurements are being takel of the traffic generated by both  regular and irregular scientific applications, applications written  in a variety of programming paradigms, data-mining applications and  applications with real-time traffic demands.  Second the project  seeks to use the information gathered from applications to guide  the designs for interconnect devices and programmable communication  coprocessors that efficiently support multiple classes of  applications and multiple programming paradigms.    The education plan addresses two important issues in experimental  computer science: First it addresses the issue to teaching a  subject area, such as high performance computing, that is  technology-driven and where the relevance of knowledge and  information can have a very short life span.  Second, it addresses  the issue of teaching the methodology of experimentation and in  particular the process of designing experiments.",
