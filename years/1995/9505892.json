 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, George   Ewing of Indiana University,  Bloomington, will study the spectroscopy,   dynamics, and reactivities of diatomic and polyatomic  molecules adsorbed   on ionic insulator surfaces.  Infrared spectroscopic techniques will be   used to  explore molecular structures and motions, energy transfer   mechanisms between the adlayer and the  substrate, and bonding within the   adlayer and between the adlayer and substrate.  Using pulsed  ultraviolet   laser excitation, photochemical reactions on the surface will be   initiated and  monitored by fluorescence.  Systems to be investigated   include hydrogen, sulfur dioxide, and methane  on lithium fluoride, sodium   chloride, and potassium bromide.  A major objective of this research is  to influence current theoretical models of monolayer photochemistry and   energy transfer, and to  observe and understand chemical reactions which   are unique to surface environments.    Surfaces can  influence chemical reactions in a variety of ways, including   energy transfer to or from the surface,  changing the strength of chemical   bonds, and altering the energetics of chemical reactions.  Professor   Ewing's work will clarify some of the issues involving energetics and   chemical reactions  on relatively inert substrates such as sodium chloride   and potassium bromide. The study of these  systems will also contribute to   our theoretical understanding of more complex systems.",
