 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420335  Sander  A series of projects in the theory of statistical physics far from  equilibrium will be studied.  The growth of random rough surfaces  will be considered; new work is proposed in the description of  growth by molecular-beam epitaxy.  An inverse method will be  applied to the generic theory of interface growth, and the  Kuramoto-Shivashinsky equation of flame fronts will be investigated  using the same techniques.  Three problems related to the  diffusion-limited aggregation model will be studied:  the question  of lacunarity, a statistical analysis of the homogenieties of the  fractal clusters produced by the model, and the inverse method will  be applied to generate a continuum equation.  Finally work will be  done in the field of patterns and fluctuations in chemical  reactions.  In the context of two simple statistical models an  attempt to understand the effects of noise and disorder on the  formation of chemical patterns will be undertaken.  %%%  A series of projects will be undertaken on systems which are not in  equilibrium.  Examples of these systems include:  the growth of  surfaces in materials, the behavior of flames, models of  aggregation of particles, pattern formation occuring in chemical  reactions and the effects of noise on these systems.  Common models  which describe these various phenomena will be studied.",
