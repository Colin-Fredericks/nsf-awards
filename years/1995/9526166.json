The objective of this symposium  is to bring together internationally distinguished material  scientists of different expertise to provide a forum for  discussion of important advances in micromechanics of high  technology materials.  The  program is attached, which  consists of 39 invited papers and 46 contributed papers.  The broad spectrum and high-caliber of invited speakers  covers the interrelation between the micro and  macromechanics of fracture in advanced materials, such as  intermetallics, composites, polymer-based composites, and  amorphous materials.  Fatigue and fracture and crack growth  modeling are considered.  %%%  This symposium accomplishes two things: It provides a  comprehensive understanding of the essential roles of  micromechanics of defects, specifically, dislocations,  cracks and etc., on mechanical behavior of advanced  materials, and it serves as a guideline for the future  materials research direction.  The symposium will bring  together a classic proceedings volume for the materials  research community to use.  ***",
