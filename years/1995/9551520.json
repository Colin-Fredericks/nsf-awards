The need for improvement of student skills  in communication, problem solving, integration of knowledge and  teamwork is commonly understood.  Some of this need can be met by  a change in the techniques used in the teaching of laboratory  courses.  The traditional method of laboratory instruction  frequently degenerates into a \"cookbook\" method, a mode in which  students follow a \"recipe\" for experimentation from their lab book.   Such exercises do not teach students to conduct an independent  scientific experiment, or to record and communicate to others the  information obtained during the course of an experiment.  The  \"cookbook\" method also fails to teach students to derive  information explicitly from measured parameters or to properly  apply statistics.  In short, most laboratory instruction does not  contribute to the development of the student as a critical thinker.   One solution to this problem is to abandon the \"cookbook\" in favor  of a sequence of team-oriented, open-ended laboratory experiences.   In this mode of laboratory instruction, students are given a  problem, trained to use the experimental apparatus, and taught the  fundamental concepts necessary for understanding the problem.  They  are required to design the experiments and analyze the data without  recourse to recipes.  Since it is believed that these skills cannot  be taught in a single course of instruction, our obj ective is to  develop independent exercises for introducing experimental design  skills into two pre-requisite classes on semiconductor devices and  electronic properties (MatE 153 and EE 128), followed by an  interdisciplinary, team-oriented design course in semiconductor  process engineering (EE/MatE 129).  The latter course will simulate  the engineering roles of industry, where interdisciplinary teams  are the rule and open-ended experimentation is a fact of life.",
