The development of a scientific understanding of the causes and consequences is the central theoretical concern o of this project.  It uses a community-level, quantitative methodology to investigate the relationships between social capital and patterns of violence.  It identifies community risk factors predictive of violence in major American cities.  It seeks to compare the structural sources of violence by blacks as compared to violence by whites and of juvenile as compared to adult violence, to integrate, theoretically, family and school variables in the research, to identify direct and indirect effects of structural conditions on violence rates, and to examine the effects of change in structural conditions between 1980 and 1990 on race- and age-specific violence rates.  The project will produce a unique and useful data set for secondary analysis by other researchers.  %%%%  Crime and violence have pervasive impacts on the development of America's human capital.
