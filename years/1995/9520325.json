The Division of Materials  Research, Division of Advanced Scientific Computing, and  Division of Mathematical Sciences are all supporting this  research. Fundamental and technological issues motivate this  work.  Magnetic mass storage technology is rapidly  progressing to the state where single bits are stored on the  scale of  thousands of atoms.  At the same time,  understanding of model and realistic fundamental behavior of  ferromagnetism in the restrictive geometries of thin films,  whiskers, and single-domain grains is rudimentary at best.  The investigators propose to further develop and utilize a  computer algorithm developed by Novotny that is much f aster  than others.  The project simulates phenomena that evolve in  time in real ferromagnets on the scale of thousands of  atoms.  The investigators are developing codes on a parallel  computer at the Supercomputer Computations Research  Institute at Florida State University.  They will then make  production runs on a similar machine at Cornell University.  These calculations will couple with recent advances in  engineering magnetic materials on this scale and on  experimental studies of dynamical phenomena using magnetic  force microscopies.  ***",
