 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501256  Parter    The major efforts of this research project are twofold: (1) The study of   preconditioning strategies for the Chebyshev spectral collocation method   for elliptic boundary-value problems, and (2) the study of first order least   squares methods for equations of practical import.  The equations of linear   elasticity are of special importance and interest.  The significance of a-  posteriori error estimates for these problems is balanced by the need for   deeper a-priori error estimates.  The difficulty in obtaining a-priori error   estimates stems from the explicit appearance of the divergence operator in   these problems.  Similar difficulties appear in the study of numerical   methods for the Stokes equations.      There are many important practical problems which arise in fluid flow and   elasticity which lead to problems which must be solved on the computer.    The solutions of these problems are then approximations to solutions of   elliptic boundary value problems.  Most of the research in this area has   emphasized finding a computer problem whose solution is indeed a very   good approximation to the solution of the elliptic problem.  Having done   that, one must still find efficient and relatively cheap methods to solve the   computer problem.  This last, very practical problem, is the focus of the   research in this project.",
