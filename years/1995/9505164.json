 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  This is a study of the work aspirations of young women as they are affected by their local area of residence.  The research ties together theories about gender and work aspirations with broader issues dealing with the effects from opportunity structures and from cultural and political milieus.  National data about aspirations are available from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and  information about place will come from a variety of existing sources.  More focused data will follow from intensive interviews with 26 adolescents, gathered over three years, from two high schools in Connecticut.  Information on place to supplement those interviews will be provided by a survey of the high schools along with additional data about the communities.  %%%   This research will contribute to the sociological understanding of gender roles, work aspirations, and local labor markets.  By taking into account how the local labor market is simultaneously an opportunity structure and a cultural and political setting in which aspirations are shaped and constrained, it will be of use to policy makers concerned with broadening opportunities for women in the work world.   In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
