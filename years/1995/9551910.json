 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a networked personal computer laboratory for  sociology.   This pedagogical approach premises that sociology is  becoming an applied information science.   The new Quantitative  Research Laboratory for sociology helps to define sociology as an  information-based laboratory science.   It serves as the hub of  the department, housing large quantities of data, integrating  several methodological as well as substantive courses, and  orienting students to the more scientific aspects of sociological  inquiry.   The technological hub integrates methodological  training by providing a common platform for all methods courses.    Several substantive courses, as well as the methods courses, are  further integrated by a community area study.    Treating  sociology as an applied information science with an emphasis on  laboratory-based training improves undergraduate education of  sociology majors in several ways:  (1) it improves the  statistical analysis skills of students; (2) it defines and  portrays an undergraduate curriculum that more closely resembles  the training and orientation of graduate studies and the work  performed by professional sociologists; (3) it trains  undergraduate students on the types of equipment and software  applications they are likely to encounter in the workplace; and  (4) it creates a stronger position for sociology as an  undergraduate major in the postindustrial economy.",
