 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this project addresses  fundamental questions in computational learning theory and  complexity.  It also  addresses specific learning problems that  are motivated by practical  applications.  Computational learning  theory provides a framework for the  formal study of problems in  machine learning.  The first goal of this project  is to determine  necessary and sufficient conditions for learning, prove lower  bounds, and design learning algorithms.  A focus is on query  models of  learning, which represent situations in which a learner  can ask questions of a  teacher or expert, or perform experiments.  Emphasis is placed on  the effect of forbidden  projections on the learnability of investigating   Boolean function classes.    The project also aims to determine structural  properties of  languages, in order to prove complexity results.  It is directed  particularly at resolving open questions concerning automata with  powers of  both randomness and nondeterminism.    Another major goal of the project   is to develop algorithms for learning in the presence of irrelevant data.    A particular  problem is to develop PAC (Probably Approximately Correct)  algorithms that are robust in the presence of irrelevant attributes   in the following way:  they  depending on only a few more attributes   then the concept they are  learning.  This problem is theoretical but   motivated by practical applications, such as medical diagnosis.  In these applications,  output hypotheses are used for future prediction  (diagnosis).  Determining the value of an attribute is expensive perhaps  involving a clinical test, and therefore it is desirable to limit  the number of  attributes whose values must be determined.    The educational component of this  project includes goals in both  undergraduate and graduate education.  At the  undergraduate level  a basic goal is to make theoretical courses accessible and  intellectually exciting to a wide range  of students.  Methods for  achieving  this goal include the following:  preparing handouts,  introducing historical  and biographical material, presenting  algorithms to students using algorithm  animation, and using  computer lab `algorithm experiments.`    At the graduate  level, the project includes teaching a graduate  course in computational  complexity theory with a significant  research component.  In addition, a  reading group in  computational learning theory, started last year, will be  continued.",
