One project concerns  the study of the magnetic symmetry of the lamellar copper  oxide antiferromagnets, with a goal of accounting for the  observed magnetic anisotropy.  Since these materials (when  suitable doped) give rise to high temperature  superconductivity, this research can have technological as  well as intellectual payoffs.  Another project concerns the  symmetry in Kagome antiferromagnets.  Such systems are  realized in structures in which magnetic ions occupy lattice  planes that are widely separated by nonmagnetic ions.  The  principal investigator will attempt to answer the open  question as to whether there is long range order of any type  in the quantum ground state.  If there is, it would probably  involve a totally new and interesting type of symmetry.  %%%  Symmetries play a crucial role as an aid in interpreting and  understanding materials.  This research involves work in two  projects in which the symmetries involved are not well  understood.  Both projects concern antiferromagnets, in  which magnetic spins do not all align but rather alternate  in a regular pattern.  The first addresses the magnetic  symmetry in lamellar copper oxides, which are materials that  give rise to high temperature superconductivity when they  are doped.  The second concerns the symmetry in a quantum  model on a special two dimensional lattice.  If long range  order is present in this system in the absence of thermal  disorder, this would probably involve a totally new and  interesting type of symmetry.  ***",
