In numerous practical contexts, researchers   are confronted with the inadequacy of standard statistical techniques  to handle the explosion in the size of current data sets, where the  number of observations can easily run into the giga- and even terabyte  ranges.   Statistical assumptions underlying many  of the most popular methods, such as \"homogeneity\" of the data,  may simply be wrong  in these cases, thus rendering common statistical  tools ineffective and even dangerous.   A corresponding problem is the growth in the  number of dimensions in many current problems.  Again standard  approaches, which were developed  in a different  era, even predating the computer in many cases, are not powerful  enough for these challenges.      The workshop on Statistics and Massive Datasets explores  the challenges  presented by massive data sets, and  does so in the context   of a variety of real world and currently pressing application areas, including  the atmospheric, biological and geo sciences, business and marketing,  ecology, and engineering and technology. With these areas as a backdrop,   specific over-arching multi-disciplinary research issues  on common needs,   including relevant statistical principles, computational aspects, data analysis, and  visualization of massive data sets are identified.   The workshop involves highly  animated discussions among scientists.  These discussions are not easily  captured in a traditional published proceedings format.  In contrast, the  activities are capture d and distributed via the preparation of a videotape  of the workshop followed by a World Wide Web (WWW) dissemination.   This new dissemination method brings the benefit   of the actual discussions to a wide audience in a timely fashion.",
