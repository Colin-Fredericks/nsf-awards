 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417547  Beers      This award will partially support the travel expenses, over a  three year period, for Dr. Timothy Beers and one of his graduate  students from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan  State University, to enable them to each made one visit to  conduct cooperative research with Dr. John E. Norris of the  Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories and Dr. Sean Ryan  of the Anglo-Australian Observatory in Epping, Australia.  The  collaborative research will focus on the discovery and analysis  of extremely low metallicity in the Galactic Halo.    Large numbers of extremely metal-deficient stars provide crucial  information on questions in cosmology, the formation and  evolution of the Galaxy, and the production and processing of  light elements in stars.  Observations of low-metallicity  candidates through the southern hemisphere sky, made possible  through this collaboration, will provide a significant increase  in the numbers of stars with metal abundances less than 1/1000th  of the solar  value, thereby enabling a wide range of  investigations concerning the formation and evolution of our  Galaxy, and the Universe.  Specific investigations include a  detailed comparison of the metallicity distribution function of  extremely metal-poor stars with predictions of Galactic  enrichment models, a study of the kinematics of metal-deficient  stars as a function of abundance and distance from the Galactic  plane, and high-resolution observations of the relative  abundances of the light and heavy elements in stars, which in  turn place fundamental constraints on stellar evolution and on  nucleosynthesis processes in the early Universe. In addition to  the access this award will provide to the Australian astronomers  with mutual interests, the project will result in additional  viewing opportunities using Australian facilities to survey the  southern hemisphere sky.",
