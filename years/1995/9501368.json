 "awd_abstract_narration": "Henson   9502327    This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant which includes both a research as well as an educational component.    Research:  The PI's research focuses on the development of nonlinear output feedback control strategies for constrained multivariable processes.  More effective estimation and control techniques are needed for chemical processes as a result of increased demands on productivity and product quality.  In order to provide satisfactory performance, industrial control systems must account for multiple inputs and outputs, nonlinear dynamic behavior, process constraints, and lack of on-line measurements.  The objective of this research is to develop a computationally efficient control strategy for chemical processes that exhibit these characteristics.  The control system has three distinct components:  (1) a nonlinear closed-loop observer which provides on-line estimates of unmeasured state variables; (2) a multivariable input-output linearizing controller which accounts for process nonlinearities; and (3) a multivariable linear model predictive controller which compensates for process constraints.  The control strategy will be analyzed theoretically and evaluated via simulation using representative chemical and polymerization reactor models.  A collaborative arrangement with DuPont will allow the control scheme to be applied to an industrial polymerization process.  This test will facilitate technology transfer to industry.    Education:  The teaching plan is designed to enhance the educational opportunities available in the Louisiana State University Chemical Engineering Department.  The specific goals of the plan are to: (1) improve the department's computer facilities; (2) revise the curriculum for the department's process control courses; (3) computerize experiments in the department's undergraduate laboratories; (4) revitalize the department's undergraduate research program; (5) establish a minority student program in the department; and (6) participa te in the department's graduate student recruitment program.",
