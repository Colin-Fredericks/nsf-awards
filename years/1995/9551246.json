 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, a technique of using synthetic H20-KCl  fluid inclusions is developed to visually simulate magmatic  crystallization and melting behavior for students enrolled in an  upper-division petrology course.   The technique offers students  an interactive, visual learning experience of a geologic process  that can never be directly observed.   Using synthetic H2O-KCl  fluid inclusions of known composition and a heating and cooling  stage, students conduct an exercise in which they observe and  control: (1) eutectic melting (of ice and sylvite at -10.7 C),  (2) liquidus crystallization and melting of ice or sylvite, and  (3) final ice or sylvite melting temperatures.   Using these  data, students construct their own phase diagram of the  water-rich portion of the H2O-KCl system and will then explore  questions on the (1) the relationship between eutectic and  liquidus temperatures and bulk composition and (2) applications  of the phase rule at various temperatures.   The main advantage  of this technique is that all of the important phase changes  analogous to magmatic systems (i.e., eutectic and liquidus  behavior, crystallization and melting textures) can be visually  observed and controlled by the student.   Consequently, every  space, line and point on a phase diagram will have direct  relevance to the student and result in a more meaningful  interpretation of phase diagrams and their application to igneous  rocks.",
