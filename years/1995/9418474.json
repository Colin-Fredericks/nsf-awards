 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boisy  9418474         The cytoplasm of cells is organized by means of a  dynamic filamentous framework called the cytoskeleton.  This  framework may be likened to a rail network along which move  many kinds of cellular \"cargo.\"  The \"cargo\" moves along the  rail network after loading onto transport vehicles  equivalent to \"flatbeds\" or \"tanker cars\" and these are  moved along the rail network by engines of various kinds.  The problem in understanding the organization of the  cytoplasm is to figure out the molecular workings of this  \"rail network.\"  The network in cells is composed of three  kinds of filamentous \"rails\" actin filaments, microtubules,  and intermediate filaments.  Some of the motors and \"cargo\"  for actin filaments and microtubules but the role of  intermediate filaments remain a mystery.       Special cells in the skin of fish provide a  particularly favorably system in which to investigate the  role of these intermediate filaments.  These cells display  spectacular cytoplasmic traffic; thousands of granules of  pigment can be induced to move rapidly and synchronously  either inwards towards the center of the cell or outwards  toward the periphery in response to a hormonal stimulus.  This system will be used to test whether intermediate  filaments participate in the movement of granules.  %%%       This study is important because will address a  fundamental mystery about he organization of the cytoplasm  and the traffic which takes place within it.  This study  will be the first to investigate the potential role of  intermediate filaments in the translocation and specific  positioning of cellular components.  Such process  necessarily entail molecular motors and have the potential  to affect numerous cellular functions including uptake and  secretion of materials from cells, positioning of organelles  and segregation of genetic material at the time of cell  division.  ***",
