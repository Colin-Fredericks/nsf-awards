 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although a number of important new fossil finds relating to the emergence of humans have been discovered in the past twenty years, there remains a great deal of controversy surrounding their interpretation - for example,  how the animals such as the `Lucy` finds got around - did they walk like us, or shuffle, or arm-swing, or do something different.  This dissertation project will analyze the evidence from hand bones to the debate about the locomotion of A. afarensis, the `Lucy` species.  Unlike the hands of all other primates, our hands have little or not role in locomotion.  This research will examine the metacarpals and finger bones (phalanges) of a number of extant and fossil monkeys in order to determine the structural correlates of locomotor differences.  Data will be obtained from x-rays, molding, and measuring original specimens and casts.  Correlations will be made betwen metacarpal cross-secional geometric properties, mid-shpft shape of metacarpals and phalanges, and their curvatures, and a comparison will be performed, taking into account the different body sizes.  A pilot study has already confirmed the usefullness of these measurements, showing that there are structural features of the long bones of the hand which do correlate with different locomotor repertoires.    These features will in turn help to elucidate the locomotor behaviors of A. afarensis, and should be useful in determining such behaviors in other extinct hominoids.     This award will also enhance the training of an energetic and excellent professional prospect.",
