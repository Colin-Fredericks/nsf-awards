 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408635  Fulton     Naegleria gruberi  undergoes a developmental transformation  from amoebae to flagellates over 100 minutes and may serve as a  paradigm to study cell differentiation led us to calcium-  binding proteins. Two calmodulins are synthesized during  differentiation and become localized in flagellates, one in the  flagella and the other in the flagellate cell body.  Characterization of the single-copy intronless gene that  encodes flagellar calmodulin (CaM-1) has shown that it cannot  encode flagellate cell-body calmodulin (CaM-2). Initial  attempts to isolate the CaM-2 gene led us to discover other  differentiation-specific calcium-binding proteins, most notably  centrin (a.k.a. caltractin). Our proposed research is focused  on centrin and CaM-2. Centrin is a ubiquitous, diversely  centriole-associated member of the calmodulin superfamily that  has been implicated in Ca2+-mediated, ATPindependent  contractility, a third contractile system. Although centrin is  clearly a crucial eukaryotic protein, its functions, especially  in relation to centrosome and basal body dynamics, are little  understood. In Naegleria, centrin is developmentally regulated  and becomes associated with the basal bodies when these  organelles form de novo during differentiation. We plan to  complete ongoing studies i) of the developmental regulation  (e.g., phosphorylation) of centrin during Naegleria  differentiation and basal-body assembly and ii) of remarkable  structures formed by centrin-like proteins in certain other  organisms, especially the spasmoneme of vorticellid ciliates.  In order to better understand centrin, we plan iii) to seek and  characterize proteins that associate with centrin using the  cloned Naegleria centrin gene and the two-hybrid system in  yeast and iv) to define by isolation, cloning and sequencing a  centrin-related protein that is strongly implicated in  contraction, the spasmin of Vorticella. In addition, we plan to  define the second differentiation-specific calmodulin, CaM-2,   by cloning its gene(s). These studies are of general interest  in relation to two questions 1) What are the differences  between the two differentiation-specific calmodulins of  Naegleria, especially in relation to whether multiple  calmodulins are a common feature among eukaryotes? 2) What is  the structure and function of centrin, especially in Naegleria  differentiation, what macromolecular structures does it form,  and what is its relation to spasmin? Finally, a portion of our  research effort continues to be directed toward obtaining DNA-  mediated transformation of Naegleria, which would permit us to  use the power of molecular genetics to dissect events during  this otherwise ideal differentiation, such as the mechanism by  which flagellar calmodulin (CaM-1) becomes localized in  peninsular flagella. %%%  This is a project which focuses on a group of protozoa on which very  little work is currently being done, but which have evolved a  fascinating interplay of cellular events.   The protozoan, Naegleria  gruberi,  undergoes a dramatic shift from a crawling, amoeboid state  to a swimming state by the de novo formation of flagella, the whip-  like structures which motors many  swimming cells.  The work pursues  this switch by concentrating on the new structural proteins which  arise in the flagellated state, such as the contractile protein,  centrin.   In addition, by understanding the developmental control of  genes which are newly transcribed, the switch to a new developmental  pathway can be assessed.  The switch may involve the expression of  particular calcium binding proteins, or calmodulins.  The project  focuses on the characterization of the Naegleria centrin and the  different forms of calmodulins.  The association of centrins from  Naegleria and another protozoan, Vorticella, with itself and other  proteins is examined. The nature of this contractile protein is  explored.  The control of differential expression of calmodulins will  be approached by testing the efficacy of obtai ning transgenic  protists for these studies.  The protists can then be transformed  with different genetic variants of calmodulins and their effect on  the development of flagella determined. By examining this unique  organism, the diversity of microbes and their multiple ways of coping  with their environment will be further illuminated.  ***",
