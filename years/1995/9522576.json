 "awd_abstract_narration": "McAnany    Under the direction of Dr. Patricia McAnany, Ms. Mary Lee  Angelini will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She  will analyze ceramics from the archaeological site of K'axob, a  prehistoric Mayan village. Her goal is to look at changes in the  manufacture of ceramics over time. To determine the types of  clays which the K'axob potters exploited, she will compare  ceramic pastes from three hundred and thirty-eight vessels from  the site to one hundred clay samples from locations in northern  Belize proximate to K'axob. Comparisons will be based on ceramic  petrography and INAA. Vessels will be sampled to obtain  information on the full range of types present and clay locales  will be tested on the basis of soil data and topographical  features. Determination of changes in production technology will  be investigated through analysis of formation techniques as  revealed through breakage patterns, xeroradiography and  petrography and determination of clay modification strategies  through petrography and experimental testing. Changes in vessel  size and form will also be noted.    Because ceramics are so abundant in many prehistoric sites and  because they preserve well in the ground, they provide a focus  for much archaeological analysis. Archaeologists try to  reconstruct prehistoric social, political and economic  organization on the basis of detailed analysis of such remains.  The site of K'axob spans the time period when complex Mayan  society emerged. Most archaeologists believe that as social  complexity increases and centralized authority appears, objects  such as ceramics become more standardized because production is  taken over by specialists who operate under a hierarchical form  of control. The case of K'axob is very interesting because -  based on visual inspection of ceramic form - just the opposite  seems to occur. If this is the case, it challenges a basic  archaeological assumption. Ms. Angelini wishes to see if this  pattern holds when one examines the same corp us of data from a  technological perspective and determines where raw materials were  collected and how vessels were made.    This project is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many Middle Americanist archaeologists. It  will help scientists to refine analytic tools and models and it  will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
