 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Joel M. Bowman at the Department of Chemistry, Emory   University, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the computational study of the   reaction dynamics for gas phase molecules. Four specific molecular   processes are being studied under this grant. An important aspect of much   of the work is that it involves the interaction of light with free   molecules; in particular, the processes of photodissociation and   photodetachment are being examined. Another special and quite valuable   aspect of the work is that a major part of it is being carried out in   close interaction with an expert, at the same university, in electronic   structure theory. The result of this interaction is that Professor Bowman   is able to study reaction dynamics with potential energy surfaces which   are based on accurate treatments of the atomic interaction energies.   Since the accuracy of theoretical studies of the the reaction dynamics is   often limited by the accuracy of the potential energy surfaces,    Professor Bowman's access to accurate surfaces substantially reduces the   uncertainties in the results obtained from the work supported under this   grant.     The long term goal of the work being carried out is to predict and   explain important gas phase chemical processes, especially those which   occur in the atmosphere and in combustion processes. In the present work,   one of the photodissociation reaction processes examined is for a   molecule which contains chlorine and this reaction is believed to be   involved in the ozone depletion of the polar atmospheres. The results   obtained from this particular study are likely to be of immediate   importance for the Environmental Sciences.",
