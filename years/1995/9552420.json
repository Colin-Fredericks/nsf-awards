 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory enhancement project is developing instructional  capabilities in four environmental engineering courses:  \"Introduction to Environmental Engineering,\" \"Environmental  Biochemistry,\" \"Aquatic Chemistry for Environmental Engineers,\"  and \"Groundwater Protection and Remediation.\"  The project is  introducing nine new experiments to the laboratory sections that  supplement these courses.   These exercises are specifically  designed to give students an opportunity to simulate physical,  chemical, and biological processes that take place in natural and  engineered environments.  Quantitative data collected during  these experiments are applied toward solving realistic  engineering analysis and design problems.   A total organic  carbon analyzer and a scanning spectrophotometer are the major  equipment components used in this project.   This instrumentation  also serves to further expose students to the capabilities and  limitations of modern equipment commonly found in research  environmental laboratories but often absent from undergraduate  facilities.   An environmental degree option was offered for the  first time by the school's Department of Civil Engineering in  1993.   As part of this program, an environmental engineering  laboratory was developed and put to use in early 1994 for a new  aquatic chemistry course.   This project is further enhancing the  capabilities of the laboratory by providing students with  exercises designed to synthesize the concepts offered within the  environmental curriculum.   Many of the new experiments are  unique to undergraduate environmental engineering laboratories,  and provide undergraduates with the opportunity to apply their  results directly toward solving realistic engineering problems.",
