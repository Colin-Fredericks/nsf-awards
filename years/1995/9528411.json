ARTS is a task of Past Global Changes (PAGES), a core project of the IGBP.  The goal of ARTS is to expand our knowledge of the behavior of the tropical ocean-atmosphere, with seasonal-annual resolution, over periods of years to centuries.  This research will enhance our understanding of the global climate variability and should ultimately lead to greater predictability of the climate system.  The proposed workshop will help to set scientific priorities, coordinate ongoing research, define new avenues of research, and catalyze international collaboration in the pursuit of ARTS objectives.  Participants will include experts in several paleoclimatology disciplines as well as climatologists versed in tropical ocean-atmosphere interactions.  Products of the workshop will include a written science and implementation plan for publication by PAGES as well as a series of prospectuses for specific science projects to be carried out as part of ARTS.  Scientists from the U.S., Indonesia, France, Australia, Canada, China, and Japan are expected to participate.",
