 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on seeking new chemistry among the natural  defensive strategies of plants and insects in order to develop  biorational methods for insect control. Thus, research is heavily  focused on the analysis of micro amounts of volatile compounds from  plants and insects. Currently, separations of volatile compounds by  capillary gas chromatography and electron impact ionization of eluting  compounds yielding interpretable fragmentation patterns is the method  of choice for these studies. In addition, infochemicals involved in  insect-plant interactions (i.e., defense, alarm, recruitment, host  selection, repellent, attractant, communication etc.) are often present  at low levels as components of a complex mixture containing numerous  isomers. Thus, their characterization requires, in addition to  separation and mass fragmentation, an additional discriminatory  mechanism to identify isomeric compounds that cannot reliably be  identified from fragmentation data alone. The ability to interface a  gas-phase infra-red (IR) detector with the GC/MS instrument adds the  essential capability to detect and identify many isomeric structures  that are presently refractory to identification by fragmentation  pattern alone. An IR interface would not only improve the  identification of minute quantities of closely related analytes but do  so as a part of the existing GC/MS analytical process. Capillary gas  chromatography linked with Fourier transform gas-phase infrared  spectroscopy and mass spectrometry meets the need for such difficult  micro analyses.         Because each analysis requires identification of a dozen or more  compounds, searchable libraries, containing the fragmentation patterns  of thousands of known compounds, are an absolute necessity. Upgrading  the software data system to accommodate MS-DOS will permit access to an  enormous resource base of compoundq that will vastly enhance structure  characterization. Similarly, interaction with the data systems  developed by colleag ues engaged in similar studies will allow sharing  of information and research results.         The existing GC/MS hardware has been very well maintained and is  in excellent condition. However, the present data system depends  entirely upon a Pascal based system which is wholly incompatible with  modern data systems that utilize MS DOS exclusively. The language  impasse prevents linkage with an IR interface and prevents  communication with colleagues. Equally, the computer language obstacle  prohibits use of the new, expanded fragmentation libraries now  available.         The inability to discriminate among isomers by analysis of their  fragmentation patterns is very frustrating and requires time consuming  analysis `y alternative techniques. The addition of an IR interface to  the existing instrument will go a long way toward resolving isomeric  components without additional investigative procedures. In addition to  its inability to distinguish between geometric isomers of natural  products such as eugenol and isoeugenol MS alone cannot differentiate  between cis and trans isomers of terpenoids and related structures. On  the other hand infrared spectroscopy provides very useful information  for discrimination among isomeric composites. Currently, the  identification of isomeric compounds through comparison of their GC  retention times on a variety of phases with those of authentic  standards is necessary. Gas phase infrared is often able to  differentiate between isomers of related compounds and combined with  mass spectroscopy will greatly facilitate identification of new natural  products for which standards are unknown. Selected infrared wavelength  detection, available on the proposed instrumentation, will also allow  selective monitoring and searching for compounds of desirable classes,  such as the phthalides, in plant extracts",
