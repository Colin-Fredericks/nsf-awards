 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500132  Gutowski   This research builds on prior work done on double diaphragm forming process of polymer matrix composite.  That research had led to the understanding of stress build up in a simple, small scale part.  Scaling up to complex, large (e.g.: airplane wings) is the subject of this research.  A major barrier is the onset of laminate wrinkling in very large parts made of aligned fiber polymer matrix composite.  In order to understand the source of through thickness stress distributions, actual through thickness deformation patterns will be followed through medical imaging techniques.  In a separate industry funded research, attempts will be made to measure in-situ laminate stresses which when combined with the basic understanding from this research may lead to a closed loop control over the deformation sequence to avoid laminate wrinkling.       Effective strategies for automating advanced composites manufacture are needed by aerospace companies who are eager to take advantage of the enormous design freedom afforded by composites in primary structures.  But, the cost of doing so is a major barrier.  Effective forming techniques can reduce cycle times dramatically, and are capable of producing a wide range of part geometries.  Because of the range of part shapes that are either being produced or are under consideration for aerospace application, a flexible process is required.  This work is aimed at developing innovative techniques of making defect free parts at a fraction of current cost.  This research has the potential to be extended into medical technology as well.  ***",
