 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hua Guo at the University of Toledo is supported by the NSF Theoretical  and Computational Chemistry Program for theoretical investigations of  chemical reaction dynamics. The concern of this work is the study of  photodissociation; in particular, time dependent quantum mechanics will  be used to study the photodissociation dynamics of small molecules. These  processes will be studied in the gas phase, on surfaces, and in solution.  In order to treat problems in the later two cases, a new theoretical  procedure will be developed which is a hybrid approach combining quantum  and classical methods. With this hybrid approach, the quantum features of  the molecular reaction are properly addressed but the effects of the  medium, substrate or solvent, are included. For the gas phase studies, a  few modest size polyatomic molecules will be treated; these include  rare  gas complexes and Ryderg excited states of methyl complexes.  The dynamics of photo-induced chemistry, in general, and of  photodissociation, in particular, depend on the details of the  interaction energies among the atoms in the system; i.e., on the details  of the potential energy surfaces. However, it is not simple to relate the  features of this surface to the identity of the  reaction products and to  the energy distribution over these products. The studies of  photodissociation being carried out in this project will enhance the  understanding of the relevant relationships. In particular, two aspects  of the work help to insure that it will have considerable impact on this  important scientific goal. First, the work is being carried out is close  contact and, often, in collaboration with experimentalists. Because of  this, the approximations used to obtain the underlying potential energy  sufaces as well as those used to study the time dependent quantum  features of the reaction can be validated. Second, the systems being  studied are carefully chosen to yield important and useful information.  They are sufficiently small to be tractable for high accuracy quantum  mechanical treatments yet sufficiently large to contain chemical bonds  and other features relevant to more general problems in photochemistry.",
