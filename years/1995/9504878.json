 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504878  Tugnait    The goal of the proposed research is to provide estimated system  models together with evaluated (quantified) modeling errors given  experimental input-output data for a wide variety of systems  (electrical, chemical, power, manufacturing and production,  robotic, electronic etc.) operating in open or closed loop.  Such  information (system model and quantified modeling error)  is  crucial to synthesis of a robust controller which maintains its  design objectives under uncertain modeling.  As such, successful  completion of the proposed research is expected to significantly  impact the state-of-the-art in robust control design.  Approaches  are being considered to transform the given time-domain  experimental input-output data into a frequency-domain transform  function model description along with the associated noise error  characterization.  Both second-order spectrum and cross-spectrum  of the data record as well as higher-order integrated  polyspectrum of the data record is being exploited for such  purposes.  This allows for far fewer a priori assumptions; rather  such modeling is dictated by the acquired data.  The case of  noisy input measurements is also being considered.  A stochastic  embedding approach is being followed for quantifying modeling  errors.  ***",
