 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allen    With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Melinda Allen and  Heidi Lennstrom will expand the archaeobotanical research  laboratory located at the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Hawaii.  They will hire a technician to help to prepare and process  samples and will purchase both a new flotation device and  photographic equipment. Because botanical materials are usually  lighter than their surrounding earthen matrix, it is possible to  use water separation to collect them. A larger device will  increase the productivity of the laboratory. Photographs permit  the production of guides or keys which can facilitate  identification at the Bishop and also be used by other  laboratories.    Botanical remains are often preserved in archaeological sites in  Oceania. Few archaeologists are qualified to identify such  materials however and the development of a specialized laboratory  will further research in a number of areas. Botanical remains  serve two principal goals because they provide insight into both  the nature of prehistoric environments and human use of it.  Archaeological deposits often include both plants used by  prehistoric inhabitants and other remains which are accidently  incorporated into the sediments. With such information, it is  possible to reconstruct how different human populations subsisted  and made use of their environments. It is also possible to  understand how people affected these environments and how they  changed over time. Many islands in the Pacific have been occupied  for thousands of years and provide excellent laboratories to  study human-environment interactions.    This research is important because it will help to provide an  important archaeological service. It will increase our  understanding of human behavior and how people and environments  interact over time.",
