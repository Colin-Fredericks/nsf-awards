 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX)  microanalytical system is added to the Biology Department's  existing scanning electron microscope (SEM) system.   This  enables students performing undergraduate research at all levels  of the curriculum in Chemistry and Physics to become much more  involved in the growth and characterization of materials using  techniques often developed for the rapidly emerging field of  Material Science.   Because of the relative ease of use of new  SEM and SEM/EDX systems, our students can perform spatially  resolved elemental analysis on films and bulk materials they  prepare as part of our extensive laboratory research programs.    Students correlate these measurements with the wide variety of  other types of electronic and optical measurement already being  made.   High- resolution SEM and SEM/EDX maps are made available  to students photographically as well as remotely over the campus  ethernet.   This project promotes interdisciplinary scientific  research by undergraduates and helps augment an expensive  instrument (SEM) so that its acquisition and maintenance costs  can be amortized responsibly over a broader base of users.",
