 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to upgrade facilities for analysis of  biological macromolecules, using X-ray diffraction, at the University  of Texas. The equipment will be used in the research of two established  investigators and two newly appointed assistant professors. It falls  into three categories, A. X-ray diffraction, B. high speed computing,  and C. molecular graphics.    A. The diffraction equipment consists of a high brilliance rotating  anode X-ray generator and a state of the art imaging plate (IP) area  detector. The detector captures X-rays as metastable centers on a  BaFBr:EuX-phosphor, which is read by subsequent laser activation. This  type of detector has the spatial resolution to accommodate both single  crystal protein diffraction and the low angle scattering patterns  generated by the users of the equipment.    B. A high speed, dual processor, computer with 4 Gbytes of disk  capacity will be used largely for molecular model refinement. This  machine will allow timely turnover of simulated annealing refinements  using the program XPLOR. It will also be used for sophisticated  analysis of low angle scattering patterns.    C. A modern molecular graphics station will be acquired. This  instrument will augment a heavily used molecular graphics capacity and  may be required to replace a failing instrument currently in use.    The research interests of the user group are quite varied, involving a  number of biologically important systems under study by a range of  methodologies. Proteins under study by single crystal analysis include:  ribosome inhibiting proteins like ricin, PAP and ebulin; plant and  fungal chitinases; the antifungal protein zeamatin; at least four  structurally different amino acid decarboxylases including ornithine,  arginine and histidine decarboxylases; several invertebrate  hemoglobins; multienzyme complexes, like PDC; and the ribosomal RNA  binding protein L9. In addition to single crystal studies, the  equipment will be used in the low angle scattering ana lysis of  polymerizable lipid assemblies. Systematic studies are underway to  define the rules governing subassembly in the planes of lipid bilayers.    The above projects tend to extend well beyond simply describing the  initial X-ray structure. Each protein is refined in a crystallographic  sense to the limits of it data in order to produce as accupate a  molecular model as possible. Also, the binding of substrate analogs or  other ligands is assessed where appropriate. Several of the research  groups have vigorous site-directed mutagenesis programs which create a  family of proteins whose X-ray analysis is important to describing  their structure/function relationships. Finally, structure-based drug  design is being developed. The design paradigm requires analysis and  energy refinement of numerous intermediate structures.    The equipment requested is of great importance to the continuation of  established programs and to the expansion of new ones. The X-ray  generator and IP detector, together with a cold temperature apparatus,  are important for data collection on the many systems under study. Some  of these crystal systems have large unit cells and require lengthy time  periods or several crystals for complete data collection. Some projects  involve a large number of mutant, inhibited, or liganded structures,  and in all cases it is desirable to collect as high resolution data as  possible. All of these considerations argue for increased data  collecting capacity. Furthermore, research projects involving low angle  scattering work on bilayer structures cannot be carried out, for  technical reasons, without acquisition of the new equipment.  The requested computing upgrade will allow modern structural refinement  programs, such as XPLOR, to run expeditiously. It will also allow the  most modern and powerful data analysis programs for single crystal and  low angle scattering analysis to be executed with comparative ease. The  need for this system is intensified by the apparent demise of the   University managed supercomputer. With over a dozen students and other  scientists using the facilities, there is a strain on current molecular  graphics equipment. A new unit will allow proper analysis of the mass  of structural work being done particularly if one key instrument,  currently in place, fails.",
