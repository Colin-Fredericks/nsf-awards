 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511628  O'Halloran    Recent literature on positive political theory, addressing such  diverse topics as legislative organization, administrative  procedures, judicial review, and comparative political  institutions, consistently posits that the process by which  policy is made ultimately shapes political outcomes.  Known  generally as the \"new institutionalism,\" this line of research  asserts that what politicians do is intimately linked to how they  do it.  In the study of American government, one of the most  important procedural choices is whether substantive policy  decisions will be made by congress or delegated to an executive  branch agency.  This question goes to the very heart of policy  making in a separation of powers system, as the forces brought to  bear on legislators are quite distinct from those affecting  bureaucratic agencies.    The current research investigates Congress's choice of whether or  not to delegate substantive discretionary authority to the  executive branch.  It has been argued that Congress delegates  authority merely to shift the blame for unpopular policy  decisions or to protect favored constituents.  The researchers  suggest instead that congressional delegation to the executive  branch can be seen as a politically expedient response to the  inefficiencies of congressional policy making.  Thus, this  analysis links the details of legislative organization to  congressional-executive relations and the decision to delegate.    The project contains three central components. 1)Building on new  advances in the theory of the firm, the researchers model  Congress's decision to produce policy \"in-house\" or subcontract  policy making to the bureaucracy.  From this model, they derive  several propositions about the impact of divided government,  committee outliers, and organized interests on Congress's  decision to delegate, and on the amount of discretion granted to  executive agencies.  2)  The investigators empirically test the  model of delegation with data drawn  from important legislation  enacted over the past half century.  This data set allows the  researchers to track changes in delegation both across issue  areas and over time.  Using the econometric specifications  suggested by the theoretical framework they test a series of  hypotheses relating political conditions to delegation and agency  discretion.  3)In addition to legislative histories, the  researchers conduct detailed case studies of two policy areas,  international trade and environmental regulation.  These case  studies investigate whether the institutions of delegation are  fixed and unchanging, or malleable, responding predictably to  changes in the political environment.  ***",
