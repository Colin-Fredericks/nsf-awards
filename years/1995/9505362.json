 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns about the effects of human interference in the oceanic  environment upon the life and habits of marine mammals have been  recently raised.  In response, researchers have taken interest in  processing all relevant information to better understand this  interference with the hope and goal of protecting marine life.  In  this context, the development of signal processing methods for the  exploration of sounds generated by marine mammals in the ocean is  being pursued.  Success of this research will enable the tracking  of mammals, and the reconstruction of the signals they produce,  through remote acoustic sensing.    Localizing marine mammals in the ocean and identifying the sounds  they generate requires the establishment of a link between physics  (acoustics) and signal processing.  The normal modes approach is  being adopted for modeling the acoustic signal propagation in the  oceanic environment  Models will then be sought that capture the  time and frequency structure of biological signals.  The  combination of acoustics and signal analysis is expected to  facilitate inversion of the acoustic field measured at an array in  the ocean for the estimation of the location of sound-transmitting  marine mammals and the actual form of the signals they transmit.",
