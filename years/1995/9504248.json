 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research project is to increase the benefits  and  to reduce the costs of automated reasoning across a wide variety  of  applications. The project both supports and derives motivation  from the ongoing  development of the Larch Prover (LP), an  interactive proof assistant for  multisorted first order logic.  Experience with previous versions of LP suggests  four important  ways to improve the cost/benefit ratio: reducing the amount of  detail required in proofs, supporting modular descriptions of  theories and  proofs, closing the gap between the logical and  operational meaning of  theories, and integrating LP into  applications.    To reduce the amount of  detail required in proofs, the project  seeks to combine different reasoning  techniques in seamless and  efficient ways. Early versions of LP emphasized  equational term-rewriting. A recent version reduced the length of many proofs  by  using cooperating decision procedures for the theory of equality  and for  linear arithmetic. The project is exploring fruitful  interactions between  equational term-rewriting and decision  procedures. The project is addressing  both logical and  operational issues for using independently developed logical  modules in larger proofs and for ensuring that proof scripts are  replayable  after changes to formalizations.    For almost all applications of automated  reasoning, there is an  unavoidable gap between logical content (e.g., the  consequences  of a specification) and operational content (e.g., the proof  techniques and/or sequence of lemmas required to prove a  particular  consequence). The project is studying how to narrow  this gap, where possible,  and how to provide useful information  about the nature of the gap, particularly  when proofs fail.    Finally, the project is seeking to improve the cost/benefit  ratio  for formal reasoning by integrating LP into applications. The  goals of  tighter integration are to enable users to think in  application-specific terms,  to make LP work  better in the context  of particular applications, and to  understand the interface  reasoning tools should present to applications. The  project is  seeking to achieve tighter integration by eliminating the need  for  transcribing designs and by developing application specific  improvements in  LP's expressive and deductive power (e.g., for  reasoning about probability).",
