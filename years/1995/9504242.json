 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric tools are developed that will provide   key  developments in computational statistical theory and   methodology. The research direction  is to develop and study   probability bounds for the probability content of convex   polyhedra with special structure via the \"abstract tube   method.\" Accounting for this geometric structure can lead, in   some cases, to explicit and easy to calculate bounds for error   probabilities, and in other cases to greater efficiency in the   Monte-Carlo evaluation of error probabilities. This research   which is at the interface between computational statistics and   computational geometry, will produce an expanded collection   of tools for constructing practical and sharp probability   bounds for a vast   array of applications. Particular focus is   given to obtaining new   bounds for the probability content of   bodies in higher dimensions using methods that arise from   the study of lower dimensional problems with similar   structure.           There is an abundance of real world applications in which   stochastic models are utilized to make critical decisions based   on probability calculations. For example,   probability   calculations are used to determine how likely a modeled   system is to fail.  This applies to systems such as a bridge, an   ecosystem, a human body, or a manufacturing method.  The   research explores ways in which special model structure for   situations such as these can be exploited to produce more   efficient and precise probability calculations.  This new   methodology should be directly applicable to manufacturing     and quality control, structural and system reliability,     environmental regulation, and a host of other areas.",
