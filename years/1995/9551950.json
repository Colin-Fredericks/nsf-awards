In many  undergraduate labs the equipment used to collect data acts as a  barrier to student learning and participation. Often laboratory  protocols force students to focus on the technical aspects of data  collection while de-emphasizes the underlying scientific principles  being presented. To be intellectually involved student must  participate in investigations, that is, they must be involved in  the design of experiments and the interpretation of results.    The equipment requested in this proposal will make it possible to  enhance student learning in biology teaching labs by replacing  current analog devices, such as oscilloscopes and chart recorders  with computer-based tools for data acquisition. The development of  customized user interfaces and curricular materials designed to  take advantage of the computer-based equipment will: emphasize the  use of critical thinking skills by giving students the tools to  quickly analyze their data; break down obstacles to learning by  allowing students to focus important scientific concepts rather  than instrumentation per se; and bridge the gap between teaching  lab experiences and independent research opportunities by  encouraging investigative lab activities.    Materials necessary to  equip two lab rooms (serving 48-60 students)  with systems for electronic data acquisition and analysis will be  purchased. The equipment will be general enough to be used in a  wide variety of courses serving both biology majors and non-majors.",
