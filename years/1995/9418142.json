 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418142  Appleton      This award will support the travel and communications expenses,  over a two year period, to enable Dr. Philip Appleton and   Mark Bransford, a doctoral student working with Dr. Appleton,  of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State  University, to conduct research with Dr. Raymond Norris, Acting  Director of the Australia Telescope National Facility, and  Charlene Heisler of the Anglo-Australian Observatory.  The  cooperative research will focus on the study of radio emission  and star formation distribution in a sample of Seyfert galaxies.    This collaborative project involves astronomical observations  and numerical modeling utilizing a sample of galaxies containing  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN's) which are observed from the  southern hemisphere.  The observational side of the project  requires the use of the unique Australia Telescope National  Facility (ATNF) aperture-synthesis radio telescope, which became  operational three years ago, and the Anglo-Australian Telescope   (AAT).  The ATNF is the only radio telescope in the southern  hemisphere capable of providing the detailed images of galaxies  required.  The special instrumentation available for infrared  imaging at the AAT is also unique in the southern hemisphere.  In order to gain an understanding of the possible causal  pelationship between starburst and AGN activity, high dynamic  range radio maps, at three frequencies, will be obtained at ATNF.  Near infrared observations at AAT will concentrate on the  distribution and strengths of key spectra lines which will be  used to distinguish between narrow-line emission and those  associated with the AGN spectra characteristic of star formation  regions.  These star formation regions will then be compared in  detail with the radio and optical morphologies of the galaxies to  search for causal connections which might link star formation  with non-thermal AGN processes. The Australian collaborators are  requesting support from the Department of Indus try, Science and  Technology (DIST) to fund their travel to Iowa State University   to make use of the special numerical modeling program being   conducted on galaxies in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.",
