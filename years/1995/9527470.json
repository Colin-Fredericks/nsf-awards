Travel expenses were provided for four outstanding young investigator,  invited symposium speakers,  whose work has led to major recent advances in the field of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  Funds were also used to provide partial support for young investigators with excellent research programs and whose students made presentations, or who otherwise had need for financial support. The topic of this meeting was both timely and important in understanding the extent of biodiversity which exists. It is well known that bacteria alone function to continually introduce molecular nitrogen into the biosphere, a process upon which all eucaryotic life owes its existence.  In this plan, plant symbiotic nitrogen-fixation occurs via two recognized systems, the rhizobium/bradyrhizobium nodulation mechanism and the  frankia /plant association.  Based on present know ledge, the latter plant association occurs predominantly in association with fast-growing trees (both temperate and tropical region) and tropical grasses.  Unfortunately,  this route for nitrogen fixation has received limited attention, although it is perhaps the most important  entry  port for molecular nitrogen into the biosphere in environmental bioreclamation projects, particularly in tropical regions.   As a result of this and because of the importance of learning more about how this activity operates, the conference proceedings will be published as a volume of Physiologia Plantarum.  A significant number of highly productive young investigators attended the conference, which provided an important forum to share information and to establish research and communication networks for the future. This Award was jointly supported by the Metabolic Biochemistry and the Microbial Genetics Programs, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. ***                         ;                                            Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   /                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Berry, Alison M                     Shelley A.
