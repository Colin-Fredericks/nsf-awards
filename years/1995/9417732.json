The long term goal of our research  is to understand how extracellular signals interact with the  plant cellular machinery to influence growth and  development.  Recent evidence strongly suggests that plant  cells have plasma membrane receptors with intrinsic protein  kinase activity.  The plant receptor-like protein kinases  (RLK) are structurally related to the animal polypeptide  growth factor receptors; however, the plant RLKs all appear  to be serine/threonine protein kinases.  Diversity among  plant RLKs, reflected in their structural and functional  properties, has opened up a broad new area of investigation  into cellular signaling in plants with far-reaching  implications for the mechnaisms by which plant cells  perceive and respond to extracellular stimuli.  Our specific  aims are to characterize the biochemical properties, both in  vitro and in vivo, of one receptor-like protein kinase  (RLK5) from Arabidopsis thaliana.  We have shown that a  recombinant fusion protein of this transmembrane protein  kinase will autophosphorylate several sites and that  autophosphorylation is critical for interaction with  cellular targets.  One of these targets, KAPP (kinase  associated protein phosphatase) contains three domains: an  amino-terminal membrane insertion signal, a kinase  interaction domain and phosphoprotein phosphatase domain,  Interaction of KAPP with RLK5 requires RLK5 phosphorylation.  This mechanism of binding is reminiscent of the interaction  of src homology 2 containing proteins with activated growth  factor receptors in animals.  The research proposed here  will define the autophosphorylation sites in RLK5 and  investigate the functional significance of KAPP binding to  RLK5.  Additional components for RLK5 mediated intracellular  signaling will also be identified.  It is anticipated that  results from these studies will yield fundamental and new  insights into the molecular mech anisms of how plants  perceive their environment and how growth and developmental  processes are regulated by environmental signals.  %%%  Differentiation in plants is profoundly affected by  environmental factors.
