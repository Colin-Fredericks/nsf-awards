 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eric R. Bittner has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Bittner received his doctoral degree from   the University of Chicago under the supervision of Professor John Light.    Dr. Bittner will continue research at the Universityof Texas at Austin   under the sponsorship of Professor Peter Rossky.  His postdoctoral   research will target quantum simulations in liquids.  He will develop a   dynamical description of transient quantum phase coherences between a   solvated system and its surrounding bath.  Specifically, he will examine   the relaxation of an excited electron in water where relaxation of the   electron occurs as a series of non-adiabatic transitions from one   electronic state to another mediated by the breakdown of the   Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the nuclear motion of the solvent   molecules.  The work will contribute to the development of a theory of   coherent control of dynamics in a realistic chemical condensed phase.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
