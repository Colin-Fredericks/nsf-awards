 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university has made a strong commitment to improving its  undergraduate program in chemistry by increasing the coverage of  molecular structure analysis in the lecture and laboratory  components of the curriculum.   The specific aim of this project   is to fund the acquisition of a multinuclear 200-MHz NMR  spectrometer that has indirect detection and variable temperature  capabilities.   The new spectrometer can dramatically improve  student access to a FT-NMR spectrometer for laboratory projects.    It allows us to develop pertinent and original experiments to  reinforce the chemical concepts being taught in the lectures.    Implementation of this proposal directly affects six courses  offered in the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum.   In addition,  five faculty members have a demonstrated need for this instrument  in their own undergraduate research programs, which involve  numerous students throughout the summer and during the academic  year.   This addition is having an immediate and meaningful  impact on the undergraduate education that is provided and can  ultimately lead to substantial improvements in the laboratory  curriculum.",
