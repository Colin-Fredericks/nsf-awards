The mollusc Aplysia, and a number  of other invertebrate animals, have proven extremely useful  in studies of basic cellular neurobiology. In large part  this is because of the extraordinarily large size of the  cells of its nervous system and the ability to recognize  these cells as unique individuals. This has allowed the  investigation of individual cells, their patterns of  interconnections, modulation of synaptic strength, behavior,  learning and development. The 1995 meeting will provide a  format for discussing new methods and findings that have  emerged in the cell and molecular biology of Aplysia and  other model invertebrate systems. These findings will be  considered in eight different session, each concerned with a  different level of analysis: ion channels, neurotransmitter,  synaptic transmission, cell imaging, circadian rhythm,  circuity and behavimr, learning and development. About 150  participants from 60 laboratories throughout the world are  expected to attend.",
