 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hunter    9552491    In this project \"Vanguard for Learning: A Plan for an NSF/DoDDS Testbed,\" BBN will lead a consortium to conduct Phase I of an anticipated two phase project. Phase I is a planning grant in which BBN will identify and review K-12 educational research products which can be aligned with National Standards and goals identified in the DoDEA Strategic Plan, assess DoDEA educational challenges and instructional culture, develop a prototype plan for integrating technology based or enabled resources across the entire DoDEA school system and develop a plan for experimentally testing that plan using two K-12 school complexes. The project is designed to address the use of technology to achieve pervasive integration across all grade levels and all subjects of two operational K-12 school complexes. It is expected that a rich  mix of technologies, pedagogies, educational resources, curricula and professional development methods will be concentrated in the testbed schools. This \"research on practice\" project is designed to gain insight into how to conduct pervasive change, identify alternative technologies and cost/benefit trade-offs for causing student centered paradigm shifts,  solve technical issues arising from incompatible communications systems and heterogeneous network environments, and identify overlooked research issues associated with technology enabled systemic change in K-12 education. Phase II of the project will consist of a two year experimental test of  a modified version of the plans generated during Phase I.",
