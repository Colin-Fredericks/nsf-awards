 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500986  Tanveer  The investigator proposes to investigate the dynamics of complex  singularities and their physical implications in a class of problems   n fluid mechanics that include the 3-D Euler and Navier-Stokes  equations in addition to interfacial flows (Kelvin-Helmholtz,  Rayleigh-Taylor) and flow through porous medium. The main goal is  to predict increasingly complicated features of a time evolving flow,  as some regularizing parameter such as viscosity or surface tension  is made progressively small. To reach this goal, he proposes to employ  a combination of analytical and numerical methods to understand how,  when and where complex singularities approach the real physical domain  that leads to selective amplification of small scales.  %%%  Sensitivity of a phenonemon to small changes in our initial state is  a well known feature of many nonlinear problems in the physical world.  In many cases, one likes to quantify this sensitivity in terms of its  relation to some physical parameter, which in their problems can be either  surface tension, viscosity or other such effects. A detailed understanding  of this dependence may help in extract valuable aggregate features of  of a highly complicated flow such as turbulence. The principal investigator  proposes to use some relatively new techniques that have proved useful in  other problems.  ***",
