They  will  study  bonding of impurities in semiconductors, low abundance elements  in  biological  materials,  and of molecules  and  surface  layers  on  surfaces.  The  research will lead to a deeper and  more  quantitative  understanding  of soft-x-ray fluorescence in various  materials.  This  will  lead  to  a unique instrumentation which will be used  to  study  surfaces,   catalysis,   interfaces  and   magnetic   dichroism.   The  instruments   will  provide  unique  capabilities  for  students   and  scientists from national, industrial and university laboratories.  %%%    The Principal investigators will utilize the extended energy range  at  the  Center for Advanced Microstructure Devices and the Advanced Light  Sources  at  Lawrence  Berkeley Laboratory  to  study  technologically  important  materials such as high temperature superconductors,  multi-  layer  magnetic materials, and high temperature materials.
