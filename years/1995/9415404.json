 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415404  Stavola  Hydrogen  is  a common and highly reactive impurity in  semiconductors. It has been known for more than a decade  that hydrogen forms complexes with  deep  level impurities  and modifies their electrical properties, but   these  hydrogen  containing  complexes  have  remained   poorly  understood  because  it  has  not been possible  to  obtain  structure sensitive  data.  Previously  the  PI  discovered  that  complexes  of hydrogen  with  transition metal  impurities in silicon  can  be  formed  in sufficient  number. This research will take advantage of this  finding  to  use  structure  sensitive  methods like  infrared  absorption  and electron   paramagnetic  resonance  spectroscopies.  The   microscopic structures  and  electrical properties of several  hydrogenated  deeplevel  defects will be investigated using these techniques. The  primary goal of this work is to develop a fundamental  understanding of several model  systems  that  will  provide  a  foundation  for  understanding complexes with deep-level  defects in semiconductors.  %%%  Hydrogen  is frequently introduced into semiconductor  materials  where it  modifies the electrical properties of  defects an impurities.  This is particularly true, for  example, in the polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductors  used in solar cell or flat panel display  technologies where  the  presence  of  hydrogen is necessary  to  improve  material characteristics. It has not been understood at a  fundamental level how hydrogen  affects defect properties  because, previously, it  had  been difficult  to  determine  the microscopic structures  of  the  hydrogen defects. In  this work, structure-sensitive measurements will  be  made  to elucidate the properties of several hydrogen containing  defects in Si  that  can  be used as models to help  understand how  semiconductor defects interact with  hydrogen.  ***",
