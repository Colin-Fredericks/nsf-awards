The  studies involve both the early stages of growth, including  nucleation of islands and defects in the submonolayer  regime, as well as a study of the evolution and morphology  of the surface at long times and long length scales in  various materials growth processes, such as molecular-beam-  epitaxy and ion-beam sputtering and ion-beam sputter  deposition.  Considerable effort is being made to continue  to identify and better understand far-from-equilibrium  processes in the presence of different types of growth  instabilities.  The concepts and the modeling techniques  developed in this project provide us with a deeper  fundamental understanding of a wide variety of materials  growth processes that are of great technological importance.  %%%  This research program develops and applies new theoretical  and simulational modeling techniques to problems in the  growth, deposition, and sputtering of materials.  The  studies involve both the early stages of growth, including  nucleation of islands and defects in the regime where the  atoms are a single layer thick, as well as a study of the  evolution and morphology of the surface at long times and  long length scales in various materials growth processes.  Considerable effort is being made to continue to identify  and better understand far-from-equilibrium processes in the  presence of different types of growth instabilities.
