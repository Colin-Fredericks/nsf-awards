 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455613  Maloney  This project will develop a one semester physical science course  for non-science, especially elementary education, majors. This  course represents an important element in IUPF's teacher  preparation sequence.  The course will be activity based with  investigations and exercises designed to elicit students'  common-sense ideas about the systems and situations, challenge  those ideas where they disagree with the scientifically accepted  ideas, and help the students construct a new understanding of the  concepts, relationships and principles that apply. A limited set of  investigative and reasoning processes, e.g., making observations  and inferences, proportional reasoning, and drawing, reading and  interpreting graphs, will be emphasized and used throughout the  course. In order to get the students to engage in the appropriate  reasoning, and to give them sufficient time to undergo conceptual  change and construct a scientifically acceptable understanding,  only selected concepts, principles, relationships, and topics will  be explored. Several concepts and principles, e.g., area, volume,  density, and conservation of mass, will be examined because of  their importance in both chemistry and physics. In addition two  fundamental topics, motion in a straight line and the basics of  compound formation, will be studied to illustrate some of the  contrasts between the two disciplines. The course materials will  emphasize pattern finding and analysis and will be designed so that  the students have to use qualitative means to work the tasks  encountered.",
