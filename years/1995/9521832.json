 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Professors F. Barry Dunning and Ken A. Smith of the Chemistry   Department of William Marsh Rice University will engage in a continuing   series of investigations of electron-molecule and ion-molecule reactions.    In the present work the emphasis is on reactions in which atoms in high   Rydberg states participate.  Specific problems addressed are the   lifetimes of collision intermediates and their stabilization through   energy transfer via interactions with a third collision partner.  In   addition, Rydberg atoms will be used to study energy transfer in ion-ion   collisions, and  create dipole bound negative ions  and investigate their    properties.  Rydberg atoms (or molecules) are systems in which an electron is in a   sufficiently large orbit so that the whole system resembles that of an   excited hydrogen atom.  With increasing excitation the electron goes into   increasingly larger orbits until it becomes free of the rest of the atom   which thereby becomes an ion.   Chemical reactions in which ions   participate play a major role and a full understanding of the reaction   kinetics and dynamics requires, among others, a  detailed knowledge of   the ion-ion, ion-molecule, and electron- molecule collision processes.    The research conducted here is directed toward obtaining such knowledge.",
