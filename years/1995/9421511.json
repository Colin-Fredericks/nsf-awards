 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is little systematic information available regarding the relation of young children's facility with language and their ability to organize and remember events that they personally experience.  Previous research has indicated that children learn from parents how to talk about remembered events, and that the more `story-like` such talk is, the better remembered events are.  This project uses an entertaining game with preschool children to determine how language used to talk about the event before, during, or after the experience affects the child's memory for the experience, both in its general organization and specific aspects, such as the particular objects and actions that were involved.    The studies will address general theoretical issues of memory processing and specific issues of the development of memory in early childhood, the beginnings of autobiographical memory (or a self-history), and the role language plays in reinstating memory for an event.  In one set of studies, preschool children (3-5 years) are engaged in an interesting episode of a treasure hunt game.  Different groups of these children have either a verbal or nonverbal reinstatement session two weeks later, and memory for the original event is tested for all groups, including controls who had no reinstatement session, in a recall session 8 weeks later. Other studies will use a similar paradigm to test effects of narratives during the episode (present talk) and narratives prior to the episode (future talk).  These studies are designed to determine the relation between children's language competence, particularly their competence in extended discourse and narrative production, to the organization of and their memory for personally experienced events.  The outcome of this investigation will have important implications for such issues as the dependability of children's memory, for educational programs, and for resolving basic questions in memory development such as the beginnings of autobiographical memory and self history.",
