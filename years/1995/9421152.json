Analysis of   in  vitro excluded volume effects is performed to both understand  in vivo excluded volume   effects and enhance the  in  vitro  yield of several biochemical processes of practical interest.  In previous work by the PI and coworkers, the first quantitative analysis has been performed of the excluded volume of DNA-polymer interaction in mixtures that consist of both double-stranded DNA and electrically neutral polymers.   Both biomolecular joining and cyclization of DNA were studied.  These studies have revealed the reason for a dependence of excluded volume  on the molecular weight of the neutral polymers.  They have also revealed excluded volume-induced protection of  high  molecular weight DNA from hydrodynamic shear-induced breakage.  Incompletely explored areas include statistical analysis of the excluded volume induced changes  in the conformation of single DNA molecules.  Incompletely explored practical applications include use of excluded volume to either prevent the hydrodynamic shear-induced breakage of double-stranded DNA or increase the rate of  in  vitro  biochemical reactions.  The specific aims are the following: (1) By use of video light microscopy,  statistical analysis will be performed by the dimensions of single DNA molecules after excluded volume-induced condensation.       Results will be obtained for several concentrations and types of polymer.  Tests will be made of our current theoretical framework for understanding excluded volume effects.  (2) By use of both pulsed and  constant field quantitative gel electrophoresis, the extent will be determined to which manipulation of excluded volume can be used to both ligate long DNA and prevent the hydrodynamic shear-induced breakage of  long DNA.  The research proposed contributes to both fundamental understanding of   in vivo  biochemistry and  the practical use of  in vitro  biochemistry for the purposes of  biotechnology.  %%%  Addition of chemically nonreactive macromolecules (polyethylene glycol's are often used) to solutions of biological macromolecules (such as DNA) has dramatic effects on both the biochemical activity and the conformation of the biological macromolecules.  Some of these effects are caused by restriction of  the volume available  (excluded volume effects).  For double-stranded DNA, some excluded volume effects can be visualized by light microscopy of single DNA molecules; these effects include collapse of a random coil of DNA.  The goals of our research  are the following: (1) By use of light microscopy, statistical analysis will be performed of  the dimensions of single DNA molecules after excluded volume induced collapse.  (2) By  use of gel electrophoresis, the extent will be determines to which manipulation of  excluded volume can be used to both promote the joining of DNA molecules and prevent breakage of DNA that occurs when long DNAs are handled by pipeting.  Tests will be made of our current theoretical framework for understanding excluded volume effects.  The research proposed contributes to both fundamental understanding of  the  in vivo excluded volume effects of cellular macromolecules and the practical use of  in vitro  biochemistry for the purposes of biotechnology.  ***",
