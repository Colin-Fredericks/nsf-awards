 "awd_abstract_narration": "This meeting, Columbia University Theory Days, is a meeting which  has been held twice per year, once in the fall and once in the spring, for  the past twelve years.  This continuing conference attracts 150 -- 200   researchers, mostly from the Metropolitan New York City Area.  Each theory  day consists of four one-hour invited talks, with scheduled discussion session  after each talk.  There are two primary goals which have been accomplished   by the previous twenty-four theory days: (1) The opportunity for theoretical   computer scientists to meet and exchange ideas; (2) Permit those researchers   in allied  areas to learn of new theoretical results and to encourage   theoreticians to help solve problems in these applied areas.  The mailing  list contains more than 700 names of scientists, students and computer  professionals with an interest in theory.  The speakers of the first   twenty-four theory days included such theoreticians as A. Shamir, S. Micali,  M. O. Rabin, R. Karp, A. R. Meyers, J. D. Ullman, C. Papadimitriou, N. Lynch,  S. Goldwasser, S. R. Kosaraju and J. Feigenbaum.  The Department of Computer  Science at Columbia University covered the expense of the first five years,  and the department together with the National Science Foundation covered  the expense of the following seven years.  The National Science Foundation  is providing partial support for the next six Theory Days.",
