 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reflecting the improvement in parallel computer technology during  the past decade, parallel computing has emerged from the realm of  graduate study into the undergraduate curriculum at larger research  universities.  In 1991 the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Curriculum Task Force  recommended the incorporation of several knowledge units related to  parallel computing into the curriculum of all undergraduate  computer science programs.  Unfortunately, at many small colleges  and universities, computer science faculty members possess little  experience in parallel computing.    To assist these computer science faculty in learning about parallel  computing, this project develops and implements two five-day  parallel computing workshops.  The workshops accommodates one-  hundred participants from small academic institutions lacking  faculty knowledgeable in the area of parallel computing.  The  workshop's main objectives are to:           provide participants with sufficient knowledge and hands-on  parallel programming experience so they can incorporate parallel  computing into their curriculum;           provide participants with educational materials to facilitate  incorporation of parallel computing into their curriculum; and           establish electronic mail capability between all participants  and the project directory for exchange of ideas, technical support,  and results relating to parallel computing.    After participants incorporate parallel computing into their  institution's curricula, these institution's undergraduate computer  science students will be better prepared for their professional  field.  Additionally, educational materials developed for the  workshops will be published, and made available electronically by  anonymous ftp.  This will assist other academic institutions  interested in incorporating parallel computing into their  curricula, or hosting similar workshops.",
