 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fahrbach  IBN-9500726    Steroid and thyroid hormones are integral modulators of neural communication and development.  These simple molecules, acting as hormones, have the potential to influence all neural function from the initiation of neural development to the activity of individual synapses in adults.  Recent advances in knowledge documenting non-genomic actions of the steroid hormones, the existence of receptor isoforms for the thyroid hormones, the involvement of non-neuronal cells in reproductive function, and the production of steroid hormones by the brain itself have had striking effects on neuroendocrine physiology, neural cell biology, reproductive behavior and non-reproductive behaviors such as learning and memory, aggression, feeding and emotion.  This action will provide support for a Young Investigator Symposium to be held at the 1995 Workshop on Steroid Hormones and Brain Function in Breckenridge, CO on March 31-April 4, 1995.  This workshop brings together scientists using different approaches to address important and timely issues concerning growth factor, steroid and thyroid hormone involvement in brain function.  Molecular biologists, neuroanatomists, neurophysiologists and behaviorists will examine such issues as sexual differentiation of the brain, steroid hormone interactions with other growth factors and neurons, thyroid hormone mechanisms of action and the role of non-neuronal cells in brain function.  These are fundamentally important questions in a field that is rapidly changing and advancing.  The inclusion of the Young Investigator Symposium will provide a mechanism to foster young scientists and facilitate collaborative efforts that may significantly enhance our understanding of basic neurobiological mechanisms.",
