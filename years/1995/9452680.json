PROMYS serves 45 first year students and 15  returning students.  Students are advised by 18 mathematically  experienced college-aged counselors and 10 faculty members.    The heart of the program is the experience gained by students  through their individual and collective efforts to solve an  assortment of challenging problems in Number Theory.  In 1995,  students will also study Abstract Algebra, Geometric Topology,  and Combinatorics.  Diverse weekly guest lecturers introduce  participants to related scientific fields, philosophical and  ethical questions and career options in mathematics and science.    Follow-up activities include an Open-Door Problem Set, Suggested  Reading List, student presentations in their own schools, and the  PROMYS newsletter.  ***",
