 "awd_abstract_narration": "With machine vision proliferating in the U.S.  as an affordable  tool for automation and quality assurance, it is becoming  increasingly important that engineering technology colleges  produce technicians and technologists capable of designing and  integrating machine vision applications.  Unfortunately, the  machine vision application process is not taught at any  engineering or engineering technology program in the country,  since most programs that include machine vision prefer to  concentrate on vision theory and processing algorithm  development.  This project addresses this critical need through  the acquisition and integration of industrial quality machine  vision equipment for an Automated Manufacturing Systems (AMS)  laboratory and through the development od laboratory exercises  aimed at teaching the process of applying machine vision and  lighting technologies for real industrial projects.   Acquiring  the needed equipment - including an Application Lighting  Investigation System (ALIS) - through this project corrects this  problem and creates a truly unique teaching laboratory that  fulfills industry's need for automation technicians and  technologists.  The potential impact of this project is as  widespread as is industrial automation.   In the university  immediate area, there are at least five companies that are using  or are considering using machine vision, and nationwide there are  certainly hundreds.",
