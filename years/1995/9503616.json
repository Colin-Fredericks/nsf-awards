 "awd_abstract_narration": "Libgober  9503616     The proposed research lies in the interface of complex differential geometry and algebraic geometry. The investigator poses a number of problems on the phenomenon of mirror symmetry. This includes a study of the hypergeometric differential equations that are satisfied by the periods of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The mirror symmetry conjecture, first observed by physicists, asserts that each Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a 'mirror' (also a Calabi-Yau 3-fold) and that certain structures of a Calabi-Yau manifold are tightly related to seemingly very different structures of its mirror manifold.    The phenomenon of mirror symmetry relates qualitatively different structures arising in theoretical physics, geometry and algebra. The rough idea is that there are structures in theoretical physics which are mirrored in structures in pure mathematics. This entire phenomenon, verified in special cases, remains an intriguing mathematical puzzle.",
