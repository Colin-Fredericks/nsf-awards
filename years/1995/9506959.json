These approaches have been extremely  valuable in elucidating the microanatomy and biochemical  function of cells and their organelles, but the spatial and  temporal dynamics of many cellular processes remain poorly  understood.  In large part, this is due to the spatial  averaging inherent in many biochemical approaches and the  loss of temporal resolution in ultrastructural studies  requiring chemical fixation.  Fluorescent probe and optical  microscope techniques developed over the past decade have  made it possible to study an increasing number of molecular  and biochemical processes in living cells.  These techniques  are now adopted to characterize the organization of a  ubiquitous metabolic pathway, glycolysis, in living cell.  The glycolytic enzymes aldolase, phophofructokinase (PFK),  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and triose  phosphate isomerase (TPI)  interact with each other and/or  structural proteins in vitro, and a variety of specific  reagents are now used to study their behavior, organization  and dynamics in vivo in living mammalian fibroblasts.  The  intracellular distribution and motility of each of these  enzymes is compared, and the interactions among these  enzymes in vitro and in vivo is characterized extensively.  The glycolytic enzyme enolase lacks specific interactions in  vitro and in vivo, and we will use enolase as a reference  molecule in our experiments.  Aldolase is concentrated in a  microdomain around F-actin stress fibers in fibroblasts, and  a fraction of the enzyme is bound in vivo.  This finding is  inconsistent with the textbook description of glycolysis  occurring as a series of fully solvated, diffusion limited  reactions in the cytoplasm, and consistent with a growing  number of models for organized glycolytic metabolism.   Recent work from several laboratories has led to the  identification of a putative domain for actin-interaction on  the aldolase molecule, based on biochemical and molecular  genetic studies of aldolase interactions in vitro.  Site-  directed mutants of rabbit muscle aldolase are used to study  the effect of specific mutations on aldolase dynamics in  vivo; mutants of aldolase catalytic activity and actin-  binding activity have been obtained and characterized.  There is also evidence that PFK and GAPDH bind to F-actin  and may interact with aldolase in vitro.  The distribution  and mobility of these enzymes in vivo is mapped using ratio  imaging. The study is part of and reflects the  interdisciplinary approach taken by the lab, with  substantial biochemical characterization of reagents prior  to their use in vivo; electron microscopy, falling ball  viscometry, fluorescence photobleaching, and fluorescence  energy transfer measurements to quantify enzyme/actin  interaction in vitro; and microinjection, fluorescence  imaging, fluorescence photobleaching, and fluorescence  energy transfer experiments in vivo.  Better understanding  of the organization of this important and ubiquitous  metabolic pathway allows better understanding of the  cytoplasm, and how biochemical reactions in cytoplasm are  organized and regulated.  %%%  After the discovery of the particle responsible in a large  way for cellular energy metabolism of the cell, the  mitochondrion, a search was undertaken for a particle  responsible for the other component of energy metabolism,  the breakdown of sugars, a process called glycolysis. No  membrane-bound compartment was identified for this process,  so the general conclusion was that the enzymes reponsible  for glycolysis function in a solvated state.  With that  assumption, much of the chemistry of glycolysis has been  done completely in vitro, after the cells have been  homogenized, extracted and the individual enzymes purified.  This project approaches the nature of glycolysi s  differently, because it now appears likely that this  conclusion is in part, wrong.  Work in progress indicates  that some of the glycolytic enzymes act, to some extent,  within a particulate microdomain where they can be  associated with each other and with the cytoskeleton.  This  work identifies the extent of association by studying the  movement and mutual proximity of labeled \"tags\" for the  enzymes or their associative partners by means of advanced  fluorescence microscopy and imaging approaches.  The  advantage of the imaging approaches is that the process can  be understood in vivo; the cell and its components will not  be disturbed. The behavior of the enzymes,  aldolase,  enolase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  dehydrogenase, and triosephosphate isomerase, and their  relationship to the cytoskeletal protein, F-actin, will be  studied in vivo.   Labeled fluorescent forms are  microinjected and their behavior studied through ratio  imaging, a process whereby the optical problems created by  the in vivo situation can be largely corrected.  The results  will have a large impact on the understanding of how the  cell organizes not only glycolysis, but other multi-  enzymatic pathways which are coordinately active in the  cell.  ***",
