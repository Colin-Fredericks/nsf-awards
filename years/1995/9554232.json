 "awd_abstract_narration": "Serim  95-54232    The Online Internet Institute (OII) will create a virtual infrastructure on the Internet to provide leading Internet using educators, proponents of systemic reform, and teachers desiring professional growth with hands-on experiences which will enable them to integrate the Internet within their classrooms, and support their peers in doing the same. The OTA report Technology and Teachers: Making the Connection states \"helping schools to make the connection between teachers and technology may be one of the most important steps to making the most of past, present, and future investments in educational technology and in our children's future.\" OII will add to the knowledge base required to make these connections.    During an eight week period this summer, 665 selected participants from school districts around the country will take part in a series of online activities and workshops designed to teach them how to identify and build successful models for using the Internet for systemic reform and curriculum development at the local level. Educators must experience what it is to learn through project-based, technology-enhanced approaches in their own learning, in order to effectively support this kind of learning for their students. Accordingly, each OII participant will in turn mentor at least five online participants in order to extend the process to the wider Internet education community, adding to the National Professional Development Library that will be created by the project.    At the same time, researchers working with the project will create an assessment piece that will support replicating this model. Software and technology developers and publishers will work with the project to develop virtual online components of value to educators with Internet access who are not workshop attendees.    Through these efforts, more than 3,000 teachers will return to their classrooms in the fall fully prepared to bring their students along into a rich environment of Internet resources. Man y tens of thousands of additional teachers will have access to electronic databases and models that provide a virtual instructional resource for networking in the service of curriculum development and systemic reform.",
