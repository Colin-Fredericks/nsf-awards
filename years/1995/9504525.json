In rank data, several   judges rank a set of objects from best to worse.  Research in the analysis and modeling of such data includes   evaluating distances between rank vectors by looking at the set of  distances as a convex cone;  extending unidimensional unfolding models to  several dimensions by using orthogonal ``contrasts\" of objects, each contrast  being a collection of groups of objects; and using quotient groups  of the group of permutations with respect to  particular subgroups to represent contrasts and/or patterns of ties  in rank data. Related to rank data is rank-based nonparametric  analysis of variance, wherein the the cells in  the design are the objects.   Main and interaction effects are defined nonparametrically  in multiway layouts, rank-based procedures for hypothesis testing of  these models are developed, and invariance and likelihood  principles are used to find universally efficient rank-based test procedures.  Finally, an approach to extending univariate rank procedures to multivariate  procedures, including multivariate analogs  of popular univariate statistics (Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney,  Kruskal-Wallis, Jonckheere-Terpstra, Kendall tau, Spearman rho, etc.)  and tests of symmetry hypotheses on covariance matrices, is detailed relying   on a particular definition of multivariate rank.  Iteration of the rank function may provide  an approach to defining multivariate   probability functions and inverse functions, with applications to generating random   vectors and multivariate QQ-plots.    The main focus of this research is to analyze and extend a number of popular   statistical procedures. Rank data, in which a number of judges ranks a  number of objects from best to worse, arise in many are as, including  political science, sociology, education, psychology, and consumer preferences.   Such  data typically show a high degree of complexity, often due to the presence  of distinct camps among the judges, natural groupings of the objects,  or a continuum of possible preferences of the judges (along, e.g., a  liberal/conservative continuum). New statistical models based on groupings of objects  are able to capture such complexities in many cases.  This research extends the  scope of these models by considering multiple groupings or continuums.  (There may be separate liberal/conservative continuums for social  issues and for economic issues.) Related research is applicable to  many fields, including agriculture, biology, economics, and environmental sciences  as well as the social sciences. Most statistical studies are directed towards  comparing individuals or treatments (e.g., fertilizers, drugs,  educational methods) based on one or more measurement, or finding   relationships between different measurements (e.g., diet and health).  The basic methods depend on fairly restrictive assumptions, assumptions  which often do not apply in real scientific situations. Consequently,  a great amount of work has been dedicated to developing procedures which  work well even when the assumptions are violated to a certain extent.   It is particularly important that the procedures not fail in  the presence of a few unusual values. When comparisons are based on only  one attribute, rank-based procedures are easily applied  and understood, and valid under reasonably mild conditions. These methods are  applied by taking the data (on, e.g., cholesterol level) and replacing  them with their ranks (i.e., the lowest level becomes ``1\",   the next ``2\", etc.) It is very common to wish to   make comparisons based on more than one attribute, e.g.,   cholesterol level and blood pressure. In such cases,  ranking individuals is more problematic since their order with respect to  cholesterol may not be the same as  that with respect to blood pressure.  A major component of this research uses a particular approach  to ranking individuals on several attributes simultaneously.   Procedures are developed based on these rankings that parallel those for   single attributes. These methods are easy to use and widely valid, being   especially resistant to unusual observations.",
