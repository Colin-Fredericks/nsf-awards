 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421888  Laughlin    A theoretical study will be made of the microscopic quantum mechanics of high  temperature superconductors using a strategy that emphasizes experimental  phenomenology over first principles computation.  The goals of the work are to  reconcile the enormous number of experimental facts in this field with one  another, to prioritize these facts, to distinguish genuinely new physical  behavior from that due to sample imperfection, and to motivate significant new  experiments.  This approach reflects the view that the important new physical  ideas in this field have already been articulated, and that the task is now to  distinguish among them in the laboratory.  Theory must be involved in this  process because the evidence of new physics is subtle and is often found in the  inconsistencies between one experiment and another.  Also, it has now become  evident that experimental confusion tends not to clear up by itself in this  field. Some specific computations for magnetic Hamiltonians are also proposed  as is some further investigation into the properties of superconducting states  that violate time-reversal symmmetry.  This is a natural extension of work on  anyon superconductivity performed on the previous grant.  %%%  A program of theoretical research on high temperature superconductivity will be  undertaken which emphasizes interpreting existing experimental results and  building on these to create new models and suggesting new experiments.  ***",
