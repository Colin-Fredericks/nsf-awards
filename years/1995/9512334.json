Total costs are jointly supported including $420,000  from the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program's  ARI allocation, $80,000 from the Division of Ocean Sciences  Marine Geology and Geophysics Program and $500,000 from the  Unitersity of Minnesota.  This group's research focuses on high  resolution studies of global and regional climate change as  recorded in the isotopic composition of marine and freshwater  carbonates including, coral skeletons, calcareous sediments,  speleothems and ostracod tests.  Specifically, the instruments  that will be purchased include a gas source stable isotope ratio  mass spectrometer (SIRMS) equipped with a Kiel device, a high  transmission efficiency thermal ionization mass spectrometer  (TIMS) and an inductively coupled plasma sector mass spectrometer  (ICP-SMS).   Additionally, the TIMS and ICP-SMS will provide the  necessary analytical capabilities for continued development of  high-resolution dating techniques (U/Th) and new proxies for  climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation (Sr/Ca  and U/Ca ratios in corals, speleothem growth rate, Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca  and stable isotope composition of ostracods).   Furthermore, the  TIMS will allow developmental work on recent breakthroughs in  chronometry using the Uranium/Protactinium (U/Pa) system.  Taken  as a whole, these instruments will be provide the necessary  sensitivity and analytical speed to retrieve the next generation  of high resolution local and regional climate records for testing  theories about the causes of climate change and for testing  models designed to simulate past and future climatic conditions.    ***",
