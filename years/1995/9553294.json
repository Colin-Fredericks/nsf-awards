 "awd_abstract_narration": "Denver Area Youth Services (DAYS), a community-based non-profit  organization serving predominantly minority children, youth and  families in Denver, Colorado, submits this proposal to sponsor a 4-  week Summer Science Camp for 50 minority children entering 7th and  8th grade.   Most will be students who will be enrolling in the  Denver youth Academy, a new charter public middle school for at-  risk students that is scheduled to open in Fall, 1995.  Two-thirds  of the target population are Latinos, about 30% African-American  and the rest Native American, all minority groups that experience  high drop-out rates, low college enrollment rates and that are  dramatically underrepresented in math and science fields in  Colorado and nationally.    The Camp represents a unique collaboration of a community-based  agency that has access to and credibility with the minority  community, and two premier institutions of science education-Regis  University and Children's  Museum of Denver.  Regis University will  provide the Principal Investigator for the project, Dr. Jim  Giulianelli, as well as develop and facilitate the classroom  learning activities for the first week of the Camp.  The Children's  Museum of Denver will develop and facilitate the classroom learning  and research activities for the second and third week of the camp.   Youth in the Camp will thus be exposed to a university campus, as  well as to a family-friendly environment for practicing science  that they and their families can continue to access on an ongoing  basis throughout the year.  The Camp will conclude with a week long  residential experience at a campsite in a national park in  Colorado's Rocky Mountains.        The Camp will provide a rich experience of integrated classroom  instruction, experiments and research activities that will be  documented in the student's Science Journals.  Extensive Career  Exploration activities will be woven throughout the four weeks  through field trips to businesses and government agencies, meetin gs  with individual scientists, guided career research, and other group  activities.  Mentors will include: university professors; science  teachers; minority high school, undergraduate and graduate students  in math and science programs serving as Camp Counselors; and  volunteer scientists and engineers.  Student support activities  include numerous family involvement activities, peer support, and  ongoing involvement of the campers with the Denver Youth Academy.",
