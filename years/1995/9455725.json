 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recognition of the importance of introductory biology courses at  two-year and community colleges to the development of scientific  literacy among college-educated individuals, BSCS is  conceptualizing, writing, testing, and evaluating a set of  innovative curriculum materials for biology students at the college  level.  Collaborating in the 36-month project are fifteen partners,  including biology faculty at eight community colleges (including  several that offer programs in biotechnology and environmental  technology), the American Association of Community and Junior  Colleges (AACJC), the two-year college section of National  Association of Biology Teachers (NABT), the Society for College  Science Teaching (SCST), the American Mathematical Association of  Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), the American Institute of Biological  Sciences (AIBS), Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Inc., and  Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company (college division).  The completed  program will offer an integrated and coherent approach to helping  students achieve three major goals of biological literacy: 1) to  understand the basic unifying principles of biology; 2) to develop  the fundamental skills of critical thinking and scientific  reasoning; and 3) to recognize the applications of science,  especially relationships among science, technology, and society.   The materials that are being developed are of use to future  teachers or science at the elementary and secondary levels because  strategies are incorporated that encourage students to reflect on  the overall deign of the program, the strategies that help them  learn, various teaching techniques, and assessment strategies.  The  products of the project will include student materials (readings,  activities, and laboratory exercises) that will support both  semester- and year-long introductory biology courses and that  emphasize hands-on, open-ended inquiry, collaborative learning, and  the relationships among science, technology, and society; an  instructor's gui de that will provide faculty with extensive  background reading and specific implementation support; and a model  for a faculty development workshop that will be designed and tested  by the partner faculty and will be supported after the end of the  project by revenues realized from sales of the program.",
