 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate an innovative alternate approach to the evaluation of the Coulomb interactions in large molecules. Recently there has been a rapidly growing interest in Density Functional Theory (DFT) as a general procedure for predicting physical properties of molecules, which is relatively inexpensive compared to traditional correlated methods. For the largest molecular systems whose study is feasible by the current DFT programs (several hundred atoms), the treatment of the Coulomb interactions, with its quadratic cost is system size, is computationally dominant. In order to be able to perform calculations on truly large molecules, a breakthrough in the scaling of the Coulomb contribution is required. There is a significant opportunity for considerable advancement beyond current technology in this area. Recent research in finite-population sampling theory has yielded a breakthrough method, the QCKR algorithm, which yields the solution to certain combinatorial problems extremely efficiently relative to standard techniques, often affording several orders of magnitude improvement. Interestingly, it is possible to express the Coulomb problem in a form which is closely related to these combinatorial problems. During the Phase I effort, the QCKR method will be extended to solve the Coulomb problem, and the potential of the method for facilitating DFT calculations on very large molecular systems will be assessed.",
