 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the problems with programming using  higher-order procedures  is the absence of formal tools for analyzing the time  and space  complexity of such procedures.   This absence is partially due to the  fact that the current mathematical models of computation for higher  types are  very divorced from the complexity-theoretic concerns.  The  aim of this project  is to work toward constructing a usable, realistic  complexity theory for  higher-order computation.    This research model is partially based on Cook and  Kapron's basic  feasible functionals (BFFs), which are a class of finite-type  functionals  that are intended to be the finite-type analogue of PF, the  polynomial-time computable functions.   At type-2 there is a reasonable  body of  work which appears to confirm that type-2 BFFs are a reasonable  type-2 analog  of PF.  Natural non-sequential extensions of the type-2  BFFs are investigated  and a theory of non-sequential `polynomial-time`  functionals is constructed.  This extended theory of type-2 BFFs is  also used to develop a theory of  computational complexity for machine  learning.    Unlike the situation for  type-2, for type-3 (and above), there is  not the weight of evidence that the  BFFs are a reasonable analog of PF.  This research tests several models (partly  based on the type-2 complexity)  at type-3, by analyzing some higher-order  algorithms involving monads,  continuations, and other higher-order  constuctions.    An intermediate goal is to use the experience gained from this  work on  the complexity of finite-type functionals, to develop `complexity  theoretic` solutions to domain equations.  Such solutions have the  potential of  providing settings in which one could examine both  semantic and  complexity-theoretic features of languages such as ML.",
