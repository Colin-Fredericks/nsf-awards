 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the researched work is to develop compact,                efficient equipment capable of generating ozone at very high                    concentrations for the semiconductor manufacturing and materials                processing industry.  Emerging process technologies using ozone                 chemistry have created the need for such equipment.  A novel                    experimental generator, constructed in phase I, has produced high               concentration ozone at three times the yield (efficiency) of                    conventional generators.  Full scale generators incorporating this              novel design are expected to be one-forth the size of conventional              generators.  The four goals for the phase II research are                       construction of a new laboratory scale generator which incorporates             the design improvements suggested by the phase I research                       utilization of the laboratory scale generator to explore several                promising approaches to obtaining additional yield improvements,                design and construction of a commercial scale generator, added                  design of modular ozone generation systems with a nominal                       production capacity of 2 to 8 kgm/day at 10 to 15 percent                       concentration.                                                                       If successful, this research will lead to the development of               a critical manufacturing resource for use in the fabrication of the             next generation of semiconductor devices.",
