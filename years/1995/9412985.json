 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Raymond C. Francis, SUNY College of Environmental Science and   Engineering - Syracuse, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under the   Environmentally Benign Synthesis and Processing Initiative for an   evaluation of peracids as replacements for chlorine containing compounds   in the bleaching of wood. Major efforts will be directed at evaluating   the metal catalyzed decomposition of caroates and peracetic acid, the   oxidation of lignin models and cellulose with caroates and peracetic   acid, and finally the oxidation of actual kraft pulp. A combination of   these results will permit the optimal conditions to be designed for the   use of caroates and peracetic acid as replacements of chlorine containing   bleaches by the paper industry.  The peracetic acid research will use   potentially hazardous, highly concentrated peracetic acid. These   experiments will be conducted in the Houston laboratories of the   industrial collaborator, Solvay Interox.  Wood pulps are usually bleached during paper manufacturing with chlorine   containing compounds. The reaction between these bleaches and lignins   produces organochlorine compounds which are believed to be harmful to the   environment. The peracids are strong oxidants which also can oxidize   lignins. However, they do not generate chlorine containing organics and   their effluents can be recycled, concentrated, and disposed of in   environmentally sound ways. As the use of peracids in wood pulp   processing is a relatively new concept and this project involves a   comprehensive investigation of both the relevant organic and inorganic   chemistry. The results will assist the paper industry to determine the   optimal conditions under which peracids should be used.",
