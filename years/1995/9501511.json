 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model has been developed for the theoretical description of large classes of problems  involving nonlinear diffusion and diffusive transport in modern polymeric materials. Of paramount  importance in many applications is the formation and propagation (according to prescribed time rules)  of multiple sharp (shock-like) diffusive fronts usually involving non-equilibrium, time dependent  diffusion processes, mechanical relaxation, and unusual physics and chemistry at fixed and moving  boundaries and at interfaces between glassy and rubbery states of the polymer. Precise understanding  and coltrol of these fronts is critical for the technological design, fabrication, and use of these  devices. In collaboration with an experimental group at Columbia University, the model will be  employed to attempt to understand the basic science involved in non-Fickian diffusion of types Case  II, Super-Case II, Sorption Overshoot, and Two-Stage at the glass-rubber transition. Various  technological problems will be formulated, and techniques will be devised to solve the resulting  nonlinear partial differential  and integral equations involving unusual boundary conditions at fixed  and moving boundaries.  Polymers, composites, and synthetic modern materials are replacing traditional  materials in many scientific, engineering, commercial, and military applications, and wholly new  devices, applications, and even entire new fields are emerging because of the existence of these new  materials. This has resulted from rapid and simultaneous developments in materials science, synthetic  chemistry, and biotechnology. The list of important scientific and technological advances being  achieved and contemplated is truly astounding. For example, it is now thought that fundamental  advances can be made in the areas of new adhesives, light-weight and incredibly strong bonding  materials and sheet molding compounds, heat shielding devices, pharmaceuticals and medical drug  delivery systems, exotic composites designed through self-assembly at the micro-structure level,  devices that work as a result of understanding and controlling glass-rubber phase change boundaries,  and environmental protective and clean-up devices and materials. Observation and experiments with the  new materials clearly indicate that, in many respects, classical theories and results are not  applicable. New theories and models, and the analytical and numerical techniques needed to analyze  them, will be developed in this project.",
