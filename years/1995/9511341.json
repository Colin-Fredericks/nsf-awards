 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511341  Rush    Cells  in  the nervous system transmit information via electrical  voltage  signals  called action potentials.  A  neuron  can  fire  action  potentials repetitively, and information from one  neuron  to  another can be communicated through the frequency at which  a  neuron  fires. One of the goals of this project is  to  elucidate  the   mechanisms  by  which  this  frequency  is  modulated.  The  membranes of most neurons contain a class of channels that  allow  potassium ions to flow through the membrane. These channels  open  rapidly  following the initial voltage increase during an  action  potential  and  then close at a slower rate.  This  channel  type  gives  rise to a potassium current, the A-current, which inhibits  temporarily the voltage increase, and thus serves as an intrinsic  mechanism by which the firing frequency is lowered. It  has  been  hypothesized  that this current can result in a  broad  range  of  firing  frequencies in a single cell. Dr. Rush is a mathematician  who  will  study  the extent to which A-current modulates  firing  frequency  in  the presence of other external influences  on  the  neuron,  such  as chemical signals released from  other  neurons.  With  an understanding of frequency modulation, they will  extend  their analysis of the A-current to other types of firing patters,  namely  repetitive  burst  of action  potentials.  This  type  of  behavior  has been seen in electroencephalograms (EEGs)  recorded  during certain phases of sleep and during seizures. It is believe  that  a  delicate  balance  of  the  A-current  and  depolarizing  currents  is  important  for the generation  of  such  bursts  of  voltage activity.",
