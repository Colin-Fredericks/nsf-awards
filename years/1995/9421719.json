 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical  Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Marsha I. Lester of the University of Pennsylvania   will study the spectroscopy and reaction dynamics of open shell complexes   in order to: 1) map out the intermolecular potential energy surfaces   between a free radical and a collision partner by accessing   intermolecular vibrations via stimulated emission pumping and infrared   overtone excitation; 2) examine the change in the intermolecular   interaction between a free radical and a collision partner  due to the   orientation of the orbital containing an unpaired electron; and 3) induce   chemical reaction within a complex composed of a hydroxyl radical and a   molecular partner by surmounting the activation barrier to reaction via   infrared overtone excitation of that radical.  Detailed understanding of reaction chemistry at the molecular level   requires  knowledge of the behavior of the reaction partners during the   short duration of the reaction process.  Free radicals, i.e.,  atoms or    molecules with an unpaired electron, play an essential part in reaction   processes but because of their short lived existence are difficult to   study in themselves and, especially, in a reaction process.  The present   research will provide fundamental knowledge and insight into the process   of chemical reactions taking place in the gaseous state.",
