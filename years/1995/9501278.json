The research component will focus on the   application of new geometrical ideas to analyze and improve numerical   algorithms.  Part of the program will involve the derivation and study of an   optimization technique on the Grassman manifold suitable for solving the   Kohn-Sham equations of the local density approximation to Schroedinger's   equation used in condensed matter physics and in materials science.  The   second part of the program involves the application of singularity theory to   analyze and explain the behavior of certain numerical algorithms widely   used in eigensystem analysis and systems and control.  The education   component will include further development of a new course in scientific   computing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Computers with a   projection system will be used in undergraduate and graduate courses in   numerical analysis and applied mathematics in order to bring new insights   into the material.  Mentoring and training of new researchers will also take   place and will integrate the research and educational activities.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-  wide  program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single   program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally underrepresented in science   and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance   the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic   careers which include both research and education.",
