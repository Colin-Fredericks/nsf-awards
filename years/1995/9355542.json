The project begins in Summer 1 with teams from 10  previously established CMP Centers attending a 2-week  residential leadership workshop at MSU.  Each team of 4 is  made up of well-prepared teachers, supervisors, and/or  teacher educators with prior CMP (or CMP-like) experience.   To prepare these teams to assume leadership roles in  implementing CMP in its respective Center's region, this  workshop introduces the leaders to: (1) the new CMP units  (including the underlying mathematics and the built-in  technological software components); (2) the uses of oral and  written discourse in mathematics; (3) ways of establishing a  problem-solving environment in the classroom;  and (4)  authentic assessment in mathematics.  Over the next 2 years,  each leadership team, in turn, prepares and supports 12 6th  grade teachers to implement the new materials and teaching  practices in their classrooms.  This support includes 2  intensive, sequential 2-week summer workshops, as well on-  going support for 2 school years.  Similar 2-year  implementation cycles for the 7th and 8th grade materials  begin with new groups of teachers in Years 2 and 3,  respectively.     Cost-sharing is 31% of the NSF contribution.",
