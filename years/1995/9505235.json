 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAR-9505235  Kedar, Sharon    Proposed broadband modeling of volcanic seismic sources will be used to evaluate the fluid volume changes and mass transport that take place during volcanic activity, as well as to resolve the source geometry of the seismic activity.  The broadband seismic data will be collected on Kilauea, Hawaii, and Stromboli, southern Italy, over the next two years.  To date, seismologists have not exploited the new broadband date for the study of volcanic processes.  Although it is a difficult problem, the results could be very useful for responding to volcanic hazards.  The simple harmonic behavior of volcanic ground motion (Oharmonic tremorsO) renders their interpretation from band-limited data ambiguous, as any source that tends to resonate may be responsible.  The complex stratigraphy and materials with widely ranging seismic velocities adds complex path effects to the problem.  The broadband signature of volcanic events has already highlighted source processes that could not be deduced in the past; broadband seismograms promise to revolutionize the study of volcanic tremors in the same way that they have impacted earthquake studies in recent years.",
