 "awd_abstract_narration": "With partial support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Daniel Kersten will purchase an instrumentation system which will permit him to study how individuals use visual clues to locate the position of objects. The instrumentation consists of: 1. a 3D Graphics computer to synthesize high-quality images and animations in which the clues to depth and shape are precisely controlled; 2. a robot arm to position, orient and move real target objects; 3. an infrared tracking device for precise measurement of hand and other motor movements. The robot arm will position real objects to coincide with the virtual target objects created by the computer whose screen is seen through a mirror. Reach and grasp movements of the hand and fingers will be monitored with the infrared motion measurement system.   Although human beings and other primates have the remarkable ability to use vision to program and control skilled movements directed at objects in their environment, scientists do not understand how individuals process multiple clues such as size, shading and shadows to arrive at this knowledge. With the equipment provided, Dr. Kersten will be able to vary these clues and change, for example the size and position of shadows, and determine how the subject's perception varies accordingly. The equipment will also be used to train students and thus serve an educational as well as research function.",
