 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will be held on June 19, 1995, in conjunction with  the ICCV conference at MIT in Cambridge, Mass. The objective of the  workshop is to bring together researchers who in the last few years  have started addressing problems in Visual Information Management  (VIM). Most of these efforts, however, were focussed either on only  a small aspect of the problem or a very narrow application.  Clearly, visual information management systems encompass central  aspects of databases, image processing and image understanding,  very sophisticated interfaces, networks and storage systems,  knowledge based systems, compression and decompression, and object  oriented systems. Without addressing most of these issues, one may  either address only theoretical issues, or may work in a microcosm  that will, at best, be extremely narrow in its utility and  extensibility. Considering the growing need and interest in the  organization and retrieval of visual and other non-alphanumeric  information, and the insufficient number of academic projects in  this area, the workshop on visual information management systems  will provide a much needed platform. While VIM is a very broad  area, the focus of the workshop is on what researchers in computer  vision could contribute. The challange for vision researchers is to  develop tools for analyzing the semantic content of video and  image, and then representing that content in a way that can be  efficiently searched and compared, and finally delivering that  content to users in the form a of useful, focused presentation.  Computer vision can contribute techniques for semiautomatically and  automatically extracting features that will be essential for  indexing and query formulation in image and video databases.  Computer vision researchers have addressed problems in human and  robotic vision for several applications, but very little attention  has been given to this new emerging field. This workshop will be  exploring computer vision techniques which are going to prov ide the  basic foundation for visual information management systems.",
