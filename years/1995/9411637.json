 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work  of Professor Robert A. Moss at Rutgers University. Carbenes and related  reactive intermediates will be studied by direct spectroscopic methods,  particularly by laser flash photolysis. Elements of the project are: (1)  dissection of the photoinitiated carbenic reactions to reveal  contamination by excited state precursors (carbene mimetic reactions);  (2) examination of isotope effects on intramolecular rearrangements, and  evidence for tunneling; (3)  the study of electronic and steric effects  in competitive 1,2-carbon migrations of unsymmetrically ring-substituted  cyclopropylhalocarbenes;  (4) the measurement of the electronic character  of 1,2-acyl migrations in acyloxycarbenes and the possible generation of  acyl anions by the basic cleavage of acyloxydiazirenes; and (5)  determination of the kinetics of carbene-pyridine ylide formation.  Carbenes, divalent carbon species, are important reactive intermediates  in organic chemistry. Aspects of the reactions of carbenes will be  studied such as the mode of hydrogen and carbon atom migrations and the  origin of the products of photolysis of  carbene precursors. This  research could lead to new insights in our understanding of carbene  chemistry.",
