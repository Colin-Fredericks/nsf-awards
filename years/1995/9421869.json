 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421869  Lewis-Beck    Comparison of voting models across advanced democracies is  hampered by a number of things, among them difference in method,  measurement, and theory.  Franco-American election studies share  in common a survey research methodology, but tend to be separated  by differences of measurement and theory.  The respective  national election surveys do not pose many of the same questions  and the dominant research paradigms in each country offer  opposing explanatory models of vote choice.    This project, a joint effort of US and French researchers,  includes, for the first time, key American National Election  Study (ANES) items in the French National Election Study (for  1995).  Following on an analysis of new French pre-test data,  these ANES items will be included:  feeling thermometers,  approval ratings, economic evaluations, seven-point proximity  measures on social issues, party identification, candidate  traits.    Similarly, this project will include, again for the first time,  key French National Election Study (FNES) items into ANES (for  1996).  These items will be subject to American pre-test, thus  paralleling the above French pre-test.  The items are:  left-  right ideological measures, nonstandard social class measures (in  particular, a social status \"staircase\" indicator, and indicators  of property ownership).    The end result will be unique:  two presidential election surveys  - - 1995 for France, 1996 for the US - - that contain comparable  measures on key independent variables.  These data sets, which  will be made available to the scholarly community through the  Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research,  will enable unprecedented cross-cultural testing of rival  theories of vote choice.  ***",
