 "awd_abstract_narration": "Olfactory transduction is the physiological process of  smell in which receptor cells transform their reception of  an odorant into a nerve signal to send to the brain.  The  mechanisms involve modulation of ion-selective components of  the membrane conductance in the olfactory receptor cell, to  trigger excitation of a nerve impulse from the cell.  Membrane properties often are studied in cells that have  been dissociated and isolated in a dish, where they are  easily accessible for physiological recording with micro-  electrodes.  This project uses a novel \"slice\" preparation  of sensory epithelium, so that micro-electrode studies will  allow characterization of the membrane properties of  olfactory cells in a more normal environment, and  determination of how the membrane conductances are modulated  by odors.  This preparation offers unique opportunities to  study spatial interactions within the sensory epithelium,  and the role of non-neuronal neighboring cells in modulating  the neural response.  Using patch-clamping techniques of  electrophysiology, the chemosensory properties of two  distinct morphological forms of olfactory cells are  compared, along with the physiological properties of three  classes of non-neuronal cell types in the epithelium.  Results will have an impact on our understanding of how  peripheral chemosensory function depends on the integrated  activity within the receptor organ, as well as the  properties of individual receptor cells.  These results will  be important to sensory neuroscience in general, in  analyzing the capabilities for detecting, discriminating and  encoding by a network system of neurons in a sheet of  epithelium.",
