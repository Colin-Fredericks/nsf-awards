Support will be aimed at attracting promising  investigators   at   the   start  of  their   research   careers.  Applications will be submitted in response to announcements to be  published  in  major  U.S.  materials societies'  bulletins.   An  international  organizing  committee, chaired  by  the  principal  investigator,  Dr. Robert Chang of Northwestern University,  will  select the U.S. participants.    This conference, which is co-sponsored by the International Union  of  Materials Research Societies (IUMRS) and the Mexican  Academy  of  Materials  (AMM), will provide an opportunity  for  materials  scientists  from  around  the  world  to  discuss  their   latest  discoveries.  Thirty-two symposia on advanced materials  will  be  presented by leading scientists in their fields, and a series  of  proceedings of the conference will be published.  In addition  to  providing a valuable forum to exchange ideas, the conference will  encourage  the development of collaborations, particularly  among  scientists from Canada, Mexico and the United States.  This award  is  jointly  supported by the Division of Materials Research  and  the Division of International Programs of NSF.  ***",
