 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, an Engineering Computer Laboratory is being  established and operated by the campus Information Services  Department.   Because of lab location and program proximity,  chemical engineering and industrial engineering students are  expected to form the bulk of the students using this facility.    During periods when no engineering classes are scheduled, the  laboratory is available for use as an open lab for any student.    All chemical and industrial engineering majors are required to  use computers to complete their coursework, so all Chemical and  Engineering students benefit from this project.   Current  emphasis on computational access is integrated throughout the  curriculum, from the introductory material through design and  engineering applications.   Significant course development in the  engineering programs is also occurring as integrated access to  computer technology is available.   This laboratory establishes a  platform for the delivery of engineering courses that utilize  computer applications and provide an integrated design experience  for all engineering students.",
