The  theoretical model relates specific electoral rules (e.g.  plurality - \"winner take all\" rules), threshold requirements, and  district magnitudes (e.g. multi-member) to the organizational  structures rational self-interested individuals choose to adopt.   By varying these components of the electoral system, it is  possible, within the theoretical model, to generate hypotheses  about how intra-party organization will differ under different  electoral systems.    The empirical analysis seeks to test the hypotheses generated  from the theoretical model using three different data sources and  methodologies.  These include a statistical analysis of a large  data set on electoral systems and party organizations for the  post war democracies; the analysis of approximately 30 \"quasi-  experiments\" drawn from actual instances of electoral system  change; and an in-depth case study exploring the responses of the  Italian parties to the recent transformation of their electoral  system.  ***",
