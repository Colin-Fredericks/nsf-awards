 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique type of apparatus will be developed jointly by the  University of Michigan and Notre Dame University that will  permit studies of low-energy nuclear reactions key to better  understanding the production of energy and synthesis of the  elements in astrophysical processes.  The latter include  BigBang nucleosynthesis and the production of energy and  heavy elements in stars and supernovae (exploding stars).  Improved nuclear measurements will help clarify some of the  outstanding mysteries that exist in astrophysics.  The  proposed apparatus will consist of a small but highintensity  electrostatic ion accelerator coupled to a specially  designed, high-efficiency magnetic detection device.  The  latter will consist of two large superconducting magnets  which will be designed and built in the U.S. as a  collaborative effort with a U.S. industrial partner. The  apparatus proposed will be part of a Midwest low-energy  nuclear accelerator facility located at the University of  Notre Dame.  A unique feature of the facility will be the  production of relatively intense, short-lived unstable  nuclear beams for the study of reactions related to  explosive nucleosynthesis.  The new apparatus will also be  available for new types of applied research in atomic  physics, biophysics and materials science.  It will serve a  dozen or more universities and colleges in the immediate  area with extensive participation by undergraduates,  graduate students, and faculty from those institutions (U.  Michigan, U. Notre Dame, Oberlin College, Ohio State U., U.  Indiana-So. Bend, U.W. Kentucky, Hope College, MSU, U.  Illinois,...).",
