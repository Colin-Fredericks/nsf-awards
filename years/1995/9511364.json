 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two major competing procedures for evaluating  risky projects where managerial flexibility plays an  important role:  one is option  pricing theory, based on the  no-arbitrage theory of financial markets, and the other is  decision analytic, based on stochastic dynamic programming.  The basic procedure in the option pricing evaluation of is  to find a portfolio of securities and a trading strategy  that generates cash flows exactly matching the cash flows of  the risky project.  One then determines the market value of  this replicating portfolio and compares this value to the  cost of undertaking the project, yielding, as a consequence,  the optimal investment decision.  The basic procedure in a  decision-analytic evaluation is to construct a decision tree  (or dynamic programming) model of the project and assess the  manager's subjective probabilities and utilities for the  possible outcomes.  One then works backwards through the  tree to find the project's value and the optimal investment  decision.  As a project involves more real assets, such as  buildings, equipment, and human capital (as opposed to  purely financial assets such as stocks and bonds), finding a  replicating portfolio becomes problematic.  On the other  hand, as a project grows in complexity, assessing  probabilities and utilities for all possible states of the  world becomes difficult.  The goal of this research project  is to further develop a procedure for evaluating risky  projects that integrates the option-pricing and decision-  analysis approaches.  The proposed procedure is consistent  with both the option-pricing and decision-analysis  approaches, can be applied when the option pricing method  fails due to a lack of a replicating portfolio, and is  simpler and easier to implement than a full decision-  analytic treatment.",
