 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on the structure of finitely presented lattices as well as the study of algorithmic problems of finite lattices.  In finitely presented lattices, efficient solutions to basic structural and representation problems will be sought.  Such problems include finding a polynomial time algorithm to decide if an element of a finitely presented lattice has a lower cover, if a finitely presented lattice is finite, if it is weakly atomic, and if it has finite width.  A proof of the conjecture that a finitely presented lattice of infinite width must contain a free lattice will be sought.  Furthermore, faster algorithms for the recognition and construction of finite lattices will be investigated.  Using theorems on free lattices, finitely presented lattices, and projective lattices, efficient methods for solving systems of equations in free lattices will be sought.  These methods should lead to efficient algorithms for determining the unification type of such a system.  Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory or logic.  This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many mathematical environments.  It also means that problems are easy to state, hard to solve and of a very general nature.  The results of this work will impact many areas of mathematics, computer science, the social sciences and business management.",
