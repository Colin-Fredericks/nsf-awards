 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports efforts to characterize the foraminifera in  drill core recovered by the Cape Roberts Project (CRP).  The CRP  will drill four holes, from a sea-ice platform in up to 500m of  water, in the southwest Ross Sea.  Geophysical site surveys  suggest that the four drill holes will provide an aggregate  thickness of about 1500m of core and span about 100 to about 30  Ma (Cretaceous-Paleocene).  This interval of geological time is  not yet documented by in situ stratigraphic sections in either  the Ross Sea or East Antarctica.  The nearest comprehensive data  sources for the Cretaceous and Paleocene) occur in New Zealand,  the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the southern ocean.  Benthic  and planktic Foraminiferida from the core will be used, together  with data from other fossil groups, to provide on-site age and  stratigraphic control as drilling progresses.  Age correlations  will be made with DSDP/ODP biostratigraphy from southern Ocean  drill sites, and also with New Zealand planktic and benthic  zonal/stage schemes.  A principal task of this work is to  document in the project's initial report, a comprehensive  accounting of foraminiferal material present so as to assist  planning of post-drilling investigations.  Basic information to  be recorded on the foraminifera will include: presence,  abundance, preservation, species dominance and diversity,  stratigraphic distribution, levels of endemism or cosmopolitanism  in faunas, and completeness or fragmentation of population  structures, et cetera.  These data will be used to address a  variety of geological problems.  Disconformities and acoustic  reflectors which extend across the rift system basins and are  also expected to be encountered in the drill hole will be dated.  Major basin subsidence/uplift trends resulting from compaction  and/or rift margin faulting will be deduced from benthic  foraminiferal bathymetric indicators.  More subtle cyclicity in  the stratigraphic distribution of benthic species will be u sed to  recognize and document phases of transgression and regression,  which in turn may indicate a relationship between sea level  oscillation and terrestrial glacial events.  The Cretaceous-  Paleocene was an interval of time during which the final  disintegration of Gondwanaland occurred, specifically the  northward movement of New Zealand and Australia away from  Antarctica.  Foraminifera from the CRP drill holes will  contribute to an understanding of the paleogeography and  paleoceanography between the highlands and Pacific margin of East  Antarctica (the location of the proto-Transantarctic Mountains),  and the West Antarctic Rift System basins between this suspected  island chain and the highlands of West Antarctica.  This will  help answer the question as to whether the marine margin of East  Antarctica, in the vicinity of the planned drill holes, was  located in a Cretaceous cul-de-sac, or whether it occupied, at  times, a position on a major oceanic circulation pathway between  the SW Indian Ocean, SW Pacific, and SW Atlantic Oceans.",
