The  surveys have been conducted at five-year intervals,  beginning in 1965.  This national survey of two-year and  four-year institutions obtains detailed data on  undergraduate enrollment, faculty counts and  characteristics, and general academic activity.  Separate  questionnaires are used for four-year and two-year  institutions.  A stratified random sample of institutions is  selected.  Data and analysis are presented in a survey  report appearing in the Mathematical Association of America  (MAA) notes and Reports Series of the MAA, and are further  distributed through presentations at professional meetings  and special articles.    This project will be conducted under the direction of a nine-  member committee broadly representative of the academic  communities to be surveyed.  Parties involved in significant  redesign and restructuring of undergraduate education in  mathematics will be important contributors to planning for  this effort as well.",
