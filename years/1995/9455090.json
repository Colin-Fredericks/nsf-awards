 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one week workshop on FT-NMR will be held for undergraduate  faculty, who have had little experience in FT-NMR, from 2 and 4  year institutions in a six state region:  Arkansas, Oklahoma,  Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa.  The workshop will consist of  lectures, instrument use, and data analysis and will cover topics  ranging from beginning NMR theory to pulse sequences and 2-D NMR.   Hands-on experience will be gained on a JEOL 270 MHz FT-NMR.  A  workshop handbook, containing a large number of spectra, will be  prepared for each participant.  Participants will be able to use  these spectra at their home institutions. Major goals of the  workshop are to up-date participants on modern NMR techniques and  to encourage use of these techniques in the undergraduate  curriculum.    Follow-up activities include a meeting at the Midwest Regional ACS  meeting, in November, 1995.  Reports prepared by participants about  their use of the information gained from this workshop will be  collected, edited, assembled, bound and distributed to all  institutions of higher education in the six state region.",
