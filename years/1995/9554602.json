The focus of this initiative is hands-on, inquiry science teaching and learning.  The targeted teachers are K-5.      A team of stakeholders consisting of teachers, administrators, business partners and community representatives will be identified and brought together to develop a comprehensive plan to implement an elementary hands-on, inquiry-based science program coordinated with grades K-12.    Activities will include:     Self-study.  A systematic and thorough district-wide (K-12) study of the Plymouth-Canton Community School District to determine its strength and weakness as it relates to science education reform.  Identify internal funding sources and a plan to sustain systemic reform.     Research.  Research of reform strategies, existing science units, staff-development models, materials supply and refurbishing systems, funding plans, and the goals and objectives of the Michigan Statewide Systemic Initiative.    The plan developed under this grant will be presented to the National Science Foundation as a full grant proposal to support systemic science education reform in the Plymouth-Canton Community School District.    Cost sharing will be $10,950.     The project requested $49,805 from NSF with 21% cost sharing.   ***",
