 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423114  Lubensky  This project involves theroetical investigations of three  subprojects related to liquid crystals:  the  quasicrystalline twist-grain-boundary C phase, the shape of  droplets in Langmuir films, and multiple scattering of light  from liquid crystals.  The twin-grain-boundary phase has  recently been observed experimentally.  The PI proposes to  study this thoroughly, including the development of a guage  theory for the Smectic-C phase that will be used to  calculate dislocation energies in type II systems, an  analysis of dipolar interactions, and a search for the  origins of quasicrystalline lock-in.  The possibility that  chiral pinwheel droplets of Langmuir which have been  observed recently are reproduced by effective anisotropic  negative line tension favoring large perimeter and the  capture of a topological defect will be investigated.  The  extension of diffusion-wave spectroscopy formalism to  nematic liquid crystals in which multiple scattering in an  anisotropic medium is produced by long-range fluctuations in  the dielectric constant will be studied.  %%%  In this project Lubensky will continue his theoretical study  of complex fluids, such as liquid crystals.  He is  considered a world leader in the theory of these materials.  The first part involves the investigation of a phase (just  recently discovered in experiments) of unique structure and  symmetry which may prove to be technologically important.  The second part, involving the study the shapes of  droplets  of molecular films, will help understand interactions within  the molecules that make up monolayers, a topic of great  interest to both physicists and biologists.  The third part,  analyzing the application of a relatively new experimental  technique to liquid crystals,  may provide an important tool  for studying liquid crystals.  It is worth noting that  Lubensky has just finished his collaboration with Chaikin of  a new textbook in graduate level condensed matter physics  that many believe will replace  the textbook currently  considered the standard in this area.  ***",
