 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415985  Paerl         Previous research on carbon (C) dynamics of microbial  mat communities has involved the quantification of C in and  out of the mats.  While these studies have increased the  knowledge of the collective C fluxes of marine microbial  mats, they have failed to take into account that mats are  composed of physiologically and evolutionary distinct  constituents including bacteria, cyanobacteria and  eukaryotic microallgae.  This research will pursue the next  logical step which is to discern the contributions to the C  budget of microbial mats by the individual components of the  mat community.  The distinguishing feature of this research  is the use of a mechanistic/functional approach for  identifying the principal organisms and ecophysiological  factors controlling the key processes in benthic microbial  mats.  Principal research objectives include:  1)  elucidating the ecophysiological processes responsible for  mat community structure and function, 2) revealing  mechanisms controlling microbial mat consortial  interactions, and 3) identifying species and functional  group succession.  Specifically the research will document  seasonal changes in the identity (taxonomic groups)  and  abundance (standing stock) of mat phototrophs and  diazotrophs using microscopy and HPLC methods.  C fixation  and allocation will be evaluated using 14C, O2  microelectrodes, microautoradiography and in situ growth  rates,  The primary ecophysiological factors (light,  nutrients, sub aerial exposure, etc.)  that regulate C  fixation, allocation and community succession will be  assessed in a series of controlled mat manipulation  experiments.",
