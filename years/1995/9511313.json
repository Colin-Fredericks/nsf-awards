 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist from Stanford, California.  The project is to study three socio-religious groups of women in Cairo, Egypt to explore the variation in women's' understanding of Islamic fundamentalism.  Using ethnographic techniques of participant observation, in-depth interviews and reading national debates in the mass media, the student will analyze the opinions of the groups with respect to government sponsored religious practices, will assess the importance of factors such as socio-economic class, age and educational backgrounds for their opinions, and profile the Islamic public debate on the proper role so religion in public life.   This research is important because Islam is a major influence in the contemporary world.  Advances in our understanding of the sources of popular support for religious policies will help decision makers understand and deal with the actions of Islamic governments and populations.  In addition this dissertation research will add to our store of expertise about this important area of the world.",
