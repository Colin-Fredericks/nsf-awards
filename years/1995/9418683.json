Stephenson, of the  Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of  New Mexico, to conduct collaborative research with  Dr. Bruce H. J. McKellar, of the School of Physics at the  University of Melbourne.  The focus of the research will  be on the application of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) effective  theory to low energy nuclear properties and the study,  mainly through low energy nuclear reactions, of the interactions  of neutrinos at energies where their masses, should they exist,  will be important.    In this theoretical study of the physics of neutrinos and   quarks in nuclei at low energies, two issues will be  investigated.  The first study concerns the behavior of quarks  in the atomic nuclei and the question of whether they remain  confined to individual protons and neutrons, or whether they  transfer between them.  The second study deals with neutrinos  and the development of a model in which the effective mass of  a particle depends on its surroundings, a model which could  explain some features of the experiments which have attempted to  measure the mass of this elusive particle.  The collaborative  work brings together the complementary expertise of the principal  investigators.  The visits by Dr. McKellar to New Mexico are  supported by the Australian Department of Industry, Science  and Technology (DIST) under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative  Science Program.",
