 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. Camerer (SBR-9511001).  The PIs propose to   study iterated rationality in the context of economic game theory.  Iterated rationality   refers to the belief that others are rational, that others believe that you are rational, that   you believe that others believe that you are rational, etc.  Iterated rationality is a central   assumption of game-theoretic analyses that have been applied to a large number of   phenomena in economics, psychology, and other social sciences.  Since the empirical   basis for this assumption is weak, the PIs plan to examine it in several ways.  First, they   will use a  numbers game  in which the estimate of a winning number by a contestant   reveals to what extent that contestant believes in iterated rationality.  Second, they will   use variations of the numbers game in order to determine which changes in the procedure   foster more rational choices.  Such procedural changes will provide clues as to subjects    assumptions about the rationality of their opponents.  Third, the PIs will examine   participants with various characteristics, such as group homogeneity or experience with   the numbers game, in order to determine what factors influence participants  rationality.    Finally the PIs will examine whether what a participant learns about rationality in one   game transfers to a different game.",
