 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523311  Wang  Cylindrical sapphire optical waveguides have been shown to be  especially attractive for the fabrication of high temperature  sensor instrumentation capable of operation at temperatures  potentially up to 2000C.  The Fiber & Electro-Optics Research  Center (FEORC) at Virginia Tech proposes to develop low-cost  reliable sapphire fiber temperature, pressure, and strain sensors  which are desirable for the monitoring and control of many high  temperature industrial processes, including the combustion  process-vital for the power generation industry.  Seven different  sensing configurations will be systematically investigated,  designed and fabricated to determine the optimal scheme for each  parameter measurement.  These sapphire waveguide-based schemes  include the balanced polarimetric sensor, the lead-insensitive  polarimetric sensor, the critical angle reflection intensity-  based sensor, the frustrated optical coupling intensity-based  sensor, and the grating-based wavelength-coded sensor.  The  selected optimal sensing schemes will then be further developed  into prototype sensor instrumentation units for system testing to  determine the system technical performance as well as the  feasibility of these sensors for the monitoring of the identified  high temperature industrial processes involved in the power  industry.  In addition to the sensor study, system development  and testing, the proposed research will also largely involve  research in waveguide evaluations and modifications, high  performance sapphire-to-silica fiber splicing, and high  temperature component fabrication which will directly support the  proposed sensor work.      The successful completion of the proposed program will result in  sapphire fiber sensor instrumentation to meet the needs of  monitoring and/or control of high temperature industrial  processes involved in the power generation industry, including  the combustion, boiling process, high temperature piping and  vessel systems.  ***",
