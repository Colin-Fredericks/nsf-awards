It is conjectured that the proposed research will engender novel solution techniques for a variety of electromagnetic optimization problems and bring about a number of powerful, highly efficient and systematic design techniques for a aforementioned electromagnetic components.  This study will also permit the formulation of guidelines regarding the suitability of Gas for other electromagnetic optimization problems in terms of number and the character of those parameter that require optimization the computational complexity of the forward analysis problem, and the available computing platform.  Education  Teaching excellence is an important component of all first-class undergraduate and graduate programs.   This young faculty member in electromagnetic will be committed to significantly revise a number of electromagnetics courses during the next for years in order to maintain and improve  the quality of the undergraduate and graduate electromagnetic curricula at the  University of  Illinois at Urbans-Champaign (UIUC).  The recently established College of Engineering's interdisciplinary program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) will instrumental in achieving the goal.  Furthermore,  he will foster discussions regarding the establishment and the promotion of an exchange program for undergraduate and graduate students between the Colleges of Engineering at the UIUC and Belgian universities.",
