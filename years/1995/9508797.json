 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMR-9508797, PI-Koch:  The scientific objective of the proposed research is to determine the influence of grain size on intrinsic ductility in nanocrystalline materials, which should help to elucidate the deformation mechanism.  Intrinsic ductility means defects (cracks, voids, etc.), impurities, or environmental effects (e.g.  hydrogen embrittlement) which may mask the fundamental ductility behavior.  Since the ductilization of nominally brittle intermetallic compounds (by creating nanocrystalline microstructures) would be of significant scientific and technical importance, the materials to be emphasized are intermetallics and intermetallic-matrix in situ composites.  In order to eliminated extrinsic factors which may influence the ductility that are induced by a given processing route, at least two processing methods for production of nanocrystalline materials are selected.  These are (1) mechanical attrition and compaction of powders, and (2) crystallization of amorphous ribbons or foils prepared by rapid solidification.  Mechanical testing includes compression tests for screening purposes, but emphasizes tests with tensile components, i.e., miniaturized disk-bend tests and tensile tests.  ***This study of intrinsic ductility of intermetallics and intermetallic composites as a function of nanocrystalline grain size should provide insight into the deformation mechanism for such materials as well as determining the optimum grain size for ductility and toughness.  This program is a collaborative effort between North Carolina State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Special educational benefits to the graduate  students result from spending the summers doing research at Oak Ridge.  The proposed research will also be carried out under the guidance and interaction with Pratt & Whitney and its program on nanocrystalline composites.***",
