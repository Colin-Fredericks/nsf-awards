 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds the purchase of computer and laboratory  equipment to allow a transformation of the structure and purpose  of the calculus-based three-semester engineering physics course  at the university.   This course serves approximately 700  students per year, most of them majoring in some form of  engineering.   Students in this course often find the course  confusing and fail to build either strong physical concepts or a  good understanding of the relation of physical models to  real-world experiments.   The new course focuses on concept  building and the development of experimental and modeling skills.     The new equipment is being used to create three new  microcomputer laboratories with computer-assisted data  acquisition.   One lab will be a qualitative group-learning  (tutorial) environment similar to those developed at the U.  of  Washington but with computer tools similar to Workshop Physics  (Dickinson) or the CUPLE Physics Studio (RPI).   These sessions  last 1 hour a week and are given in each of the three semesters.    Students work in groups of four using guided-discovery  worksheets.   The other two labs are quantitative and are taken  in the second and third semesters.   They last for 3 hours per  week.   Students take data both by hand and using the computer  and use spreadsheets to model their observations.   The emphasis  is on developing understanding.   The same computer tools are  used in both the qualitative and quantitative labs.   Both labs  use facilitated learning with Socratic dialog methods.",
