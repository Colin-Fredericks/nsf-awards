 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Evaluation Center at Western  Michigan University will conduct a study of the evaluations done on EHR science and mathematics education projects.  The purpose of this study is to describe the current state of practice and to compare this with the Standards for Educational Evaluation that represent the accepted goals for evaluation in the education field.    The study by Western Michigan University has three elements.   The first is a metaevaluation of the evaluations done for 40 EHR projects as well as generating example materials of interest to the field.  Second, WMU will conduct training in evaluation through two institutes, two conferences will introduce the issue of internships.  The conferences will introduce the issue of evaluation at NSF to a broad audience and provide a forum for discussion of the study findings.  Institutes will provide month-long, in-depth training in NSF educational evaluations.  Internships will be an extension of the institute, providing continuing opportunities for evaluation experience with NSF projects.  The  third element in the study is providing support services for the first two activities, including electronic dissemination of the results, technical assistance to projects base on the findings, and development of a directory of science and mathematics education evaluators.",
