 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506287  Prescott  The purpose of these groups of experiments is to understand the evolution and unique structure of macronuclear and micronuclear genomes and their processing in development. Three strategies to study the micronuclear genome and its processing and the evolution of the macronuclear and micronuclear genomes are proposed:  1. Comparison of macronuclear  with micronuclear versions of 5 genes in addition to the 5 already studied is proposed to establish the frequency of gene scrambling and a fuller definition of various scrambling patterns. 2. The temporal relationships of DNA processing events, particularly IES excision, MDS unscrambling, excision of gene-sized molecules from chromosomes, and telomere addition are to be detected in individual developing macronuclei with polymerase chain reactions. 3. A comparison of sequence versions of particular genes among several species of Oxytricha will give a measure of phylogenetic relationships and show how scrambling of micronuclear genes changes or is modified in evolution.  %%%  Cilliated protozoa possess a transcriptionally inactive germline nucleus (micronucleus) and a transcriptionally active somatic nucleus (macronucleus) within the same cell. After two cells mate, a new macronucleus develops from a micronuclear fusion product in each mating partner, and the old macronucleus disintegrates. In cilliates of the hypotrich group, DNA sequences are extensively amplified, cut, spliced, eliminated, and reordered during the 3-day development of a macronucleus. During these events blocks of DNA sequences in many genes are reordered to produce transcriptionally functional genes. Comparison of the DNA sequences of micronucliar with macronuclear versions of 5 genes has shown that micronuclear versions are interrupted by multiple, short AT-rich sequences called internal eliminated sequences (IESs) that are spliced out during macronuclear development. Three of the 5 genes are scrambled; blocks of sequence called macronuclear destined sequences (MD Ss) which are separated by IESs, are out of order, and, in some instances, inverted compared to the transcriptionally functional macronuclear versions of the genes. Parts or all of this DNA processing may represent evolution of novel molecular operations or may represent exploitation of molecular operations sporadically used in less conspicuous forms among other eukaryotes. In either case, these unusual events are an opportunity to learn about possible ways that an organism may manipulate its genomic DNA. Experiments to provide more detail of the actual mechanisms involved will be done.  ***",
