 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420164  Klekowski    This Americas Program award will  fund a  research  collaboration between Dr. Edward Klekowski, University of  Massachusetts  Amherst , and Dr. Avril-Siung-Chang,  Institute of Marine Affairs, Trinidad -Tobago, West Indies.  They propose to survey, genetically and chemically, selected  mangrove populations in Trinidad,  to determine if there is  a correlation between sediment contamination by chemically  identified pollutants and enhanced mutation in the  indigenous mangrove forests.   The work is an extension of  previous studies done in Puerto Rico by Dr. Klekowsky.   The  research  focuses on a an easily observed small subset of  mutation , albino propagules, with the  purpose  of  extrapolating the results to the rest of the gnome.   The  study will be divided into three parts: genetics, sediment  chemistry and pigment fingerprinting.  The University of  Massachusetts  will be responsible for the population  sampling, mutation rate measurements and the final data  analysis.  The group from the Institute of Marine Affairs,  Trinidad, will be collecting sediment cores from the  mangrove populations and will do the chemical analysis for  the core samples for petroleum related compounds.  The  pigment fingerprinting  will be done by the Department of  Marine Science, University of P.R.    Mangrove forests are a widespread ecosystem in the tropics  with unique features at the interface of land and sea,  and  form a protective buffer that cushions against tropical  storm surges.   They are an important forestry resource in  certain areas and are often nursery areas for commercially  important fish species.  Basic information on their  component species and how they respond to stress, will be  needed to develop appropriate conservation or restoration  programs and will help focus attention on the long-term  consequences of petroleum-related environmental pollution.  Trinidad offers a unique site for this study with its  combination of both controlled uncontaminated mangrove  h abitats as well as habitats that have been chronically  contaminated by petroleum for decades.  ***",
