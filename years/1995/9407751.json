 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schortman    With National Science Foundation support Drs. Schortman and Urban  will continue their archaeological work in the 96 km2 Naco valley  which is located in NW Honduras. Their prior research has  revealed over two millennia of continuous occupation predating  the Spanish Conquest. This span was characterized by changes in  political centralization and the extent to which the valley was  integrated within a single polity. The team will focus their  attention on one of the most marked centralizing episodes, the  Late Classic period (AD 600-95) when Naco and its immediate  environs were administered from the site of La Sierra. Although  concentration of power at La Sierra is strongly indicated by the  archaeological record, it is much harder to identify the factors  which underlie this political process. Evidence suggests that La  Sierra's rulers monopolized the production and distribution of a  limited range of generally needed items. These goods, the  researchers hypothesize, were fashioned using complex, difficult-  to-learn skills on materials localized in the capital. In effect,  control was achieved through the imposition of an economic  monopoly. However, data also indicate that this monopoly was not  complete and that outlying areas manipulated the system to obtain  varying degrees of autonomy. The goal of the present research is  to evaluate in detail how this system worked. The research team  will excavate a series of sites, not only in the capitol of La  Sierra, but also in a number of outlying areas which are located  at different distances from it.    This research is important because it will shed new light on how  complex societies emerge and are maintained. The level of  effective political centralization observed in the Naco valley is  widely replicated in many parts of the third world today.  Archaeology offers the possibility to gain unique insight into  such political mechanisms because it permits them to be followed  over extended time periods. The work is also import ant because it  will involve a large number of undergraduate students and  encourage them to pursue careers in science.  ***",
