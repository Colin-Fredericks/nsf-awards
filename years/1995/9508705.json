 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508705  Fieber  The experiments proposed in this study will address control of  neural function in the marine snail, Aplysia.  The simple nervous  system of this invertebrate is a model for the study of changes in  neural function that directly affect the animal's behavior.  The  neural control of egg laying in Aplysia is the physiological  phenomenon that will be examined.  The study will employ the  technique of single cell voltage clamping, which flows through  special channels in a group of neural cells called bag cells.  Two  specific goals of the study are:  1) to work out methods for  studying single sodium channels to understand how they execute  their role in the neural pattern that results in egg laying, and 2)  to identify certain hormones that circulate in the body of the  animal during egg laying that may change the way the sodium  currents operate.  These studies are the first step in a planned  study that will explore the idea that egg laying is dependent on  specific changes in these sodium currents.  Such studies have broad  relevance for understanding how an animal's nervous system controls  physiological or behavioral responses.",
