 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bryan Eichhorn, Chemistry Department, University of Maryland -   College Park, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate   the synthesis and characterization of transition metal derivatives of   soluble group 14 and 15 Zintl ions. The compounds will be prepared from   the reactions between zero valent transition-metal complexes and Zintl   anions. The targeted complexes will be among the first anionic   transition-metal Zintl ion clusters. These species contain few or no   attendant ligands or organic groups and will contain highly nucleophilic   transition-metal centers. The use of these complexes in the activation of   small molecules will be investigated.  In general metal atoms tend to lose electrons to form positively charged   ions. However, there is a class of negatively charged species called   Zintl ions which are composed of several (usually between 7 and 12) metal   atoms which are clustered together. This project aims at preparing such   negatively charged clusters in which one of the components is a   transition-metal. Since the transition-metals have important, e.g.,   catalytic properties, the new species to be prepared in this research are   envisioned to possess the ability to activate small molecules and perform   chemical transformations more efficiently than presently known Zintl   species.",
