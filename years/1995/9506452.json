 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will  develop  improved  numerical  methods  for simulating  fluid  flow, with emphasis on the vortex sheet model. The approach is based on the vortex method, in  which  Lagrangian points  carry  the vorticity. The working hypothesis is Prandtl's idea that the vortex sheet is an  asymptotic  model  for  a  free shear layer in slightly viscous flow. The first task in this pro- posal is to develop a fast summation method to study spiral scal- ing  properties  in  the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem. Other projects are a simulation of splitter plate flow with  realistic  boundary conditions,  and  a  comparison of planar and axisymmetric vortex sheet roll-up. The investigator will compare  vortex  simulations with  finite-difference  solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and with the available laboratory experiments. A key  concern  is to  obtain  accurate numerical solutions in order to make precise statements about the validity of the  various  modelling  assump- tions.  Fluid dynamics is concerned with the motion of gas (e.g. air) and liquid (e.g. water). A key goal is to understand the forces which act between the fluid and an immersed solid surface. For example, air  flow  past  the wing is responsible for the lift force which supports an aircraft in flight.  Fluid flow is important in  many areas of science and technology, from internal combustion engines to weather prediction to blood flow. The  mathematical  equations which describe fluid motion are difficult to solve, and hence the investigator is developing numerical algorithms for use  on  high speed computers.  The goal is to provide insight into the physics of fluid motion, and to create modelling tools to help  engineers solve design problems.",
