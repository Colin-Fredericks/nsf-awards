 "awd_abstract_narration": "To promote high achievement in science, math, and engineering  (SMET), the United States must commit and offer resource to  students of color, who are underrepresented in these fields. SHARP  is an exciting, multi-faceted summer program that will kindle  minority youth's flame for science, math, and engineering--and for  careers in SMET fields.  Through SHARP, 50 African-American,  Latino, and Asian students will be exposed to institutions of  higher education, minority professionals in SMET career fields, and  hands-on opportunity to work on SMET-related projects.    In the summers of 1995, 1996 and 1997, SHARP will run a 4-week, 5-  day-per-week commuter camp for 50 participants on the campus of the  University of Massachusetts at Lowell.  Half will come from Boston  and half from Lowell, a small, economically distressed city north  of Boston.  They will learn by doing in the University's classrooms  and its science, engineering, and computer labs.  They will be  instructed by minority professionals from technology corporations  and colleges that are current ESRA partners; these organizations  and individuals will also show them that people of color can and do  achieve successful careers in these fields, a critical missing  piece for so many minority youth.  Field trips will expose them to  colleges and businesses and provide further options for hands-on  learning.  Parent activities and follow-up opportunities will  ensure that students continue to build on their newly acquired  purposefulness and skills.    SHARP involves a strong partnership of businesses, colleges,  schools, and other organizations.  It is coordinated by ESRA, a  minority-controlled organization that is dedicated to minority  access to SMET fields.  ESRA has 9 years experience in just this  type of educational and support program, including substantial  experience in programs for inner-city, middle school students of  color.  ***",
