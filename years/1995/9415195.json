 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of the Animal Research Facility (ARF), constructed in 1974.  Presently, one room within the ARF is available to researchers employing minor research procedures required for developmental neuroscience, endocrinology,  cell and molecular biology and behavioral science investigations.  Although faculty have been productive, the kinds and quality of research that can be performed at the institution are limited due to inefficient space, location, and physical constraints. The research environment lacks adequate services such as gas and air, and fixed furnishings including benches, cabinets, and ventilated hoods.  The ventilation system does not comply with accepted standards for housing laboratory animals and cannot accommodate the special needs to isolate animals with known biohazards or with unknown health conditions.  Due to the impediments, investigators must transport  animals to  individual labs or to other facilities on the main campus.  At times the investigators are forced to house or use animals at other institutions because of limited space and facilities at UTSA.    As part of a comprehensive expansion and renovation effort supported by the University of Texas System, the NSF project will  include renovating space for aquatic and semi-aquatic animals, creating a multipurpose laboratory, sterile preparation rooms,  and utility and storage rooms.  The plumbing and HVAC systems in current space will also be replaced.    Once completed, the renovated space will  give researchers the capabilities required to conduct different types of research in various fields of science, and will help broaden the base and diversity of the biology program. Thus students are exposed to a wide range of techniques applicable to many different areas of science. Not only has UTSA recently been authorized to offer a Ph.D. program in biology, but the institution prepares a considerable large percentage of Hispanic students for careers in science. Modernization of the facility is essential for the department's expanding biological research and research training programs, including the preparation of minority scientists for the scientific challenges of the 21st century.",
