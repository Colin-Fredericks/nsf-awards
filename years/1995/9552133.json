 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides computer majors a hands-on systems  development environment for learning how quality application  systems are developed rapidly.   Through this project, a systems  development laboratory, equipped with computer-aided software  engineering (CASE) tools, object tools, project management and  estimation tools, and a Lotus Notes groupware environment on  sixteen networked workstations, is being established.   The  workstations are configured with these systems development tools  that information systems professionals use for the construction and  maintenance of application systems.  Two systems courses, titled  Systems Analysis and Design I and II, use the new laboratory.    Also, this lab is becoming an integral part of the database  management course and a course on object technology that is  expected to be added to the CIS curriculum.   In the first systems  course, students learn an integrated CASE tool that supports  process modeling, data modeling, and event modeling.   In the  second course, the focus is on building an application from start  to finish using James Martin's RAD (Rapid Applications Development)  methodology.   RAD requires a computer-supported room to conduct  JRP (Joint Requirements Planning) and JAD (Joint Application  Design) sessions, an integrated CASE tool that automatically  generates code from design specifications, and a networked  environment that facilitates teamwork.   Through these realistic  development experiences, students gain the skills and knowledge  that is usually acquired through working in a matured software  development environment.",
