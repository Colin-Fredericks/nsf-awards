The program will have participation  of staff from the College for Human Resources Development, the  Center for Teaching and Learning, the School of Engineering and  Mines, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School, and  Native American Programs.  The project is designed to increase  the awareness of parents, school personnel, college faculty, and  students of the educational and career options in math and  science open to Native American students with disabilities.   Efforts will be made to enhance the curriculum, teaching  strategies, hands-on and culturally-appropriate experiences, and  counseling options for these students.  Computers, the necessary  adaptive equipment, and training in their use will be made  available to the students.  The project will increase the team  building and liaisons among school personnel, college faculty,  parents, and professionals in math, science and engineering.   This interaction should result in permanent changes to the  infrastructure of the school system and the curriculum and  opportunities open to the students.  The project will involve a  summer institute for school personnel, parents, faculty, and  mentor/role models and two institutes involving these persons and  30 fourth and fifth grade disabled Native American students from  schools on or near reservations.  A hands-on, culturally  appropriate project will be designed and implemented in each  participating school.***",
