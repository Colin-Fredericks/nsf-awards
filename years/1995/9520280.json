 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520280  Azizinamini  Composite construction consisting of  concrete filled tube (CFT) columns with  relatively thin-walled steel tubes, has  been used in building construction in  U.S. and Far East.  In general, in this  type of construction, steel beams are  framed to these columns at each floor  level.  Detail and design criteria for  connecting steel beams to CFT columns  are almost non existent.    The overall objectives of this project  are to develop an economical connection  detail for connecting steel beams to CFT  columns and provide accompanying design  provisions.  The focus of this  investigation is to develop the Fully  Restrained (FR) type steel connection  detail for CFT columns for buildings  ranging from 10 to 20 stories high and  for seismic performance categories D and  E defined per \"NEHRP Recommended  Provisions for the Development of  Seismic Regulations for New Buildings\".    The connection detail to be selected and  design provisions to be developed will  give consideration to the following  issues: a) level of ductility, b)  economy and constructability, c)  avoiding over stressing the steel shell  portion of the CFI columns, d)  preventing damage to the joint region of  the column by moving the location of the  plastic hinge to some safe distance away  from the column face, e) taking  advantage of composite action between  the concrete slab and the steel beam.    At least two structural configurations  will be investigated.  static and  dynamic linear and inelastic analyses  considering different ground motions  will be conducted to establish a level  of ductility required for the  connection.  Both finite element  analysis and experimental study will be  carried out to develop the connection  detail and design provisions.  Results  of this research should fulfill this  technology gap and expedite acceptance  of composite structures in construction  industry.    This is a project supported under NSF 94-  154 a CIS Solicitation \"Research on  Composite and Hybrid Structu res\".",
