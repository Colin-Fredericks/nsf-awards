 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521618  GREEN    A continuous flow analyzer powered by osmotic pumps has been  developed to monitor nitrate concentrations while submerged in  freshwater or seawater. Osmotic pumps driven by a NaCl gradient  propel both sample and reagents through a miniature continuous flow  manifold.  The analyzer operates with sample and reagent flow rates  of about 8.0 and 0.7 ml per month, respectively, shows a linear  response from 0 to 20 micromolar nitrate with a detection limit of  0.1 micromoles, and has a 90% response time of approximately 30  minutes.  The analyzer automatically standardizes itself by  correcting for baseline and sensitivity drift by periodically   injecting and analyzing known standard solutions.  The system has  operated continuously for month-long periods in freshwater and  seawater, and can be adapted to a variety of colorimetric analyses.   The research supported here will take this demonstrated technology  and develop the chemistries to analyze for a variety of trace  metals (i.e., iron, zinc, cadmium, copper and manganese), as well  as other macro-nutrients (i.e., silica and phosphate). Potential  applications for such analyzers include oceanographic studies as  well as environmental monitoring and industrial process control.",
