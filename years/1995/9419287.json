This proposal  is concerned with the characterization of the  novel protein  transport machinery found in chloroplast thylakoids which is  unique in that translocation is driven only by a pH  gradient. Because proteins targeted to the thylakoid lumen  are synthesized outside the chloroplast in the cytosol,  there are two membrane systems which much be passed, the  outer double membrane system and the the thylakoid membrane  itself.  The signal which targets the proteins past the  outer double membrane system is cleaved from the protein,  revealing the second part of the signal peptide which then  interacts with the thylakoid protein transport machinery, or  translocase.  The objectives of the proposal are to purify the  translocase,  identify the pore complex associated with the  translocase, assess  the use of this pore by proteins which  can use other translocases not driven solely by a pH  gradient and vice versa,  determine the location of the  machinery on the thylakoid membrane system, and explore the  possibility that such translocases might occur in E. coli.  %%%  Contemporary signal peptide-based transport systems have  evolved from an archetypal mechanism.  Yet each system has  unique methods for targeting, initial insertion, and chain  translocation, which are reflected by specific components  and translocation requirements.  In this context, it is  expected that one thylakoid system, with its singular  dependence on a pH gradient, has evolved a simpler, possibly  more efficient mechanism for translocation.  Results of this  study should provide insight into the mechanism of pH  gradient-driven translocation mechanisms.  It will also  provide tools to explore the relationship between envelope  and thylakoids during the early developmental stages of  thylakoid forma tion.  The work proposed will have impact on  our knowledge of the mechnanism and evolution of protein  translocation across membranes in general.  ***",
