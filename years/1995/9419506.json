 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419506  Sethna  Collective behavior emerging on long length scales will be  explored in three systems.  First, the investigator will  study disorder-induced nucleation of bursts associated with  certain hysteresis loops and investigate innovative  applications to magnetic recording which result.  Second,  the dynamics of large, mobile voids will be studied  analytically and using realistic simulations of bulk  aluminum and copper.  This work will help understand failure  present in microfabricated devices with high current  densities.  Third, chaotic states in two-dimensional systems  described by partial differential equations whose  topological defects move in a chaotic, turbulent manner will  be studied.  More general coarse-graining methods will be  used to investigate phase transitions and the effects of  boundaries, and to understand the nature of noise in these  systems.  %%%  For many systems, even though the underlying physics of the  interactions of the individual particles is complex, on a  large scale rather simple laws can often be found.  Three  examples of such systems that are forced to be far from  equilibrium will be investigated theoretically.  First,  certain systems, such as magnets, behave differently  depending on whether a parameter (such as an external  magnetic field) is increased or decreased.  Such systems  will be investigated and these results will be applied to  magnetic recording.  Second, the movement of voids (pockets  of air) in materials such as aluminum and copper will be  investigated using equations and computer simulations, with  a goal to better understand failure in microfabricated  devices with high currents flowing through them.  Third, the  behavior of chaotic noise and defects will be investigated  in certain classes of two-dimensional systems, such as  fluids that are forced to flow and heart muscle walls.  ***",
