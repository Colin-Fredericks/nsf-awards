 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the rhythmic coordination between two  limbs in patterns that are exhibited by humans in simple (e.g.,  two limbs moving at one tempo), moderately complex (e.g., one  limb moving at twice the frequency of another), and very complex  (e.g., 7-ball juggling) activities.  Its objective is twofold,  (1) to identify general (dynamical) principles that govern the  stability and variability of rhythmic interlimb coordinations,  and (2) to understand how these principles apply in coordinating  the limbs with respect to objects and other environmental  influences.  Four classes of experiments will use two tasks,  swinging hand-held pendulums and cascade juggling.  The  experiments will manipulate the phase relation between the limbs  (e.g., moving in the same or opposite directions), the  frequencies at which they oscillate together when coordinated,  and the frequencies at which they tend to oscillate when not  coordinated.  Spatial and temporal features of the environmental  information constraining the rhythmic patterns will also be  varied.  Computerized motion recorders will analyze movement  patterns in three dimensions, and theory and methods of nonlinear  dynamics will be used to address them.  The types of rhythmic interlimb coordination patterns under study  are common and basic to very many everyday activities, as  seemingly nondescript as walking and as skilled as playing a  musical instrument.  The behavioral simplicity of the basic  coordination pattern is deceptive; its understanding requires  that we use recent advances in a branch of physics to identify  lawful regularities within which cognitive (psychological)  constraints on movement can be defined nonarbitrarily.  This  so-called dynamical perspective promises a richer set of  constraints on modeling what the brain has to do in order that  coordinated rhythmic movements in general and locomotion in  particular can be executed.  It should also provide new  hypotheses about the causes of movement disorders as well as  ideas for designing prosthetic and robotic limbs.",
