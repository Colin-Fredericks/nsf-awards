 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Amy Mullin of Boston University is supported by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division with a Research   Planning Grant to study the collisional and reactive dynamics of highly   vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules.  These species will be   prepared by ultraviolet laser excitation followed by rapid internal   conversion to high vibrational levels of the ground electronic state.    Preliminary studies will concentrate on energy transfer between   vibrationally excited pyrazine or pyridine with carbon dioxide and water.    Product state distributions and absolute cross sections will be   measured.  Ultimately, experiments will be conducted to investigate the   ability of high levels of internal excitation to drive otherwise   unreactive systems over an activation barrier.   Most chemical reactions take place on the ground electronic states of the   reactants.  Large activation barriers can prevent reactions from taking   place, even when the systems are at elevated temperatures.  In this   project, Professor Mullin will use laser excitation to populate high   vibrational levels of these molecules, corresponding to vibrational   temperatures of 3000K, a temperature which would normally decompose the   molecule.   This method of preparation allows a large amount of energy to   be present in the reactant without decomposing it and enhances the   reaction by providing enough energy to overcome the activation barrier.",
