 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455719  Hadlock                              Through the sponsorship of the Mathematical Sciences Department,  Bentley College has recently developed a new interdisciplinary  course entitled \"Modeling Applications in Environmental  Management.\" This course serves a wide range of students and has a  dual objective: to teach them about the complex range of everyday  environmental issues that are faced by business and governmental  organizations, and to give the students first hand experience in  the key role that mathematical modeling plays in dealing with these  issues. The course has a significant field component that includes  visits to operating companies and government installations.   The purpose of this grant application is to develop textbook  materials and teaching guidance that would enable a wide range of  teachers primarily at the college level, but also at the high  school level, to incorporate some or all of the same material in  offerings at their own institutions. The course developer has spent  many years in industry applying mathematical models to  environmental problems and is in a unique position to develop and  organize such materials for use in the classroom.   In fact, this course has already attracted considerable attention  outside the College, and many invitations have been received to  speak about the course itself and to provide further material that  might make it possible for others to teach this subject matter.  Thus the purpose of this proposal is to provide support for the  development of high quality materials to support the inclusion of  this material in courses at various levels and at various kinds of  institutions, to train a pilot group of teachers in its use, and to  initiate and promote the further dissemination process through the  academic community.",
