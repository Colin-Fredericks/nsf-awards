 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554556  Peters  The Departments of Chemical and  Mechanical Engineering at the  University of South Carolina will  establish an interdisciplinary  traineeship program focusing on the  reduction, recycle, or elimination  of hazardous solvents in  manufacturing processes. This  program in Environmentally  Conscious Manufacturing addresses  an issue which is of great  importance across the manufacturing  spectrum, and which affects both  large and small industries. The  program includes significant  interaction with small businesses  in the State of South Carolina, as  well as support from the State  Department of Environmental  Control. In addition, close  collaboration with large companies  such as AlliedSignal, AT&T, and  Westvaco ensures that trainees will  receive a broad exposure to  fundamental and applied problems  facing industry.  Trainees will perform research in  one of three broad areas: pressure  swing adsorption for solvent  recovery and recycle; supercritical  fluid technology for solvent  substitution and process  modification; or modeling of  solvent-intensive manufacturing  processes (including adsorption and  supercritical fluid technologies)  for life cycle analysis and  environmental design. The modeling  effort in particular is designed to  hasten the transfer of results of  academic research to industry,  including small businesses.  Trainees will receive mentoring  form outstanding academic scholars,  as well as from industrial mentors.  Some will have internships in  domestic industries, while others  may apprentice with AT&T Global  Information Systems in Germany  under an arrangement developed for  this traineeship program. These  trainees will also be given  instruction in classroom teaching.",
