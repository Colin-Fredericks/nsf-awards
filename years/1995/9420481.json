 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420481  Warr    This three-year award will support U.S.-Sweden-Estonia cooperative  research in immunology.  The investigators are Gregory Warr of the  Medical University of South Carolina, Lars Pilstrom of Uppsala  University in Sweden, and Sirje Timmusk of the Estonian Marine  Institute.  The objective of their research is the study of antibody gene  expression in transgenic rainbow trout.  They propose single cell  studies of the following:   (1) channel catfish immunoglobulin  enhancer in tissue-specific gene expression in rainbow trout; (2)  impact of transgenic expression of the endogenous immunoglobulin  genes of rainbow trout; and (3) functional chimeric antibodies in  transgenic rainbow trout.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise with in  vitro studies of gene expression and catfish immunoglobulin genes  and enhancers.  This is complemented by the Swedish and Estonian  investigators' experience in growing transgenic trout and expertise  with in vivo transgenic studies of immunoglobulin expression. The  transgenic fish are grown and maintained at the Estonian Marine  Institute.  The project will determine whether the catfish heavy chain  gene can be expressed and if so can it assist with the formation of a  functional antibody in rainbow trout.  The project will advance our  understanding of the immune system and comparative immunology.  It also has potentially important commercial applications if transgenic  fish with desired traits can be raised.  ***",
