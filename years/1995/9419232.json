 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  This award supports a collaborative study of Quaternary glacial  marine deposits of the Larsen Basin.  These sedimentary deposits  are uniquely suited for study of the Modern environmental setting  and recent paleoclimatic evolution of the northeastern Antarctic  Peninsula continental shelf, an area thought to exhibit  pronounced sensitivity to climatic changes. Microfossils from  these deposits and their stable isotope compositions provide  information on varying oceanographic conditions, ice mass extent,  and sediment dispersal. Questions to be answered include:  1)  What are the faunal and isotopic responses to glaciation,  both proximal and distal to the variety of small and medium ice  masses in the area?  2)  What is the relationship between physical evidence of ice  position, as expressed in sediments and seismic data, and the  faunal and isotopic signatures thereof?  3)  To what extent is an environmental model of the highly  variable interglacial Modern shelf applicable to describing and  understanding late Quaternary environments representative of  different climatic regimes? Preliminary results of a pilot study  using surface and cored sediments indicate that foraminiferal  assemblage composition and stable isotope ratios record highly  variable Modern and late Quaternary environmental conditions.  However, data are needed from a larger number of cores to  reconstruct the Antarctic Peninsula late Quaternary environmental  history. Methods to be employed in this research are  foraminiferal and palynological analyses, foraminiferal carbon  and oxygen isotope ratios, and carbon-14 measurements.       The primary research objectives of the proposed one-year  project are as follows:  1) Provide the first study for the Antarctic Margin Project for  drilling in shallow water depths offshore of Seymour Island.  The  proposed work would serve to provide a sound environmental  framework of the Quaternary deposits from which to interpret the  Cenozoic record; 2) Establish the first Qua ternary stable isotope  chronostratigraphy for Antarctic continental shelf sediments;  3) Document and interpret Quaternary climatic fluctuations,  including proposed Holocene warming episodes, as they are  preserved in the sediments, biota, and stable isotopic records,  and reflect variations in local and regional ice buildup,  physical and chemical oceanography, and sediment source areas.  This research represents an important contribution to  international global change studies.",
