 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506878  Reeves  The HMG-I(Y) family of \"high mobility group\" (HMG) nonhistone proteins are of considerable current interest because they are founding members of a newly described category of nuclear proteins called \"architectural transcription factors\" that appear to be involved in the in vivo regulation of both the chromatin structure and the transcriptional activity of an increasing large group of mammalian genes.  However, the HMG-I(Y) proteins are distinguished from other HMG proteins in this category of factors by their ability to specifically bind, both in vitro and in vivo, to A(T-rich B-form DNA by the recognition of structure rather than nucleotide sequence.  Available evidence suggests two principal, though not mutually exclusive, models of how the HMG-I(Y) proteins might function in chromatin as gene transcription regulatory proteins.  The first postulates a nucleosome positioning or \"phasing\" role for HMG-I(Y) whereby binding of the protein to DNA substrates of a particular structure(s) establishes a \"boundary\" that influences placement of adjacent nucleosomes in important areas such as certain gene distortions in substrate DNA, HMG-I(Y) facilitates the binding of transcription factors to promoter/enhancer sequences and also functions to bring together separated regulatory regions so that they can form a stereo-specific multiprotein complex necessary for transcription initiation.  This research will experimentally test specific aspect of one of these models.  We will employ care selected in vitro systems to quantitatively evaluate the role of HMG-I(Y) in both DNA-bending and in nucleosome positioning/phasing in reconstituted chromatin and will assess the effects of HMG-I(Y) on the in vitro transcriptional competence of precisely defined chromatin templates.  %%%  The HMG-I(Y) family of \"high mobility group\" (HMG) nonhistone proteins are of considerable current interest because they are founding members of a newly described category of nuclear proteins called \"architectural transcrip tion factors\" that appear to be involved in the in vivo regulation of both the chromatin structure and the transcriptional activity of an increasing large group of mammalian genes.  However, the HMG-I(Y) proteins are distinguished from other HMG proteins in this category of factors by their ability to specifically bind, both in vitro and in vivo, to A(T-rich B-form DNA by the recognition of structure rather than nucleotide sequence.  This research will address, in a precise and quantitative manner, the important question of how the HMG-I(Y) proteins might influence the structure and function of eukaryotic chromatin in vivo.  The results obtained from these in vitro studies will set the parameters for, and define the limits of, future experiments aimed at elucidating the in vivo function of these unusual and intriguing regulatory proteins.  ***",
