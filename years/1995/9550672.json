 "awd_abstract_narration": "A four-week summer science camp for minority students will be  offered over the course of three years which will meet these  objectives: a) teaches participants natural science and mathematics  topics through data collection and analysis; b) instructs students  about Alaskan Native traditional knowledge and use of the  environment; and c) introduces resource management and other  science and mathematics careers as an option for Juneau's Alaska  Native youth.    The camp is the result of a working partnership of state and  federal resource management agency personnel, the science and  mathematics faculty at the Juneau School District and the  University of Alaska Southeast, the Discovery Foundation, the  Chilkoot Culture Camp, and Earthwatch.  Innovative follow-up  activities will create a network of learners (both teachers and  students) who share the above stated goals.  The lessons we learn  from developing integrated science and mathematics curriculum and  assessment tools that are relevant for minority students and that  are based in the recently adopted Alaska Student Performance  Standards, will be applied to District curriculum throughout the  following school year for use by reeular classroom teachers.  The  camp will provide a model from which other school districts in  Alaska may benefit.  The project will address equity issues by  raising standards for mathematics and science education for all  students.",
