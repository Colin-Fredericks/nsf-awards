 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this project is to provide the  equipment necessary to prepare prospective secondary mathematics  teachers to teach effectively using technology, as recommended by  the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education  (NCATE) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics  (NCTM).  This is accomplished through the provision of the  equipment necessary to create the Mobile Mathematics Laboratory  (MML), which can be transported from school to school and set up  inside the classrooms of prospective mathematics teachers  undergoing the student teaching experience.  The equipment is  chosen so that the laboratory can be set up quickly using the  existing furniture, no retrofitting of the classroom is required,  and no wires are running across the room.       Because prospective mathematics teachers will need to be  familiar with using the machines in the MML and will need to be  taught mathematics using computers, the Advanced Mathematical  Laboratory (AML) is also being created.  The AML, which is used  to teach computer-intensive mathematics, will be stocked in  virtually the same arrangement as the MML because using these  machines prepares the prospective mathematics teachers for using  the MML and the absence of wires and the low profile and small  footprints of the notebook computers are very desirable.",
