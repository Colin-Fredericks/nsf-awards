 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413480  Likkel    The near-infrared spectra of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) will be studied in  order to characterize them in terms of electromagnetic emission  processes.  This research is especially timely because it involves  infrared wavelength observations which were not possible until  recently.  The initial observations of the project will be pursued by  using the infrared camera, GRIM-II, on the 3.5m telescope at Apache  Point Observatory in New Mexico.  The Washington State University  Program in Astronomy has access to this telescope and has the  facilities to reduce the data from the observations.    A major thrust of this project is to understand what effect emission  lines, etc, have on the infrared wavelength bands ,J, H, and K,  observed using photometric detectors.  What are the various  contributions to the brightness of the observed J, H, and K infrared  wavelength bands?   By answering this question, J, H, and K colors of  PNe can be interpreted more accurately.      Trends and correlations between the morphology, excitation,  composition, and other characteristics of the PNe, will be identified  so that the results can be generalized to other nebulae. The results of  the research will provide useful information that will benefit  astronomers studying PNe.  The results will also be useful to  researchers studying similar objects, such as symbiotic stars, BE type  stars, and ultra-compact ionized Hydrogen (HII) regions. Useful and  interesting results of the research will provide a basis on which a  more extensive project may be planned.",
