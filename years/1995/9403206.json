 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403206  Emslie       The project will develop a chronology of avian extinctions for  the Plio-Pleistocene of Florida using the exceptional fossil record  of birds from this region.  Dozens of published and unpublished  late Pliocene to late Pleistocene (Blancan through Rancholabrean  Land Mammal Ages, 2.4-0.010 Ma) localities that include over 100  taxa of birds provide an excellent database from which to establish  this chronology.  These avifaunas are located throughout Florida,  represent a diversity of depositional environments and provide  substantial information on the structure of terrestrial, wetland  and coastal/marine communities throughout this period.       This chronology will be supplemented with identification and  description of seven additional avifaunas that will add at least 10  undescribed extinct taxa to the fossil record of Florida.  Limited  fieldwork at selected sites and newly discovered localities will be  completed to determine their age, recover additional fossil  material and collect paleoenvironmental data using paleomagnetic,  strontium isotope, radiocarbon and palynologic sampling.       Avian extinction in the Plio-Pleistocene will be investigated  using FAUNMAP, a GIS-based computer program,, and digitized land  cover maps of Florida, to reconstruct avian distributions and  habitats for specific time intervals.  Paleoenvironmental  information will be drawn from geological, paleontological and  palynological data from over 50 vertebrate localities.  The maps  generated from this program will be compared with the avian  chronology to develop and test hypotheses on avian extinctions and  climatic change.       This research will be completed over a two year period in  collaboration with a geologist and paynologist.  It will provide a  thorough documentation of Plio-Pleistocene avian diversity and  extinction in one geographic region of North America and will be  the first application of the FAUNMAP system with fossil birds.   Results of this investigation will be  applicable to current global  warming and its potential impact on vertebrate communities.",
