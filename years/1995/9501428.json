 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Cindy Samet of the Chemistry Department of Dickinson   College will engage in a study of the hydrogen bonding in   hydrocarbon-base complexes in the condensed phase.  The goal of the work   is to investigate the C-H hydrogen bonding and its dependence on the   hybridization of the s and p orbitals of the carbon, and on the presence   of electron withdrawing constituents.  The principal technique for   carrying out this work is matrix isolation Fourier transform   spectroscopy.  This research project will also enhance the research   opportunities for undergraduate students at Dickinson College.  This project represents the debut of a young woman faculty member as an   independent research scientist.  Hydrogen bonding represents an    interaction between strongly bound molecules which form a weakly bound   complex.  The linking agent is a hydrogen atom proton of one molecule,   the proton donor, which forms a weak bond with the partner, the proton   acceptor molecule.  Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in the   structure and bonding of organic materials, including those of biological   importance.  The initial studies of this research will be followed up   with work on larger systems such as organic crystals and large   biomolecules.  The chemistry curriculum of Dickinson College has recently   been revised and now contains research as a requirement for chemistry   majors.  This project will strengthen the undergraduate chemistry   curriculum and thereby contribute to an improved education of the next   generation of scientists.",
