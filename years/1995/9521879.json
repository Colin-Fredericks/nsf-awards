 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521879  BROOKS   The Middle Stone Age is a period when anatomically modern   humans replaced more archaic forms.  Recent research findings in   Africa have shown that economic activities of humans in this time   may also have been associated with crucial behavioral changes.    Excavation of Middle Stone Age sites is limited, however, and   long sequences with good faunal preservation are rare.  This   project will continue work by an interdisciplinary team of   archeologists, paleontologists, geologists, and geochemists at   Middle Stone Age and Acheulean sites in the Aduma-Bouri regions   of the Middle Awash Valley of Ethiopia.  Continued excavations   will focus on evidence of human economic activities in   association with fossil lake shores and deltaic deposits.    Parallel work will continue on the relatively little-known Middle   Stone Age industries of the Aduma region and the later Acheulan   sites at Bouri in order to establish a chronological and   paleoenvironmental relationship between the sequences of these   two regions.  Research will include stratigraphic,   paleolandscape, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the   Aduma region and establishment of an absolute chronology using   several techniques.  The project will be coordinated with the   work of a team led by T.D. White that is working sites about   30 km to the north.   This project will continue what already has been a   productive network of sites in central Ethiopia.  The excellent   preservation of materials has generated new insights into the   evolution of marine-related industries.  Of special significance   is the potential to gain new insights into the behavior   transformation of early humans from independent actors into   communal entities who work together and employ relatively   sophisticated tools.",
