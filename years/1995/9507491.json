 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507491  Dalton  The proposed work deals with the relation between biological  nitrogen fixation and defenses against active forms of  oxygen such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide.  Nitrogen-  fixing systems, such as legume root nodules and  cyanobacteria, are at high risk from active (partially  reduced) forms of oxygen due to the strong reducing  conditions required to reduce dinitrogen to ammonia.  A  major source of free radicals in nodules is leghemoglobin,  an extremely abundant protein in nodues with the unfortunate  tendency to autoxidize and release superoxide and hydrogen  peroxide.  Defense against active oxygen in legume nodules  and in some cyanobacteria is provided by a series of coupled  reduction-oxidation reactions involving ascorbate  peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate  reductase, and glutathione reductase.  This pathway  effectively removes hydrogen peroide from the cytosol.  A  major objective of this work is to determine the extent to  which ascorbate-glutathione pathway is essential for the  process of nitrogen fixation.  This will be examined by  constructing transgenic plants that are antisense for  ascorbate peroxidase.  Nodules of these plants will be  examined on molecular and physiological levels to determine  the effects of impaired peroxide scavenging.  In addition,  an in vitro system containing functional bacteroids,  leghemoglobin and the components of the ascorbate-  glutathione pathway will be constructed.  Criticality of  this pathway will be investigated by examining the  consequences of omission of various components such as  ascorbate, glutathione or the individual enzymes.  The role  of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway in cyanobacteria  cultured under various nitrogen and light regimes will also  be examined in hopes of developing a flexible prokaryotic  system for genetic manipulations.  Finally, nodule oximetry  will be used to investigate the role of the ascorbate-  gluthathione pathway vis-a-vis the variable oxygen diffusi on  barrier in antisense and wild type legume root nodules.  Since nitrogen fixation is oxygen-limited, an increased  understanding of oxygen defense processes could facilitate  long range goals of improving nitrogen fixation by  increasing the oxygen supply.",
