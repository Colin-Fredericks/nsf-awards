 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, is a continuation of efforts in laboratory automation and  robotics. Professor Frank A. Settle and his students at the  Virginia Military Institute have designed a fully automated system  for the colorimetric analysis of ortho-phosphate. They will expand  this system to incorporate the analysis of transition metal  analytes using automated flow injection analysis (FIA). Selected  metal analytes will be treated with a chelating reagent to form a  highly colored water insoluble dithiozone derivative whose  absorbance is proportional to the metal analyte concentration.  Prof. Settle will use surfactant chemistry to solubilize the  reaction products and eliminate the need for solvent extraction. A  full laboratory information management  system (LIMS) will be  developed for this assay, which incorporate the use of a Zymark  BenchMate robot for sample handling and reagent preparation.  Professors Settle and Sienerth will supervise a 10 week summer  research experience for undergraduate students, in addition to  supervising selected research students during the academic year.  These students will be trained in quality control and method  validation procedures, computer interfacing and programming,  software development, and analytical instrumentation and chemical  methods.   An active laboratory information management system (LIMS) has been  developed for control of two independent automated procedures for  the colorimetric analysis of metal analytes. This system  incorporates facilities for control of a Zymark robot for reagent  and sample preparation, validation and calibration of the equipment  and methods using `Good Automated Laboratory Practice` guidelines,  and data storage, manipulation, and final report presentation.  The  research program described will provide a rich training ground for  undergraduate students and provide them with the laboratory and  computer skills demanded in `real world` industrial applications.",
