 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554521  Ulman  We are proposing a Graduate  Research Traineeship Program in Optical Science and  Engineering, in two strategic areas: materials for  photonics, and for information  storage applications. The Office of Science and Technology  Policy has emphasized that materials synthesis and  processing are critical technologies. Also, the U.S. Army  and Air Force are supporting  research in optical science and technology, especially in  the two strategic areas proposed here. The trainees in this  program will  develop new materials for photonics applications and for  digital image storage. Their research will be carried out at  four levels: *  Design and investigations of molecules;* Design and  investigations of polymers;* Processing of polymers;* Device  fabrication; Students will be  involved in all research facets,  and will interact with a number of faculty, and enjoy a  stimulating interdisciplinary research environment.  Theoretical work will  be carried out in collaboration  with Professor Shaul Mukamel at the University of Rochester.  Investigations of Langmuir-Blodgett films will be carried  out at the  NSF Center for Photoinduced  Electron Transfer, at the  University of Rochester, in collaboration with Professor  David Whitten. The trainees in this  program could enter a PhD track in the Chemistry or Chemical  Engineering Department at the Polytechnic University, and  would  be drawn from Chemistry and/or Chemical Engineering. The  goals of  the nonlinear optics part of  program have been defined together with Dr. David Williams  of Eastman Kodak Company, and training opportunities for the  trainees at Kodak Research Laboratories,  through summer employment, are now being discussed. Also  included in  this program are high school and undergraduate mentoring.  Plans for recruiting trainees will emphasize  underrepresented groups. Five  students would be recruited for  these traineeships and would  complete their PhD programs in 5  years or less.",
