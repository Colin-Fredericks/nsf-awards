 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506556  Shieh    This award provides funding for the establishment of a multi-  university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on  Electronic Materials, Devices, and Systems between the Center for  Advanced Electron Devices and Systems at the University of Texas  - Arlington and the Electronic Devices and Materials Group at  Texas A&M University.      The research activities of these two sites are complimentary and  this operation will enable the Center to expand its research  activities and enrich their industrial membership base.  This  consolidated Center has expertise in bulk single and thin film  growth, characterization and process modeling of electronic  materials, Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), and Pulsed Laser  Deposition (PLD) for the production of multi-layer and  heterostructure devices, rapid thermal processing, fabrication,  and evaluation of devices (fiber-optics sensors, integrated  optics, semiconductor lasers, microwave and millimeter wave  circuits and devices, superconductor devices, ferroelectric  devices, and optical instrumentation), device modeling and  simulation.    The University of Texas - Arlington will coordinate the  activities between these two research sites during the first two  years of operation.  The continuation of this coordination  responsibility will be reviewed and discussed by the Industry  Advisory board at the end of the second year.    The Principal Investigators have worked collaboratively in  developing this multi-university Center.  They have excellent  background and the experiences necessary to carry out the  proposed plan.  The universities have also shown strong  commitment in supporting this multi-university Center.    This proposal has been coordinated with Dr. Marvin White, Program  Director, Division of Electrical and Communications Systems.    The Program Director recommends the University of Texas -  Arlington be awarded $40,000 for the first year of a five-year  continuing award. ($25,000 for regular support, $10,000 for  the  administrative support, and $5,000 for the evaluator).                                                                       Page 2    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Director and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education and Centers  Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of  renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which a collaborative, robust research program is  developing; and 3) the extent to which the support base is  developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the Program Director  will recommend support for the next period of this continuing  award.     Jay Lee  Program Director, I/UCRC",
