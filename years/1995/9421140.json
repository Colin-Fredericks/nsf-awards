 "awd_abstract_narration": "Waselkov    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Waselkov and his  colleagues will study the growth patterns in Eastern oysters  (Crassostrea virginica) to determine the relationship between  growth and seasonal changes in water temperature. The goal of the  work is to determine whether analysis of oyster shells will  permit determination of the season when the oyster was collected.  Preliminary evidence indicates that such an approach is possible  in temperate waters where significant seasonal variation in  temperature occurs. It is less clear whether the same pattern  holds in warmer areas such as the Gulf of Mexico. The  investigators will examine oyster growth from two locations,  Alabama and Maryland, with several methods. Oysters will be  marked and grown under known conditions for two years before  being harvested. Temperature will be electronically logged. Both  wild and hatched spawned oysters (of known) age and will be  stained with tetracycline in a sequence that will allow spatio-  temporal identification of growth patterns throughout the annual  cycle. Analytic methods will include traditional optical  micrometry, digital image analysis with time series analysis and  use of a scanning proton microprobe.    The successful development of this technique will have important  archaeological implications. Oysters formed a major dietary item  in many areas of prehistoric North America and are widely found  in archaeological sites where they are well preserved. Scientists  wish to understand how prehistoric peoples with simple  technologies subsisted in a wide range of environments and made  use of available natural resources. To do this, they attempt to  determine the seasons and length of time individual sites were  occupied. This can be extremely difficult to do and the proposed  oyster shell study will, hopefully, provide a technique to  accomplish this.",
