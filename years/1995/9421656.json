 "awd_abstract_narration": "In  modeling scientific discovery.  Over the last several  years,  this  group has developed several computer programs that automate  important  aspects of scientific discovery in biology, chemistry,  physics,  and  also  general  experimental  science.   They  have  identified promising discovery tasks by studying primary  sources  such  as  scientific  articles, talking with  a  broad  array  of  scientists,  and  even  doing  \"field  work\"  in  some   science.  Automation methods have  included the concepts and techniques  of  heuristic   search,  of  algorithms  and  optimization,   and   a  elementary  mathematics  and  statistics.   Concrete  results  in  various fields back up the hypothesis that a significant fraction  of  scientific  inference  can be  automated  today.   There  is,  however,   the  hypothesis  that  mush  of  scientific  inference  consists of generic tasks that are quite specific, but that -  in  their  computational essence - are common to  multiple  sciences.  The  concept  of  generic scientific task is a new  way  to  view  computing in biology, computational  chemistry, and so on.   This  research  explore  the concept of \"generic  scientific  task\"  by  investigating  whether  it leads to practical  results  (powerful  discovery tools for scientists), and how this can provide a  more  systematic understanding os scientific inference.",
