 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503535  Steinfink    This award provides partial support of the purchase of a state-of-  the-art high resolution powder x-ray diffractometer.  The primary  users will be faculty, graduate students, research associates,  and post-doctoral students at the University of Texas at Austin.  The instrument has been chosen with accessories to meet the  specific needs of the research requirements of the user group.  The instrument will have at least a 4KW generator to produce a  high-intensity x-ray source from a sealed-off x-ray tube.  The  goniometer will be based on a theta/theta geometry with a Peltier  cooled solid state detector.  A variable goniometer radius will  permit an ultimate peak resolution of 0.025  2, especially  important in data collection for Rietveld structure refinement.  It will be equipped with a 486/66 or better computer with  software analysis capabilities equivalent to or better than those  sold by Materials Data Inc. (MDI).  The instrument will be  equipped with high and low temperature stages in which the  atmosphere can be controlled.  A thin film attachment will be  part of the system.  This equipment will be situated in an  existing laboratory that has the required space and utilities.  %%%  Several research topics that require a state-of-the-art powder  diffractometer will be pursued.  Its use will be heavily devoted  to the investigation of phase transitions in oxides and  chalcogenides as a function of temperature and atmosphere, to the  study of thin films especially for photocatalytic applications,  and the collection of data for crystal structure refinement by  the Rietveld technique.  These projects are supported by a  variety of public and private sources.  It is expected that these  procedures will constitute the major time allocation for this  instrument.  In addition to the furtherance of research projects,  the presence of this equipment in the Materials Science and  Engineering Laboratories will provide training of graduate  students in techniques of importan ce in materials science, an  area that is increasingly recognized as indispensable if this  country is to maintain competitiveness and leadership in the Age  of Materials.  ***",
