This state-of-the-art  spectrometer system will become a key instrument in the currently  forming new initiative, National Science Foundation Industry  University Cooperative Coatings Research Center and the Materials  Science Program at North Dakota State University.  The  spectrometer system will introduce systemic changes, providing  opportunities for new research and educational directions at  NDSU, and will serve as an inter-college and interdepartmental  unit housed in the Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory Cluster in  the Polymers and Coatings Department.  This spectrometer system  is requested by the inter-disciplinary group of researchers from  three colleges on NDSU campus, Science and Mathematics,  Engineering, and Pharmacy, appointed in the Departments of  Polymers and Coatings, Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Mechanical  Engineering.  Included in the equipment is the hardware necessary  for implementing the system and all necessary software and  licenses for the system to be brought into service.",
