 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University (OSU) asks assistance to obtain a  field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with an  integrated x-ray energy spectrometer (XES) to replace an  obsolete, deteriorated 18-year-old scanning electron  microscope/x-ray energy spectrometer (SEM/XES) system. Our  present system, the only instrument of this type at OSU, was  built in 1976 and was purchased in used condition in 1981.  OSU has taken over 30,000 micrographs and logged in excess  of 6000 beam hours with this SEM. In 1993-94 , 165 campus  researchers from 24 departments in nine colleges used the  Electron Microscope Facility at OSU; the facility is managed  by the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology.    Diverse and high quality research by OSU faculty members  requires a SEM with the greater resolution, broader  versatility, and better reliability available in a modern  FESEM. Amongst the many users are six investigators, three  each from the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology and  the Department of Zoology, that would be primary  beneficiaries of this instrument; each of these individuals  currently have research projects supported by NSF.    Dr. Philip Brownell's research is on sensory neurobiology of  arthropods and focuses on cuticular sense organs and the  correlation of fine structure with sensory function. Dr.  Aaron Liston uses herbarium specimens for comparative  examination of morphological features to compare plant  species. Dr. Terri Lomax's research centers on understanding  the regulation of plant growth and development at the level  of cellular responses to hormonal and environmental signals.  Dr. Robert Mason studies the reproductive biology and  chemical ecology of reptiles. Dr. Carol Rivin's research  focuses on activities and regulation of genes essential to  embryogenesis in maize. Dr. Barbara Taylor's program  investigates intercellular communication between muscles and  their innervating nerves during adult development of fruit  flies.    In addition to the direct benefits t o these research  programs, our SEM/XES system helps in attracting faculty and  students to OSU, contributes to undergraduate and graduate  student training, and is essential to many other of OSU's  basic and applied research programs in:         human, animal, and plant health, pharmacy, and    bioengineering;       air, water, and soil ecology, pollution, and resource  development and conservation;       forest pathology, productivity, and development and  performance of wood products;       foods and nutrition;       engineering, advanced metallic, ceramic, glass, and    polymeric materials development, failure analysis, and    tribology;       botany, entomology, microbiology, zoology, chemistry,    geology, and physics.    This new field emission instrument would significantly  improve the research capability at Oregon State University.  The new capabilities for low voltage high resolution  examinations of cell and tissue surfaces allow substantial  improvements to image quality and would allow researchers to  apply this improved technology to a variety of problems.",
