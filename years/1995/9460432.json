 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to evaluate the use of One Cell Systems' microencapsulation technology in the assessment of transfected cells. The current commercial importance of genetically modified or transfected cells in the development of vaccines, diagnostics or drug delivery systems as well as the treatment of malignant, infectious and genetic diseases is well recognized. Obtaining and characterizing a pure population of transfected cells or evaluating the efficacy of different transfection methods usually requires including a drug-resistance gene and clone selection. The ability to encapsulate single cells into agarose microdrops would allow the expression of the desired protein to be measured in individual cells using automated methods such as flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This proposal is designed to determine the feasibility of using the encapsulation system to evaluate transfected cells. These initial studies will utilize two different transfected cell lines; a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO l-l5500.  ATCC CRL 9609) which secretes tissue plasminogen activator and a mouse mammary line (CSM a  b lH, ATCC CRL 8401) secreting human chorionic gonadotropin. Successful completion of these phase I studies would provide the basis for the development of a new and potentially more efficient technology for the evaluation and selection of transfected cells.",
