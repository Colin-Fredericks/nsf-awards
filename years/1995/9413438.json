 "awd_abstract_narration": "Browman    With National Science Foundation support and under the direction  of Dr. David Browman, Ms. Georgia Britt will collect data for her  doctoral dissertation. She will analyze ceramic material from the  archaeological site of Bezuapan which is located in Veracruz,  Mexico. Prior excavation of individual households has yielded  large samples of ceramics from well defined stratigraphic  contexts. All date from different intervals within the Late  Formative period. Evidence indicates that the ceramics were made  within each household. Ms. Britt will examine these materials  from a number of perspectives to determine the degree of  standardization within each ceramic type within each sample. She  will record metric as well as technical and decorative  attributes.    The underlying goal of this research is to study the relationship  between ceramic production and social organization.  Archaeologists have argued that as societies grow more complex,  the degree of economic specialization increases and the degree of  mass production increases. They have also assumed that  standardization increases as well and that degree of  standardization in ceramics and other common objects can be used  as an indirect measure of social complexity. However these  assumptions have not been carefully tested. Other kinds of  archaeological evidence indicate that the Late Formative period  in Veracruz marks a time of increased social complexity. By the  following Early Classic period a clearly divided hierarchical  society had emerged. In conjunction with other researchers who  have examined ceramics from the later period, Ms. Britt will  focus on the Late Formative to determine whether, in fact, social  complexity and ceramic standardization are related.     This research is important for several reasons. It will help to  refine a tool which is of wide archaeological use. It will also  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
