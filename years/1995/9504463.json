The   theory and methodology of such models, referred to as   extended linear models, are particularly tractable when   the models are concave; that is, when the log-likelihood   depends concavely on the unknown function or functions.   Among the class of concave extended linear models are   ordinary, logistic, probit, Poisson and other   generalized linear models, multiple logistic regression   (which is useful in multiple classification), hazard   regression (for survival analysis), and models for the   estimation of density and conditional density functions.   In the context of such models, polynomial splines and   their tensor products are natural building blocks for   constructing finite-dimensional estimates of   infinite-dimensional main effects and loworder   interactions, and the resulting ANOVA decompositions   provide an insightful tool for data analysis. In this   research, the corresponding nonadaptive theory and   closely related adaptive methodology will further be   developed and refined in a variety of settings. In   particular, an attempt will be made to establish uniform   rates of convergence first in the regression context and   then for other extended linear models, where the maximum   likelihood estimates are intrinsically nonlinear. The   theory for spectral density estimation in the context of   a stationary time series will be extended to handle   mixed spectra. The theory and methodology for survival   analysis will be extended to include time-dependent   covariates and directly to fit a flexible proportional   hazards (Cox) model without modeling the dependence of   the hazard function on time. The methodology and theory   that have already been develo ped for extended linear   models will be modified to handle neural spike train   processes that occur in neurophysiology and event   history analysis, which is commonly used in sociology   and other social sciences.      This research is part of the investigator's long-term   research program in statistics, which began two decades   ago. Prior to that time, the emphasis on statistics had   been on parametric modeling, which involves fitting   models with a fixed, finite number of unknown   parameters. At that time, the investigator joined the   small cadre of statisticians working in the field of   nonparametric modeling. A half-dozen years later, the   investigator further specialized his research program to   what essentially amounts to the synthesis of parametric   and nonparametric modeling; specifically, flexible   parametric models are employed that have increasingly   many parameters as more and more data become available.   A decade ago, the investigator began another long-term   project: teaching and simultaneously writing a textbook   for an upper-division or graduate-level first course in   probability and statistics in which the statistics   portion is presented in an innovative manner suggested  by this synthesis of parametric and nonparametric   modeling. (The textbook will be published this summer.)   This educational project, in turn, has had a catalytic   effect on the investigator's research program. Moreover,   in the direction of human resource development to   improve the civil infrastructure, the investigator has   used the positions of Teaching Assistant for the course   and Research Assistant on previous NSF grants to recruit   Ph. D. students, train them in teaching and in the   investigator's research program, and place them in   academic and industrial research positions. Recently one   such former student, who currently has a tenure-track   position at a leading American statistics department,   assisted an American software company in winning a small   SBIR contract  to create a commercial software   implementation of the state-of-the-art survival analysis   methodology that was developed by the investigator and   this and another former student. The resulting product   should prove very useful in biotechnology. Another   former student, who has a permanent position at one of   America's leading research labs, has continued a   methodological development initiated in his Ph. D.   Dissertation and successfully applied this methodology   to improve the quality of the IC manufacturing process   of the Lab's parent company. Hopefully, the   investigator's continued research and training of Ph. D.   students and his related collaborations with former Ph.   D. students will have more such worthwhile consequences.         ??",
