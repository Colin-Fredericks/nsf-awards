 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522617  Bronk      This project will study the composition, biological availability,  and rates of uptake and release of dissolved organic nitrogen in  two highly contrasting estuarine systems- the Chesapeake Bay and  Georgia coastal rivers.  These systems are vastly different with  respect to the type, source and relative liability of dissolved  organic nitrogen.  Because the Principal Investigators will conduct  their studies in conjunction with the two currently funded Land  Margin Ecosystem Research studies at the these sites, the results  will greatly enhance the understanding of these important coastal  aquatic environments. The significance of the proposed research is  several fold.  First, in the broadcast, sense the eutrophication of  nation's coastal waters and estuaries is a well recognized problem,  yet we have little knowledge of the contribution and importance of  organic nitrogen to this problem. Second, with the advent of new  techniques, these studies will yield and appreciation of the  mechanisms by which both bacteria and phytoplankton obtain their  nitrogenous nitrogen will aid our ability to balance and control  the flow of nitrogen through estuarine and coastal systems.",
