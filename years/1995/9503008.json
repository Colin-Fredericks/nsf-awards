Closing and opening phenomena are abundant in  physiological tree structures, with examples including the  respiratory tree or different parts of the circulatory system.  This project proposes to: 1) develop experimental techniques to  measure spatial correlations on the lung surface during opening,  2) monitor the opening process in response to various stimuli, 3)  develop new models of how avalanches propagate in tree  structures, 4) introduce novel statistical approaches to reveal  power law distributions and long-range correlations and apply  them to measured and simulated data, 5) provide, through  intensive simulations, substantial new insight into a variety of  physiological phenomena encountered in the respiratory and  circulatory trees.  A long term goal is to understand how the  high level of organization implied by the power law distributions  and long-range correlations govern the statistical and  physiological behavior of closing and opening process in tree  structures that are fundamental to their natural function.    The work carried out as described is expected to produce  fundamental knowledge in the field of physiological modeling, and  lead to new discoveries.  ***",
