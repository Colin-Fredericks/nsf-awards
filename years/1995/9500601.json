 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500601  Ducklow         This is a joint research project by Drs. F Azam H.  Ducklow to perform quantitative studies on the significance  of bacteria in mediating and regulating biogeochemical  fluxes of carbon and nitrogen in the Arabian Sea, as a  component of the USJGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study.  These  scientists will make core measurements used by bacteria to  respond to dramatic changes in primary production that  occurs regularly due to monsoonal reversals in the Arabian  Sea. The JGOFS core measurement s will include bacterial  abundance and biomass, bacteria production (by both 3H  thymidine and 3H leucine incorporation methods), DOC, POC  and PON.  The research is designed to address two key  questions concerning microbial heterotrophic processes  identified by US JGOFS: 1)  How do the community structures  which occur during the oligotrophic vs. eutrophic periods  differentially impact carbon storage and export fluxes? and  2)  Does the decomposition of sinking particles slow down in  the suboxic zone and result in enhanced vertical flux  through this layer?  The investigators hypothesize that  sequential occurrence of highly eutrophic and oligotrophic  productivity regimes creates a uniquely robust microbial  loop during the oligotrophic period at the expense of slow-  to-degrade DOM which accumulates during the eutrophic  period.  They predict that the strong dominance of the  microbial loop renders the oligotrophic period net-  heterotrophic and this has implications for spatial and  temporal patterns of carbon oxidation and exchange.  The  'stored' DOC may also support high bacterial carbon demand  (higher than would be supported by particle flux) below the  mixed layer following shoaling of the pycnocline.  A second  hypothesis they wish to test is that sinking particles in  the surface waters are rapidly solubilized by hydrolytic  exoenzymes of colonizing bacteria but the enzymatic  solubilization is greatly reduced in the suboxic layer  resulting in much slower depth dissipat ion of POC.",
