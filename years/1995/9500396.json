 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500396  Banerjee   The use of virtual environment could provide a major advancement for manufacturing information management and decision support technologies.  In this research virtual reality will be used in facilities and product layout information management and optimization systems.  In the layout domain, the research will address three important problems: (1) three-dimensional (3D) general layout design, (2) layout of manufacturing cells and material flow paths in factories, and (3) layout of multi-module assemblies.  The short-term objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using virtual reality in reducing the manufacturing cycle time.  The long-term objective is to develop raw technology for a real-time-virtually-real management control and decision support tool.  There is also a major software development component.  In addition, the research involves collaborations with Motorola and five other industrial firms, the Chicago Manufacturing Center, and National Institute of Standards and Technology, and industry collaborators will co-fund the work.   The research aims to enable a shorter lead time in manufacturing.  It will enhance the fundamental understanding of manufacturing decision support in light of integration of new technological developments in virtual reality.  It will provide a new generation of tools for training, develop alternatives to physical prototyping and provide avenues for sustaining employee interest in better design of manufacturing systems through continuous improvement.  The research will be introduced through lectures and laboratory experiments to graduate and undergraduate students.  Concepts will be incorporated into courses in computer-aided design, virtual environments, production control, intelligent manufacturing systems and facilities layout.  Seminars will also be conducted for industrial partners and other companies.",
