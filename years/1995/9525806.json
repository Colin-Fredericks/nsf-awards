 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525806  Hofmann  Increasing evidence indicates that krill populations surrounding  South Georgia are supplied by krill exported from the Antarctic  Peninsula region.  However, little knowledge of the potential  krill transport pathways exists.  General circulation patterns  for the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea regions are known.  However, recent observations have shown considerable mesoscale  structure to the flow on the continental shelf west of the  Peninsula, in Bransfield Strait, around Elephant Island and in  the Scotia Sea, which potentially influences krill transport and  retention.  Moreover, local hydrographic and current conditions  have considerable influence on the development and growth of  krill.  Hence, understanding and elucidating krill transport  pathways or possible retention regions requires knowledge of the  mesoscale current and water mass distributions.    The overall goal of the research is to investigate transport of  krill between the Antarctic Peninsula region across the Scotia  Sea to South Georgia.  To accomplish this general objective the  following specific research objectives will be pursued:  (1)  implement a circulation model for the Antarctic Peninsula-Scotia  Sea region; (2) interface an energetically based model for the  development of krill from larva to adult with the circulation  model; and (3) use the circulation-krill model to investigate the  retention and/or transport of krill in the Antarctic Peninsula to  South Georgia.  This modeling study is a joint effort between E.  Hofmann and J. Klinck at Old Dominion University and Dr. Eugene  Murphy at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in Cambridge,  England.  It will provide a framework for analyzing, synthesizing  and integrating the large environmental and krill data sets  collected by BAS around South Georgia with those from the  Antarctic Peninsula region that have come from historical sources  (e.g., BIOMASS) and the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research  (LTER) Program and those from the Bransfi eld Strait and Elephant  Island regions from the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources  (AMLR) program.  Moreover, the proposed modeling studies are  relevant to the key science questions set forth by U.S. GLOBEC  (GLOBEC, 1990) and International GLOBEC (GLOBEC, 1993) for the  Southern Ocean.  In particular, it addresses issues related to  the role of circulation and biological processes in structuring  Antarctic krill populations.  Also, quantifying the krill  transport (flux) between the Peninsula and Scotia Sea has been  identified as a high priority issue by the Convention for  Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).",
