 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414900       Wallace, Douglas    The utility of using mitochondrial DNA variation to assess  genetic variation in human populations and to reconstruct  human migration patterns has been demonstrated by many  studies, going back to the well-known \"Eve\" hypothesis.  For  this reason, recent investigations of human origins in the  New World and Asia have used mtDNA variation to trace  genetic links between populations in these regions.  While  it is clear that New World populations are derived from  northern Asian populations, it is not so clear how many  migrations there were into the New World, and from how many  source populations (variously argued as one, three, or even  four separate migrations).  Analysis of northern Asian  populations is required to address these issues.    This project to collect and analyze samples from Siberian  populations is timely and will provide critical information  for further investigation of these issues.  The graduate  student has previous field experience in this area, and has  established the groundwork for collecting the samples, is  well versed in the analytic techniques, and has alrealy co-  authored important papers in this area.  The project will  return important and intersting information.  ***",
