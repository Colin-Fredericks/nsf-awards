 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506913  Feigon  Aptamer is a name coined for DNA or RNA oligonucleotides which have  been selected from a large pool of oligonucleotides containing a  region of random nucleotide sequence for binding to a specific  target molecule.  The isolation process involves repeated cycles of  selection for, and enrichment of, oligonucleotides with an affinity  to a specific target, followed by amplification of these sequences  using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Olionucleotides with  the selected characteristics, i.e. binding to a specific molecule,  are finally identified through cloning and sequencing.  The cloned  sequences are usually screened for a common consensus and possible  secondary structural motif.  This methodology has been used to  identify a number of different classes of RNA aptamers that bind  specifically to common metabolic substrates and cofactors.  These  include ATP, GTP, riboflavin, FAD, FMN, cyanocobalamin and the  amino acids arginine and citrulline.  Based on the consensus  sequences and further experiments such as deletion analysis,  minimal binding sequences have in most cases been identified and a  secondary structure proposed.  However, to date, no three  dimensional structure for RNA aptamers have been determined.  Multidimensional, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy will be used to  determine the three-dimensional structures of aptamers that bind  biological cofactors, in the absence and presence of bound  cofactor.  RNA samples for NMR studies will be synthesized by in  vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase.  These will initially  be investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy to screen for sequences  which give good NMR spectra.  Once well-behaved samples are  obtained, partially or uniformly 15N and/or 13C-labeled samples  will be synthesized, to facilitate complete resonances assignment.   In favorable cases, complete three-dimensional structures will be  determined using metric matrix distance geometry and refinement by  molecular dynamics.    %%%  NMR spectroscopy  will be used to study the structures of RNA  oligonucleotides that bind biological cofactors.  These RNAs  contain a wide variety of proposed secondary structural motifs,  including hairpin loops, internal loops, pseudoknots, and  intramolecular G-quartets.  Thus, determination of their structures  will lead to a greater understanding of the principles of nucleic  acid folding.  Very few RNA structures of any kind have been solved  so far, so any information on tertiary structures of RNA should  greatly add to the knowledge base of these secondary structure  motifs.  Determination of the specific cofactor-RNA interactions  will also help elucidate some of the factors governing sequence  specific recognition of RNA by proteins and other ligands.  The  structures of the specific ligand binding sites are also relevant  to \"RNA world\" models of the origin of life, in which the evolution  of intermediary metabolism occured at the time of the RNA world.   Finally, determination of these structures should be useful in the  design of new catalysts which need these co-factors for their  function.  ***",
