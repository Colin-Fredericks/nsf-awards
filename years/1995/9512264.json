 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512264  Doyle    A multi-technique surface analysis system  with initial  capability for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and  scanning Auger microscopy  (SAM) will be acquired by the  University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa.  This fundamental capability  does not now exist at the Tuscaloosa campus and is part of the  University commitment to its materials science program.  The  equipment will be located in a central analysis facility which  serves major materials research programs at the University, most  notably the Center for Materials for Information Technology  (MINT).  The MINT is a multidisciplinary research program  focusing on new materials for flexible magnetic media and heads,  two areas in which the power of SAM/XPS will be directly  beneficial.  The combination of XPS and SAM in one instrument  allows for the determination of near surface chemical composition  (SAM) and composition gradients (SAM), depth profiling (SAM),  chemical bonding (XPS), chemical states (XPS), and functional  groups (XPS).  The instrument will support research programs in  high magnetization and high coercivity films and particles,  coupling in magnetic trilayer structures, giant magnetoresistance  in multilayered structures, wear and corrosion of magnetic media,  and metal matrix composites, among others.  %%%  The multi-technique surface analysis system will fulfill a  fundamental need of several programs in materials research on  campus and will thus have a large impact on the academic  infrastructure.  It will allow faculty to propose more  comprehensive, and therefore more competitive, materials research  proposals, and will provide students with hands-on training with  a state-of-the-art tool.  This instrument will also expand  opportunities for cooperative research with industrial sponsors.  ***",
