 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the problem of power dissipation, primarily  on the fundamental issues of what are the real sources of power  dissipation in CMOS microprocessors, and what can be done to  minimize it at a more global level.  The goal is development and  demonstration of techniques that would support Power-efficient  Instruction Set Architectures (PISA).  For this, there are four  major tasks:    1.     Developing technology independ models and metrics for power         dissipation in CMOS logic.    2.     Analyzing current day designs to benchmark the stat of the art         and to indentify processor subsystems that are potential power         hogs.    3.     Development of new techniques that will reduce these metrics.    4.     Demonstration of these techniques in a prototype CMOS PISA CPU         chip.    These new techniqujes will indlude gate disign level approaches,  but will focus primarily on organizaitonal and instruction set  architectural appropaches that inherently have a lower power  requirement.  The end goal of this research is to develop a deeper  scientific understanding of the relationship between power and  computation, and develop techniques that minimize the ratio of the  two in ways that can broadly impact the continuing evolution of  VLSI technology and its successful use in computing.",
