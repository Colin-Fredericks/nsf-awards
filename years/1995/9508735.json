 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508735  PINTO  This project will provide the first phylogenetic analysis of relationships within the blister beetle family (Insecta: Meloidae).  Morphological and biological features of both adults and larvae will be utilized in this analysis.  Present classifications establish major groupings based on phoretic behavior (dissemination by hitchhiking on another organism, mostly other insects) of the first instar larvae and Dr. Pinto believes these are unnatural groupings because this behavior has probably arisen independently in different lineages.  A major contribution of this project will be keys to the blister beetle genera of the world (At present no keys exist.).  Availability of such keys will allow researchers in different parts of the world to undertake further research with these beetles, ranging from applied research concerning these agronomic pests to evolutionary studies of their unusual metamorphosis and other aspects of their biology.  %%%  Members of the family Meliodae are known as blister beetles because of the noxious, caustic defensive chemicals they produce.  Several species are important pests of crops in different parts of the world and others are threats to the health of livestock (e.g. in this country alone several horses become sick and some die each year from eating hay infested with meloid beetles).  This project will contribute to our knowledge of this element of insect biodiversity and offer information that may prove of use in reducing economic losses attributable to these pests.  ***",
