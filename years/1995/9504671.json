 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.Wenbin Lin  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship   in Chemistry.  Dr. Lin received his doctoral degree from the University   of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Professor   Gregory Girolami.  Dr. Lin will continue research at Northwestern   Univesity under the sponsorship of Professor Tobin Marks.  His   postdoctoral research will target the synthesis and characterization of   novel organic second-order nonlinear optical materials. The work seeks a   fundamental understanding of the microscopic structures of the acentric   chromophoric multilayers which are prepared using siloxane self-assembly   technology, as well as the interrelationships between microscopic   structures, bulk nonlinearities, and thermal and temporal stabilities of   these self-assembled films.  Better understanding of these   interrelationships is crucial to the development of novel second-order   nonlinear optical materials for application in practical devices.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
