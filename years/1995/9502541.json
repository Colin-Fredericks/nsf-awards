 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widening gap between processor speed and memory latency will  continue to be a critical issue to the performance of computer  systems.  The  latency problem is even more acute on  multiprocessors that share the same  space, in which a main memory  module is typically remote to all or all but one  of the  processors.  It is therefore important to reduce unnecessary  remote  memory references and unnecessary network activities, and  to achieve high hit  ratio at the private, primary caches.    The project explores coherent  designs of compilers and  memory architectures to improve the average memory  latency, and  the network traffic.  The main thrust of this work is to combine  compilers' ability to predict program behavior with harrdware's  ability to  record memory reference patterns at run time.  The  research focuses on three  major issues:  (1) The use of a  compiler-assisted and hardware controlled  coherence mechanism on  multiprocessors with private cache memories; (2) The use  of  sophisticated interprocedural analysis to support the proposed  coherence  mechanism, via array data flow analysis and static task  scheduling; and (3) The  effects of program transformations, false  sharing and limited directory  pointers on the proposed coherence  mechanism.  This work covers a variety of  multiprocessors that  share a common address space, including bus-based systems,  the  Non-Uniform Access (NUMA) multiprocessors and the Cache-Only  Memory Access  (COMA) multiprocessors.    The main objectives of the PI's education plan in this  funding  period are (1) to redesign the compiler and language design  course  sequence for the Computer Science Department of Minnesota  and to solidify the  interfaces of these sources with other  language design sources; (2) to augment  the main compiler and  language design sources by seminar courses which address  new  issues regarding the interfaces of the compilers with the rest of  the  computer systems, and (3) to achieve teaching excellence in  these c ourses so  as to provide students solid understanding of  the principles of programming  language design and implementation  and compiler techniques which will be  important to their  scientific and engineering career.  The PI will conduct two  experiments in this funding period. One is to develop a language  design source  to be taught after the compiler courses and the  other is to add an operating  system implementation course to the  curriculum.    Additional educational  activities of the PI include exploration  of new avenues for creating industry  co-op programs for students  in the computer systems area and exploration of new  avenues or  providing professionals with excellent access to both the basic  courses and the seminar courses, e.g. through the university's  Distributed  Multimedia Learning Center.",
