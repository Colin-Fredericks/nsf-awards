 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMR-9509766, PI-Smyrl:  The objective is to develop microvisualization methods to locate and identify precursor sites for pitting corrosion and other forms of localized corrosion.  These methods will be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments to remove or passivate the sites and thereby mitigate local attack.  Scanned, gold-coated, optical fibers are employed to carry out combined photoelectrochemical and electrochemical microscopy (SPECM) to identify precursor sites on titanium and titanium alloys.  This technique has been successfully used to reveal precursor sites for high purity titanium.  The precursor sites are more highly electroactive than the surrounding surface, but the sites have lower photocurrent activity.  In order to extend the measurements to higher resolution, tapered optical fiber tips are used.  The ultimate resolution for the latter measurements is on the order of 10-20 nanometers, as demonstrated by near-field optical microscopy.  Studies are performed in the 100-200 nanometer level as a first step before going to the 10-20 nanometer range.  The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) is used to obtain rapid photoelectrochemical images to complement the above studies.  CLSM is also used for fluorescence microscopy on aluminum alloys to locate copper-rich areas.  The latter are sites for cathodic reduction of oxygen, and their removal from the surface has been shown to improve the corrosion resistance and pitting resistance of aluminum alloys.  ***This project demonstrates the capability of fluorescence microscopy with the CLSM to monitor the surface treatment processes designed to remove cop per inclusions that cause pitting corrosion on aluminum.  The combination of the techniques will enable a study of nonuniform reactivity on metal surfaces over lateral dimensions from tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers and will extend understanding of the nature of pitting precursor sites on titanium and other metals.***",
