 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide support for the infrastructure of the  molecular biology database research program at the evergreen  State College over the next year, maintaining a full-time  programmer for months and providing limited travel and software  upgrading.  Activities which will be enhanced by this support  include:    1.  Completion of publication of the analysis of the  bacteriophage T4 genome.  With its approximately 300 genes and  long years of study, T4 is the most complex virus for which the  entire sequence is known.  Many interesting phenomena have  already been observed, from both spliced- and folded-out introns  to nested genes and complex protein machines to a 26-amino acid  dual-function protein gene product to genes highly homologous  with eukaryotic proteins.  The computer support under this grant  will facilitate interaction among the members of the T4  community, and also work with various outside groups using the T4  data set as a model system for genoming analysis.  A major  activity will be to explore available tools for analyzing the  still-uncharacterized half of the genes involved in the  transition from host to viral metabolism after infection by large  virulent phages.  This work will also help to identify the most  useful candidate programs for a Molecular Biologist's  Computational Workbench.    2.  Support of collaborative efforts for object-oriented  molecular biology database specification, research and prototype  development.  This collaboration involves the Evergreen team  (Drs. Cushing and Kutter, Tom Stidham and several students), Tom  Marr and colleagues at Cold Spring Harbor and Tim Hunkapillar and  David Yee at the University of Washington.  Here, the major  current work involves development of a metadatabase for the  storage of complex multiple database sequence comparisons,  particularly important in facilitating comparing search results  across a range of search programs to tease out weak but  significant relationships from very large amounts of data .  The  metadatabase will be built upon the framework existing in the  Genome Topographer, an integrated database for genomic analysis  and viewing being developed by Tom Marr; we have been  collaborating with them for the last year on its expansion to  application to prokaryotic systems.  In a parallel effort Tim  Hunkapillar and David Yee will b implementing the sequence  comparison metadatabase in Sybase so that these two database  approaches can be compared in functionality and usability; we are  working together closely on this project.    3.  Provide support to students in the \"Student Originated  Software\" and \"Molecule to Organism\" programs who are involved in  the above projects.    The infrastructure thus supported makes it possible for molecular  biology and computer scientist faculty and students to work  together, sharing problems and solutions in facilitating analysis  of the complex ways that genomic information is organized and  expressed.",
