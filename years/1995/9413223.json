 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413223  Lynch  This award renews support of a joint training effort by 14 faculty who are members of the Department of Biology and who belong to one of three interdepartmental units (the Institutes of Molecular Biology, Neuroscience and Marine Biology) or to the Ecology and Evolution Program.  The theme of this RTG is molecular evolutionary biology.  The research and training are broadly focused on experimental and theoretical study of genetic mechanisms, developmental biology and population biology, all considered at the molecular level and all approached from an evolutionary standpoint.  The research programs of the faculty involve a diverse set of organisms including bacterial viruses, fungi, higher plants, drosophila, zebrafish, and other invertebrate and vertebrate animals.  Training activities involve students at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels.  Undergraduates participate during both academic year and the summer term, generally during their junior and senior years.  Graduate student participants are recruited from first year students in any of the institutes or programs listed above.  Postdoctoral fellows are recruited through national advertising.  Besides research, training include an RTG colloquium featuring about 10 outside speakers each year, a journal club and a set of 4 courses in each of three areas: evolutionary, developmental and molecular biology.  Of the 12 courses, 5 were developed for the RTG.  Graduate trainees are required to take 5 courses, including at least one course in each area.  All trainees are required to participate in the journal club and colloquium.  In addition to these, a new program of 3 day-long mini-symposia per year will begin in the renewal period.  Each symposium will involve 3 - 5 outside speakers and be preceded by a 3-4 week journal club focused on the topic of the symposium.  ***",
