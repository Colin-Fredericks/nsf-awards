This multi-university operation will conduct research to address  problems associated with several types of industries:  electric  utility, heavy electric power consuming industries, electric  component industries, and environment condition control industries.    Therefore, a wide spectrum of projects will be conducted in the  following areas:  1) control system for energy efficiency, optimal  power genepation, transmission, distribution, and utilization; 2)  modeling and simulation for nonlinear time varying events,  intelligent monitoring, and diagnostics; and 3) system management  study to improve the energy efficiency for electric components,  equipment, and facilities.    Research activities will be coordinated between Purdue University,  Colorado School of Mines, and Wichita State University (as an  EPSCoR sponsored affiliate).    The U.S. Department of Energy is providing funding in this award to  augment the ongoing research program and to provide for a  membership in the Center.",
