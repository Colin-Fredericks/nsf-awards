 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jack Harris, Mr. Brian Ludwig will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study stone tool assemblages from a series of East African sites which date to between 2.5 and 1.5 million years ago. He will examine materials from the Gona and Omo sites in Ethiopia, Foobi Fora in Kenya and Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Measurements will be recorded on 29 variables based on strictly technological features found on flakes, angular fragments, cores and other reworked pieces. Mr. Ludwig is an experienced stone worker and he will also use replicative techniques to determine the processes by which these objects were produced. On this basis he will gain insight into the cognitive and manipulative abilities of the hominids who produced them and trace how these developed over time.   The period between 2.5 and 1.5 years ago marked a major advance in hominid capabilities. At 2.5 million the archaeological record begins with the first flaked stone tools. A million years later hominids were producing standardized forms. The goal of this research is to determine how this process developed over time. Previous archaeological studies of these materials have focussed on `tool types` and attempted to sort materials into named categories. However such an approach gives little insight into their makers' cognitive and manipulative abilities. Mr. Ludwig's work will help to alleviate this situation.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide information of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the development of human cognitive abilities and assist in the training of a promising young archaeologist.",
