 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stull Observatory is a unique facility for the teaching of  astronomy to undergraduate students.   Equipped with telescopes  ranging from 9 inches to 32 inches in aperture as well as CCD's  and computers for image processing, the observatory is presently  providing an excellent exposure to astronomy for nonscientists  and beginning science students.   This program enhances the  equipment and course offerings for the more advanced students.    As part of these efforts, computer control is being added to the  32-inch telescope, improving the observing aspects of the  program.   This retrofit reduces the amount of time needed to  acquire astronomical objects, enables rapid changing between  fields, and facilitates assembling mosaics of larger regions of  the sky.   In turn, these abilities increase the number of  objects that can be observed on a given night, allow improved  photometry, and facilitate rapid response to unusual targets of  opportunity such as supernovae and events first detected outside  the visible wavelengths.   This new system benefits the advanced  students in the upper-level laboratory course, their research and  senior projects, and the research projects they share with  faculty.   In addition to the more advanced students, we  anticipate that the telescope automation can also benefit the  beginning lab, physically disabled students, and area high  schools.",
