 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507082  Napoli    A contributing factor to the enormous diversity observed for plant  form is the outgrowth of lateral buds, and the subsequent formation  of a characteristic shoot system. This proposal is a renewal of  previous funding supporting a genetic analysis of axillary  branching and apical dominance. Previous work demonstrated that  sufficient genetic diversity can be induced through mutagenesis in  order to make a genetic study of axillary branching possible. Three  genetic loci have been identified in Petunia hybrida that control  the degree of axillary branching. The recessive alleles condition  the phenotypic expression of increased branching potential or  decreased apical dominance (dad). The following objectives will be  pursued: 1) continued developmental and physiological  characterization of dad1 and dad3 mutants, 2) genetic studies to  isolate second site suppressors of dad1 and dad3, along with the  genetic characterization of suppressor mutants, 3) double mutant  and triple mutant analysis employing dad mutants and increased  apical dominance mutants, and 4) transposon tagging to clone the  dad1 gene. A transposon tagging system using the maize element  Dissociation (Ds) has been developed in this laboratory for an  inbred genetic line of P. hybrida. The Davis collection contains  159 plants containing independent Ds donor loci. Ds can be  transactivated to excise from donor sites at a high frequency in F1  progeny resulting from a cross to provide active transposase from  Activator (Ac). Dr. Napoli has analyzed 51 of the Ds donor loci and  have demonstrated the occurrence of pre-meiotic events giving rise  to germinal excision events. Two donor Ds loci have been mapped to  approximately 2.8cM of the dad1 gene. A test cross has been  initiated to tag and clone the dad1 gene.  ***",
