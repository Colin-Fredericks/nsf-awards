One way to investigate this problem is to  study systems that are still in the phase of planet formation.    Intensive studies of Beta Pictoris (A5 IV-V) have revealed a dust disk  and a dynamic gas envelope (showing both mass infall and outflow)  around the star.  The age of Beta Pic (<200 million years) roughly  corresponds to the era of planet formation and subsequent \"heavy  bombardment\" in our solar system.  Therefore, it is likely that Beta  Pic's dust + gas disk is similar to the accretion disk in the  primordial solar nebula.  However, it is still not resolved why Beta  Pic seems to have such a dynamic dust + gas disk, with about 100-200  mass infall events each year.  The understanding of the accretion  mechanism in Beta Pic, and of the relationship between the debris disk  and its circumstellar gas, is far from complete.  Is this a young  planetary system still undergoing formation, or is it the remnant of a  dusty proto-stellar accretion disk in its clearing phase?  Other  systems similar to Beta Pic with debris disks and circumstellar gas  need to be identified and studied to answer the questions.    The detection of circumstellar debris around nearby A type stars, such  as ,Beta Pic, provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore possible  proto-planetary systems that could resemble our own Solar System at an  early stage of evolution.  Therefore, a search for proto-planetary  system candidates will be completed.  The ultimate goal of this study  of these systems is to ascertain if they, as a group, represent some  phase of planet formation.  Three major objectives will be pursued:    (1) Identify nearby main-sequence A type stars that have circumstellar  dust, using the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) Faint Source  Survey (FSS) data.  Although it is very difficult to detect dust disks  by direct imaging, one can infer the presence of circumstellar dust by  the det ection of excess infrared wavelength emission that is consistent  with thermal radiation from the orbiting grains.    (2) Obtain high-resolution visible and ultraviolet wavelength spectra  of the volume-limited A-star sample to study the presence, ionization,  and kinematics of the circumstellar gas.  These high-resolution spectra  can be used to detect narrow circumstellar gas absorption spectra  features and the amount of circumstellar gas in the line of sight will  be inferred.  The visible and ultraviolet wavelength circumstellar  absorption lines will be compared to each other to test whether the  evaporation of cometary-like bodies is responsible for the variable  redshifted lines seen in spectra of Beta Pic and several other Beta  Pic-like stars in the volume-limited A-star survey.    (3) Test the hypothesis that gaseous accretion is occurring in the  inner regions of the debris disks of these planetary system candidates.  These systems might have physical properties similar to those of the  primordial solar nebula.  The study of the dynamic nature of these  proto-planetary system's circumstellar environments will provide  valuable insight into the formation of planetary systems.",
