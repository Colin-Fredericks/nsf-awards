 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project computerizes the physiology laboratory with four  Macintosh-based data acquisition stations, each with associated  transducers and data analysis software.   This equipment allows  for expanding the goals of laboratory experiences in Human  Anatomy and Physiology, Advanced Topics in Physiology, Organismal  Biology of Animals, and Animal Behavior to address recent  findings about the role of misconceptions in students'  difficulties with science.   Old laboratory experiences  emphasized reinforcing and demonstrating the material covered in  class; carrying out scientific hypothesis-testing experiments;  and engaging in collaborative dialogue about, and criticism of,  one another's experimental designs, findings, and inferences from  the data.   The new exercises include exploratory research,  qualitative and quantitative model construction, and model  testing.   The new equipment is easy and fast enough to enable  students to begin each laboratory with a period of discovery  experimentation in which they explore subjects about which they  may already hold misconceptions (e.g., the roles of oxygen and  carbon dioxide in regulating respiration rates).   Its  mathematical abilities allow them to build and evaluate models,  which they can then evaluate through hypothesis-testing  experiments.   When not in use for classroom experiments, the  computers can be used for studying tutorial programs and for  Internet access.",
