 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research on sulfur, oxygen, and  nitrogen transfer reactions by Dr. Robert G. Bergman of the  Department of Chemistry, University of California-Berkeley.   Transition metal complexes capable of transferring heteroatoms,  such as sulfur, oxygen, and alkylated nitrogen, between organic  molecules and metal centers will be studied.  Initial work will  focus on organotantalum complexes which remove these atoms and  groups from three-membered organic ring compounds, creating  hydrocarbons and new metal complexes with heteroatom-metal  multiple bonds.  After this initial phase, the project will  define the mechanism of these reactions in preparation for  identifying other metal complexes which can run these reactions  in reverse catalytically, thus generating complexes which can  convert alkenes into species such as epoxides, thiiranes and  aziridines.    The transfer of heteroatoms such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen  between organic molecules and transition metal centers is a  fundamental chemical process in organic and biological enzyme  chemistry.  The results should lead to the design of reactions  useful in organic synthesis in the chemical and pharmaceutical  industries, and to methods for removal of sulfur, oxygen, and  nitrogen from fuels, thus reducing production of environmentally  harmful sulfur and nitrogen oxides from this source.",
