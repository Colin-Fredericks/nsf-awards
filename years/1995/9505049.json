 "awd_abstract_narration": "Van Vleck       The investigator analyzes the behavior and stability  properties of differential equations under discretization.  In  particular, methods are developed for the efficient computation  of  stability information and global error estimation for large  systems of ordinary differential equations.  The research is  focused in two areas.  The first area is to determine methods for  accurately computing Lyapunov exponents and related quantities.  This includes analysis of methods and their errors and the  development of robust software to determine not only the Lyapunov  exponents but also an estimate of the error in their computation.  The second area is in the study of backward and shadowing error  analysis as a means for characterizing global error when solving  nonlinear differential equations numerically.  The investigator  applies these concepts to discrete in space, continuous in time  difderential equations that arise in the biological and physical  sciences.  The ultimate goal of this project is to analyze,  develop  and implement algorithms for the long-time, large-scale  computation of approximate trajectories for systems of lattice  differential equations.  While computing trajectories the codes  simultaneously obtain global error estimates and finite time  Lyapunov exponents or kinematic eigenvalues and the associated  growth/decay directions.  This research is expected to yield  contributions in the areas of dynamical systems, numerical  analysis and applied modeling.       The goal of this project is to provide improved accuracy in  simulations of models corresponding to large scale physical and  biological processes.  With more accurate simulations these  models  may be studied in greater detail and this should lead to  improvements in the models.  Because of the large scale nature of  the models the investigator employs distributed and parallel  computing environments.  The techniques to be used to increase  the  accuracy of the simulations rely on mathematical techniques  in  dynamical systems and numerical analysis.  In particular, the  investigator develops techniques that attempt to isolate the  potential for error.  He is particularly interested in  determining  the directions in which approximate solutions, obtained during  simulations, expand and contract.  Additionally, he wishes to  determine the rate at which this contraction and expansion takes  place.  This allows to determine which directions in the  approximate solution are susceptible to error growth (i.e. the  directions corresponding to expansion) and which directions are  less susceptible to error growth (i.e. the contracting  directions).  Ultimately, the contraction and expansion  information  is to be incorporated into the simulation software.  This  information is used to control the error in the simulation and  estimate the final error in the approximate solution.  The  methods  are aimed at showing that near the approximate solution there  exists an exact physical solution.  This may be an exact solution  of a slightly different model or an exact solution for the model  being studied but starting from a slightly different sample.",
