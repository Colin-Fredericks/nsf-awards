 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522971  Shah   This project investigates several computational techniques for transferring product geometry data from design to  manufacturing without human intervention.  The project is   divided into two parts.  The first component of the project is the  development of machining algebra for geometric representation of  tool-workpiece interaction for all machining processes.  This provides the mathematical basis for determining the machining  process that produces each machining feature on a given part.   The second component of the project is a computational model for  mapping dimensions and tolerances (D&T) while preserving the design  intent.  The key elements of the model are geometric building  blocks, directed geometric constraints, and degree of freedom  analysis for validation.  Methods for redistributing the designers  D&T between machining features will also be developed.   This project addresses a critical area of industry need, viz., design and manufacturing integration.  The lack of this integration  results in longer development times because manufacturing planning  today is a very labor-intensive activity.  The machining algebra  has the potential to capture the fundamental characteristics of common machining processes, replacing shallow heuristic rules used now, enhancing the degree to which manufacturing can be automated.  The methods proposed are generic; they are independent of particular computer aided design (CAD) or computer aided process planning (CAPP) systems used.  Each of the computational methods can be used independent of each other, making it attractive to incorporate them into existing CAD/CAPP systems.  This will enhance the communication between design and manufacturing and enhance process planning productivity, thus reducing time to market.",
