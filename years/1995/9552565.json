Consisting of 14 individual elements, the exhibit is to communicate  the essential role and significance of observation in the human  experience and its more purposive character in science; the role  and importance of instrumentation in scientific observation; and  the importance to science of observing and interpreting phenomena  in different ways.  \"Take Another Look\" is aligned with nationally  developed science education goals as outlined in Goals 2000, the  AAAS Benchmarks, and with the California's Science Framework.  The  project targets the adult/child unit (parents and teachers with  children age 2 to 10 that they accompany).  Particular attention is  being paid to reaching traditionally underserved audiences  including Latino, Asia, and African American.  Complementary  materials include a Teacher's Guide, a Family Activities Guide, and  a free/low cost \"take-away\" card with suggested activities and  recommendations for other activities.  It is estimated that in four  years it will reach over two million children and adults both at  the San Jose Children's Discovery Museum and host museums of the  touring version.",
