 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for funding for a BioRad DVC-250 laser-scanning  confocal microscope, together with associated camera, computer and  printer equipment. This equipment will be used for imaging both living  and fixed biological specimens, at high resolution, and in three  dimensions. This rapidly maturing technology is now in very wide use,  and is particularly suited to visualizing multiple antigens or stains,  simultaneously, and their digital analysis. With the equipment system  requested, we will be able to acquire microscopic images, process them  with a computer, and print them out, at publication quality.    While there are a number of other microscopes available on this campus  (compound microscopes, Electron microscopes, etc.), there is no  confocal microscope. The USC medical school houses a confocal system,  but this is not available to labs on this campus. Two of the proposed  major users now use confocal systems at other sites. Ko uses a system  at the City of Hope Hospital (20 miles distant), which is not available  to others. Warrior uses a system at U.C. Irvine (50 miles distant),  which is available, but charges a $100/hour user fee. In short, the  biological researchers here do not have regular, or open access to this  important technology. We have examined three different confocal  microscopes: the Nikon K2Bio, BioRad DVC-250, and the Meridian, and we  have determined that the BioRad offers the best compromise of  performance and cost, for our purposes. This institution (USC), has  undertaken to provide 30% of the total cost of this equipment, as a  cost share.    This equipment system will be used by a group of Biological research  labs at the University Park campus, of the University of Southern  California (in Los Angeles). This group consists of five major users  (Moses, Warrior, Tower, Herrera and Ko, the principal investigators  listed), and five minor users (Bottjer, Manahan, McFall-Ngai, Thompson  and Watts). All of the major users are currently supported by federal  gr ants. While our research interests are somewhat disparate we all  share a strong interest in using the confocal microscope to visualize  structures and antigens in three dimensions in biological specimens.    The Moses lab studies pattern formation and cell fate determination in  the Drosophila compound eye. They will use the confocal system to  colocalize gene products (such as Drosophila homologs of Transforming  Growth Factor a, and its putative receptor), and to examine double and  triple stained genetic mosaic tissues. The Warrior lab studies inter  and intra-cellular movements in the developing Drosophila embryo. They  will use the equipment to study germ cell migration, and the functions  of the schnurri and DnudC genes in early development. The Tower lab  studies development of the Drosophila chorion, and the regulation of  DNA replication. They will use the system to quantitate DNA levels in  the developing follicle cells. The Herrera lab studies developmental  plasticity in frog neuromuscular junctions, and the action of steroid  hormones on this structure. They will use the system to study the  junction structures in living specimens, in which their function, and  response to hormones, can be tested. The Ko lab studies neuro  transmitter release and the function of the presynaptic terminal. They  will use this equipment to explore the behavior and morphology of  voltage coupled Calcium channels, using specifically binding toxins.",
