 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for matching funds to purchase a new cryo-electron  microscope equipped with a slow-scan CCD camera. This system will allow  direct acquisition of digital images suitable for computer image  reconstruction and structural analysis of macromolecular complexes.  Although the UCLA campus has several electron microscopes, none are  suitable for state-of-the-art cryo techniques. Each of the major users  will contribute different areas of expertise to the shared facility,  including cryo sample preparation, classical electron microscopy,  site-specific antibody and gold labeling techniques, two-dimensional  crystal growth, and three-dimensional image reconstruction. Proposed  research projects involve a diverse array of biological assemblies:  human adenovirus particles with bound cellular receptors; retroviral  capsid protein assemblies; the spliceosome, a complex particle involved  in mRNA processing; the vault organelle, a ubiquitous cytosolic  ribonucleoprotein particle; cell-to-cell channels, which directly  connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells; and GABAA receptors.    The proposed facility will complement the existing strengths at UCLA in  imaging and biological structure. The Nuclear Medicine Division has  leaders in the fields of PET scanning and medical image reconstruction.  The Molecular Biology Institute has several renown x-ray  crystallographers. One goal of the proposed facility is to bridge the  resolution gap between x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy by  combining atomic structural information of component molecules with  image Reconstructions of macromolecular complexes.    The Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology will provide  suitable renovated space for the cryo-electron microscope and funds for  half of the instrument's cost. Sufficient computational power for image  processing already exists at UCLA. Additional computer graphics  workstations will be purchased from the Principal Investigator' s  start-up funds. After the initial one ye ar warranty period, the ongoing  maintenance and operating expenses for the cryo-electron microscope and  CCD cameras will be covered jointly by the major users' grants and  departmental funds. The administration of the proposed cryo-electron  microscopy facility will be carried out by an inter-departmental  committee at UCLA. Dr. Nigel Unwin, a recognized leader in the field,  has agreed to serve as an external consultant and provide both  technical advice and overall scientific guidance.",
