 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550098  Rankin    With this project the exploratorium creates a national leadership  institute, the Exploratorium Institute for Inquiry, which  combines its extraordinary facilities and resources supporting  scientific inquiry with a \"local laboratory\" of Exploratorium-  stimulated district science education reform projects.  Designed  to foster high quality inquiry-based teaching and learning in the  nation's elementary schools, the Institute for Inquiry will  provide educators from across the country with advanced  professional development opportunities to augment science reform  initiatives already underway as well as support the development  of inquiry innovation in the local laboratory.  The five year  project will create a nexus of practitioners committed to  changing elementary school science and provide a gathering place  to integrate the experiences, ideas and insights of the nation's  inquiry designers and implementers.    Through a unique combination of theory and practice, the  Institute will give at least 800 elementary educators, from all  strata of the field -- such as lead and resource teachers,  science resource teachers, administrators, informal science  educators, principal investigators of science education reform  projects, scientists, university educators and national leaders  in the field -- an unusual and powerful opportunity to explore  inquiry-based teaching and learning.  Its components include two  and three week workshops designed to provide professional  developers with in-depth inquiry experiences in science and  learning, four day seminars for reform implementers with initial  exposure to inquiry instruction, and two day forums with provide  platforms for vigorous debate and review by national leaders on  critical topics in inquiry.  These activities will build upon a  local laboratory of inquiry innovation including advanced inquiry  projects, Exploratorium associate schools practicing inquiry, and  classroom teacher workshops.  An ongoing Inquiry Network for  p articipants will consist of an annual proceedings publication  and an Internet-based electronic communication network.    The cost sharing is 42% of the NSF award.  ***",
