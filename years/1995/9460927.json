 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a technique for automated monitoring of SNMP data. Profiles of behavior for many variables defined in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Internet Management Information Base (MIB I and II) will be constructed and evaluated using statistical analysis. In our exploratory analysis, data for selected variables will be collected at 15 second intervals for devices attached to a university LAN and downloaded for later analysis. Methods will be employed to handle the noisy or bursty nature of the variables and to deal with the dynamic and non-stationary aspects. The techniques we develop are likely to be applicable to diagnostic problems in many other industries that face non-stationary, highly complex behaviors in the data that can be monitored. Even if the research is not successful and Intellinet, Inc., is unable to identify profiles or multivariate measures with sufficiently stable predictive power, the results of this work and the methodologies they examine will benefit the research community. Moreover, data that they collect concerning the behavior of a broad class of SNMP variables in both normal and faulty conditions and the relative predictive power of these variables are likely to be of value to network operators and device manufacturers in the future.",
