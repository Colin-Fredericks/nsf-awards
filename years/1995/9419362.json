 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419362  Deutsch    Research is proposed in three areas of theoretical statistical physics. (1)  Studies of nonequilibrium processes which possess large fluctuations.  The  objective is to better understand the structures which arise in fully developed  turbulence by using a simulation technique that selects large, but unlikely  fluctuations.  The results should provide an improved understanding of  turbulent intermittency.  (2) Structural prediction for macromolecules.  Prediction of structure and morphology is important in the understanding of  materials and biomaterials, but requires knowing the forces between the  individual building blocks of the systems.  The large experimental data base on  protein structure will be used to systematically determine the force field that  acts between different atoms or constituent submolecules.  The results will be  important in determining structures of macromolecules.  (3) Quantum simulations  using statistical methods.  A large class of problems is difficult to simulate  due to sign changes during averaging processes.  This class of problems is of  fundamental and current interest.  A method will be studied which greatly  speeds up this averaging process by replacing the sudden change in sign by a  continuously varying phase.  The consideration of the statistics of these  phases leads to improved methods for doing these averages.  %%%  Theoretical research involving advanced computational techniques will be done  on a variety of problems dealing with very large random systems.  One problem  will develop new methods to better determine the structure of biologically  important macromolecules.  Another project will deal with new algorithms to  surmount a fundamental problem involving calculations of physical systems of  interacting electrons.  The solution of this problem can have a profound impact  on calculations for high temperature superconductors.  Finally, calculations  will be made on the effect of rare fluctuations on the development of  turbulence  in fluids.  Turbulence is an extremely difficult problem to  understand and it affects a wide variety of everyday happenings.  ***",
