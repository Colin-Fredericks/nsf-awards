During  the first two years of the  project, the co-coordinators have  organized meetings of the  principal investigators and  produced annual progress reports  which have been disseminated to  all interested parties.  In  addition, a number of technical  sessions at national and  international meetings have been  held to publicize the research  work.  It is proposed to continue  these coordination activities to  the conclusion of the five-year  program.  A major on-going  activity is to integrate all  research results and produce a  multi-volume document which  summarizes research  accomplishments in the areas of  basic research and implementation.  ***",
