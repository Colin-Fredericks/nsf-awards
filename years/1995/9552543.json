 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552543  Gwynne    The Wildlife Conservation Society will use this one year award to  move forward their planning for the \"Rain Forest Trail and the  Living Treasures of the Congo Gallery.\"  This is the first phase of  an ambitious $29M, 6 acre outdoor exhibit area focusing on the  Congo Rain Forest and an indoor Environmental Education Complex.   The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) conducts extensive field  research in a number of central African sites and has an important  living collection of tropical African wildlife in the New York  facility.  The Congo Rain Forest/Environmental Education Center  will include three major interpretive areas and an educational  resource area.  NSF is being asked to support two components of the  Congo Rain Forest complex which are the Rain Forest Trail and  Living Treasures of the Congo Gallery.  The Rain Forest Trail, with  both indoor and outdoor elements, will be a total immersion exhibit  where visitors will be surrounded by a replication of an African  rain forest and will have the opportunity to encounter a variety of  its living inhabitants, and experience how its ecosystem functions.   They will have the experience of making scientific observations  thus gaining insight into how scientists work.  The goal of this  design technique \"is to move beyond the limited scope of  traditional zoo exhibits (which simply portray the 'animal as  object')\", toward a presentation of animal and plant communities as  they interact within an ecosystem.  The Living Treasures Gallery  will be a 4000 sq. ft. space which is dedicated to the introduction  of the diversity of rain forest inhabitants, their environmental  adaptations, and complex interrelationships.  The gallery will be  divided into four areas: Adaptations for Survival, The Forest of  the Megavertebrates, The Interconnected Forest, and Seeing the  Unseen.  Numerous interactive devices will be developed to engage  the visitor in hands-on activities and materials will be developed  that link the themes of  the exhibit with the agenda of formal  education for both teacher and students.",
