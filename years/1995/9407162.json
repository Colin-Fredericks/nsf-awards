Non-technical summary    In many animals the basic processes of sexual selection include male  male competition and female choice.  It is generally believed that  female choice can involve preferences for mates who provide direct  benefits such as care of offspring and preferences for mates who  provide indirect benefits via the genes that they contribute toward  the offspring.  Recently, theoretical biologists have confirmed that  several different models of indirect sexual selection are plausible.  However, experimental evidence for, and distinctions between, these  models are meager.  This paucity largely exists because many of the  species in which sexual selection is studied are not amenable to the  controlled experiments needed to test assumptions underlying the  various models.  In the current project we will overcome these  previous difficulties by studying female choice in an unusual pyralid  moth, Achroia grisella, that can be observed and raised in the  laboratory.  Female choice in A. grisella occurs via an indirect  mechanism  -  selection based on male ultrasonic signals.  We will  employ a variety of breeding experiments to study the heritabilities  of male signaling characteristics and of female preferences for these  characteristics. The general viability of offspring of females who  mate with preferred males will also be noted.  Our findings will  provide assessments of the alternative hypotheses (1) that indirect  female choice is arbitrarily based on genetic attributes which are  unrelated to general viability and (2) that the genetic attributes  chosen are related to mate and offspring viability. Study of A.  grisella will also increase our fundamental understanding of  ultrasonic signaling and perception, and it may lead to improved  control strategies of this (and related) species, a pest of honeybee  colonies.",
