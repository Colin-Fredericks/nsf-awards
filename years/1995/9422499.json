 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422499  Wakimoto        Physical forcing that occurs on small spatial and time scales (mesoscale)  often determines the timing, location and severity of various weather phenomena.   The Principal Investigator proposes to apply principals of mesoscale analysis to a  variety of weather phenomena including tornadogenesis, study of convection in the  boundary layer along what is termed horizontal convective roles, and to the study of  oceanic cyclogenesis.        The tornadogenesis study is focused on determining the physical factors that   cause some severe thunderstorms to produce tornadoes while others do not.  The  Principal Investigator will participate in the second phase of the Verification of  Origins of Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX)  as well as continue analysis of data  collected during the first phase in the Spring of 1994.  A unique aspect of this  investigation is the first use of airborne Doppler data for the study of tornadogenesis.        The study of horizontal convective roles is a continuation of analysis of data   collected during the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification.  This study is  focused on one of the most common types of boundary layer convection and will  include a study of how horizontal convective roles interact with the sea breeze.        The third component will investigate the fine scale details of oceanic  cyclogenesis using data from the Experiment on Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over  the Atlantic.  Preliminary radar syntheses have revealed shallow mesoscale  circulations that form along an intense warm front.  This mesoscale feature appears  to be the incipient circulation that can lead to rapid cyclogenesis when it comes into  a proper phasing with an upper-level short wave trough.  ***",
