 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioelectric fields can be measured on the human scalp in response  to sensory stimuli and in association with cognitive tasks. Evoked  potential (EP) and event related potential (ERP) scalp fields, the  terms used for these bioelectric fields, are important objects in  research on fundamental issues concerning sensory processing in humans.  Scalp potential fields offer good temporal resolution (less than 1 ms);  brain activity can be \"tracked\" during processing, a feature  unavailable to other modalities of functional brain imaging. Magnetic  field recording also supports tracking but at a cost more than 10 times  that of bioelectric field recording.                In most contemporary applications, bioelectric field recording  has suffered from inadequate spatial sampling. Both theoretical and  empirical studies suggest that the Nyquist sampling interval on the  scalp is about 2.5 cm. More than 100 electrodes must be placed on the  scalp to capture potential fields without risking distortion, a  recording density that until recently has been out of practical reach.                This proposal is made to acquire equipment for high density  spatial sampling which will be used by several researchers, their  graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. The research projects  supported by this facility will span a wide range from engineering  through sensory psychology. It will bring together a group of  researchers with complimentary backgrounds and act as a catalyst for a  sophisticated research program aimed at understanding how the human  brain processes sensory information. These researchers are from three  institutions, Southwestern Medical School (SWMS), University of Texas  at Dallas (UTD) and Southern Methodist University (SMU), all located  close to the proposed facility.                        No comparable facility exists within or near the Dallas metro  area. UTD has a 32-channel \"BEAM\" system. SWMS has a 32-channel  \"homemade\" recording system in operation. Neither school or the ir  combination can provide the required recording equipment.                It is proposed to purchase a 128-channel recording system from  Electrical Geodesics Inc. (EGI), an S.B.I.R. grant-supported company  under a \"Beta\" site agreement to reduce costs. The system, \"Net  Station\", will include EGI's Geodesic sensor nets that allow 128  electrodes to be placed on the scalp in about 20 minutes, state of the  art amplifiers, a flexible data acquisition system, and software for  signal processing, convenient display of results, as well as  statistical testing. These functions are vital to making the facility  useful to the researchers. It is also proposed to acquire an optical  disk to support the large data storage requirements of the project. A  three-dimensional digitizer completes the equipment requirements  allowing experimenters to record all electrode locations for adequate  display and processing.                Important as the equipment and software are to the success of  this project, it is also recognized that the facility must provide  apppopriate support staff for the researchers at least for the first  few years of its operation. Thus it is proposed to hire an electrical  engineer who will serve as the chief technical person. In addition,  SWMS is prepared to support the salaries of the P.I., who will act as  the administrative head of the facility and of a well-trained  technician who will be responsible for subject scheduling, equipment  maintenance and who will assist in the actual data acquisition process.  During the three years of this project, the goal is to develop the  facility so that it becomes a \"stand alone\" research resource supported  by its users.",
