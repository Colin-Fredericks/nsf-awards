 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a recipient of ARI funds, Oklahoma State University  (OSU) will renovate and modernize its research  facilities used for geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing research located in the  Geography Building on the Stillwater campus.  The multi-use facility has a growing reputation in the  region as a center for geographic research. Examples of research conducted in the Department include:  investigations of the diffusion of language innovations, modeling spatial correlation between  landscape and atmospheric conditions, and integrating remote sensing and geographic information system  technologies for optimizing crop yields.  Geography faculty  collaborate with faculty in other  departments on campus as well as professionals affiliated with academe and industry in institutions  throughout the country.  In addition to performing high quality research, the GIS remote sensing  faculty at OSU has made a major commitment to increasing the number and quality of students who are  involved with geographic research in Oklahoma, especially among populations that are traditionally  under-represented in the field.  This project will provide the critical research infrastructure that  will allow the program to continue to perform cutting edge geographical research into the twenty-first  century. Deficiencies that require immediate attention are the following:  inadequate electrical power  and grounding, safety problems associated with exposed gas and electrical conduits, inadequate heating  and air conditioning and wall alterations to improve the efficiency of space used for research and  research training. Once completed, the project will support critical investigations in the areas of  global change and environmental research.",
