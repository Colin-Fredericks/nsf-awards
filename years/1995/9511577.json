 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511577  O'Loughlin    This research investigation uses a political geography  perspective to examine the diffusion of democratic norms and  practices across time and space.  The study encompasses the  period since the emergence of the modern nation-state beginning  with the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and covers the subsequent  waves of democratization, including the 19th century,  decolonialization in the mid-20th century, and the most recent  period of democratic transition, starting in the 1980s and  continuing in the mid-1990s.  This investigation rejects the  atomistic frameworks that have been used to date to study the  diffusion of democracy.  These frameworks have focused separately  on globalism, regionalism, and localism.  Rather, the  investigators develop and test theoretical propositions that  integrate all three levels of scale, yet retain a temporal  dimension.  The approach integrates internal political economic  processes, regional political economic competition, as well as  the impact and influence of the global political economy upon the  spread of democratic norms and practices.  Context sensitive  models of this process attuned to the across-space and over-time  variations are developed and tested.  Using dynamic cartographic  techniques designed to display quantitative information  intuitively, the investigators show how the ebbs and flows of  democratic norms have regional and local, as well as global  causes.  Using dynamic space-time statistical techniques, the  investigators develop parameters to describe this process.  The  objective is a more complete, contextually informed model of the  ways in which democratic norms and processes have been extended  over time and over space.    This investigation will help elaborate how political and economic  changes implicate each other at different levels of scale.  It  will also contribute to an understanding of what encourages the  development and survival of democratic norms and rules in new  contexts.  Importantly, it will al so address the debate between  different views of the sources of democracy, integrating each  into a contextually sensitive perspective that spans the global,  regional, and local scale.  ***",
