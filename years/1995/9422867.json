 "awd_abstract_narration": "People value status and often seek it as a reward for their  efforts in work and elsewhere.  Status is defined as high  rank on some dimension that is held by society to be  important.  The sources of status can be separated into two  main categories: those which are earned and those which are  unearned.  College graduates, for example, hold \"earned\"  status relative to high school dropouts while hereditary  rank represents an example of \"unearned\" status.  Status is  an inherently social phenomenon but one which is full of  economic ramifications.  Social psychologists understand  that status affects the way people treat each other.  Their  work shows that, for example, people will discriminate in  favor od people who have a status level similar to their  own, and against those with lower status.  Economists look  at these questions from a different angle.  What economists  want to know about status is whether people are willing to  continue to discriminate when discrimination costs money.  Economists also want to know whether status is valuable  enough to pay for it, and if so, how much people are willing  to pay.  These questions form the objectives in this pilot  effort.  The research explores the economic basis for the  value of status by creating status in an experimental  economic environment, for example, an experimental market.  Analysis of these experiments will compare subjects'  decisions based on whether they or their opponents had high  or low status.  This research will aid in understanding the  ways in which status changes decision making and in the ways  status can be used to reward work efforts.",
