 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511765  Willis    Many  animals,  from  spawning  salmon  to  hungry  seabirds  and  insects,  locate distant unseen resources (such as  food  or  the  salmon's  home stream) by using odors released by that  resource.  These  investigators  study the male moth, Manduca  sexta,  which  locates  mates  by flying upwind in a trail of the sex-attractant  odor (pheromones) released by receptive females.  The male moth's  flight is guided by combining information from all of its senses,  including smell, vision, and touch. To explore how the male moths  adapt  their  behavior to changes in their environment,  such  as  changing wind speed or odor concentration, male moths are  video-  taped  while flying freely toward the pheromones in a  laboratory  wind  tunnel and activity from their flight muscles is  recorded.  In  this  way,  control signals from the nervous  system  can  be  correlated with the behavior that is videotaped. The results from  these  free-flight studies can then be compared to  results  from  tethered   male  moths  provided  with  computer-driven   sensory  stimulation from a flight simulator and tethered males using  the  muscle  activity patterns generated in the moth's nervous  system  to  drive  the  computerized flight simulator. This  will  enable  these  investigators  to analyze how the  moth's  nervous  system  combines the information from all of its senses with the on-going  behavior  patterns that underlie this complex behavior.  Finally,  computer simulations of odor-guided flight in moths will be  used  to   test  hypotheses  about  how  the  nervous  system  controls  behavior. Knowledge derived from these studies can them  be  used  to  design artificial systems that could perform similar adaptive  control functions.",
