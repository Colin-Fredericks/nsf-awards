 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a haptic interface  system that allows force interactions with computer-generated  virtual reality graphical displays. This system is based on  coupling the human hand with a robotic manipulator using  electromagnetic principles. The development and interfacing of the  mechanical hardware used to implement the force feedback system is  a major aspect of the research. A six degree of freedom robot  manipulator is used as the motion platform for the force interface  device and to provide reactions for the electromagnetic forces. The  robot will hold the magnetic force generation device near the hand  of the user, using position and orientation tracking to follow the  motion of the user's hand. Virtual forces will be computed from the  interactions between objects and the user's hand in the virtual  environment and transmitted to the human by energizing electrical  coils attached to the finger tips of the user. Development of a  virtual environment for studying real-time interactions is also a  part of the research. Geometric models of the virtual objects will  be developed and displayed using a head mounted display coupled  with a Silicon Graphics, Inc., Onyx Reality Engine. The position of  the user's head will provide visual orientation of the graphics  scene. The motion of the user's hand will be measured using the  relative position of the robot. Finally, strategies for real time  motion and collision detection of the objects in the virtual  environment will be developed.",
