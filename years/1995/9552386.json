 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Molecular Modeling Laboratory is being established to introduce  undergraduate science students to the extremely important area of  computational chemistry.   Students use the laboratory for  class-related studies and in undergraduate research.    Instruction of the basic principles of biological, organic,  inorganic, and physical chemistry are substantially improved  through the calculation and visualization of 3-D structure,  molecular orbitals, protein dynamics, enzyme substrate binding,  reaction pathways, vibrational spectra, and more.   Whenever  possible, calculations from the laboratory are used to address  questions arising from measurements the students make in the  experimental laboratories.   Senior thesis students in the  chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology programs use these  powerful computational methods and visualization techniques to  understand and interpret their research results.   In both  course-related studies and undergraduate research, the laboratory  enhances the students' understanding of basic chemical principles  as well as introduces them to modern computational methods  routinely used in graduate school and industry.",
