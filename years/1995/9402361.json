 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402361  HEDGES         Over the next three years joint research will continue on the  sources and reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in  seawater.  Studies will focus primarily on the 20-30% of total  dissolved organic matter which can be gently isolated in relatively  large amounts by tangential-flow ultrafiltration.  The three  central objectives of the research are: 1. To identify the  biological sources and transformations of the major DOM components.   2. To elucidate compositional trends among DOM constitutes of  different size. 3 To characterize in detail the compositions and  associations of the various organic materials comprising seawater  DOM.  Research to determine the biological and digenetic origins of  DOM will emphasize rapid processes occurring in the upper water  column where large differences in DOM concentrations and  compositions are observed.  A better understanding of compositional  trends among dissolved organic materials of different size will  help to delineate processes affecting DOM cycling and to judge how  representative ultrafiltered isolates are of bulk DOM.  More  detailed characterizations of the compositions and forms of ultra-  fitered DOM will aid in distinguishing its biological sources,  identifying key transformations, and deconvoluting functional re-  lationships among DOM constitutes.  This line of research has  already provided new insights on both the reactive and refractory  components of the immense seawater DOM pool and should continue to  yield information useful over wide range of oceanographic studies.",
