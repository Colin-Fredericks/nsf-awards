 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural   anthropology from the University of Michigan.  The project will study a pastoral people   in Tanzania, East Africa.  The question to be asked is how global processes of capitalist   market change have changed the local rural economies, specifically in the evolution of   cattle-raiding.  The student will test the hypothesis that closer connections with the   national state and regional markets have expanded the scope of cattle raiding.  Using   ethnographic methods of intensive interviews and observation in two rural villages as   well as the study of local and regional archives and documents, the project will analyze   how the increased commodity value of cattle has affected their importance in ceremonial   and prestige activities in these societies.    This research is important because in addition to expanding our expertise in this   important regional of the world, the study will illuminate the process by which the   international capitalist market expands into local-scale traditional areas, transforming   local practices into larger-scale commercial practices.",
