 "awd_abstract_narration": "The following proposal is aimed at developing a prototype  instrument for the observation of infrared, or vibrational  Circular Dichroism (VCD), using Step-Scanning Fourier  transform (SS-FT) methodology. VCD is a spectroscopic  technique, developed originally in the mid 1970's, in which  the differential absorption of left and right circularly  polarized indrared light by vibrational transitions is  observed.  This effect is very small, yet contains  conformational and structural information which cannot be  obtained easily by any other spectroscopic method.  The lack  of commercial instrumentation for its observation has  restricted the wider application of VCD as a structural  tool.    This proposal is intended to produce a new generation of VCD  instruments which could serve as blueprints for commercial  VCD spectrometers.  The proposed instrument is conceived as  a VCD spectrometer, rather than a Fourier Transform infrared  spectrometer to which VCD capabilities were added.  A number  of technical innovations will make this instrument very  unique, and will extend its capabilities beyond the present  limits of VCD spectroscopy.  The applicant's laboratory has  been in the forefront of the development of vibrational  optical activity, and has extensive experience with both  dispersive and interferomatic spectroscopic methods.  Thus,  this laboratory is ideally suited to take a leading role in  development of a new generation of VCD spectrometers.    The main thrust of the applicant's research is the  determination of the solution conformation of biological  model systems:  peptides and small proteins, as well  asoligonucleotides and their interactions with drugs.  The  SS- FT-VCD instrument described here will be used in these  studies to further reduce VCD data acquisition time, improve  spectral quality and permit spectra to be collected from  more dilute aqueous solutions.",
