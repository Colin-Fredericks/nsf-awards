 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550458  Guzdial    Our world is changing in ways that make learning a critical skill-a  verb, not a noun.  When our engineering students enter the  workplace, they will find: That organizations as a whole need to  learn, and that individuals who can learn are highly valued (Senge,  1992), that the half life of their engineering knowledge is  something on the order of five years (Lohmann & Stacy, 1990); and  that the artifacts they design and build must lend themselves to  being learned by their users; and it makes sense to design them so  that users can learn the artifacts easily (Norman, 1993; Soloway,  Guzdial, et al., 1994a).    Modern cognitive science has cast new light on learning. We know  that successful learners are active learners: They seek to  understand deep structure in what they learn, they integrate what  they learn into what they knew previously, and they index learned  knowledge so that it is usable later (Farnham-Diggory,  1990;kolodner, 1993).  Passive learners who rely on knowledge being  served to them in terms of lectures and presentations are not  successful learners-we cannot expect passive learners to be able to  learn from new situations without someone there to package the new  knowledge for them.  Active learners learn based on two components:  * Activity: Students who are active learners are actively doing,  and are learning in order to better engage in that doing. Support  which enables a student to be successful and learn from an activity  is called scaffolding (Palincsar, 1986;Wood, Bruner, et al., 1975).  * Context: The situation in which students learn has a significant  impact on what students learn and how well they may use the learned  knowledge later (Farnham-Diggory, 1990).    My research and teaching plan are geared to prepare students for  life in a learning society.  My research is focused on defining,  implementing, and evaluating methods that lead to active learning,  particularly using (1) context-setting and (2) scaffolding  techniques. I apply the se methods in engineering education because  of the critical need for engineers who can learn and the ready  access to engineering educators who are willing to explore  innovative methods in education at Georgia Institute of Technology  (Georgia Tech). My teaching plan has two focuses: (1) on using  these same methods in my own and other computer science education  and (2) on teaching these methods to others.    The specific research I propose in this research is to apply the  methods of scaffolding and context-setting to enabling the use of  programming as an activity in engineering education. My hypothesis  is:  *    Programming can be an effective and efficient activity for  engineering education, achievable by (1) redefining the activity of  programming and (2) creating environments to support this  redefinition based on techniques of context-setting and  scaffolding.    Products of this work:  *    An empirically evaluated theory of the technological context-  setting and scaffolding needed to integrate a complex activity  (programming) into a range of domains in engineering education.  *    The creation of a general programming environment to improve  engineering education by providing students with the opportunities  to define and debug processes in a domain-oriented manner.  *    A set of courses at the undergraduate, graduate, and  continuing education levels to inform students about educational  technology.  Impacts of this work:  *    Engineering education will be improved through use of a tool  for students in active learning.  *    Educational technology will have a theory to guide future  development of supportive and guiding structures in software to  achieve active learning.  *    Improvements in computer science education based on the  research into context-setting and scaffolding.  ***",
