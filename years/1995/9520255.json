 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520255  Dagenais    This five-year continuing award provides funding to establish an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Optoelectronic  Devices, Interconnects, and Packaging at the University of  Arizona/University of Maryland.    Fourteen companies and Government Agencies are becoming members of  this joint university Center.    The initial research agenda at the two research sites will address:   1) Optic Interconnect Development for Advanced Processing and  Network Systems; 2) Holographic Interconnects for Optical Neural  Networks and Other  Applications; 3) Theory of Semiconductor  Nonlinearities; 4) Semiconductor Lasers and All-Optical Switches;  5) Near to Mid-Infrared Optical Parametric Oscillators; 6) Novel  Optoelectronic Devices; 7) Waveguide Waferboard Project; 8)  Semiconductor Laser Amplifiers:  Packaging and Applications; 9)  Characterization and Modeling of Acousto-Optic Correlators; 10)  Process and Device Characterization.    The Co-Directors and their colleagues are well known researchers  and are qualified to run this Center.    This project has been coordinated with Dr. Deborah Crawford,  Division of Electrical and Communications Systems.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Maryland be  awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.   All subsequent years will be funded at the $50,000 per year level.     Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the of the Engineering Education and  Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number  of renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommends support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
