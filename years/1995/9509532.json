 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University in the purchase of a modern single-  crystal diffraction system.  This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number  of areas, including the following:  (1)  Organosulfur Complexes as Highly Conducting  Materials; (2)  Synthesis of Natural Products and Biologically Active Compounds Via  Homochiral N-Acylpyridinium Salts; (3)  Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of Vanadium-  Protein Model Systems; (4)  Stereocontrolled Nucleophilic Addition Reactions to Acyclic  Acetals; (5)  Metal Halides at the Interface of Molecular and Solid State Chemistry; and (6)   Synthesis and Characterization of Organic-Based Magnetic Materials.    The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three-  dimensional structure of a molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of all  the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about  the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.",
