 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419900  Benson  As the nervous system develops, exuberant connections are made  between cells, many of which are later eliminated to arrive at the  final pattern of connections.  A question that has yet to be fully  answered is the role that neural activity plays in this process of  synapse formation, elimination, and consolidation.  This research  will investigate the formation of synapses between cultured  hippocampal neurons, which have been shown to closely resemble  their in vivo counterparts molecularly, structurally, and  functionally.  A number of experimental manipulations will be  performed to elucidate the role of neural activity in the formation  and stabilization of synapses and synaptic patterns.  This entire  process is integral to the development of the nervous system, and  is one that is modifiable by experience and learning.  The outcome  of these experiments may provide fundamental information about how  the electrical activity associated with neural activation refines  the connections between nerve cells.",
