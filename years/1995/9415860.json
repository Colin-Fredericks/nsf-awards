The main objectives are to  achieve a deep theoretical understanding of combined source-channel  codes and to develop practical algorithms that can effectively be  used in real applications such as low-bandwidth video compression  and low-delay speech coding. Very narrow bandwidth transmission  channels, such as mobile cellular telephony, require efficient  coding schemes to protect the transmitted source information from  the corruptive effects of channel errors. Some previous work on  joint source-channel coding has yielded limited success at  protecting source coded information. In particular, low complexity  techniques are needed for low delay real time implementations. This  project will investigate channel coding techniques for source  coding applications with an emphasis on image, video, and speech  coding applications.  A summary of the topics to be investigated  is: Classes of low-complexity redundancy free codes for discrete  memoryless channels; error control coding will be incorporated into  the source code design and the index assignment problem will be  addressed for codes with redundancy.  High resolution quantizer  theory will be studied for sources transmitting across noisy  channels. Some preliminary results give useful formulas for  randomized index assignments, but a much stronger theory is needed  for optimal index assignment.  Lattice codes will be studied both  for quantization and channel coding. A goal will be to develop  efficient encoding algorithms for lattice source codes  (respectively, decoding algorithms for channel codes). Preliminary  results so far have yielded very fast algorithms for the Leech  lattice, as well as some of the best-known low dimensional  lattices.  Efficient decoding techniques will be developed  for channel codes in Euclidean space using specific source coding  information.  In particular, trellis decoding algorithms and theory  will  be studied for unequal input probabilities and unequal error  protection. This is currently an unsolved problem though extensions  of techniques from traditional decoding algorithms have yielded  some limited preliminary success.  ***",
