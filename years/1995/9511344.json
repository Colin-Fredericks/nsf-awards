We lack a historical benchmark since adequate information on the economic mobility of Americans has been unavailable for the mid-nineteenth century.  Published data from the decennial censuses of population for this period allow examination of only broad aggregates: net migration flows, the distribution of occupations at a particular place or point in time, and the average level of wealth in various communities.  Where specific mid-nineteenth century immigrants and natives went, how they changed jobs over the course of their careers, how successful they were in monetary terms as those changes occurred, and how immigrants' economic performance changed as their time in the U.S. increased have remained a mystery.  This project uses two new longitudinal samples of ante-bellum immigrants and natives followed through the federal censuses of 1850 and 1860 to help fill this gap.  It documents the extent of economic mobility among immigrants and natives in the years before the Civil War.  A variety of sources provide comparable information on economic mobility in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  The reports of the Immigration Commission (1911) and Public Use Micro Samples from the 1900-10 and 1970-90 federal census of population provide cross-section information on the number of years immigrants have spent in the U.S., making it possible to see how the economic performance of immigrants compares to that of natives as immigrants' time in the U.S. increases.       This project provides a historical perspective on the economic mobility of immigrants and natives in the U.S. over nearly a century and a half of economic development.  It assesses the relative economic performance of immigrants and natives in three periods: 1850-70, 1880-1 910, and 1970-90.  The study will examine changes in income, occupational attainment, and wealth using data on time since arrival, career histories, and information on the performance of parents and children.  This will make it possible to assess how the relative performance of immigrants and natives has changed over long periods of time and to learn how much of the change in relative performance has resulted from structural changes in the U.S. and world economies and how much has resulted from changes in the legal restrictions placed upon immigration.  Answers to these questions are particularly relevant when the role of immigrants in the U.S. economy is under greater scrutiny than at any time since the Immigration Commission's Report of 1911 which prompted the imposition of the quota system.",
