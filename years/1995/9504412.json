 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced real-time systems, such as the Next Generation Workstation/Machine Controller (NGC) for  automated factories, require built-in database support for concurrent data access. However,  conventional database systems do not provide the performance levels or response time guarantees needed  by these real-time applications. To address these needs, an object-oriented software system called  Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems (MDARTS) is being designed, implemented, and evaluated. MDARTS supports explicit specification of real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an object-granularity level. Unlike other approaches, MDARTS has built-in strategies to examine these specifications at runtime during application initialization and to dynamically adjust its data management configuration on a per-object basis to provide real-time guarantees. For maximum performance on shared-memory multiprocessors, MDARTS supports concurrent, direct shared-memory data access. This unique design achieves transaction execution times two to three orders of magnitude faster than current real-time d atabase systems. In summary, the contributions of this project are two-fold. One, novel database technologies will be introduced, including methodologies for providing  probabilistic and hard real-time guarantees and the implementation of an open multiprocessor database  architecture providing extremely high levels of performance. Two, MDARTS technology will be applied to develop distributed, open architecture controllers for actual manufacturing machine tools, evaluating  its effectiveness for addressing the high-performance real-time data management needs of manufacturing  applications.",
