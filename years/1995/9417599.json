 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417599  Katz  Mirror symmetry, since its discovery about five years ago, has  been under intense investigation by both physicists and  mathematics.  From the viewpoint of physics, mirror symmetry  provides a powerful computational tool for extracting the  properties of a broad class of string compactifications; it has  also led to arguments establishing that there are physical  processes in string theory resulting in unusual developments such  as space-time topology change.  From the viewpoint of  mathematics, mirror symmetry uncovers a hitherto unknown  structure in algebraic geometry which shows a deep connection  between a priori distinct algebraic varieties through their  common conformal field theory.  This physical connection, among  other things, allows for the calculation of various topological  properties which have proven intractable using more standard  mathematical methods.  recent research in mirror symmetry has  underscored the unusual degree to which it serves as an arena  where physical and mathematical methods can be harmoniously  united to produce important results for both fields of study.  The Mirror Symmetry Workshop will be held at Oklahoma State  University February 9-12, 1995.  The efficacy of this workshop  will be augmented by its taking place during a Special Year in  Algebraic Geometry which will be held at Oklahoma State  University during the 1994-95 academic year with partial support  from the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the National  Science Foundation.  ***",
