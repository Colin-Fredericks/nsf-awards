 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently-developed theoretical insights and numerical methods will  be used to generate and solve new mathematical models for  interpreting measured spatial and temporal distributions of waves  and associated particle velocity distributions in the magnetosphere  and heliosphere.  Emphasis will be on the evolution of beam-excited  waves, wave-accelerated particles, and beam relaxation, using  kinetic, fluid and hybrid models.  Innovative higher dimensional  two-time-scale fluid codes designed  to mimic linear and nonlinear  kinetic effects will be developed and solved on the NCAR  supercomputers, with lower dimensional versions tested against  Vlasov codes.  In collaboration with experiments from the Berkeley  Space Sciences Laboratory, theoretical models will be constructed  and numerically analyzed, and the results compared with in-situ  rocket and satellite measurements  of electrons, ions, magnetized-  electron-plasma waves and lower-hybrid wave structures in the  magnetosphere.  Relevant magnetospheric wave and particle data will  come from the Alaska-88, Bidarca and Alaska-95 rockets, the  imminent Fast Explorer and satellite, the Swedish satellite Freja,  and the Cornell Topaz rocket campaigns.  We will construct and  numerically analyze closely related mathematical models, which  describe similar fundamental underlying processes common to beam-  driven Langmuir wave turbulence found in the electron foreshock of  Earth's bow shock and in the solar wind, during solar radio  emissions, and postulated as the source of the heliospheric  emission measured by Voyager 1 and 2.  Theoretical predictions will  be compared with high-time resolution data on particle  distributions and Langmuir waves in the electron foreshock and in  the solar wind expected from the WIND satellite, to be launched in  November of 1994.",
