 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly expanding technology of cellular communications, wireless LAN, and  satellite services will make it possible for users to access information  anywhere and at anytime.  In  this environment, users will be mobile, use low  powered computers, and communicate with the network  over narrow bandwidth  links.  Such an environment introduces new challenges in the design of  communication mechanisms due to constraints such as bandwidth, energy, cost, and  the availability of  computing resources due to host mobility.  Hence,  communication protocols should be designed for  adaptability to changing  environments brought by mobility.  The research project will design and build  support for mobile communications applications that explicitly take into account  bandwidth  limitations, energy limitations, and mobility using the following  approaches:    (1) The communication  between the client and the server will be  via an intermediary. Indirect interaction allows for  optimization and  development of specialized protocols for the wireless link and mobile host  without  having to change any protocol that  is running on the fixed hosts.  (2)  Design environment aware  communication primitives that will have access to the  current environment state and also be notified  about any changes.  Thus, the  type of communication to use can be tailored to the prevailing  conditions.",
