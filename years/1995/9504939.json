The topic of the workshop has  been chosen to maximize the possibilities for overlap and  constructive exchange between condensed matter physics,  field theory, and mathematical physics.  Quantum impurity  problems have attracted great attention in recent years due  to strong interest in mechanisms for the breakdown of Fermi  liquid theory in the context of high-temperature  superconductivity, the development of nanofabrication  techniques for realization of artificial impurities on a  mesoscopic scale, and successful application of new  theoretical methods such as conformal field theory and the  extrapolation of lattice problems to large spacial  dimensionalities.  The workshop will bring together workers  from all of the above fields to share ideas, in keeping with  the interdisciplinary purpose of its sponsor, the Institute  for Fundamental Theory at the University of Florida.  %%%  This grant provides partial support for the workshop  \"Quantum Impurity Problems\" to be held February 24-26, 1995  at the University of Florida.  This workshop will bring together scientists, both  experimentalists and theorists, from a variety of  subdisciplines to share ideas in an interdisciplinary way on  topics and techniques related to quantum impurities in  materials.  The support will help junior researchers and  students attend this workshop.  The workshop is unique, not  part of a continuing series, and in an emerging research  area.  For the above reasons, the Materials Theory Program  feels support is a wise investment of program resources. ***",
