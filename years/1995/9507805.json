This inquiry has focused on developing theories  that illuminate speaker competence and it has led to many  interesting and successful predictions about cross-linguistic  similarities and differences. However, as this reqearch has grown  to incorporate a greater variety of within-language and  cross-linguistic data, it has become increasingly clear that  certain phenomena that have been given widely accepted syntactic  explanations (for instance, constraints on question formation or  the distribution of pronouns) quite possibly cannot be analyzed  in exclusively syntactic terms without an undesirable impact on  the explanatory value of the syntactic theories themselves.    Consequently, it is essential to explore seriously the question  of how the greater incorporation of nonsyntactic explanations  into linguistic research could deepen our understanding of  problematic linguistic phenomena and, at the same time,  strengthen syntactic theory. We will hold a workshop as a forum  for such an exploration, with the following overarching goals:            identifying clear and convincing arguments that some or       all aspects of a given linguistic phenomenon must or cannot       be analyzed syntactically;           identifying and evaluating specific proposals for       nonsyntactic analyses of natural language phenomena;           exploring the implications of candidate nonsyntactic       analyses for syntactic theory; and           exploring whether and how nonsyntactic analyses of       linguistic phenomena can be expressed in a       \"parameterizable\" theory that can cover typologically       diverse languages.    Among the topics to be explored in the workshop will be:  constraints on extraction, bound variable anaphora, and th e  \"triggering\" of movement. These examples all share the potential  of being illuminated by a theory or theories of the informational  import of sentences -particularly their presuppositional  properties and informational articulation.",
