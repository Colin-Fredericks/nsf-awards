 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520277  Lee  To reduce the damages to reinforced  concrete columns and to prevent  their collapse due to strong  multidirectional ground motions,  the use of concrete filled tubular  (CFT) columns is an attractive  option.  In 1992, an NSF Workshop  for U.S. Japan Cooperative Research  on Composite and Hybrid Structures  recommended that the CFT column  system be one of the four research  areas to be emphasized in  earthquake engineering research.  In recent years a large number of  cyclic loading tests on CFT  specimens of the circular type has  been conducted.  These tests were  primarily subjected to combined  compression and torsion.  Results  showed that CFT members can deliver  high ultimate strength with large  ductility.  This project will  develop appropriate mathematical  models through both analytical and  experimental investigations to  quantify the composite actions of  CFT columns under cyclic and  earthquake loading considerations.  In the experimental program, the  scale or volumetric effects and the  loading rate effects will both be  considered, shaking table tests of  three-dimensional CFT columns  system will be carried out during  the second half of this three-year  study.    This is a project supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil  Infrastructure Systems (CIS)  solicitation, NSF 94-154.  ***",
