To cope with impending water shortages, California has adopted numerous legal reforms aimed at creating a Water Market:  an institutional mechanism to facilitate the transfer of water rights from agricultural to urban and environmental uses.  In spite of continuing reforms, few long-range inter-regional water transfers have occurred.  These few actual transactions will be the focus of examination:  the parties, their interests, conflicts, and resolutions during negotiation and execution of transfer agreements, and the changing institutional milieu.  Practical results will include what urban water districts and environmental interests can reasonably expect from the best feasible water market program.  Theoretical results will include a discussion of TCE as an alternative or complementary paradigm for understanding the relationship between resource scarcity and market mechanisms.  This proposal seeks funding for four trips to agricultural and urban water districts which have successfully transferred water.  Critical details of transactions are found in actual participants files and recollections.  Onsite interviews will provide the evidence with which to test the predictions of TCE related to water markets.  %%%  The historic approach to meeting new water demand in arid California has been a technical one:  federal, state, and local agencies augmented natural river flows by building dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and groundwater wells.  For a host of economic, environmental, technical, and political reasons, additional surface water development is not expected to provide significant new resources for future needs.  Market-based reforms which promote efficient use of existing resources have been offered as a primary alternative to new construction in meeting the projected additional demand for water that will be faced by 2020.  Scholars, interest groups, policy make rs, and politicians have hailed water markets as a significant and positive future force in California water allocation decisions.  But in spite of this fanfare, only three or four longterm, interegional water transfers have been concluded in California.  Thus there appears to be a discontinuity between expectation/perceived performance and actual performance.  Failure of the water markets strategy will have serious consequences for future water supply strategies.  This research addresses the reasons for this discontinuity and the utility of water markets through an examination of the California water market agreements.  It uses the insights of Transaction Cost Economics analyze the water markets strategy.  ***",
