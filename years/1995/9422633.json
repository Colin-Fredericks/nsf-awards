 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the credibility and professional integrity of scientific investigators have come under question, academic institutions have developed policies and guidelines regarding the ethical conduct of research.  But the policies may not be consistent with the norms of scientists or the exigencies of research careers.  The specific aim of this investigation is to characterize the professional norms of  researchers and compare them with those expressed by institutional representatives.  The investigators will develop a quantitative scenario-based survey methodology to evaluate scientists' beliefs regarding norms of professional ethics.  They will administer the survey to a sample of NSF awardees in molecular and cellular biology.  The results will be compared to those of a group of institutional representatives with expertise in research ethics.  The survey instrument will be designed with the help of three four-hour focus groups, two consisting of active scientists and one of representatives.  The instrument will use scenarios in which several factors can be varied systematically.  Subjects will be asked to give ratings of the scenarios, from fully ethical to highly unethical, and to indicate what actions, among a list of possibilities, should be taken in response.  Results will be published in articles and presented at professional meetings.  The study will lead to increased understanding of the ethical beliefs held by persons in research environments at colleges and universities.  It may assist in the development of policies and guidelines by these institutions and federal agencies and, if effective, provide a tool for further study of norms in other fields of science.",
