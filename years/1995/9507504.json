 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507504  Fendler    The objective of U.S.-Hungary research project, between Dr. Janos  Fendler of Syracuse University and Imre Dekany of Attila Jozsef  University, is to pursue fundamental work required to develop a  simple and versatile technique for constructing stable and robust  organic/inorganic composite self-assembled nanostructured films.   The researchers have demonstrated layer-by-layer self-assembly of  ordered nanostructured films composed of alternating layers of  cationic polyelectrolyte and anionic solid nanoparticles.  They  believe that this suggests a viable membrane-mimetic approach to  engineering advanced materials.  As a result of this project, the  researchers hope to achieve a high degree of stability and  relative ease of systematic chemical and physical manipulation  that will enable them to derive nanostructured films with desired  mechanical, optical, electro-optical, electrical, magnetic, and  electromagnetic properties.    This chemistry project in organic dynamics fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.   ***",
