 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drennan    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Ms. Ruth Fauman-  Fichman will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will  conduct laboratory work both in Mexico and in Albany NY to  analyze archaeological materials collected from sites in Morelos,  Mexico. These sites, occupied between 1150-1519 AD document the  span of time during which local groups were incorporated into the  Aztec empire. Ms. Fauman-Fichman will focus on materials related  to the spinning industry and the production of cotton thread. She  will analyze architectural information from excavated houses in  both urban and rural contexts; associated ceramics; artifacts  associated with women's activities such as mazie grinding  equipment, cooking pots, griddles and objects related to  spinning, weaving and embroidering. The will incorporate this  information with the architectural data to reconstruct activity  patterns and how these changed over time. The project also has an  experimental component and the function of spindles and related  artifacts will be determined.    Although this project focusses on one specific industry, the goal  of the work is to understand how production changes in varying  political conditions. With incorporation of Morelos into the  Aztec empire, the political situation in the region underwent  major alteration and local groups were forced to work to provide  tribute. Cotton constituted an important prehistoric good and  demands were met in this form. In technologically simple  societies, much production takes place on the household level and  Ms. Fauman-Fichman wishes to understand how these basic societal  units were impacted by and responded to these changes.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  new insight into a period of great interest to archaeologists. It  will shed new light on how, over time, basic units of society  adapt and will assist in training a promising young scientist.",
