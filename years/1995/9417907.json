 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417907  Eich    This award will partially support travel, living expenses   and publication costs for Dr. Margaret H. Eich and a   graduate research assistant from Southern Methodist University   to conduct cooperative research with Dr. Maria Orlowska and  Dr. Robert Colomb, of the Department of Computer Science at the  University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.  The  collaborative research will focus on developing new checkpointing  and recovery algorithms aimed at distributed databases.    Database checkpointing saves the state of a database on a stable  memory separate from the primary database copy.  In the event of  a failure of a primary copy, the loss can be restored using the  backup copy of the log.  Checkpointing techniques so far examined  by the Southern Methodist group require no synchronization  between transactions and checkpointing, and also facilitate a  partial recovery of the database after failure.  These features  are desirable for both a high throughput Main Memory Database  (MMDB) system, and also for a distributed database environment.    Objectives for this cooperative work are to examine techniques  for extending MMDB recovery to distributed databases.  The  specific work to be conducted will apply partition checkpointing  to distributed database environments, will expand commit and  partial recovery algorithms for distributed environments, and  will perform initial analytic studies validating the developed  approaches.  ***",
