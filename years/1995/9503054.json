 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503054  Williams    This grant provides $33,287 as one-half support for upgrades to  the Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe facility at the University  of Massachusetts.  This facility has become an essential research  and teaching tool for a diverse group of researchers from western  New England.  One particular focus of many studies is the  integration of high-resolution compositional mapping (x-ray  mapping) with high-precision quantitative analysis.  In the five  years since the microprobe was installed, Cameca has made several  improvements to the hardware and software of the SX-50, and the  new SX-100, that significantly improve the quality and efficiency  of the instrument.  Specifically, upgrades will be made to four  essential subsystems of the SX-50: (1) autofocusing (2) fast  image acquisition, (3) frame buffering, and (4) replacement of a  SUN 3 computer with a SPARC 5.  The first two items will allow  users to collect high-resolution qualitative and quantitative  data much more quickly and efficiently.  Frame buffering offers a  much improved method for viewing electron images and for  integrating these images with other compositional or optical data  sets.  The upgraded computer is required for running the new and  dramatically improved version of the Cameca software.  The  proposed upgrades are essential for the laboratory to remain a  state-of-the-art research facility and to keep its position as  one cornerstone of the analytical community of western New  England.    ***",
