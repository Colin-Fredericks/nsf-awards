 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coakley  Oregon State University is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation and repair of   the  controlled environment facilities in Cordley Hall, home to the Departments of  Botany and Plant Pathology, Entomology, and Zoology.  The research and research  training performed in the departments focuses on increasing the knowledge and  understanding of biological responses to the environment.  Research programs of 28  faculty that will benefit from the renovations are grouped into four categories:   environmental biology, cellular and molecular biology, host-parasite interactions, and  genetics, developmental, and evolutionary biology.  Environmental biologists  investigate issues of global environmental change and their effect on biological  diversity and biological productivity in animal and plant species.  Cellular and  molecular biology research includes developing methods for using biotechnology to  manage the effects of global change. Investigative studies, in genetics, developmental  and evolutionary biology, include research on the genetic and hormonal regulation of  morphogenesis and gene expression, and how these control the development in plants  and animals.  The goal of the research program is to gain a better understanding of  the processes that contribute to more sustainable ecosystems and maintenance of  biological diversity.  The absence of sufficient controlled environment rooms  currently limits the scope of  projects that faculty can undertake.  Due to antiquated systems and absence of  protective and back-up mechanisms, valuable experiments have been lost following  power failures. Renovations of these rooms and of the sea water and fresh water  aquariums will have a major impact on the ability of the faculty to conduct research  and research training.  Several capabilities not available, including dedicated space for  plant and insect studies, dew deposition, photobiology, seed storage and containments  of transgenic plants, will be available once renovations are comple ted.  Such  improved facilities will enhance the Department to pursue new research opportunities.",
