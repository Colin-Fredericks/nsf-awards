 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a computer-based laboratory for improving the  teaching of research design and analysis skills in the psychology  curriculum.   The general objective is to improve students'  competence, interest, and experience in conducting and analyzing  research with computer equipment.   This may serve as a model for  comprehensive regional universities in widening the pool of  future researchers.   Students in a two-semester Research Design  & Analysis sequence gain experience using a wide range of modern  research methods on the computers; these experiences are tied to  course objectives to improve understanding and skills in design  and analysis.   Students design, conduct, and analyze their own  original research using the laboratory and are better prepared to  enter graduate school and pursue careers in research.   The  laboratory is also used in other lower- and upper-level  psychology classes to provide firsthand experience with research  methods covered during class and is available to students working  on individual research projects.   Hardware and software is being  chosen to maximize flexibility and ease of learning, and use of  the equipment is being integrated into the Research Design &  Analysis curriculum.",
