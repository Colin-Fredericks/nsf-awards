 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411142  Stetson  This award supports the participation of eight U.S. social and political scientists (including  two graduate students) in an international research planning workshop to be held in Western  Europe in March, 1995.  This activity was jointly organized by Professors Dorothy  McBride Stetson of Florida Atlantic University, Amy Mazur of Washington State  University, and Joyce Outshoorn of the University of Leiden, The Netherlands.  The  workshop will bring together U.S. and European scholars in political science and sociology  for the purpose of establishing priorities for comparative research on institutionalized  feminism and preparing research designs to conduct cross-national investigations of research  questions and hypotheses.  Invited participants in the workshop have expertise in  comparative politics and social theory, and research experience on the phenomenon of  women s policy institutions in one or more countries.  The U.S. participants will benefit  from the opportunity of working with counterparts from European countries where there is  a long tradition of inquiry into state theories.    Some of the most far-reaching changes in Western societies in the last 100 years have been  related to the changes in gender roles, specifically those associated with the massive  movement of women into the paid labor force and the parallel shifts in family relations,  child rearing and  political participation.  The term  state feminism  refers to the creation  of government agencies assigned to improve the status of women.  These include a variety  of forms from specialized bureaus or ministerial level offices to equal opportunity councils.  The workshop and ensuing collaborative research promises to make important contributions  to the development of empirically grounded theory of state capacities and state-society  relations.  ***",
