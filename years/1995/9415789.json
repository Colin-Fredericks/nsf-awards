Among these gaps are lack of data on: 1) small  watersheds of different morphoclimatic zones and their  ability/efficiency, relative to larger watersheds, to transport  materials to the oceans, 2) transport of material through lagoonal  estuarine systems, the mixing rates of which are slow and the  mixing zones large, and 3) inputs of material to coastal waters in  groundwater.    Research is proposed to address these gaps through investigations  on three types of under-studied systems with the following  objectives:    A) To obtain a better understanding of products resulting from  arctic-subarctic weathering, the fate of these materials (primary  trace elements) in the freshwater-seawater mixing zone and relative  contribution of fluxes to the ocean from smaller rivers of this  morphoclimatic zone.  These studies will be carried out in the  Anadyr river-estuary system in Northeastern Russia.    B) To identify the major biogeochemical interactions that control  trace element fluxes through a lagoonal estuary, taking advantage  of the slow mixing rate/long residence times of materials in such  systems to obtain better resolution of solute-master variable  relationships during mixing in the low salinity region.  The Patos  Lagoons, in Southern Brazil will provide the field site for these  investigators.    C) To determine the composition and concentrations of subterranean  weathering products associated with the Floridan Aquifer and to  investigate biogeochemical processes that influence the fate of  trace elements upon entering the marine environment. Freshwater  springs, which discharge directly into coastal waters of the West  Florida shelf, and the adjacent coastal waters will pr ovide the  site for these studies.",
