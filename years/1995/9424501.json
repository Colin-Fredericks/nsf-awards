Both  collocated as well as  noncollocated control  configurations will be  considered. A general control  methodology and guide lines  will be developed. Stability  conditions for vanishingly  small gains, in the presence  of time delays, when actuator  and sensor are collocated,  will be found for (a)undamped,  (b) classically damped, and  (c)nonclassically damned  structural systems.  The time  delays which cause instability  for collocated feedback  control will be utilized  to achieve infinitesimal gains  stability for noncollocated  feedback control systems.  All  analytical results will be  applied to a simple five  degree-of-freedom system for  numerical verifications.    This study will help  understand the effects of  small time delays, which are  inevitable in the feedback  loop, on the stability of the  closed loop control systems.  The results will have  immediate and direct  application to the robust  control of a wide variety of  structural and mechanical  systems in dynamic  environments, especially  in the suppression of  vibrations generated by  earthquake ground shaking.  ***",
