 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to achieve in electron optics what  was done in light optics over two hundred years ago: that is, to  develop the electron optical equivalent of the acromat. When completed,  this will be the first practical device to simultaneously correct both  spherical and chromatic aberrations in electron optics. The two key  elements are an electron mirror and a beam separating system. The  mirror has aberrations of opposite sign from those of conventional  electron lenses and thus provides a means of canceling out aberrations.  This grant renewal seeks funds to carry out the third phase of this  project. The first phase covered the design and construction of an  electron mirror, beam separator, and the electron lenses, and  theoretical and experimental investigations of the mirror properties  (G. F. Rempfer J Appl. Phys. 67, 6027-6040 (1990)). The second phase  (just completed) produced the first successful demonstration of the  correction of chromatic aberration by means of an electron mirror (G.  F. Rempfer and M. S. Mauck, Optik (1992) 86, 3-8), and the completion  of an advanced electron optical bench to carry out high precision  testing of an aberration corrector. The goal of the proposed third  phase is to utilize this unique resource, (the new electron optical  bench, the only one in existence designed for branched systems), to  demonstrate correction of spherical aberration, and simultaneous  correction of chromatic and spherical aberration. When the conditions  for correction have been established, resolution tests will be  performed. Tests will be done first in the probe mode. The correction  parameters will then be adjusted for cancellation of aberrations in the  photoelectron microscope (PEM), and resolution tests will be performed  in the PEM mode. The bench studies will lead to optimum positioning of  the components of the optical system and locations of the feedthroughs,  manipulators, and ports, so that a less bulky vacuum housing can be  designed which wi ll serve the purpose of providing a workable prototype  instrument. The new housing will free up the optical bench for  continuing experiments with other branched systems.                A promising byproduct of this research is the beam separator,  which can serve to separate the incident and returning beams in a low  energy electron microscope/mirror electron microscope (LEEM/MEM). In  fact, the first LEEM and MEM images of biological specimens (cultured  mammalian cells) were recently obtained with the beam separating system  developed as part of this project (O H. Griffith et al., J Micros. 168,  249-258 (1991)). Because the branched system is common to both LEEM/MEM  and corrected PEM, the new vacuum housing for the corrected-PEM can be  designed to enable LEEM and MEM studies as well. The research planned  for this proposed five-year NSF grant renewal will result in an  aberration-corrected lens system (i.e. an electron optical acromat) and  a modular instrument intended primarily for corrected PEM, but capable  also of LEEM and MEM. The higher resolution PEM should produce sharp  imagines of DNA and DNA-protein complexes having information  (photoelectron contrast) not available in the present imaging methods.  Other applications include receptor distributions on the surfaces of  normal and malignant cells, and imaging membranes and cytoskeletal  elements. A hallmark of this research collaboration between a physics  and engineering team (at Portland State University in Portland) and a  molecular biology group (at the University of Oregon, Eugene) is the  rapid application in the biological sciences of the instrumental  advances funded by this NSF grant.",
