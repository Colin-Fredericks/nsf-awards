The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Ellen M. Sentovich to work with Dr. Gerard  Berry at the Ecole des Mines de Paris.    The researchers will explore effective computer-aided design  tools (CAD)for synthesizing control systems. The study will  focus on encoding controllers, optimizing register selection  and analyzing combinational cycles.  Control-intensive  electronic systems employed in a variety of new  applications, including automotive, avionic and robotic  controlq and communications systems, are difficult to design  correctly because they employ a mix of hardware and software  components.  Furthermore, the design process is complicated  by stringent design requirements and time-to-market  constraints. State-of-the-art tools are still not capable of  producing optimal, correct and complete control systems. It  is the goal of this research to combine the expertise of the  host engineers, specifying and compiling control-intensive  systems, with that of the postdoctoral fellow's logic  synthesis and optimization to further the research to create  effective CAD tools to meet the design constraints. ***",
