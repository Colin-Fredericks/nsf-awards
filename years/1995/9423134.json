It will reveal who are the participants in the dispute, what are the sociolegal strategies they employ, how their differing definitions of community generate differing sociolegal  strategies, and how their language shapes and is shaped by these processes.  The project will last for twelve months.  It involves field research in four settings, each of which involved distinct processes:  community council meetings, regional forest activist meetings, state legislation, and federal adjudication.  The research will be ethnographic;  it will include participant observation, audio taping of public speech events, and personal interviews.  Conversation analysis will be used to analyze fully the interactions of participants.  The research will contribute to sociocultural understanding of a contemporary political issue and its public policy implications by focusing on participant perceptions and understandings of one another, institutional settings, and dispute processes.  %%%  This research analyzes dispute processes in Washington state bearing on the Pacific Northwest forest dispute in the United States.  The Northwest forest dispute has arisen because of conflicting views of the definition and use of the region's forest resources and over the social and biological consequences of forest redefinition.  At the federal level, the dispute is guided by litigation challenging the adequacy of environmental protections in federal forest policies.  Litigation over this issue has existed and continues to exist as policy makers, activists, and local community members struggle over what are appropriate environmental protection policies.  At the state level, the dispute is guided by the needs of timber areas that would be negatively affected by environmental protection regulations.  At the community level, diverse groups have involved themselves in the dispute.  It will re veal who are the participants in the dispute, what are the sociolegal strategies they employ, how their differing definitions of community generate differing sociolegal  strategies, and how their language shapes and is shaped by these processes.    ***",
