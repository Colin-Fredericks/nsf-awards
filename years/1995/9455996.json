 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics faculty at Wentworth have been employing active  learning strategies characteristic of the calculus reform movement  at all levels of mathematics courses for students of engineering  technology since 1989. This student population is motivated  primarily by perceived relevance of subject matter to specific  technical problems. They are developing, through joint efforts of  mathematics and technical faculty, laboratory investigations using  engineering laboratories and multi-media simulations which  illustrate and teach mathematical concepts.  This planning project  begins at the intermediate algebra/trigonometry level and continues  through differential equations, and includes the finite  mathematics/statistics track for manufacturing students. 100  sections per year, containing 2500 students, will be affected.   Through the Southeast Massachusetts TECH PREP Consortium, Wentworth  is taking the lead in extending the secondary level \"integrated  curriculum\" reforms of Tech Prep to the college level. Tech Prep  consists of alliances of secondary and post secondary schools in a  (2+2) format for technical education.  The Wentworth project is  serving as a national model for colleges of engineering technology  in integrating the learning of mathematics with technical  applications.",
