 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory-based workshop and international symposium is jointly organized by Prof. Gerald Schatten of the Dept. of  Zoology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Prof. Barry Fabian, of the Dept. of  Zoology, University of Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The event, to take place January 5-24, 1996, at the U. of Witwatersrand, has manifold objectives:  to enhance the level of cell and developmental biology teaching and research; to encourage and give visibility to the work of scientists who are members of under-represented groups; to strengthen Africa regional networking through the formation of the African Society of Cell and Developmental Biology; and to stimulate collaborative research projects between US and African scientists. The organizers have marshalled the loan of demonstration advanced imaging equipment and personnel from an international array of manufacturers.  By bringing advanced instrumentation and expertise to a central location, the workshop will enable some two dozen qualified young investigators from various parts of Africa to perform experiments themselves, become familiar with the techniques and capabilities of the technology, and, it is hoped, inspire them to pass on these tools to their own trainees.  NSF is supporting the participation of five scientist-instructors (four from the U.S. and one from Kenya), plus five African trainee-participants, at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral and young-investigator level, from throughout Africa.  This activity will strengthen the capacity of young researchers in Africa to use advanced techniques; promote experimentation in novel animal and plant species; and stimulate beneficial networking between a center of excellence in South Africa and institutions in other African countries.",
