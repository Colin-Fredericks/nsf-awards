 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521719  Kanade  An international workshop \"Toward a Research Agenda and  Infrastructure Development in Computer Assisted Diagnosis  and Therapy\" is to held in the Spring of 1996 and will be  convened at a conference center near Bristol, England.  The  goals of the workshmp are to: 1) Produce an inventory, at an  international level, of the medical, engineering, and  computer science research in medical robotics, computer  assisted diagnosis and therapy, and virtual reality in  medicine and telemedicine. 2) Develop a five year research  agenda and development plan, and 3) Elucidate measures that  could promote the establishment of an infrastructure to  facilitate the development of the field.  The workshop  report is to be widely disseminated in electronic and  printed formats, and a printed report of the project  recommendations will be produced.  The project has important  implications to NSF and other research grant-making  agencies, as well as the nation's research community, for  planning research programs and the allocation of limited  resources in this area.    The workshop organizers have high competence in organizing  and directing large scientific meetings.  The planning  process for the workshop involves an innovative technique  wherein the workshop participants will contribute to the  preparation of a \"pre-workshop document\" to facilitate  deliberations and conclusions during the three day meeting.  Much of the planning process is to be conducted using  INTERNET to hold \"virtual\" meetings of the workshop  Executive Oversight Committee.  NSF funds will support only  the U.S. participants.  Expenses of attendees from other  countries will be borne by their own institutions or  government agencies.    Biomedical engineering research in medical robotics and  their interventional procedures holds high promise for the  development of the technologies needed to provide new  capabilities to diagnosticians and therapists, to the  reduction of patient morbidity and mortality, and, in  certain  cases, to lowering the cost of health care.  The  workshop is expected to contribute significantly to progress  in this area of research and technological development.  ***",
