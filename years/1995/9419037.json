 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419037     Jeffrey  There is now strong evidence that ultraviolet radiation is  increasing over certain locations on the Earth's surface.  Of  primary concern has been the annual pattern of ozone depletion  over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean where ozone levels have  declined as much as 74% compared to pre-ozone hole events.   Reduction of ozone concentration in the stratosphere has been  shown to result in an increase levels of ultraviolet radiation.   The impact of increased ultraviolet radiation due to ozone  depletion upon phytoplankton and primary production has received  extensive interest, while the effects on bacteria have been  largely overlooked.  It is apparent from previous studies in both  the Southern Ocean and elsewhere that bacteria play a vital role  in mineralization of nutrients and provide a trophic link to  higher organisms.  The objectives of this study are identify DNA  damage in bacterioplankton resulting from ultraviolet radiation  and as a function of ozone depletion, relate the intensity of the  induction of DNA repair genes (recA) to the extent of damage, and  estimate the effect of the stress on carbon fluxes through  bacterial assemblages.  Sensitive new advances in molecular  biology to identify photoproducts and examine the induction of  cellular DNA repair mechanisms will be coupled with traditional  approaches for measuring bacterial biomass and production.   Pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts and cyclobutane dimers  are the unique photoproducts created by ultraviolet radiation.   These DNA lesions may be identified using radioimmunoassays.  The  recA gene is wide spread and highly conserved among bacteria.   Because of the pivotal role of this gene in repairing damaged  DNA, its concentration and activity will be used as a direct  assay of the bacterial response to DNA damage.  With measurements  of bacterial biomass, production and growth efficiency, subtle  effects on bacterial carbon fluxes will be estimated.  The  results will provide information  on the amount of UV induced  molecular damage and repair mechanisms in planktonic populations.   Both ultraviolet-A radiation and ultraviolet-B radiation create  cellular damage, while only ultraviolet-B radiation is enhanced  as a result of ozone depletion.  Through simultaneous analysis of  DNA damage and the induction of the recA gene as a general  response to damage, the effect of ultraviolet-B radiation will be  contrasted with other mechanisms of DNA damage.  Additional  information will be provided on the effects on total production  and further elucidate the interactions of bacteria and  phytoplankton production in the Southern Ocean.",
