 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiclassical quantum gravity is a bridge between the  classical theory of Einstein and a full quantum theory of  gravity whose exact nature is not yet known.  It therefore  applies to phenomena that are both close to the classical  theory of gravity, but have implications for the search for  a quantum theory of gravity.  Several investigations into  semiclassical quantum gravity will be carried out.  These  include an investigation into the pair production of charged  black holes.  Investigations into the nature of the full  theory of quantum gravity will also be carried out.  A  problem of particular importance is the status in quantum  gravity of the singularities which limit the predictive  power of the classical theory.  This will be investigated  using the techniques of string theory.  The objective is to  establish whether singularities are smoothed out or removed  at this fundamental level.    A central issue of modern cosmology is the problem of  providing a theory of the initial condition of the universe  which will make testable predictions for observations today.  Since gravitation is the dominant force governing the  structure of the universe on the largest scales of space and  time, and since the early universe is likely to be quantum  mechanical in an essential way, the search for this initial  condition is carried out in that branch of quantum gravity  called quantum cosmology.  A broad based research program  will be carried out into the nature of this initial  condition, the generalizations of quantum mechanics which  may be needed for its interpretation, and the models which  allow for comparison of its predictions with observations.  The objective of this research is to encapsulate the  simplicity of the early universe as revealed by observation,  together with the features which arise out of this  simplicity, in one physical law.",
