 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded computing systems must be designed to meet hard, soft,   performance, cost and other constraints.  This research studies the  synthesis of embedded systems built from multiple processors, which  may be commercial or application-specific ICs connected in a  network.  This methodology, co-synthesis, aims to simultaneously  design the hardware and software architectures of a system.   Algorithms for meeting all constraints through iteration of both  the hardware architecture of the distributed computing engine and  the process architecture of the application software are being  investigated.  The model for the research is the task graph and  distributed system graph.  These are being extended based on  simultaneous design the hardware and software, stronger assumptions  about processes in the task graph, and simultaneous scheduling,  allocation, and partitioning of processes during co-synthesis.   Mathematical optimization methods, such as graph partitioning and  network flow, are being used to generate effective design  algorithms.",
