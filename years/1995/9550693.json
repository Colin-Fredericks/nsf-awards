 "awd_abstract_narration": "As we move into the 21st century, science and technology play an  increasingly important role in all aspects of our society;  therefore, it is imperative that our future decision-makers develop  a positive attitude toward solving problems through science  education as well as to comprehend the impact of science and  technology on the individual, culture and society.    The New Haven SPACES Initiative will identify 50 youth with at-risk  factors operating in their personal lives.  They will be enrolled  in the New Haven SPACES Initiative and participate in a three-level  program designed to develop positive attitudes in personal growth,  career development and interpersonal and global relations.    The proposed six-week summer camp will provide an intensive hands-  on experience with science and math activities for youth entering  the seventh, eight and ninth grades.  An important part of the  program will focus on aquatic ecology featuring canoe trips down  the Quinnipiac River to Long Island Sound.  The activities planned  for such a camp would accomplish the following objectives:   Positive Youth Development- Experiential education has proven  effective for knowledge gain and development of positive attitudes  and life skills.  This program would provide participants  development opportunities that enhance positive self-esteem,  feelings of accomplishment, responsible decision-making and problem  solving, and communication and personal management skills.  Improve  Science and Math Literacy- The summer camp setting will create and  informal participatory setting within which to foster  scientifically literate individuals who will effectively use their  science education to make wise decisions and become responsible,  problem-solving citizens.  Through active participation, youth will  learn how science and math relate to their lives and how they, as  individuals, impact their environment.  By using operational  processes of science and math in informal settings, the  participants will develop  a positive attitude toward learning.   Career Preparation-The activities planned will allow participants  to explore a variety of science and math careers.  Interaction with  professionals in these fields will enhance their experience and  knowledge.  Improved literacy skills will prepare participants for  productive employment in the fields of science and math  ***",
