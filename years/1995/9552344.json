 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory uses the concept of Signal Integrity to augment  the curricula in electromagnetics and high-speed digital design  (both at the VLSI and board levels) for junior and senior level  students in computer and electrical engineering.  The  proliferation of high-speed (> 50 MHz) digital designs requires  that computer engineering students develop a sophisticated  understanding of the electromagnetic effects of signal  propagation in various media.   The experiments performed in this  lab describe the use of time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and  time-domain transmission (TDT), in conjunction with simulation  and analysis, for identifying, measuring and solving signal  integrity problems.   The experiments serve both to illustrate  the course material in electromagnetics and to educate the  students as to its usefulness.   This applications-oriented  laboratory also serves to increase interest in the  electromagnetics curriculum, particularly amongst computer  engineering students.  Mixed-signal (analog/digital) circuits  have come into their own for wireless networks and can be  expected in avionics and intelligent highway applications, as  well both personal and commercial navigation.   A funded program  for retraining in the design of mixed-signal integrated circuits  may draw upon this laboratory as a remedial resource, and will  serve as an object lesson to current undergraduates about the  broad relevance of electromagnetics fundamentals.  Educational  objectives include the concept of wave transmission and  reflection, impedance matching in digital/mixed signal systems,  understanding the problems, possibilities, and techniques of  high-speed measurements, and an introduction to fast digital  oscillography.   The laboratory will also serve as a resource for  generating and evaluating realistic design exercises in  high-speed circuit fabrication.",
