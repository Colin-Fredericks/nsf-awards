 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552950  Wilensky    This proposal is to develop two plans: research and education plans  geared to providing Connected Mathematics experiences for students  from middle school through graduate school.    The content area of the research plan is learning about  \"complexity\". Complexity is the study of systems in which phenomena  or global behaviors arise from the interactions of simpler parts.  Many everyday phenomena exhibit complex behavior: the growth of a  snowflake crystal, the perimeter pattern of a maple leaf, the  advent of a summer squall, the dynamics of the Dow Jones or of a  fourth grade classroom. These are all systems which can be modeled  as composed of many distributed but interacting parts. They all  exhibit non-linear or emergent qualities which place them well  beyond the scope of current K-12 mathematics curricula.    The research goals of this plan are 1) To understand how learners  make sense of complex phenomena; and 2) To design tools and  activities that foster the building of intuitive conceptions of  complexity.    The research hypothesis is that: learners, through building their  own computational models using modeling environments, can build  intuitions about complexity and make sense of complex phenomena.  Even learners not usually considered good at mathematics and  science can build models that demonstrate a qualitatively greater  level of mathematical achievement than is usually found in  mathematics classrooms. In contrast to the prevailing view,  probability and statistics is an example of a complex domain in  which learners can develop intuitions.    The target population for this research is primarily high school  students, though some research will be conducted with younger and  older students and pre-service teachers as well. Several content  domains will be used as the source of phenomena to be modeled in  the proposed research. A particular focus will be using probability  and statistics as tools to understand complex phenomena, and in so  doing Building  intuitive conceptions of both the probabilistic  tools and the complex phenomena.  ***",
