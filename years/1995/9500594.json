 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  OPP-9522626    This workshop will bring together Arctic indigenous people and applied health scientists from the United States, Canada and Siberia to discuss ethical issues in health research. Many of these issues involve social and cultural communication and the linkages between rapid social change and health status. This linkage is recognized by the U.S. Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984 and the Polar Research Board of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The objectives of the workshop are to significantly extend the current dialogue between health researchers and indigenous peoples' organizations in the circumpolar north, to exchange information on health research ethics, to adopt principles on health research ethics which may be adopted by the circumpolar nations, and to ensure indigenous participation in the development of these principles. The workshop will take place in Inuvik, Canada on June 2-3, 1995. U.S. support is being provided for Alaskan and Russian participants. Canada is supporting Canadian, Greenlandic and European participation.  ***     ??",
