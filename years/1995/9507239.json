 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507239  Walsh    The  broad outlines of the evolution of how animals  excrete  their  waste nitrogen are reasonably well understood.  Fully  aquatic  animals  typically excrete ammonia  as  their  main  nitrogenous waste product because the water surrounding them  will   dilute  the  toxic  ammonia.  Terrestrial  and  semi-  terrestrial  animals,  in order to conserve  water,  excrete  nitrogenous waste products like as urea and uric  acid  that  are   less  toxic  and  can  be  stored  safely  at   higher  concentrations.    The  production  of  these   less   toxic  compounds is costly, however, because of their higher energy  content.  In  spite  of this expense,  one  fish,  the  gulf  toadfish, has recently been shown to synthesize and  excrete  urea.   This   research  is  aimed  at   understanding   the  biochemical  pathways  the fish uses  to  make  urea,  their  similarity  to  those  of  terrestrial  organisms,  and  the  genetic   basis  for  this  ability.   Field  studies   will  determine what advantage this ability provides in an aquatic  environment.     Preliminary    results    indicate     that  environmental  stress  induces the  fish  to  make  urea.  A  variety  of biochemical, physiological, molecular and  field  techniques  will be used both in the laboratory and  in  the  fish's  natural  setting  to  identify  synthetic  pathways,  control mechanisms, and the functional significance of  urea  excretion.  This research should provide unique insight into  the  genetic  mechanisms,   physiological  significance  and  evolution  of an important physiological trait in vertebrate  animals.   Ultimately, it may lead to genetic advances  that  would  enable  culture  of fish that make  urea  instead  of  ammonia  that  could  simplify high-density  aquaculture  by  reducing   the   need   to  control   ammonia   levels.   If  environmental  stress  is the trigger  that  initiates  urea  production, the abundance of the fish may make it  a  useful  bioassay for biologically im portant changes in coastal water  environments.",
