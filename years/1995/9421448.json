 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421448  Forehand  Homeostasis is the process by which the body maintains temperature,  blood pressure, digestion, and a variety of other physiological  functions necessary for life.  Homeostasis is controlled  unconsciously through connections of the autonomic nervous system.   Control centers in the brainstem regulate organ function via their  connections with neurons in the spinal cord and peripheral ganglia.   It is clear that optimum organ function can be achieved only by a  fine matching of command neurons with their targets, yet it is  unclear how cells in the developing autonomic nervous system convey  to one another critical information about their position and  destinations.  Recent studies have begun to elucidate the  organization of embryonic preganglionic thoracic neurons into  discrete groups of cells.  These neurons are located in the spinal  cord and send information from the brain to a series of autonomic  ganglia via processes called axons.  This research is designed to  determine how these axons find the appropriate autonomic ganglia so  that the message is received by the correct ganglion cells.   Preganglionic axons must contact a number of ganglia located at the  rostral end of the body (towards the head) or at the caudal end of  the body (towards the tail or feet).  Some preganglionic axons  project rostrally and others project caudally; no axon splits to  project in both directions.  The immediate goal of the proposed  research is to determine the way in which these axons make this  choice.  One set of experiments will determine the way in which the  appropriate numbers of axons that are to project in each direction  are established.  In other experiments, the way in which the axons  bundle together to project to the ganglia will be examined to  determine if axons destined to project one direction selectively  bundle with like axons.  The results of these experiments will  elucidate factors that lend a unique identity to individual pools  of preganglionic neurons.  Ultima tely, this research will define  functional cell groups of the preganglionic cell column relative to  their topographic targets and the organs they regulate.  This  experimental paradigm has the potential to provide a unique  situation for studying the general way in which topographic maps of  the body are matched to various levels of the nervous system .",
