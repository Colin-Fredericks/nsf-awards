 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the undergraduate education in Computer-  Aided Design (CAD) application in Digital System Development  Process (problem formulation, design, implementation, and  testing) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer  Science.   The objectives of this project are being achieved  through a structured laboratory development plan with a  rotational experiment at the end of each category of experiments.   Three categories of laboratory projects consist of introductory,  medium, and advanced experiments.   In a rotational experiment,  student teams rotate the project during system development  process.   During time T(i+l) team X that formulated and designed  the project during T(i), will implement the design of team X-l.   During time T(i+2) team X tests the design of team X-2, which was  implemented by team X-l.   This development plan will be  implemented in two courses.   The application of CAD methods in  course project work and laboratory projects in the undergraduate  logic design of digital systems, integrated-circuit-based system  design, application, and testing is being increased over what is  presently offered.   Major pieces of equipment and software being  purchased include six IBM PC 486 or compatible along with  operating system software, six Workview educational CAD systems  from Viewogic Inc., six Xilinx core CAD (XACT) systems, Xilinx to  Workview interface (DS391), six HP 1651B logic analyzers, two  Alpro logic programmers, and one Labview class package.   All the  software and equipment is being used in a laboratory setting.",
