 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503844  Agmon    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Ariel Agmon  of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology at the  University of California-Irvine and Dr. Yasuo Kawaguchi of  the Bio-Mimetic Control Research Center of the Institute of  Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN). Project funding will  enable Dr. Agmon to spend one year in Japan, resident at  RIKEN, in order to study the functional role of different  classes of neocortical inhibitory interneurons in the  thalamocortical circuit. Dr. Agmon has previously studied  the functional and morphological organization of  thalamocortical connections in mature and developing  animals. Dr. Kawaguchi has been instrumental in shedding  light on the rich diversity of morphological and  electrophysiological properties of inhibitory interneurons  in the cortex. Dr. Agmon will combine his expertise with  that of Dr. Kawaguchi to study the functional and  morphological organization of inhibition with the  thalamocortical circuit.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of neuronal anatomy and  physiology. The U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to  become familiar with research techniques, equipment, and  facilities at RIKEN while contributing to the overall  research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
