This conference is concerned with the  newest research and development on intelligent systems,  application to power systems, including knowledge-based systems,  neural networks, fuzzy logic, and machine learning.  The  conference is a prestigious one which is attended by key  researchers in the field from 20-30 countries.  NSF and  EPRI  supported previous ISAPs.  The conference has a good balance  between industry and university participants - about half of the  last ISAP was from industry.  Therefore, it is an important forum  for academic researchers to develop collaboration with the  industry.  This conference is also multi-disciplinary since the  diverse fields of intelligent systems and power systems are  involved.    ***",
