This Board provides a focal point  for studies related to environmental engineering and  hydrology.  The Board's objective is to improve the  scientific and technological basis for resolving important  questions and issues relating to management of water  resources.  This award is jointly supported by the  Environmental Engineering segment of the Environmental  Systems Program in the Engineering Directorate and by the  Hydrologic Sciences Program in the Directorate for  Geosciences.    An important function of the Water Sciences Technology Board  is to conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and  conferences that can be utilized for program planning  purposes.  The Board also functions as an appropriate means  for coordination of research plans with other Federal  agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE, and the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers.***",
