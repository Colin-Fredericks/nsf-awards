 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412897  Paul, V.  The University of Guam Marine Laboratory will build a  housing facility for accommodating visiting researchers  including visiting graduate students.  The 2000 sq ft  building will contain three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a  kitchen, and a living area for dormitory style  accommodations and a separate suite with two bedrooms, one  bath, and a kitchen for an apartment style unit.  Earlier  support allowed the university to complete the architectural  and engineering plans for this building.  Such a facility is  considered extremely important because 1) the institution is  in an isolated academic environment and visiting  investigators are a valuable resource for interactions and  new ideas, and 2) skyrocketing rents and a serious housing  shortage combine to make it difficult to impossible to find  adequate lodging for visitors staying less than 6 months.    The University of Guam Laboratory supports the research of 8  full-time faculty, numerous graduate and undergraduate  students, as well as visiting investigators.  The research  demands on facility have increased due to the addition of  new faculty at the laboratory, the recent establishment of  collaborative programs between the Marine Laboratory and the  University of Hawaii and the University of the Ryukyus  (Okinawa, Japan), and the awareness of the Marine Laboratory  as a resource for coral reef research by over 550 scientists  who attended the 7th International Coral Reef Symposium on  Guam in June 1992.  The new building will allow the support  of increasing numbers of visiting scientists that wish to  conduct research at the laboratory , which will in turn  enhance the research environment.",
