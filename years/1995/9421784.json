 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research by Dr. Suzanne Harris of the  Chemistry Department, University of Wyoming, on  hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts.  Approximate electronic  structure calculations (Fenske-Hall) will be used to examine both  solid state and molecular systems related to HDS.  Thiophenic  binding sites on the surfaces of active HDS catalysts, such as  ruthenium, rhodium and promoted molybdenum sulfides, will be  compared to those in model thiophenic molecules.  Calculations  will be carried out on both adsoption of thiophene at selected  surface sites on these sulfides, and on related groups of  complexes incorporating thiophenes, benzothiophenes, and  dibenzothiophenes.  These calculations will make it possible to  evaluate how the nature of the transition metal center, its  coordination geometry, the other ligands bound to the metal, and  the nature of the thiophenic ligand itself affect the binding and  activation of thiophenic molecules at one or more metal centers.       This is the first theoretical attempt to relate heterogeneous  hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions to the homogeneous chemistry  of metal thiophene complexes.  HDS is used in the petroleum  refining industry to remove sulfur from thiophenic molecules in  heavy crude oils and coal-derived liquids.  At high temperature  and hydrogen pressure, the petroleum is passed over a metal  sulfide, and the thiophene is removed.  The behavior of molecules  of metal thiophenes has been used to help understand the behavior  of the real catalyst system, but the details of the mechanism  remain unknown.  In this study, the electronic structure of metal  thiophene molecules will be compared to that of the surface of  the metal sulfide catalysts in order to better understand the  absorption and reactions of thiophenes in HDS catalysis.",
