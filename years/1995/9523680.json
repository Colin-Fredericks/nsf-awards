 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring.     This joint project by researchers at the University of Colorado and University of Alaska will increase the understanding of the feedback mechanisms in Arctic climate.  The integration of meteorological data derived from satellites with regional atmospheric models will allow better prediction of Arctic climate variables at the proposed site for the Phase 2 field experiment in 1997.  This research will necessary for planning the experiment phase of the study.",
