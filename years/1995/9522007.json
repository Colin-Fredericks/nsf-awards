 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Forbes will   investigate the dynamic phenomena associated with flexible biradicals. He   will study the mechanisms of exchange interactions which include vacuum,   sigma bonds, solvent and excluded volume. Further, the principal   investigator will investigate the theory for spin physics of correlated   polyradicals. Finally, he will elaborate the dynamic effects such as   lifetime broadening and J-modulation.  Degradation of organic compounds which are an integral part of consumer   products often occurs by means of free radicals. This is particularly   true for products that are exposed to light (i.e., polymeric materials   for containers and wrapping materials). This investigation addresses how   this reaction occurs and what are the factors which influence the course   of the reaction. Thus an understanding will facilitate how degradation by   light can either be prevented or accelerated. Finally, the results of the   study will be valuable to physicists and organic chemists.",
