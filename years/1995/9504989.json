Professors Miller and Hopkins are carrying  forward their investigation of the homotopy theory of \"elliptic  spectra.\"  This includes both arithmetic and analytic aspects,  connecting to the arithmetic of elliptic curves and to index theory  and conformal field theory.  Professor Liu's work is related; he is  studying the implications of the modular properties of elliptic  genera.  Professor Hesselholt is pursuing his analysis of algebraic  K-theory via a range of homotopy-theoretic tools associated with  topological Hochschild homology.  Professor Garoufalidis's research  focuses on the construction and analysis of 3-manifold invariants  analogous to the Vassiliev invariants of knots.       Despite the diverse nature of these research projects, they  are all reflections of a single great tide that is currently  lifting large parts of Mathematics.  Inspired largely by Physics,  many fields are in the process of moving from a study of phenomena  accessible from a \"one-dimensional\" perspective to an attack using  \"two-dimensional\" tools.  In Number Theory it is this new approach  which led to the solution of the 350-year-old Fermat Conjecture.   The final outcome remains to be seen in Topology; but already it  has yielded a much deeper understanding of large parts of homotopy  theory, as well as the celebrated constructions of new invariants  for knots and higher-dimensional geometric structures.  ***",
