 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's strategy is to use the power of advanced  workstation technology to improve the way science is taught and  learned in a multicultural university. Project activities will  have four faculty persons from biology, chemistry and the earth  sciences collaborating to develop three new interdisciplinary  courses, write 29 interactive science visualization courseware  applications, revise instructional delivery, prepare a variety of  instructional materials that can be used at other institutions,  integrate Internet resources into the classroom, and create a new  class of instructional applications that can be executed remotely  over the Internet using the World-Wide-Web protocol. This project  will annually involve about 200 students who are science majors  and 500 general education students. The goals are to increase  retention of majors and the scientific literacy of non-majors.  Courses will be offered in a highly visual, user-friendly,  computer-based learning environment that is interactive, powerful  and intuitive. Language barriers are less of a problem in an  interactive environment utilizing pictures, animations, sounds,  graphs, words and numbers where science can be seen, heard and  explored. More fully engaging students in thinking and problem  solving will allow them to learn better. Also, techniques,  concepts and demonstrations which are too expensive, dangerous or  do not lend themselves to traditional modes of instruction can be  taught despite pedagogical obstacles. Project results will be  disseminated through publication, professional presentations, and  be made available nationally over the Internet.",
