This fellowship opportunity will  enable Dr. Liverance to begin a collaborative research  effort with Dr. Tetsuji Shioda of the Mathematics Department  at Rikkyo University.  The investigators propose to study  possible applications of  Dr. Shioda's work on Mordell-Weil lattices of elliptic  surfaces. The main research question is he size of the  Galois representation associated to the Mordell-Weil  lattice,  and possible applications to elliptic curves.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Liverance will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  methodology invented essentially single-handedly by Dr.  Shioda for the elliptic surfaces. Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
