 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505523  Williams    This U.S.-Russian Cooperative Research grant is for \"SO2 and  Trace Metal Fluxes from Kudriavy Volcano, Kurile Islands  (Russia)\" is between Dr. Stanley Williams of Arizona State  University and Russian scientists from: the Institute of  Experimental Mineralogy (Moscow), the Institute of Volcanic  Geology and Geochemistry (Petropavlask-Kamchatsky), and the  Institute of Volcanology and Geodynamics (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk).    Kudriavy volcano is a perfect location of studying metal fluxes  from magmas due to its extremely high fumarole temperature (up to  940  C), strong gas flux, common calc-alkaline andesitic  composition, and the lack of a hydrothermal system which would  interact with the magmatic gases to change their composition.  Studying metal fluxes at these purely magmatic high temperature  conditions will help further to constrain the mass of metals  degassing from calc-alkaline magma bodies, in general.  The  research will: (1) measure SO2 flux by COSPEC and determine rare  metal fluxes; (2) direct fumarole gas sampling to determine the  isotopic composition of O, H, S, C, N, and He in highly magmatic,  arc type volcanic gases and investigate the effects of  temperature on the isotopic compositions; (3) make inferences on  the ultimate origins of the rare metals using obtained data; and  (4) measure SO2 flux from other volcanoes nearby on the Kurile  Arc: Baranski, Ivan Grozniy, and Burevestnik.      This proposed research in geological sciences fulfills the  program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading  experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest  and competence.  The workshop will also be used to promote the  interest of graduate and undergraduate students in particle  physics.  ***",
