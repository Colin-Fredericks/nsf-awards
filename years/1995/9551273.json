The project addresses  the need to make existing interactive materials easily available,  to extend them, and to create new materials focused on the level  and the abilities of the students users.           The Library for Interactive Studies in Mathematics and  Science, based at the Institute for Academic Technology of the  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is being built on the  World Wide Web over a two year period.  The library contains  interactive workbooks on topics commonly encountered in  undergraduate mathematics, from college algebra and pre-calculus  through multivariate calculus, differential equations, and  mathematical modeling.  The library makes available to instructors  all over the country a wide variety of interactive workbooks that  they may freely use and distribute to their students.  Workbooks,  together with the program necessary to read them, are provided over  the Internet instantly, and free of charge.  The initial library  holdings are 45 of the most effective experimental workbooks  created for the MAA-sponsored Interactive Mathematics Text Project  (funded by IBM and NSF, ILI-LLD grant USE-9150272).           All  needed information about the library is disseminated  electronically via e-mail and discussion lists, as well as through  presentations and workshops.  The goal is to show teachers what can  be done, to get them interested in experimenting, and to teach  interested faculty how to build their own interactive workbooks.   Faculty are invited to join an initial core group of 8  knowledgeable authors whose colleges are participating by piloting  and testing materials. Materials are provided and a workshop is  held to prepare 16 new teacher/authors.  An integral part of the  development process is feedback from an editorial board directed to  the authors.",
