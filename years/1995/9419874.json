 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural   anthropology from the University of Chicago.  The research will take place in Sri Lanka   where the student will study two relatively new export-oriented garment factories which   hire a predominantly female labor force.  Using ethnographic techniques of in-depth   interviews and participant observation as well as studies of local and regional archives,   the student will examine how the experience of work in these factories changes the   women's notions of themselves as people and citizens of the nation.  Women are   traditionally the store-house of traditional cultural values, and the student hypothesizes   that work in the factories, which explicitly aim to change their worker's identities to   relate more to the national state and less to their local group, will produce conflict and   change in the women and their families.  This research is important because the process of global market change has   brought foreign-owned or dominated work-places to many traditional parts of the world.    Understanding how the experience of work in these trans-national sites affects the   women workers, and through them their households and families, will help us understand   and deal with the stresses and tensions that the expansion of the global market produces.",
