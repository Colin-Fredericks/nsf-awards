 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Menger at Emory University will  study the hydrophobic association of various long-chain organic materials containing carboxylate,  amine, imidazole, hydroxyl, and metal functionalities into complex assemblages called \"clumps.\"  These substances will be screened for potential catalytic activity in water toward a variety of  organic reactions.  Methods related to combinatorial chemistry will be used to identify clumps  that exhibit catalytic activity approaching that of enzymes.  These methods will be extended to  the study of substances bonded to colloidal gold and to substances bonded to polymers.    This study will measure the ability of a mixture of organic molecules containing long chains of  chemically bonded carbon atoms and other reactive atoms to associate together in water solution  to form microscopic spherical balls called clumps.  These clumps are expected to behave in a  manner similar to naturally occurring enzymes.  Because organic reactions do not occur readily  in water, these clumps may help to enhance the reaction of organic compounds in a water  environment.  This could help to reduce the amount of hazardous wastes generated from  industrial production of organic compounds that normally require organic solvents that must be  recycled or burned.",
