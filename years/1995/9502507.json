The focus of the educational plan involves the teaching of  chemistry by using a modular approach and developing an  undergraduate research seminar program.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research and educational plan of Dr. James W. Leahy of the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  Professor Leahy will focus his research efforts on the development  of new methods for the catalytic formation of carbocyclic compounds  and the preparation of a  theoretically interesting fused-  ring system containing a novel carbocation. The focus of Professor   Leahy's  educational plan involves the teaching of chemistry by using a  modular approach and developing an undergraduate research seminar  program.",
