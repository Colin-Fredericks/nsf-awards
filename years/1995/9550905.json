 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enhance student performance and  retention in introductory computer science courses through the use  of closed laboratories.  To enable this teaching approach we will  create a computer laboratory.  The laboratory will consist of a  file server, a Postscript printer, a network of 20 microcomputers  equipped with Alsys ActivAda, and 10 dot-matrix printers.  This  facility will be used to conduct weekly closed laboratories.  Each  laboratory will provide hands-on learning experiences for mastering  basic programming skills and becoming competent with the tools most  frequently needed for program development.  These tools, which are  integrated within ActivAda, include an editor, compiler, formatter,  debugger, librarian, and execution profiler.  The laboratory will  be staffed 14 hours a day.  In addition to being used for scheduled  closed laboratory sessions, it will be used by students to complete  course programming projects.  An additional 5 licenses for ActivAda  will permit students to access this software from other campus  computer clusters when the lab is scheduled.  By integrating a  closed laboratory into our current course structure, we expect to  improve student performance on programming projects and increase  the percentage of students who successfully complete the  introductory sequence.",
