 "awd_abstract_narration": "The four small, rural Virginia counties of Surry, Sussex, King and  Queen, and Charles City, have formed a consortium identified as  Project SUCCESS.  This consortium was organized to address the  historical pattern of academic under-achievement of its public  school students, especially minorities.  The project's academic  focus is science and mathematics.  The primary intervention  strategies will be in the following categories: 1) professional  development for teachers; 2) curriculum revision; 3) student  enrichment; 4) parental involvement; and 5) community involvement.   It is to be noted that the objectives and activities described for  Project SUCCESS have been developed in consideration of Virginia's  Statewide Systemic Initiative in science and mathematics, VQUEST  (see Appendix A for a further explanation of this relationship to  VQUEST).    This grant application is being submitted to request support for  the staff development and student enrichment aspects of the  consortium plan.  Activities in these categories will include  summer programs for teachers and students, student Saturday  Academies during the academic year, informal education experiences,  parent and community seminars on the importance of science and  mathematics for today's citizens, increase participation of  teachers in professional science and mathematics organizations,  more student participation in science fairs, workshops to increase  the types of science and mathematics assessment methods used  internships, and other interactions between students and  professionals to increase student awareness of careers in science,   mathematics and relate fields.  Support is being sought to continue  staff development activities focused on summer \"Laboratory  Institute\" for three additional years.  ***",
