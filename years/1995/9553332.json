 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553332  Patterson    The Morehouse College Research Scholars program is designed to  increase the number of students who attend graduate school and  earn doctorates in the sciences.  The objectives of the program  are:  1)to motivate students to pursue careers in science  research through a coordinated mentoring program; 2) to provide  participants in the program with early research experiences,  beginning with a prefreshman summer program; 3) to enhance the  academic preparation of students through enrichment courses,  counseling, mentoring colloquia, and seminars; and 4) to provide  students with information on graduate schools, fellowships and  research careers.  The program consists of four components to  accomplish the stated objectives:  1) an academic year research  and enrichment program for undergraduates; 2) a prefreshman  summer research and enrichment program; 3) summer research  activities for upperclassmen; and 4) a coordinated  mentoring/counseling program.  The project will serve a target  group of up to fifteen scholastically talented undergraduates at  the College who are science majors.  These students will be  assigned to faculty mentors who will direct their research  projects and serve as academic advisors.  The participants will  enroll in enrichment courses, and participate in student  colloquia and departmental seminars.  Emphasis will be placed on  a coordinated mentoring/counseling program to ensure the  students' academic and research progress.  In order to enhance  student preparation for graduate school, specific strategies will  be implemented through a \"Bridge to Graduate School Mentoring  Program.\"  Formal relationships will be established with ten or  more graduate schools where participants in the program may  consider matriculation.  it is expected that the Research  Scholars Program will significantly increase the number of  Morehouse graduates who obtain doctorates in the sciences over  the next five to ten years.",
