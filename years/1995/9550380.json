 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even the simplest of programs can be full of elusive errors.  The  study of program checkers, self-testing programs and self-  correcting programs was introduced in order to allow one to use a  program P to compute a function f without trusting that P works  correctly.  Many problems are easy to specify, but efficient  programs which solve them may be vepy complicated.  For such  problems, the proposed approaches to program correctness have  already show promise.  The goal of this project is to understand  how broadly these techniques apply.  This research will develop a  core of algorithmic techniques for writing fast and simple  checkers, self-correctors, and self-testers.  Previous research on  self-correctors and self-testers obtained theoretical tools and  insights which have been used in recent results in the theory of  interactive proof systems.  This research involves the study of the  relationships between these areas.  Other topics in the area of  computational learning theory and game theory will be studied.   These topics have applications to algorithms in reinforcement  learning, text correction, part-of-speech-tagging, DNA sequencing  and handwriting recognition.    Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course entitled  Program Correctness Probabilistic Proof Checking and Interactive  Proofs.",
