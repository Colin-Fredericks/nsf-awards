 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves developing modern physical chemistry  laboratory experiments during a three week faculty workshop for 16  participants.  Each participant will be asked to present to the  workshop an outstanding experiment from their home institution,  provision having been made in advance for the material needs and  apparatus.  Participants will then develop in pairs two new  experiments with write-ups for use in their home institutions,  which will be presented to and tested by the whole group.  It is  expected that experiments involving modern instrumentation (e.g.  lasers and computers), easily transportable experiments,  experiments involving biochemical materials, and fast kinetics will  be developed.  These new laboratory exercises will be field tested  during the following academic year by at least four of the  participants'institutions, and presented at a symposium organized  by the project director at a national ACS meeting.  Commercial  publication of the products will also be explored.",
