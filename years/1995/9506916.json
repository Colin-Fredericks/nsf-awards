 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506916  Wakimoto  In the proposed studies, the regulatory difference between heterochromatic and euchromatic genes will be examined using germline transformation and chromosome rearrangements. The cis-regulatory requirements of the light (lt) gene will be identified by testing the effect of specific repetitive DNAs on transcription of a transgene that contains the It promoter fused to the coding sequences of the bacterial lac Z gene. Repetitive DNA fragments will also be tested for their ability to confer the properties of heterochromatin by assaying insertions for effects on chromosome morphology, euchromatic gene expression and gene dosage using germline transformation. As a complementary approach, larger regions of the left arm of chromosome 2 (2LH) will be tested for various functions by comparing the effects of chromosome rearrangements that variegate for heterochromatic and euchromatic genes, but differ only in the amount of 2Lh. These overlapping deletions provide the material for physical mapping of the heterochromatin so functional properties can be correlated with size of a heterochromatic block or the type of repetitive DNA.  %%%  The chromosomes of higher eukaryotes are comprised of two cytologically distinct domains, heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin appears darkly stained and tightly condensed throughout the cell cycle, including interphase, while euchromatm shows cell cycle changes in the level of condensation. The structure and function of heterochromatin will be examined through the study of the heterochromatin on the left arm of 2Lh of Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies have shown that at least eight genes located within 2Lh require proximity to heterochromatin for normal levels of expression. Chromosome rearrangements that remove these genes from centric heterochromatin and place them in distal euchromatic regions cause variegated expression. Molecular studies have shown that long, heterogeneous arrays of repetitive DNA are located within and surroundilg  one heterochromatic gene, the lt gene. These studies address questions about the molecular determinants of higher order chromosome structure and the functional significance of the heterochromatin. Therefore, the results should contribute to a better understanding of chromosome structure in other organisms  ***  ??",
