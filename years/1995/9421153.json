 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421153  Tomsovic       This project is aimed at extending new, more powerful  semiclassical methods: i) to mesoscopic and atomic problems  - the emphasis is on quantum coherence and wave-function  localization problems, ii) to simplifying the difficulties  arising in connection with chaotic motion, iii) to  investigating the leading corrections and higher degrees of  freedom, and iv) to adapting the methods to stationary  quantum mechanics.  Finally, expertise garnered from  previous investigations will be brought into the classroom,  such as the animation of real time wave equation solutions.       The overall subject matter of this proposal is highly  interdisciplinary and has consequences in many domains.  Analogous phenomena can be found in acoustic, atomic,  mesoscopic, molecular and optical systems.  It has the  further interest of involving the Correspondence Principle  and ultimately the interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Experience reveals a strong student interest in the  combination of mesoscopic physics, nonlinear dynamics and  wave asymptotics.  Conversant students have a broad base and  are well equipped for research careers in a number of  disciplines.  ***",
