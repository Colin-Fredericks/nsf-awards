 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418769  Grosjean    This proposal supports a two-year postdoctoral fellowship for Dr.  David Grosjean at NEC Corporation at Tsukuba and at the  Research Center for Utra-High Voltage Electron Microscopy at  Osaka University.  Project funding will enable Dr. Grosjean to  spend two years in Japan, resident at NEC, in order to conduct  research on microelectronics with Dr. Hidekazu Okabayashi and  other Japanese electrical engineers.  The PI has proposed to work  on the very challenging and technologically important problem of  the electromigration of aluminum atoms at high electric current  density in submicron aluminum lines.  He will also gain knowledge  of metal film preparation and electrical characterization and  stressing equipment.     As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Grosjean will have the opportunity to  become familiar with research techniques and equipment at NEC  Corporation and Osaka University.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
