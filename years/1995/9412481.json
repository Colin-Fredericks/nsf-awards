The group will study and correlate chemical  analyses, structure, and corrosion resistance of films  formed by electrode-less deposition.  Preparation of  samples, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical testing will be  carried out at the ITS facilities in Saltillo, Mexico. Auger  electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  scanning electron, transmission electron, and scanning  tunneling microscopy will be done at CMC in Denton, Texas.    This study is likely to lead to the development of better  corrosion resistant coatings and improved understanding of  the relationship of properties to performance. The project  will also serve to provide an international experience to  graduate students through the sharing of facilities and  research environments in both countries.  ***",
