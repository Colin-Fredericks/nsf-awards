 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the study of motivic cohomology of schemes  and its relationships to algebraic K-theory.  Recent developments  concerning a spectral sequence relating algebraic K-theory to  higher Chow groups and the computation of the higher Chow groups  of complex varieties of sufficiently high codimension in terms of  etale cohomology give a complete understanding of algebraic  K-theory with finite coefficients of smooth complex varieties of  dimension less than or equal to 2.  The principal investigator  will pursue further this line of investigation in order to obtain  an understanding of algebraic K-theory of higher dimensional  complex varieties and of more general schemes.  In addition to  this study of motivic cohomology, he will investigate the  relationship between polyrelative algebraic K-theory and cyclic  homology, thus completing a series of works on excision in  algebraic K-theory.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a  revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its  origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by  the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and  topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields  as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
