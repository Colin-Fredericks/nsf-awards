The head region of the myosin molecule, which contains its  enzymatic site and which interacts with actin to produce force, can  now be produced in native or modified form by molecular biological  techniques, and the atomic structure of a myosin head has been  determined by x-ray crystallography.  The structure of native and  mutant myosin heads attached to actin filaments will be determined  by electron microscopy of frozen-hydrated samples combined with  three-dimensional image reconstruction.  Structure determination at  10-15A resolution permits elements of protein secondary structure  such as  -helices can be recognized, but even at lower  resolution, fitting known atomic structures into the envelope of  the reconstructions allows them to be interpreted in detail.  Of  particular interest is the conformation of the regulatory domain of  the myosin head and how this changes when regulatory switching  occurs.  These structural methods will also be employed to study  regulation of contraction by the tropomyosin-troponin complex bound  to actin in the thin filaments; reconstructions will be interpreted  in terms of atomic models of actin and tropomyosin.  Of particular  interest is establishing the location and possible movements of  troponin in thin filaments at different stages of regulatory  switching.  Electron cryo-microscopy and image reconstruction will  also be used to determine how myosin subfilaments are incorporated  into native thick filaments.  Among the proteins known to associate  with myosin are those of the titin family; vertebrate titin plays  an elastic role in the muscle cell, and may also define how thick  filaments align during muscle development.  Co-assembly of myosin  and smaller titin isoforms believed to have structural and  regulatory roles will be exami ned by electron microscopy to  establish which features of native filament structure depend on the  interactions between these proteins.   %%%  Muscle contraction requires the organization of contractile and  regulatory proteins into large complex assemblies.  To understand  contraction in molecular terms, it is therefore necessary to know  not only the structures of the individual proteins, but also how  the proteins assemble into the larger structural units found in the  cell.  Two aspects of muscle cell organization and of the control  of contraction are emphasized: the mechanisms by which protein  subunits regulate myosin-actin interaction and thus contraction,  and the process by which contractile and accessory proteins  assemble to form the filaments of the muscle cell.  The size and  complexity of the protein filaments in muscle means that the method  of choice for analyzing their structures is electron microscopy.   In cases where the filament components are symmetrically arranged,  image analysis offers a further powerful mathematical and  computational approach to determining their three-dimensional  structure and arrangement.  When atomic-level information about the  separated components is available, it can be incorporated to  produce a highly detailed picture of the functional units in the  muscle cell, and thus open a path to a new understanding of muscle  contraction at the molecular level.  ***",
