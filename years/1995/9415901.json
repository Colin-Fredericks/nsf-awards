 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research by Dr. Marcetta Y.  Darensbourg of the Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University,  on hetrolytic bond activation by first row transition metals.   Three projects will be pursued: (1) ligand engineering to  activate C-H heterolytic bond cleavage by proximate first row  transition metals; (2) mechanism of nickel-thiolate activation of  sulfur dioxide to sulfate; (3) homolytic C-S bond cleavage in  low-valent nickel complexes in which Ni-H acidity is controlled  by ligand structure.  In the first study, rigid chelating and  tetreadentate ligands will stabilize the metals (Co, Fe, or Ni)  and enable a C-H bond to be positioned close to the metal center  to promote its activation.  In the second investigation, nickel  complexes will be used to promote reaction of sulfur dioxide with  dioxygen in an unusual reaction in which sulfur dioxide is  converted directly to anionic sulfate without formation of a  metal-bound sulfate.  In the third project, activation of carbon  dioxide will also be studied, and the acidity of Ni-H in highly  reduced species will be determined.    Bond breakage under controlled conditions is critical in many  essential chemical reactions.  In all the reactions studied with  the support of this award, the position of the metal with respect  to bonds to be broken will be controlled to order to investiate  how to use metals to position other atoms for reaction.   Answering this question is important for understanding many  biological enzyme reactions and for developing new industrial  catalysts.  In addition, finding economic means to oxidize sulfur  dioxide is vital for pollution abatement, thus adding to the  significance of understanding the details of reaction of sulfur  dioxide and oxygen.",
