 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510490  Noble   The objective of this industry internship project is to develop an integrated analysis for material flow systems based on an empirical study of a manufacturing system.  The project will develop and apply an integrated material flow system design and analysis methodology that accounts for the hybrid nature of the manufacturing environment under consideration. The methodology will consist of the integration of mathematical programming, computer simulation, and existing facility layout software packages. The research plan is to (1) determine the optimal unit load sizes to achieve material flow synchronization in a hybrid manufacturing environment, and (2) develop a plan for facility layout and material flow system evolution over a time horizon.  The project addresses the incremental adoption of an integrated material flow system so as to provide an implementable methodology for small and medium sized manufacturing firms.    Material flow system is a primary integrating component of a manufacturing system. Therefore, an inefficient material flow system can affect manufacturing productivity and competitiveness. Research in the integration of material flow systems can advance the understanding of the interaction between material flow and other systems within a shop floor. Increased understanding of the nature of interaction will provide some insight in the development of methodologies whereby these types of complex environment can be analyzed. . Because the research is directed at small to medium sized manufacturing operations, the tools developed can be used by these firms to evaluate their material flow systems in order to achieve better shop performance.",
