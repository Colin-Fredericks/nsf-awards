The intended approach of this  project is to use the position of these two organizations to bring  together members of the academic research and development community  with members of the software publisher community to identify  issues, discuss their resolution and develop collaborations that  will bring NSF-funded ideas and projects to market and increase  their impact on education. The vehicle for this meeting is the  national meeting of the Software Publishers Association, scheduled  for Boston, MA Sept 26-30, 1995. Typically, 1,500 people attend the  east cost conference of SPA.    We plan a series of activities during this conference that will  address the objectives above. Some of these activities will be open  to the general audience attending SPA. Other activities will be  limited to an invited group of academics and publishers that will  begin what is hoped will be an on-going dialog that contributes to  the resolution of the identified issues.  ***",
