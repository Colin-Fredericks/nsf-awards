 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a cooperative research effort between US and  Latvian researchers.  Mores specifically, this project supports  the travel expenses of a Latvian researcher to visit   the University of Maryland for the collaborative  research with the PI.    The award period is for two years.  The  research examines issues in the area of machine learning.    The project studies relative  sizes of the hypothesis space that a learning  algorithm must search through in  order to find a correct  solution.  Several new views of learning by examples  are used for investigation.    The project also generalizes regular  expressions, which  are extensions of the term rewriting systems for which  practical learning algorithms have been implemented.  The  project   develops techniques for extending these implementations to a broader   class  of functions.",
