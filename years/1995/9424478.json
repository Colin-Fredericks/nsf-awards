The thermodynamic stabilities of the quaternary systems will be studied by determining relevant phase equilibria.  Both the four-point probe and transmission line methods will be used to study the electrical behavior of the ohmic contacts.  For those material combinations giving significant Schottky contacts, both I-V and C-V methods will be used.  Films of intermetallics will be deposited on the compound semiconductor alloys by sputter deposition, and annealing of the contacts will be carried out using a rapid thermal annealing furnace.  The metal/semiconductor interfaces will be characterized in the as-deposited state and after annealing using a variety of surface-sensitive techniques, including TEM, SAM and GAXRD (glancing angle x-ray diffraction). %%% The results of the proposed study are expected to provide improved fundamental understanding of the relationship between electrical behavior of intermetallics/compound semiconductor alloy combinations, and the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities at their interfaces.  Concurrently, the research investigation can have a significant impact on the design and development of optoelectronic and high-speed electronic devices for practical applications.  An important feature of the program is the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials research. ***",
