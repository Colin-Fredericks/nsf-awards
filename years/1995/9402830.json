 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402830  EMERSON    This is a study of the geochemistry of Mo, V, U, and Re in a series  of cores on the continental margins of the Atlantic, Pacific, and  Indian Oceans. These elements are conservative, or nearly so, in  sea water and highly enriched in sediments overlain by anoxic or  very low oxygen-content bottom water.  The concentration of these  elements in sea water may have changed in the past in response to  the changing area of anoxic sediments in the ocean. Quantitative  interpretation of the changes, however, requires better  understanding of how these elements behave in continental margin  sediments.  Thus, their burial rates over the past 20 Ka. will be  studied in five box-core transects from the continental shelf to  the deep sea.  Cores from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean  continental margins were raised on previous pore water  investigations, and sediments from a transect across the oxygen  minimum zone in the Arabian Sea to be sampled in the Indian Ocean  Program in 1995, will be provided from other investigations.  In  the latter study, a year-long suite of sediment trap samples will  also be analyzed.  All transects cross a strong gradient in  sediment redox conditions, and some also experience dramatic  changes in the level of bottom water oxygen concentration.  Both  the organic carbon rain rate to the sediment-water interface and  the bottom water oxygen concentration influence the burial rate of  these metals and will be determined.",
