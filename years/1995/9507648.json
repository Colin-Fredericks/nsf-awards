The impact of different types of  democratic institutions, mainly parliamentarism and  presidentialism, is also distinguished    The emphasis is placed on the objectives of governments and the  mechanisms of accountability they face under different political  institutions.  Empirical predictions concerning the size of  government and economic performance are derived from a formal  model.  These predictions are tested, using data for 139  countries between 1950 and 1990, by estimating the probability  that incumbents lose office as a result of bad economic  performance and by estimating equations which relate government  size to economic performance.  The analysis is conducted  separately for each type of political institution, taking account  of the fact that regimes are endogenous with regard to economic  performance.    The project will elucidate the impact of political institutions  on the accountability of governments and on their economic  behavior.  In particular, it will assess whether democracy can be  expected to generate better economic policies and better  performance than different types of dictatorship and whether  different democratic institutions affect policies and  performance.  These results have direct consequences for issues  of institutional engineering, particularly applicable to new  democracies.  ***",
