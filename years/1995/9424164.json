 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI project  is a companion project to the RUI project CCR-9503601 (PI: Belanger) of Northeast  Missouri State University.    (1) The first part of this research project aims to  better understand  the properties and structures of average-case NP-complete  problems under randomizing reductions.  Randomizing reducibility  is a powerful  tool used to learn about average-case completeness.  In particular, the  existence of isomorphisms between complete  problems and the structure of  complete problems under randomizing  reductions are studied.  Polynomial  isomorphisms are explored in  the setting of randomizing many-to-one reductions  based on recent  results on the NP-isomorphism problem with respect to random  instances, which have explicit support for this goal.   (2) The second research  topic is rankable distributions.  P-rankable  distributions were proposed  recently to capture the ranking of  probability distributions, but they are not  directly comparable  to p-time computable distributions used in the literature.  The  goal here is to investigate whether p-rankable distributions can  provide  harder instances than p-time computable distributions for  randomized NP  decision problems and randomized NP search  problems.",
