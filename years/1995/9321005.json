 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being supported under Phase II of the Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.  It will support the  development of a reliable and effective software system for the  design and analysis of composite multilayered shells.  The system  should be capable of modeling both linear and nonlinear behavior  in three dimensions, assessing the quality of the solution, and  providing feedback so that the quality of the solution can be  improved.  Its hierarchical structure should allow the selection  of models of increasing complexity in an adaptive manner, so that  the goals of computation are satisfied within the required  accuracy and with minimal effort.  The investigation will be  focused on hierarchical sequences of models for laminated shells  and the issues of implementation of these models into the  structure of the p-version of the finite element method.  In the  Phase I effort, the scope was limited to the bending of laminated  plates and addressing their extension to shells.  Phase II will  involve utilizing the results of Phase I to assess the problems  associated with bending/membrane coupling and curvature, and to  extend those concepts to the nonlinear (small-strain large-  deformation) solution methods for laminated plates and shells.",
