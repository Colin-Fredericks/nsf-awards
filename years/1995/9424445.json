The  proposed theoretical work includes the development of an ab  initio quantum molecular dynamics method for simulating the  structure and properties of \"ionic\" compounds maintained at  constant pressure. This will be used to study phase  equilibria and defect energetics and structure in a variety  of important compounds. The prototype compositions will be  silicon oxides, but considerable effort will be devoted to  inventing materials with novel structures and properties.  The bond valence method of analyzing bond lengths in  crystals will be extended to include the effects of non-  bonded interactions and to accommodate exceptional cations.  The mathematics of nets such as occur in zeolites and  framework silicates will be studied. The experimental work  will be devoted to synthesis of new nitrides and oxides,  with special attention to phases stable at high pressure.  Structural characterization of new phases and previously  known important phases with incompletely determined  structures will be conducted using X-ray and neutron  diffraction. %%%  This research program consists of experimental and  theoretical studies in crystal chemistry. The underlying  theme of this project is to obtain deeper understanding of  the factors that determine crystal structures and their  relationship to chemical and physical properties. Examples  of some of the major lines of research are: 1) simulation of  crystal structure for application to phase equilibria  studies at high pressures and to examine defects in  crystalline materials; 2) measuring electron density  distributions in crystals to understand bonding; 3) crystal  structure determination to confirm theoretical studies; and  4) the development of adequate descriptions of complex  structures.",
