Institution: University of Chicago    This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago acquire consoles for a 500 MHz, 300 MHz, and 400 MHz NMR.  The research activity to be supported includes:     1.  mechanism of protection by heat shock proteins   2.  Chameleonic Amphiphilic Peptides   3.  the structure and mechanism of nucleic-acid binding proteins (including metal-binding            motifs such as Zn fingers) and of nucleic acid   4.  basic chemistry of homogeneous catalysis   5.  Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Catenated Group 14 Molecular Frameworks   6.  Conformationally Well-Defined Polymers and Micro-phase Separated Block Copolymers      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
