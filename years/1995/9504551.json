Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project named SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring.    This work is a collaborative effort between the University of Nevada, Dessert Research Institute and the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute.  Several key atmospheric measurements during the SHEBA field program will be made from tethered balloons that will carry scientific instruments up to a kilometer above the ice surface.  Some of these instruments must be adapted and tested for Arctic conditions.      One group of measurements focus on cloud microphytsics and another group involve radiative heat fluz measurements.  The microphysics instruments will provide characterizations of cloud particles at different altitudes as the balloon moves vertically through cloud layers.  The radiative instrument package will consist of self-leveling up- and down- short-wave flux radiometers, cloud liquid water instruments, and meteorological packages for pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind.  The collaborative effort will provide common operational and data logging components.  Partial support is also being provided by Dept. of Energy.",
