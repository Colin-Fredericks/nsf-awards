The effects of  a disorder potential on the static and dynamic properties of  classical crystals, as well as crystals in very strong  magnetic fields, will be studied, including correlation  functions in the ground state, noise spectra, and AC  conductivity.  He will also theoretically study  photoluminescence (an experimental probe), quantum effects,  double layer quantum Hall systems, excited states, and  impurity effects.  %%%  The PI will conduct theoretical research on two-dimensional  electron systems, as found on the surface of helium and in  semiconducting systems in strong magnetic fields.  Such  systems are of special interest because they cannot be  completely explained by traditional theoretical methods.  This PI plays an important part in contributing to the new  methods that must be developed to understand such systems.  He is known for the breadth of his research and the variety  of methods he uses.  Parts of his work will be especially  helpful in interpreting several recent experiments on these  systems.  ***",
