 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic nitrates (RONO2) play important roles in the atmospheric  chemistry of Nitrogen oxides NOx (NOx = NO, NO2) and represent a  major area of interaction between atmospheric cycles of nitrogen  and organic carbon.  Nonetheless, the detailed removal process of  organic nitrates from the atmosphere is not well understood.  This  research project will study organic nitrates and their related  reaction using a sensitive new multipass absorption technique,  cavity ring-down optical spectroscopy.  The immediate goal of the  research and planning activities is to gain additional experience  with this new instrument and obtain some preliminary experimental  results with it.  During the planning period, specific experiments  will be performed to examine the spectroscopy and photochemical  reactions related to ethyl nitrates in the atmosphere.  The  activities associated with this research planning grant will lay  the necessary groundwork for the next stage of experiments.  The  experimental results will demonstrate the principal investigator's  ability in performing competitive research in field of atmospheric  chemistry and will lead to the development of subsequent NSF  proposals.",
