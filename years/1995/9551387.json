 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates experiments that illustrate chemical  principles with a new strategy and a new format for conducting  the experiments.   The strategy involves switching from  \"traditional\" experiments, in which students follow detailed  directions, to an inquiry philosophy, in which students are given  more freedom in conducting experiments and analyzing data.   The  new format requires computers at each laboratory station for data  collection, manipulation, analysis, and display and incorporates  computerized experiments.   This merger of current computer  technology and the inquiry approach frees the student from  tedious data collection and engages students in the observations,  analysis, and interpretation of data.  The changes in the general  chemistry laboratory are linked to changes in an advanced  laboratory interfacing course that emphasizes the construction  and testing of simple circuits and sensors used for data  acquisition in the general chemistry laboratory.   Additionally,  the advanced students develop new general chemistry experiments  using these circuits and sensors.  The new experiments are  further tested when they are incorporated into the general  chemistry laboratory.   This symbiotic relationship provides a  source for continual feedback and evaluation of the entire  project.",
