 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501820  Mayer  The primary objective of this project is to stimulate and motivate  learning at every level (undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate).   In the area of fundamental research, the author proposes to develop  a process to fabricate 2- and 3- dimensional (2- and 3-D) photonic  crystals for optical wavelengths.  The 3-D periodic dielectric  structure that will be fabricated is a square-rod structure in the  simple-cubic lattice.  This scaffold structure has the property  that all of the flat faces are at right angles to one another.   Intuitively, this implies that the fabrication procedure for this  square-rod structure will be much easier than those described for  face-centered-cubic lattices.  The proposed process relies on the  integration of many techniques that are currently being used to  fabricate III-V optoelectronic devices.  In particular, the 3-D  structure will be fabricated from a GaAs/A1As stack grown by  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).  Following the growth, a submicron  cross-hatched pattern is defined on the sample of the surface using  electron-beam lithography.  The unprotected areas of the GaAs/A1As  stack are removed using reactive ion beam etching (RIBE).  To  complete the photonic crystal, the compositional structure of the  A1As supports is modified and the alternating layers of A1As are  removed in a selective etchant.  En route to this 3-D result, a 2-D  structure will also be fabricated.  Both of these photonic crystals  will be characterized by the transmission method.  The successful  demonstration of a 3-D photonic crystal at optical wavelengths  would allow the development of a new class of devices that could be  used to reflect, trap, guide, and switch light.  ***",
