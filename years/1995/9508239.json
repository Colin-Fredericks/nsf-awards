 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508239  Mukherjee       This project will (i) explore new architectures for the next  generation of networks employing optical technology, in particular  wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), for wide-area (nationwide)  coverage, and (ii) evaluate and stress-test the performance of  these networks by employing realistic workload (traffic) models.   This ``almost-all-optical'' wide-area WDM network will utilize  wavelength multiplexers and optical switches in a routing node, so  that an arbitrary virtual topology can be imbedded on a given  physical fiber network.  The virtual topology, which is packet  switched and which consists of a set of ``all-optical lightpaths'',  is set up to exploit the relative strengths of both optics and  electronics -- packets of information are carried by the virtual  topology ``as far as possible'' in the optical domain, but packet  forwarding from lightpath to lightpath is performed via electronic  switching, whenever required.       This WDM-based network architecture provides high aggregate  system capacity due to spatial reuse of wavelengths, support for a  large and scalable number of users given a limited number of  wavelengths, and very lenient requirements on the  wavelength-tunable optical devices of the individual users.  On a  microscopic level, this research will optimize the cost, efficiency  and throughput of the WDM routing node.  On a macroscopic level, we  will (a) investigate the overall design, analysis, upgradability,  and optimization (including cost vs. performance tradeoffs) of a  nationwide WDM network consistent with device capabilities; (b)  examine related device issues such as optical amplification, fiber  nonlinearities, etc.; (c) study traffic control issues related to  switching, routing, and performance management of the network to  develop ``adaptive reconfiguration algorithms'' in order to  reconfigure the virtual topology when the pattern of offered  traffic changes; and (d) develop optical hardware support and  algorithms for  emerging networking services such as multicasting.  ***      *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking and Communications Research Program  4201 Wilson Blvd. Room 1175  Arlington Va 22230    (703) 306-1949  (703) 306-0621 (FAX)",
