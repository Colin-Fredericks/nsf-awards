 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Calumet region (East Chicago, Gary, Hammond, and neighboring  parts of Northwest Indiana and Illinois) has a very large minority  student population with a low rate of enrollment in post-secondary  education.  The objective of this program is to demonstrate to  these students that there are excellent job opportunities in  engineering and science where graduates can earn a good living  while doing work they enjoy with interesting people.  The focus is  on a five-week summer program for students entering grades 8 or 9,  with follow-up activities for succeeding summers.  The program is  a cooperative activity of Purdue University Calument with the Gary  and East Chicago school systems; it is administered by Purdue  Calument and guided by a steering committee made up of  representatives from Purdue Calument, Gary, East Chicago, and the  Companies supporting the program.  The key feature is the structure  which ties science, math, and applications together; thus topics  are chosen so that the participants see the importance of math as  a basic tool, and its application to engineering and science.  The  mornings are primarily lecture/discussion/demonstration; the  afternoons are hands-on (laboratory and computer usage) sessions or  industrial tours.  A topic that demonstrates the format is DC  electric circuits (science and hands-on lab),along with  simultaneous linear equations (math) PSpice (computer program to  simulate electric circuits), and Northern Indiana Public Service  Company (plant visit to observe and meet engineers for an electric  utility distribution system).  ***",
