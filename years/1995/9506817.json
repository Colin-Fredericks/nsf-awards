MLD is not sensitive to heme a or CuA(which give  rise to features that dominate the magnetic circular dichroism   MCD  spectra of most cytochrome c oxidase derivatives one would  like to study) but is sensitive to some states in which the heme  a3-CUB binuclear pair can be prepared. Consequently, it is expected  that the site of interest can be observed free of spectral  interference from the other chromophores using the MLD  approach.    The major limitation associated with magneto-optical measurements  on hemoproteins in general has been that the MCD signals derived  from species having a low spin ferric (S = 1/2) ground-state are  the most intense and can therefore dominate much of the spectrum.  Such hemes tend to be simply electron transfer centers and not  directly involved in substrate binding. Since for most purposes we  are primarily concerned with the latter, this represents something  of a problem. Nearly always, it is possible to prepare one or more  interesting derivatives where the electron transfer centers are  low-spin ferrous (S = O) and the substrate binding heme has some  paramagnetic ground-state (S =2 usually). In these circumstances,  only the active site heme has a readily measurable MCD signal.   Unfortunately, there invariably remain a number of derivatives  which could usefully be studied by MCD spectroscopy if it were not  for small amounts of residual low-spin ferric hemes dominating the  spectrum. This tends to be the rule rather than the exception and  is definitely the most serious source of spectral interference  associated with the technique.    MLD spectroscopy represents something of a breakthrough in this  regard, since it is not sensitive to either low-sin ferric, or  ferrous, systems; but is likely to prove particularly useful for  studying integer spin paramagnets.    The MCD instrumentatio n now on-line at The University of Alabama  operates between 1.2 and 300 K, O to 7 tesla, over the wavelength  range 350 to 3000 nm. No other single instrument has these  capabilities. Also, unlike other MCD instruments, it has been  constructed entirely by American companies. The planned addition of  the MLD option will represent a further unique feature in a single  instrument. This equipment arguably represents something of a  national resource.  %%%  This research will develop the technique known as magnetic linear  dichroism (MLD) as a tool for the study of hemoprotein and other  samples which have proved difficult to investigate by established  methods. Presently, there seem to be no useful MLD data reported  for any metalloprotein samples.The information obtained will assist  in the elucidation of the mechanism by which certain metalloenzymes  function and is, therefore, of some fundamental significance to  biochemistry.  The planned addition of the MLD option to the magnetic circular  dichroism (MCD) instrumentation now on-line at The University of  Alabama will represent a further unique feature in a single  instrument and, arguably, represents something of a national  resource.  ***",
