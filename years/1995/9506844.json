 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fitch, David  IBN-9506844         To understand how morphological diversity in multicellular  animals has arisen by the accumulation of evolutionary changes in  genes, an understanding is first required of how morphology is  specified by genes and developmental mechanisms.  The 4-celled tail  tip of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is being studied as a  model for elucidating the genes and developmental processes  involved in producing its morphology.  Because this structure  adopts different morphologies in related species, the tail tip  provides a model for the evolution of morphogenesis as well.  In C.  elegans, the shape of the tail tip is pointy in adult  hermaphrodites and blunt in adult males.  The pointy shape in  hermaphrodites results from retention of the larval state, whereas  the blunt shape in males results from cell fusions and changes in  cell size, shape and possible adhesion that occur rapidly, just  before the last larval molt.  Additionally, a cell-cell signalling  event may induce the coordinated expression of these events.  To  identify genes involved in male tail tip morphogenesis,  morphological mutants are being isolated and characterized.  One  such gene, lep-1, acts specifically to control adult fate in male  tail tip cells and is being cloned to determine its molecular  function and expression pattern.  Epistatic interactions among  identified genes will eventually be studied.  The hypothesized  cell-cell interactions in the induction of tail tip morphogenesis  are being tested by selective ablation of multiple or single  candidate cells with a laser microbeam.  Other cellular processes  potentially involved in tail tip morphogenesis are being  investigated with markers and inhibitors of cellular components.   To provide a precise microanatomical framework for these genetic  and developmental analyses, the cellular architecture of the tail  tip is being detailed by electron microscopy.         The major educational activities take the form of  undergraduate and  graduate courses (mainly on evolution and  evolutionary developmental biology), but participation in pre-  service teacher education, undergraduate advising, and supervision  of high school, undergraduate and graduate student research  projects in the laboratory are also important.  In the courses and  laboratories, emphasis is placed on inquiry-centered, hands-on  learning.  Students are guided by question-based approaches to  construct their own knowledge and skills.  In particular  activities, cooperature learning is encouraged to develop  communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively as  well as independently.  A continuing emphasis in both coursework  and assessment will be the development of language and problem-  solving skills.  The objectives of all of these activities are to  develop in all of the participating students a solid foundation of  knowledge in biology, a hearthy skepticism and creative ability to  formulate constructive questions and hypothesis (and thus an  appreciation of science as an approachable, dynamic, creative,  human activity), a practical knowledge of the scientific method as  a general problem-solving tool, and an ability to effectively  communicate findings and concepts in both oral and written  language.",
