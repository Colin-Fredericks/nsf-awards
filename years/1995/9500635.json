Work will be done on boundary value     problems for elliptic systems in domains with rough boundaries which     arise naturally in practise. More precisely, resolvent estimates and     fractional powers of the Stokes operator in three-dimensional     Lipschitz domains will be studied. The results obtained will be used     in the investigation of Navier-Stokes equations which model the flow     of a viscous incompressible fluid. Methods to be employed include     singular integrals, layer potentials, formulas obtained through     integration by parts, and interpolation. A second line of research     concerns Schrodinger operators with degenerate electrical potentials     and magnetic fields, which governs the dynamics of particles in     quantum mechanics. Work will be done on boundedness of certain     operators which are the analogues of Riesz Transforms,     the non-classical eigenvalue asymptotics and exponential decays of     eigenfunctions. The approach to be used is based on a refined version     of uncertainty principal. Finally work will continue on the unique     continuation problem for the degenerate elliptic operators.           Partial differential equations form the backbone of mathematical    modeling in the physical science. The role of mathematical analysis     is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the     solutions. This include answers to questions about existence,     uniqueness and smoothness. The research supported by this award,     aside from its interest in partial differential equations,    is very important in the areas of applied mathematics and     mathematical physics.      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%",
