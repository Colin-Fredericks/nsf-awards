 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504213  COHN, JOSHUA    This a high-vacuum, pulsed lase deposition (PLD) apparatus  will be used in the development of a vigorous basic research  program investigating the transport and magnetic properties  of perovskite-like films displaying giant magnetoresistance.  The study of spin wave dispersion in magnetic oxides will be  carried out using layered structures composed of magnetic  and superconducting oxide films.  This award also supports  the acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer for ex situ  structural characterization of specimens.  The use of the  pulsed laser for patterning microstructures in discussed as  a promising means of developing  a complete materials  engineering facility.    The proposed research involves materials physics issues with  direct bearing on potential applications in magnetic  information storage and microwave technologies.  Physical  properties investigations will included measurements of  transport and tunneling phenomena, magnetic susceptibility,  ferromagnetic resonance and microwave transmission.    This instrumentation will enable us to meet our educational  goals of training Ph.D. candidates and undergraduate  students in frontier areas of research involving advanced  materials, their characterization, and processing.  The  knowledge and skills developed through use of the  instrumentation will enhance their prospects in tomorrow's  technological marketplace.",
