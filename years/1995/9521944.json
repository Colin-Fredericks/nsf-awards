 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521944  Pfister   Despite their ecological importance in decay and decomposition of organic matter and their occasional pathogenicity in plants and animals, fungi as a group remain poorly known, with few specialists able to identify the taxonomic entities or to pursue further biological investigations.  One especially difficult complication lies in the fact that fungal organisms may live and reproduce asexually, through specialized spores, for years, without showing evidence of the sexual reproductive or \"fruiting\" structures that make possible accurate taxonomic identification and phylogenetic analysis.  Dr. Donald Pfister at Harvard University, a mycologist with a long and productive record of research on ascomycete fungi, is teaming with colleague Dr. Michael Donoghue, with interests in theoretical aspects of systematic and phylogenetic research,  in a study of filamentous fungi placed in the suborder Sarcoscyphinae.  These are largely wood decomposers or saprobes, although some are known plant pathogens; many species are estimated yet to be described, especially from tropical environments.  A major emphasis of their five-year program is on the integration of traditional morphological studies with two additional lines of evidence: molecular analyses of DNA sequences of fungal samples, and laboratory culturing to asqess mating behavior between geographic isolates.    Training in both practical and theoretical aspects of fungal systematics will involve undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates.  Colleagues in South America will also participate in the work.  The University provides superb laboratory and collections facilities, and computerization is a hallmark of all aspects of the research, including specimen databasing, taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, and Internet linkage to major fungal resources.",
