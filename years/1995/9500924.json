Woerdeman      ABSTRACT    The principal investigators plan to study a variety of interconnected   problems in a highly active area of research in Mathematical Sciences that   involves operator theory, matrix analysis,  and their applications in   science and technology, using also closely related areas of pure and applied   mathematics: function theory, Fourier analysis. In addition to continuing   work on other topics,  specific problems are outlined in the following   subjects which are the main focus of the research: 1.   Interpolation problems for matrix and operator valued functions; 2.   Completions of finite and infinite matrices and operators; 3. Riccati   equations; 4. Krein space operators; 5.Applications. The principal   investigators strive to develop new results that can be proved in an   abstract mathematical context (e. g., in terms of *-algebras), and that at   the same time yield new and useful information in various more specific   settings.    The principal investigators plan to relate the newly obtained abstract   results to the original areas of application. Applications that are   emphasized in the proposal include Advanced Manufacturing (engineering   control systems) and High Performance Computing and Communications   (tomography), which have been identified as two of the strategic areas with   impact on national need.  Other areas of relevant application are:   engineering control systems, optics of polarized light, kinetic energy   minimization in quantum chemistry, diffraction of waves, signal processing,   and pattern recognition.  Interactions with many researchers in different   fields (mathematics, computer science, engineering),  various countries   besides the U. S. (Canada, The Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Norway, France,   United Kingdom), and scientists in industry and government (the National   Institute of Health, NEC Research Institute)  are planned and form an   integral part of this project.",
