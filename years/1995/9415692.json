 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  NCR-9415692, University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, \"Codes and Processing for Two-Dimensional Data Storage\", PI-Blahut:  This research is on two-dimensional communication waveforms and codes for data storage systems of the future.  Emphasis is placed on optical (and magnetic) storage systems whose read mechanism can simultaneously sense two-dimensional regions of the storage medium.  Systems that employ a one-dimensional array of read sensors against a moving medium form one type of example.  Systems that optically illuminate a patch of a stationary medium and observe this patch (as with a photodetector array) form a second type of example.  Both kinds of physical systems are now under study in industry and this proposed research is needed to support the evolution of such systems.  The main topics are (1) Equalization and Bit  Synchronization, (2) Channel Modulation Codes for Data Translation, (3) Error Control for Two-Dimensional Data Arrays, (4) Block Synchronization, (5) Decoders for Algebraic Geometry Codes, and (6) Two-Dimensional Information Theory.  The goal is to nurture and develop a body of knowledge on full-surface recording.  The approach will be of two kinds.  The very successful methods of communication theory and information theory will be generalized, when possible, to two dimensions.  In addition, new methods of communication theory and information theory unique to two dimensions will be developed.  It is well known that the two-dimensional plane is much more complicated than the one-dimensional line, so new mathematical phenomena arise in the design of two-dimensional waveforms and codes.  The problems are much more difficult but the rewards may be much greater.  Successful completion of the research would provide (1) codes and waveforms for the novel optical and magnetic storage devices of the upcoming decade, (2) anticipated large improvement in storage density, (3) recommendations on the architecture of future optical and magnetic storage devices, (4) new insights into the classical one-dimensional communication waveforms, (5) a fertile new information systems research area with strong connections to deep problems both in physics and mathematics.\r\n*****************************************************************************\r\nAubrey M.
