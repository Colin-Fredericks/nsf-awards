One of its  goals is to express some classical index theorems, especially those  involving the Euler and signature operators, as homotopy theoretic  statements, and then to study the higher-order information provided  by this reinterpretation.  The researchers are also investigating  geometric questions about surfaces in four-dimensional manifolds,  as well as algebraic issues surrounding the action of permutation  groups on the homology of configuration spaces.  Finally, they are  working towards a classification of p-compact groups (i.e.  \"homotopy Lie groups\") as well as towards a more complete  understanding of how topology and number theory are mixed together  by the constructions of algebraic K-theory.       The general theme of the project is the study of some  remarkable and exciting connections between geometry (the science  of topological spaces, that is, of higher-dimensional shapes) and  algebra (the science of equations and numbers).  The connections go  both ways.  For instance, deciding whether or not it is possible to  use the methods of calculus on a particular topological space turns  out to involve solving some fairly subtle equations.  On the other  hand, the collection of all solutions to an equation can often be  assembled in one way or another into a topological space.  The  investigators are looking at some particular aspects of the  interplay between geometry and algebra, and they expect that taking  a dual point of view will lead to major advances in both areas.  ***",
