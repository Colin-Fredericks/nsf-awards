 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503951  Kempf    This award supports a 14 month postdoctoral fellowship  for Dr. Carl Kempf.  This fellowship opportunity will  enable Dr. Kempf to undertake a collaborative research  effort with Dr. Tadao Inomata of NSK, Ltd.  The  investigators intend to develop and implement control  algorithms for high speed, high precision mechanical  systems.  Objectives include development of  compensators for systems utilizing variable-reluctance,  direct-drive electric motors that will reduce step and  settle times, increase tracking accuracy, and reduce  the effects of friction.  Advanced power amplifiers and  drive electronics will also be investigated.  Results  of this research will be applied to high speed,  automated wire-bonding equipment and will be relevant  for similar devices employed in precision  manufacturing.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Kempf will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  equipment at NSF, Ltd. while contributing to the overall  research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
