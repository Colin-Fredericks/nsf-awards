 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for a state-of-the-art  digital transmission electron microscope, the Zeiss EM 910.  This instrument will serve a growing community of  researchers at the University of North Texas Health Science  Center at Fort Worth as well as a number of other  researchers from local institutions.  Currently the electron microscopy lab of the Microscopy Core  Facility serves 12 researchers.  This includes 5 major  projects with the remainder being comprised of minor  projects, graduate students and non-Health Science Center  researchers. The Microscopy Core of the Health Science  Center is housed within the Department of Anatomy and Cell  Biology and is currently attempting to upgrade its  facilities.  Several pieces of state-of-the-art support  equipment have already been acquired.  The Zeiss EM 910 will  replace an aging transmission electron microscope which  cannot be upgraded to the levels of sophistication and  ability currently needed.  The Zeiss EM 910 is a state-of-  the-art instrument which will enable us to meet our current  and future needs, as well as add an integral piece of  equipment to an ongoing effort to improve the research  infrastructure at this new health science center.Our current  research needs, which the Zeiss EM 910 meets and our present  microscope does not meet, include:    1.    Improved image contrast for work with low contrast  specimens (i.e. immunocytochemistry and in situ  hybridization).    2.    The ability to record, store, manipulate and print  digital images from the transmission electron microscope.    3.    The ability to perform morphometry, stereology and  particle analysis using digital images.    4.    Storage and automated recall of specimen grid  coordinates.    5.    Low magnification micrography and automated montaging.    6.    Enhanced data recording to both negatives and archival  computer files.    7.    Utilization of the Health Science Center's computer  network for exchanging data and images between researchers  here an d around the country.    8.    Electronic image rotation to allow better orientation  of images prior to recording.    9.    Future upgradability to cryoelectron microscopy,  scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive  x-ray analysis and the in-line Omega electron energy filter.        This instrument will also compliment our goal of  improved training of institutional and community graduate  students and.technicians.  It will also enhance the current  medical profession program and the planned allied and public  health professions programs of this new health science  center.",
