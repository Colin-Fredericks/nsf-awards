 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501045  Kupiainen      The project  uses methods previously developed in Statistical   Mechanics for the study of dynamical systems with spatially   extended attractors. The first set of problems deals with  the formation of patterns and fronts in nonlinear parabolic PDE's.   The Renormalization Group will be used to study universal properties   of fronts and patterns in the Cahn-Hilliard and related equations.   The second set of problems deals with chaotic infinite   dimensional dynamics. Expansion methods will be used to study the   phenomena of spatio-temporal chaos and phase transitions in coupled   map lattices and probabilistic cellular automata.      Extended dynamical systems model regular and chaotic   phenomena that are present in macroscopic systems   that are composed of a very large number of identical   parts such as liquids, gases and some biological and  ecological systems. Both the formation of regular   patterns (real life examples are waves in oceans, convective   phenomena in atmosphere and patterns in clouds) and  irregular, chaotic phenomena which exhibit chaos   as irregular behaviour both in time and in space (for example   turbulent motion of fluids) will be studied.  Previously developed methods   for problems in other areas of mathematical physics will be used to   study universal aspectsof these phenomena, i.e. aspects that are rather   insensitive to specific models that are being used.  ***",
