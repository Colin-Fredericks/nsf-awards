 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500694 Temple  This proposal addresses the problem of  constructing, analyzing and numerically computing shock-wave  solutions of systems of nonlinear, hyperbolic conservation laws,  with emphasis on the compressible Euler equations of gas  dynamics. Shock-waves are modeled by discontinuous solutions in  inviscid equations, and shock-waves are what introduce  time-irreversibility, decay, loss of information, dissipation and  increase of entropy into the dynamics of solutions. The author's  recent construction of a shock wave solution of the Einstein  equations takes advantage of the fact that the gravitational  metric is continuous across a shock, even though the fluid  variables are discontinuous. This allows for solutions that are  weaker than shock wave, and the proposal explores the organizing  effect that the gravitational metric has on the geometry of shock  wave propagation. In the nonlinear theory of sound waves, the  authors address the open problem of explaining the stability of  periodic solutions. Their idea is to treat Lie bracket errors in  wave interactions as virtual waves, and thereby they can identify  and study a nonlinear cancellation mechanism that explains why  the dissipation due to increasing entropy defeats the  amplification of waves due to nonlinear interaction in the long  time.  The proposal involves the analysis and interpretation of  the author's recent construction of a new shock wave solution of  the Einstein equations of general relativity. This exact solution  resolves a problem that was first posed in a famous 1939 paper by  J. Robert Oppenheimer and his student H. Snyder. The new shock  wave solution of the Einstein equations of general relativity  provides a model in which the universe begins with a shock wave  explosion instead of the well established ``Big Bang'' scenario  (in which the entire universe burst from a single point). The  proposal explores the possible application of this construction  to modeling the dynamics of stars.",
