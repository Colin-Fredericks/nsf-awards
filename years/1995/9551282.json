 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the purchase of an HPLC with a diode-array  detector (DAD).   Further, the instrument must have the  capability of doing the following experiments: quantitative  deconvolution of overlapping chromatographic peaks, second  derivative spectroscopy, spectral library searches, diode and  multichannel averaging, peptide mapping, microbore separations  and post-column reaction detection.   This instrument is an  integral part of new experiments being incorporated into  analytical, instrumental, organic, biochemistry, molecular  biology, advanced synthesis, and undergraduate research.   New  bioanalytical and environmental labs in analytical chemistry  introduce students to modern HPLC separation techniques and  spectroscopic methods and encourage them to understand the  fundamentals of chemical interactions (mobile-stationary phase)  and multichannel devices (DAD).   Fundamental principles are  reinforced in upper-division laboratory courses.   For example,  students in biochemistry perform a tryptic digestion of a reduced  protein, separation of the peptide fragments by RP-HPLC, and  identification of coenzyme carrying peptide fragments by their UV  spectra.   The HPLC-DAD is also being used for undergraduate  research projects involving kinetics and mechanisms of  micellar-enhanced photochemical reactions and photoinitiated  peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence.   This instrumentation is having  a broad impact on chemistry and biology students and is becoming  an integral part of a new macromolecular  characterization/isolation laboratory.",
