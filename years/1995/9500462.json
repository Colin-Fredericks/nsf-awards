 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500462  Madanshetty   This research aims at advancing the technology of cleaning semiconductor chips and devices by ultrasonics.  The current research builds on prior research on \"Ultrasonically Induced Fluid-Particle Interactions at Nanometer Length Scales\", which led to the discovery of \"acoustic coaxing\", whereby microcavitation can be induced on liquid borne microparticles by superposition of a strong acoustic field with a weak field at a very high frequency.  By lowering the threshold needed for microcavitation via acoustic coaxing and combining with micro-streaming, a process to clean semiconductor is proposed.  By advancing the fundamental understanding of acoustic coaxing induced microcavitation, it is expected that key process control parameters will be identified to realize a practical manufacturing process.  An additional benefit of the research is expected in developing a new way of detecting liquid borne particles for ultra clean liquids.      As the semiconductor industry drives towards packing of more and more information on a chip using finer and finer details, the barrier to manufacturing technology becomes the state of cleanliness.  Successful completion of this project can lead to building of ultrasonic equipment with a knowledge based process control that has the potential of achieving ultra clean manufacturing environment for semiconductor.  In fact, two small companies are partnering with this researcher based on this promising technology to develop instrumentation for detecting liquid borne microparticles.",
