 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. James P. Morken has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Morken received his doctoral degree from   Boston College under the supervision of Professor Amir Hoveyda.  Dr.   Morken will continue research at Harvard University under the sponsorship   of Professor Stuart Schreiber.  His postdoctoral research will apply the   techniques of modern combinatorial chemistry to the development of a   general method for increasing the affinity of non-peptidic ligands for   their natural receptors.  By attaching the ligand to a combinatorial   peptide library, followed by screening the library for binding to the   target protein, it should be possible to identify sequences that   establish reinforcing non-covalent interactions between ligand and   receptor.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
