 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423033  Almes  In 1993, Merit, Inc. and their study partners, Advanced Network  and Services, Inc., implemented a plan to provide augmented  connectivity and infrastructure to the southwestern U.S..  This  was done by establishing full switching capabilities which  support high bandwidth carrier transmission facilities similar to  other locations that support NSFNET backbone services.   Additionally, they established two direct connections to the new  switches for the Phillips Laboratory and the Sandia National  Laboratories, both of Albuquerque, New Mexico.       Since then this region has seen a growth in research and  education activities through further use of this connectivity.   This is especially true for the support of the University of New  Mexico's management of the Maui High Performance Computing Center  (MHPCC).  This project will continue to expand the high  bandwidth, wide-are networking for the southwest region including  the two national laboratories and will also include the provision  of a high-speed gateway connections for the state-wide network,  New Mexico Technet, that serves the entire state of New Mexico's  university-industrial-government research complex.    The ANS operated NSFNET Backbone Network has been operating since  1988 at speeds of 1.5 million bits per second.  A new higher  speed service of 45 million bits per second began operation in  1990 which now connects nineteen locations.    This Albuquerque connection will also benefit from the economies  of scale which are achieved because of the multiple organizations  which share a common infrastructure and common network management  facilities.",
