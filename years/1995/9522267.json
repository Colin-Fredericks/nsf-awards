The symposium will focus on the biochemistry, molecular biology, structure/function and physiology of ion channels and transporters in intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles.  The aim of  the symposium is to integrate the  physiological, biochemical and genetic approaches to the study of this class of membrane proteins and provide a focus for discussion of this new frontier of membrane biology.        The meeting consists of five sessions : 1)endoplasmic reticulum ion channels and transporters, 2)mitochondrial channels and transporters, 3)nuclear channels and transporters, 4) secretory mechanisms  and 5)organellar localization of calcium.  There will also be poster sessions and a session entitled new ideas, new faces, consisting of shorter talks by young investigators selected from abstracts submitted for the poster session.  These proceedings will be published.  %%%         This meeting covers an area which is relatively recent in the studies on membrane structure and function.  Most of these studies have been concerned with the plasma membrane, however this meeting concerns the membranes of the intracellular organelles.  Since these proceedings will be published, this information will be available to all interested scientists.  ***",
