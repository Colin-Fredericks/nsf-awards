 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506039  Miller       This research project in communication protocols focuses on  the study of formal modeling of communication protocols which spans  the areas of protocol specification, verification, testing and  performance.  Goals of the project are to provide a unification of  the formulation techniques across all of these areas from  specification to testing and to add the capability of studying  performance within the same kind of formulation.  Currently the  approaches used to formally specify a protocol are different from  those used to verify the logical correctness of a protocol.  There  is also a gap between the verification formulations and the  conformance test generation formulations.  The research studies in  this project are aimed at closing these two gaps and thereby  providing a more integrated approach to the design of communication  protocols from specification to verification to testing.  In  addition, the studies aim to allow one to investigate the  performance of the protocol at an early stage of the design, again  using the same formulation techniques as in specification and  verification.  ***",
