Time and space  resolved detection of electronic excitation of insulator surfaces  by induced change in chemical interaction potentials between the  surface and the AFM tip will be investigated.  Synchronized short  laser pulses with the tip scan are expected to improve aspects of  nanomachining with features that introduce chemical specificity  into AFM.  In addition, high energy, six electron-volt photon  pulses of two hundred femtoseconds duration, are used to conduct  ultrafast spectroscopy and supporting studies on technologically  useful classes of materials that exhibit self-localization of  excitations in pure crystals.  Materials which have the  additional technological advantage of being the best new fast  scintillator crystals for high-energy electromagnetic  calorimeters and medical imaging will also be investigated.  %%%  This is a multidisciplinary proposal which spans a broad area of  research such as basic studies of the interaction of atoms with  light in bulk solids and surfaces, photochemistry,  micromachining, and medical imaging.  The program combines  femtosecond lasers with atomic force microscopy to study the  energy conversion of light into atomic discplaments in solids and  surfaces.  The program has a strong university-industry component  and provides opportunity for training students in the basic  sciences as well as applied research.  The core industrial  research collaboration is with AMP Incorporated.  ***",
