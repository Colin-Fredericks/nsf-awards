 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jeffrey, William   IBN #9417799         Little is known about how changes in development arise during  evolution.  To address this problem, Dr. Jeffrey capitalizes on a  unique model system consisting of closely-related species of  ascidians with different forms of development.  Ascidians are  simple animals with many of the same developmental features as  vertebrates, including a notochord (the evolutionary precursor of  the vertebral column), a dorsal central nervous system, and a tail.   Most ascidians develop the features described above, however, a few  species have lost this property during evolution.  One of the two  species studied by this laboratory has vertebrate-like features,  whereas the other has lost them.  Remarkably, when these two  species are hybridized, the species lacking vertebrate-like  features recovers them, suggesting that the function of  developmental regulatory genes has been lost in the latter species.    This result opens the possibility of identifying genes involved in  regulating development and evolution of the vertebrate-like  features.  Previously this laboratory has used a subtractive  procedure in which the RNA products of cloned genes from one  species were subtracted from those of another species to identify  these regulatory genes.  One of the genes the Jeffery group has  identified is called manx because it is required for development of  the tail (e.g. Manx cats lack a tail).  The manx gene produces a  regulatory protein that is likely to control the activity of other  genes. This proposal will be funded in order to obtain more  information on how the manx gene controls tail formation in  ascidians and to identify the other genes controlled by manx that  play a role in development of vertebrate-like features.  Using  these procedures, they will identify additional genes involved in  development of the notochord, tail, and central nervous system.   The information obtained is expected to help understand how the  body plan is generated during the developm ent and evolution of  higher animals.****",
