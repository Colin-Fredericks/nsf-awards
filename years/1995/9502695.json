 "awd_abstract_narration": "Array signal processing techniques were traditionally limited to  military applications. Researchers recently found that these  techniques could be applied to significantly expand channel  capacity and improve quality of wireless communication systems  through exploitation of spatial diversity.  Despite significant  research activities in array processing during the last decade,  conversion of such military technology to cost sensitive commercial  technology is not trivial. A significant amount of research and  development effort is required to realize these techniques in a  wireless communication system. This research is developing  innovative antenna array processing techniques and fast  implementation schemes for various wireless communication systems.  The program scope is not limited to algorithm development,  theoretical analysis, and simulation studies; our ultimate  objective is to implement the resulting algorithms in real  hardware.    Industry specializing in digital signal processing and its  applications in telecommunications has experienced rapid growth in  this world due to high demand for information access and  processing. To respond to such a growth, new courses in these areas  and innovative teaching methodology must be developed so that  students can quickly adapt to various challenges. During the  proposed period, the principal investigator plans to develop  several new courses in these areas including undergraduate lab  courses, continue involving undergraduates in industry sponsored  projects, design more computer projects, create opportunities for  minority students and students with disabilities, and, what is more  important, develop a multimedia teaching method drawing on advanced  technology, e.g., live audio, video, and graphical illustrations  and real hardware demonstrations.",
