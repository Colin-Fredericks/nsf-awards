 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project based on the concepts of multivariate linear inverse interpolation and physical optimality would develop a finite stepwise procedure which would guarantee an optimal, or near-optimal, design in a small number of design cycles regardless of the design model size. It can readily optimize the frame geometry, resulting in designs which would be generally lighter than the minimal weight frames of fixed geometry. In contrast, the existing methods for structural optimization are iterative in nature, and have significant limitations in regard to the design model size and optimality.  Phase I research would establish the feasibility of the new approach by developing the essential analytical details of the algorithms used in the innovation, along with error analysis in support of the high computational reliability of the approach. Phase II effort would develop efficient computer implementations of these algorithms, formal proofs of optimality, and the capability to handle dynamic loadings.  A PC-based FORTRAN program to optimize building frame design to meet contemporary design standards would also be developed. This program would be unique in its scope, since no structural frame design program available today offers the capability of fully automated optimal design.",
