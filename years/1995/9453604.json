 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teaching Excellence Advancing Math and Science  This project will develop a needs a needs assessment for the State of Oregon for K-16 science and mathematics education through the participation of a broad representation of stakeholders in a collaborative effort.  This effort will deal with curricular and pedagogical changes needed in both K-12 science and mathematics education as well as undergraduate science and math courses that serve pre-service teachers.  These issues will ultimately impact formal teacher preparation programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Three workshops will be held at geographically dispersed locations across the State of Oregon.  These three sites will allow for maximum involvement of stakeholders from through the State-- community college, college, and university faculty in science, mathematics, and science and mathematics education; K-12 teachers and administrators; state and local government leaders; representatives of informal science education centers such as museums and aquariums; and leaders from business and industry.  Particular attention will be paid to involving representatives of diverse populations that are traditionally underrepresented in science and mathematics education, such as women and minorities.  Specific efforts will made to include representatives from rural Oregon communities tat serve large Hispanic and American Indian populations.  Each workshop will produce a document summarizing its findings and recommendations.  Following the three workshops, the three documents will be distributed to all stakeholders, including workshop participants and other statewide leaders in education.  Through one or more sessions on an educational television network, a opportunity will be provided for a statewide discussion that will move toward convergence on the needs assessment and a corresponding identification of the major problems that must be addressed in preparing science and math teachers.  This process will establish on-going communication  among stakeholders in the State of Oregon and lead to continuing dialogs, especially between K-12 teachers and college and university faculty, concerning the organization of programs and resources and the commitment to solutions at all levels in the education system.",
