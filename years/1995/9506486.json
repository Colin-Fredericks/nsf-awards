 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506486  Nekvasil       Crystal nucleation in silicate glasses is of great importance  in both geological and materials systems. Yet, many important  questions still remain regarding the effects of pre-existing  amorphous phase structure on the homogeneous nucleation process in  silicate melts and glasses and the dynamic processes leading to new  steady-state species distributions.  This CAA is requested to  permit the PI to begin a new research direction focused on the  structural aspects of time-dependent processes relating to  crystallization from molten and glassy silicates.  This direction  strongly complements her previous experimental and theoretical work  on equilibrium thermodynamics in molten silicates.  This project  would serve as an introduction to NMR spectroscopy as well as  nucleation studies and would be conducted during her first  sabbatical leave.         The proposed study focuses specifically on evaluating the  kinetics of structural readjustments and its effect on induction  times.  MAS and static NMR experiments on glassy lithium disilicate  will be coupled with nucleation studies with the specific goal of  determining the kinetics of \"short\" range order readjustments after  structural perturbation.  The kinetics of Qn species rearrangements  when coupled with the effects of structure on induction times will  also indicate the kinetics of the readjustment of cluster  distributions (i.e., \"medium\" range order).  In addition to  advancing our understanding of the effect of pre-existing structure  on induction times, the data obtained should provide a means of  determining whether or not a specific measured Qn species  distribution at or below Tg reflects an equilibrium state.  This is  of immediate relevance to the interpretation of the numerous  structural data of glasses in the literature and should provide a  guide to the preparation of glasses for future structural studies.         The award supplement will support a particularly talented  female, African-American underg raduate.  She will work closely with  the PI and a female chemistry professor on all aspects of the  project.",
