 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ideas from algebraic and arithmetic geometry have   to  recent advances in symbolic algebraic computation,   computational  number  theory, and in the effective geometry of real semi-algebraic   sets.  In  motion-planning and modeling, the  reintroduction of   classical methods of  elimination theory  including multivariate resultants, u-  resultants and Chow  forms  have aided in the design of efficient parallelizable   algorithms.  In  number theory, rational points on abelian varieties defined    over finite fields  have provided a rich new source of groups with  arithmetic   properties that can  be exploited in the design of new  algorithms.    This study   computational problems for which algebraic  and algebro-  geometric methods have  had significant impact.  The research further explores the  applications of  multivariate resultants to problems   involving algebraic curves  over finite fields and their Jacobians.  These methods have   been  successfully  applied in designing factorization-free algorithms  which   have achieved  order-of-magnitude improvements performance  in computing   arithmetic properties  of curves.  Methods of  elimination theory that have been   used to explore the  structure  of semi-algebraic sets and to construct solutions   to systems of  polynomial inequalities are also studied.  Such methods have   been  successfully  applied to the design of theoretically efficient  solutions   to very general  problems in solid modeling and  algorithmic motion-planning.    This research  focuses these  methods on somewhat more constrained problems    manufacturing and from molecular modeling involving   topological  polyhedra with  low degree surfaces in low dimensional spaces  where   algebraic tools, together  with the basic paradigms of  computational geometry, provide   a framework for the  design of  both theoretically efficient and potentially   practical  algorithms.",
