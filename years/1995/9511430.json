 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511430  Pallas  The overall goal of this research is to determine how different  areas of the cerebral cortex become specialized to process  different types of sensory information, and how functionally  specialized brain circuitry is created from non-specialized brain  tissue during development and evolution.  The hypothesis being  tested is that the sensory inputs received by cortex during  development play a critical role in organizing specific circuits in  cortex.  To test this hypothesis, auditory cortex will be studied  in three groups of animals; one group which has had sensory input  to auditory cortex removed at birth, another group which, by a  minor surgical procedure, has had visual input diverted into the  auditory pathway at birth, and a third group which consists of  normal, unmanipulated animals.  How the circuitry of auditory  cortex is affected by these manipulations of sensory experience  will then be examined. Using the rewiring manipulation, it has been  shown previously that auditory cortex can be \"turned into\" visual  cortex by supplying it with visual input from birth.  The question  yet to be investigated is whether this occurs because the early  visual inputs have changed the circuitry of auditory cortex, or  because auditory cortex is so similar to visual cortex that it it  has an intrinsic capability for processing visual input  appropriately.  Preliminary results suggest that the visual inputs  do induce changes in circuitry.  The circuitry of auditory cortex,  then, will be examined using anatomical methods to determine  exactly what these changes are and how they produce the functional  changes that have been observed.  Knowledge of how sensory input  influences cortical circuitry during development will provide  information about how evolutionary changes in sensory organs might  ultimately be accommodated by the central nervous system.  This  research, therefore, will provide fundamental information about  both cortical developmental mechanisms and the evolution o f complex  structures in the central nervous system.",
