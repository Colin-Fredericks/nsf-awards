 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this course is to develop an interdisciplinary  introductory science course for first-year college students that  will emphasize the methods and relevance of scientific inquiry.  Target students are primarily those students that do not intend  to major in a science. The course content is intended to include  interdisciplinary topics of broad interest in logical sequences.  We start, for example, with color vision (physiology, perception,  optics, spectroscopy), autumn foliage (isolation of chlorophyll,  photosynthesis, light as energy), and the origin of oxygen-rich  atmosphere (respiration, flow of energy through biosphere,  ecosystems). This theme (light, energy, and matter) then leads us  through topics in astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, and  biology, all in context and without traditional discipline  boundaries. Laboratory demonstrations and exercises will be  exploration-driven with students actively participating in  defining the questions that are asked and how we look for  answers. In the last half of the year, small groups of students  will carry out self-directed research projects and present their  results to the class. Three faculty from different disciplines  will teach the course through lectures to the entire class  (approximately 1/3 of the meetings) and in smaller discussion  groups (2/3 of the meetings). Course content is able to evolve  and change depending on the faculty involved in a given year. A  lab director will facilitate weekly lab exercises, and senior  students from all disciplines will serve as teaching assistants  and role models. Students will be graded by the quality of  exploration reports, projects, and personal journals (no timed  exams). An Advisory Committee of outside persons will provide  input on course content and evaluation.",
