 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502413  Gutierrez    This CAREER project will explore the influence of impinging low-energy  ion  beams (down to ~50 electron-volts) on various polycrystalline and  single-crystalline  transition metal magnetic film  structures  (iron,  cobalt,  nickel  and their various alloys and nitrides)  deposited  on  silicon and gallium-arsenide substrates. Different ion beam sputtering  parameters  such as substrate temperature, processing gas environment,  ion beam angle of incidence, and ion beam energy will be varied in  an  effort to determine their influences on magnetic film characteristics.  The  physics  of the ion beam-induced property modifications  will  be  investigated,  and  this  knowledge  will  be  applied   towards   the  controlled   modification   of  technologically   important   magnetic  properties  such as saturation magnetization, coercivity,  anisotropy,  and  magnetoresistance  in  more  complicated  layered  magnetic  film  structures.  The  research  program  includes  relevant  collaborative  efforts   with  Southwest  Research  Institute,  the  Naval   Research  Laboratory,  the University of Texas at Austin, and the University  of  Missouri (Neutron Reactor Facility), and Commonwealth Scientific, Inc.  %%%  Magnetic   film   materials  are  lucrative  structures   for   device  implementation   in   the   magnetic   sensor,   microwave/fiber-optic  communication  and magnetic storage industries. These  materials  have  helped  spur  the rapid growth of the magnetic technology industry  to  its  present  ~$80 billion market. This CAREER research  project  will  explore  the  influence of impinging low-energy ion beams  on  various  transition  metal  ferromagnetic materials (iron, cobalt,  nickel  and  their  various  alloys  and  nitrides)  during  film  deposition.   In  particular,  the  ion beam-controlled modification of film  saturation  magnetization,    magnetic   anisotropy,   coercivity,    and    giant  magnetoresistance  will be investigated. All film  materi als  will  be  processed  on semiconductor substrates (silicon and gallium  arsenide)  to  promote  their possible implementation in devices.  This  research  project  will  be  operated in close cooperation with  the  innovative  Materials Physics undergraduate curriculum program at Southwest  Texas  State University.  ***",
