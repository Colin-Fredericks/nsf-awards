The research investigates the organization and effects of  political campaigns (defined as \"intensive efforts by leadership circles to step up their control over resources in order to achieve ambitious aims\") by the leadership of newly independent Ukraine, in the face of ethnic-territorial divisions.  Specifically, interviews with political elites, archival data on public protest, socio-economic data, and election-results analysis will be used to uncover the influences and role of ethnic Russians in the Donbass region (eastern Ukraine) in support of or opposition to the new regime.  The geographic dimensions of the research entail the relationship between political processes at the sub-state (oblast) and national-state scales, the role of ethnic-territorial fragmentation in the building of a nation-state, and the influence of the Russia-Ukraine border on economic and political events in this eastern-most region of Ukraine.  The project should provide a political-geographic perspective on the development of (or failure to develop) a democratic institutions at the sub-national and national scales, including the influences of ethnic territoriality and the multiple implications of a national border on institutional development.",
