 "awd_abstract_narration": "With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the SUNY Albany Center for Social and Demographic analysis will complete the installation of a UNIX network. Major items include a module upgrade for a Sun Sparcstation 20 to a model 514 MP, and 4 SunSparcstation 20 Model 1 with 60 MHz SuperSparc processor with SuperCashe SX 24-bit Color Accelerated graphics imaging workstations. The instrumentation will provide an interdisciplinary group of social science researchers with a computing infrastructure suitable for projects that require the manipulation and analysis of extremely large data files. It will also provide access to state of the art statistical analysis procedures that are memory intensive. Researchers involved include anthropologists, economists, geographers and regional planners, psychologists, sociologists and public health specialists.  The researchers will address a number of topics. These include, for example, a study of segregation and neighborhood change between 1970 and 1990 which will examine trends in metropolitan racial and ethnic segregation, multiethnic patterning and the spatial concentration of poverty and wealth. Other projects will focus on family patterns of southern migrants to northern cities, the relationship between specific aspects of nutrition and mortality, and adolescent behavior and parent-teen communication. The center involves many students in its research and the equipment provided will serve an important educational as well as research function.",
