University of New Hampshire  Title: High-Resolution Coastal Record of Western Equatorial Pacific          and Adjacent Highland Climate During the Last Glacial Cycle    The goal of this study is to derive a high-resolution coupled  record of surface and high-altitude climate change in the western  Pacific warm-pool (WPWP) over the last glacial cycle.  The  record will come from Cenderawasih Bay on the northwest  coast of New Guinea.  Because of its position, proxy  records in Cenderawasih Bay concurrently monitor the temperature  and hydrology of the core WPWP as well as changes in temperature  and precipitation on the directly adjacent Irian Jaya highland.   The program involves a seismic survey and piston cores will be  collected.  WPWP temperature and precipitation changes will be  distinguished using foraminiferal isotope records supplemented by  SST estimates derived from transfer-function analysis of planktonic  foraminiferal census data.  High-altitude paleoclimate changes  caused significant fluctuations in the extent of high-altitude  glaciation as well as the composition and elevation of vegetation  zones.  Glacier, vegetation, and climate changes also will be  reconstructed.  By filling a large spatial and temporal gap in  tropical paleoclimate reconstructions, this project  will contribute to understanding the role of the global tropical  climate system in large-magnitude global changes on sub-millennial  timescales.***",
