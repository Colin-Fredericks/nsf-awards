The  modules will contain instrumentation-oriented components dealing  with current real-world topics, group projects, updated teaching  methods, student learning assessments, emphasis on conceptual  thinking interactive multimedia and exploratory laboratory  experiments. Development of interactive, multimedia computer  programs that simulate the operations of the FT-IR, and FT-NMR  spectrometers, from sample handling to data acquisition and work-up  will be developed in collaboration with Engineering Animation, Inc.  A UV-VIS multimedia simulation has already been developed at the  University of California at San Diego. A consortium of Iowa's 15  community colleges, three public universities, and four private  colleges will collaborate on all aspects of the project through  long-distance video conferences on Iowa's fiber-optics  communication network and at annual summer workshops. This project  will enable students and faculty in the entire state of Iowa to  have facile access to modern instrumentation (UV-VIS, FT-IR and FT-  NMR) via computer simulations. Iowa State university will serve as  a clearing house for running actual chemical samples submitted by  students of the participating institutions. The samples will be run  on instruments at Iowa State University, and the spectra will be  made available to the students and faculty from the community  colleges and private colleges over the internet (via anon ftp,the  world wide web, or by e-mail) as digital files or graphic images.  This project will provide new curriculum enhancements and  developments to four-year institutions and all community colleges  in the state of Iowa.",
