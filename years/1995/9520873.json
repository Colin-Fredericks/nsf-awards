It uses the North Dakota dispute as a case study, but will seek to connect the North Dakota situation to national and international legal concerns.  The dispute involves civil rights, property law, and concepts of Indian sovereignty, and has been pursued in both the legislative and judicial policy arenas.  The investigation will use ethnographic and language analysis methods to analyze data gathered from interviews with key participants in the reburial conflict, legal documents, and media reports on the dispute.  The project should advance theoretical work on civil rights, the legal treatment of scientific values, and the debate in anthropology on the embedding of local conflicts in larger conflicts of interests and institutions.  %%%%  This project investigates how the American legal system has shaped the conflict between scientific and historical interests and the interests of Native Americans with regard to Indian burial sites and the examination of skeletal remains held in scientific and historical collections.
