 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is requested for an instrumentation upgrade to enhance the  research facilities provided by the Microscopy Center at the University  of Massachusetts at Amherst. The Center and its staff provide a  complete range of research and training services in light and electron  microscopy, with emphasis on biological applications. Replacement of  the laser and light sensing system of an existing confocal microscope  will provide the sensitivity needed for projects on living cells, and  an inverted microscope configuration will facilitate microinjection  experiments. For image acquisition, display and processing, replacement  of an outdated Micro Vax computer with an Indigo graphics workstation  capable of handling the three dimensional reconstruction and rendering  of large confocal data sets is requested. Acquisition of a rapid  freezing device and freeze-substitution unit w ill enable users to take  advantage of the improved structural preservation and antigen retention  provided by cryotechniques.    As examples of the work that will be made possible by these upgrades,  the research projects of seven major users and eleven minor users of  the Microscopy Center, covering a wide range of topics are described.  The projects, all of which are externally funded, are focused on  important problems in cell biology, neurobiology, and biogenesis.    Strong institutional support for the Microscopy Center is provided by  contributions from four Administrative units, which currently exceeds  $120,000 per year. Users are charged fees based on the cost of  consumable supplies, and microscope time. This combined income covers  the salaries of two professional microscopists, maintenance contracts  on the electron microscopes and modest repair and replacement costs.",
