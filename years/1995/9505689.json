The focus of the workshop will be on the \"Role of Thermal Swing Absorption in Air Separation.\"  Thermal Swing Absorption (TSA) is an emerging non-cryogenic technique that is specifically designed to use waste heat as the energy source.  An oxygen binding complex is used to selectively and reversibly bind oxygen, which can be released at a higher temperature.  The experience and knowledge transfer from this workshop may lead to research and development with significant impact on cost-effective production of oxygen for its use in pollution prevention or control and for energy savings.  The research needs in this topic will be documented in the form of proceedings.  There is potential of long term impact on the manufacturing of oxygen, a critical gas for industrial and biomedical applications, and on pollution control as well as energy savings.",
