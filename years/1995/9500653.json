The  major  project  is  interdisciplinary  and  involves  aspects  of  physics,  chemistry and optical science. The research deals  with  the new phenomena of sonoluminescence; particularly single bubble  sonoluminescence. A vapor bubble, trapped at the center of  fluid  contained  in an acoustic resonator, radiates bright  flashes  of  light  that  are  easily seen by the naked eye. In  the  process,  energy  densities  can  increase by a factor  of  1012,  and  50-  picosecond light pulses are synchronized with the acoustic  cycle  to a few parts in 1011. This project extends the sonoluminescence  experiments  to  low temperatures by employing  cryogenic  fluids  (nitrogen,  argon,  neon, and helium). Initial  experiments  with  nitrogen have revealed a spectacular increase in luminosity  over  prior   room  temperature  work  involving  aqueous  media.   The  mechanism of the sonoluminescence in not known, and this  project  will obtain information that may allow a mechanism and theory  of  the sonoluminescence to be developed. Additional subprojects deal  with helium films adsorbed in porous materials, sound propagation  in  these  fluids, and a theoretical study of the nature  of  the  superfluid transition in helium.  %%%  This  project  is devoted to the study of cryogenic  fluids.
