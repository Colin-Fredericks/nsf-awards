 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500445  Seymour      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral  Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at  research centers of proven excellence. The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Joseph D. Seymour to work with Dr. Paul T.  Callaghan at Massey University.    The investigator proposes to use nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) experimental techniques to noninvasively probe the  structure of sea ice.  Laboratory manufactured sea ice will  be analyzed using NMR imaging and diffusion measurements of  protons in the entrapped brine of the sea ice.  Images and  measurements of anisotropic and restricted diffusion will  provide data on laboratory sea ice morphology.  The  Antarctic work will be conducted using an NMR system to  measure magnetization relaxation parameters of sea ice core  samples.  Use of the earth's field NMR system is an  important dimension of this project because of possible  applications of the technique, ranging from on site sensors  to underground environmental hazard detection.  The study is  part of the New Zealand Sea Ice Project, a collaboration  involving four universities and a Crown Research Institute,  in which physical and mechanical measurements on sea ice are  made to advance understanding of sea ice physical  properties. ***",
