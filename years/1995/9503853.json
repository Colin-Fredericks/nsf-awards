 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503853  Jackson    This award is for partial support of a time-resolved near-field  optical spectrometer (TRNFOS) to be used fop .semiconductor  nanostructure research.  By combining two commercially available  instruments, we can configure a spectrometer that achieves both  ultrafast (<100 fs) time-resolution and spatial-resolution (< 500  A) more than an order of magnitude better than previously  achievable using the best far field optics.    The unique combination of capabilities of the instrument will  allow us to consider experiments that previously were not  possible.  In particular, this instrument will allow for the  first time:    (A)  Optical observation of spatially local potential       fluctuations no longer masked by the inhomegeneously       broadened photoluminescence lines (following Hess et al.)    (B)  The study of exciton dynamics in confinement to, and       scattering from, these spatially local potential       fluctuations.    (C)    The study of exciton dynamics in quantum wires and dots.       Namely spatially resolved capture of excitons to wires and       dots, as well as spatial transport of excitons along wires.  %%%  The principal aspects of the proposed research are the study of III-V  and II-VI nanostructures.  In the III-V multiple quantum wells the  availability of the TRNFOS instrument will provide a spatial resolution  that will allow optical observation of exciton confinement to lower  dimensions through both \"intrinsic\" local potential fluctuations, as  well as \"extrinsic\" potentials fabricated through focused ion beam  mixing.  For the case of focused ion beam mixing, the instrument will be  capable of providing in a unique manner the lateral potential profile  created by compositional intermixing.  This understanding is an  essential step in creating quantum wire and quantum dot structures.  For  quantum wire-like structures the TRNFOS instrument will provide local  information on exciton lifetimes and exciton anisotropic diffusion to  contrast with our p resent far field results.  Similarly, in II-VI  diluted magnetic heterostructures this instrument will allow us to  observe directly the affect of magnetic ion clustering and alloy  fluctuations on exciton dynamics and the magnetization dynamics of the  magnetic ion themselves.  In particular, we are interested in the  dynamics of exciton self-localization in the formation of lower  dimensional exciton magnetic polarons, and in the affect of d-d  superexchange on the magnetization dynamics of magnetic ion clusters.  The acquisition of this time-resolved near-field optical spectrometer  will significantly advance present NSF supported efforts as well as open  new opportunities to explore semiconductor material science and physics.  The understanding of confined structures, quantum wires, quantum dots,  and arrays will be strongly influenced by the acquisition of this  instrument.  ***",
