 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507444  Rouch      On a long-term basis, the most important organ in the body for controlling blood pressure is the kidney.  Although many people believe that only the heart is important for regulating blood pressure, it is the function of the kidney which assures that the body maintains the correct amount of blood for the heart to pump.  The kidney also functions to maintain an adequate supply of total body fluid so that all bodily organs including the brain, stomach, liver, intestines, muscles, etc., are surrounded by the proper amount of water, electrolytes, and nutrients to function properly.  For the kidney to adequately perform these critically important responsibilities, nerves send signals to the kidney and these signals, in effect, tell the kidney what to do with respect to water, electrolytes, and other substances.  The physiological mechanism of nerve action on the kidney is not well-understood, and innovative research is required to uncover the mysteries of the interaction between nerves and kidneys.  The proposed research project is designed to study this important interaction by measuring various properties related to salt and water transport in the rat kidney in response to nerve action.  The rat kidney has been studied quite extensively in the past and thus, provides an excellent experimental model for the proposed research study.  Specifically, this project will be an investigation of how nerve receptors in the kidney function to control the renal handling of salt and water which is very important in the maintenance of normal blood pressure.  The information gained from this study will add significantly to body of knowledge involved with the how the kidney controls blood pressure and what role the nerves play in this very important function.  ***",
