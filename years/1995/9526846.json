Common mechanisms of speciation  involve physical isolation of populations for long periods  of time: when sufficiently isolated such that virtually no  migration occurs between populations, populations regularly  diverge in their traits. If isolation continues long enough,  the result is speciation.  Even occasional migration between  populations, however, leads to gene exchange that prevents  genetic divergence of populations from occurring, at least  when the consequence of migration is joint reproduction of  individuals derived from different populations. Thus, the  tendency of organisms to accept as mates those individuals  born in different populations should affect the probability  and rate of speciation. For organisms with good powers of  dispersal, physical isolation between populations may occur  rarely, and mate choice for members of one's natal  population could have an important role in speciation  processes.    This study experimentally investigates the occurrence and  significance of mate preferences for natal population in two  populations of longtailed finches. The longtailed finch is a  small songbird native to northern Australia; although it is  a strong flier, natural populations occurring at short  distances from one another are highly distinctive.  Preliminary work has established that birds from one  population refuse to mate with birds from a different  population.  Additional work will  determine the causes and  functions of this preference for natal population.  Research  will include investigation of the cues birds use to  recognize birds from their own population; how early life  experiences may modify a bird's p erception of what  constitutes \"its own\" population; and the role of  preferences for associating with kin in these population  preferences.  Results of these experiments will be relevant  to several broad areas of contemporary scientific  exploration in biology, including population biology,  evolution, ecology, and animal behavior. Results may be  useful in furthering our understanding of captive breeding  of wild animals and management of threatened species.",
