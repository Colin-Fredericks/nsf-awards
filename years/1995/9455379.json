 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455379  Galanter  Undergraduate science education has two jobs. First it must prepare  young scientists to continue their studies in one of the  disciplines. But even more important, science education has a  responsibility to the nation and its citizens to ensure scientific  literacy among the electorate. If we regard all introductory  students as recruits for advanced work as a major, we may fail to  provide subject matter appropriate to the non-scientist.  Alternatively, if the non major is a central obligation, we may not  attend to the needs of the advanced instruction. We propose an  alternative-a constructivist introductory program that lets  students study quantitative and experimental aspects of human  nature from the biological to the social at varying depths and  breath. The program provides the infrastructure for a core  curriculum in science. This new educational design consists of  transportable but interdependent modules that require careful  reading and analysis, occasionally of primary sources. There are  also many opportunities for a variety of complementary projects,  field trips, computerized experiments and simulations, and summer  studies in research laboratories, that will let students extend  their science skills.  Student participation in the collection and  analysis of data and concepts are central to this proposal, thus  departing significantly from audio-visual and electronic  augmentation of classical lecture methods. These separable, but  cross-integrated units can be adapted to a variety of teaching  contexts. We will demonstrate this portability by using them at  neighboring institutions during or immediately following this  grant.",
