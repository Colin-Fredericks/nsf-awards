 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advances in optical materials and technology play an  important role in the future of undergraduate science and  engineering programs.   The Department of Physics and Applied  Optics offers three courses in the area of optical materials and  applications.   Hands-on experience with modern optics and its  related technology is essential in the motivation and training of  students in applied optics program.    Through this project, new  experiments enable students to grow and to examine electro-optic  and nonlinear crystals and organic polymer thin films.   These  laboratory experiments investigate three important aspects of  optical materials:  (1)  crystal fabrication, (2) optical  properties, and (3) applications.   Some of these labs are  structured while some are open-ended labs to allow for the  students creativity.   The major instruments provided through  this project are (1) Neslab bath circulator and Diamond saw for  crystal fabrication, (2) polarization microscope, scanning  monochrometer, storage oscilloscope, and data acquisition system  for characterization of materials, and (3) laser diode system,  imaging system, high-speed detection system, and a HeNe laser for  the proposed applied experiments.   This equipment acquisition  provides undergraduates skills and experience in crystal growth,  concepts, and techniques that are utilized by researchers and  industries.",
