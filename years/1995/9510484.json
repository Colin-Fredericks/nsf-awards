 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rosemarie Szostak, Chemistry Department, Clark Atlanta University, is   supported under a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and   Engineers by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division to incorporate theoretical modeling   into a program in the experimental design of  zeolites and zeolite based   catalysts. Dr. Szostak will join the Biosym  Catalysis and Sorption   Project, which is a partnership developing effective software for the   solution of catalysis and sorption problems.  Dr. Szostak will apply the   newly designed methodologies to examine faulting in zeolite structures   and to predict organic cations that will alleviate faults in zeolites.  Zeolites are widely used industrial materials which have numerous   applications including as catalysts, molecular sieves, and ion and gas   separation materials. While zeolites have  been studied experimentally   for many years, the ability to theoretically predict their structures or   properties is only now becoming possible. This Career Advancement Award   will permit Dr. Szostak, a well respected zeolite experimentalist, to   obtain the skill needed for her to apply theoretical tools to the   understanding of these materials. By membership in the Biosym  Catalysis   and Sorption Project she will be able to integrate her experimental   program with the most recent computational techniques.",
