 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a modern, fully-equipped,  undergraduate lab in the critical cross-disciplinary area of  Particulate Systems Engineering.   This lab forms the basis for  an undergraduate lab course, serving approximately 40 students  each year, taught in conjunction with the course, \"Particulate  Systems Engineering\" (ENGR 379), offered through the Particulate  Systems Research Center.   This lab course is expanding and  enhancing a successful undergraduate program in this area which  has included the nurturing of over 70 talented undergraduates  through a previous NSF grant.   Accurate measurement and  prediction of particulate properties are important to the science  and technologies associated with global warming, ozone layer  depletion, indoor and outdoor air pollution, combustion,  micro-contamination control, nanophase and materials  manufacturing, sensor and fiber optic fabrication, reduced  production and cleanup of hazardous wastes, and nuclear reactor  safety.   This importance is emphasized by the fact that over 70  percent of DuPont products are in particulate form, and that the  nation's research agencies initiatives in global warming, air  quality, and nanophase manufacturing.   Equipment used in this  project falls into three categories: aerosol generation, aerosol  classification, and analytical lasers.   In combination with the  substantial equipment already in place, this new equipment allows  undergraduate students to participate in an intensive laboratory  course that includes experiments designed to measure particle  distributions, characterize aerosol particles, study aerosol  dynamics and reaction chemistry, study specific aerosol  applications, and study and compare different aerosol measurement  and generation techniques.",
