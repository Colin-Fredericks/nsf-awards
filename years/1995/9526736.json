As in previous years, the purpose of this conference is  to provide an informal forum for the presentation and discussion of  new work on selected topics in nonlinear optics quantum electronics  and lasers, and their applications to physics, chemistry and  engineering.  An informal atmosphere with a strong emphasis on  discussion is intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a  manner not possible at regular meetings of professional societies.   Particular effort is made to provide an opportunity for graduate  students and postdocs to interact in this informal atmosphere with  foremost experts in the field.  A total attendance of approximately  135 scientists from universities, industry and government is  anticipated.  It is proposed that the estimated total expense for  the conference of 440,000 be shared by the National Science  Foundation ($6,000), the Office of Naval Research ($5,000), the Air  Force Office of Scientific Research ($10,000), the Army Research  Office ($4,000).  The remainder ($15,000) is obtained from  registration fees paid by Gordon Conference attendees.  The  National Science Foundation funds will be used to assist graduate  students and selected junior faculty who, because of limitations of  their own sources of funding, require financial assistance to  attend the conference.  No honoraria will be paid.  ***",
