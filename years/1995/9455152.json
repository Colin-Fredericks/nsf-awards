 "awd_abstract_narration": "To focus attention on improving the undergraduate preparation of  teachers of middle grades mathematics, the MIDDLE MATH Project  will host two Summer conferences and an academic year seminar.  Forty mathematicians and mathematics educators from across the  United States will work collaboratively to develop middle grades  certification or endorsement programs.    During the first conference, participants will: explore the NSF  Middle Grades Mathematics Curricula currently being developed;  hear and react to the developers' perspectives on how curriculum  change should affect teacher preparation; review past teacher  preparation projects; analyze the NCTM and MAA recommendations  for change; and reflect on relevant research.    Using electronic mail, a team of research mathematicians and  mathematics educators will guide seminar participants in a  focused look at the nature of the college mathematics that middle  grades teachers should experience. They will review the middle  grades text from the NSF-funded NCTM Research Interpretation  Project and will discuss the past NSF Middle-School Mathematics  Teachers Preparation Projects with their developers.    The second summer conference will serve as a catalyst for change.  Participants will explore ways in which to use research on the  learning of undergraduate mathematics to support and inform  curriculum development. Working groups will be established to  help the participants review and refine drafts of their proposed  program models, course syllabi, and related publications. An NSF  program officer will discuss potential sources for funding  continued reform efforts.    The MIDDLE MATH Project monograph will include edited  descriptions of selected teacher preparation programs, course  syllabi and related papers. It is hoped that the project will  serve as a catalyst for change. Participants will use knowledge  gained from learning of relevant NSF initiatives to create more  appropriate middle grades programs.",
