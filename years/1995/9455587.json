Designed for use  by undergraduates in introductory level courses (in both  traditional and long-distance classroom and home settings), Vision  and Voice aims to encourage the exploration of language within an  interactive, multimedia, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural  environment.  It links  together the methods, theories and data of  anthropology, biology, cognitive science, linguistics, literature,  neurology and the visual and performing arts.    In both its  prototype and future CD-ROM formats, The Origins of  Communication focuses on three broad areas of language: (1)  Evolution (2) Human Development, Language Acquisition, and Animal  Communication; and (3) the Brain.  All three areas of investigation  include multidisciplinary material (theories, data, controversies)  on visual and verbal aspects of communication.  It is PROLARTI's  first undertaking, which promises to provide a model for truly  interdisciplinary research and teaching on language and to bridge  the widening gap between the sciences and humanities.  It plans to  do so by redesigning scientific investigations of human  communication to include the study of art alongside the study of  language.  When art is defined as \"visual representation,\" its  presence in all aspects of human communication (e.g., gesture)  becomes apparent. Rather than simply emphasize similarities between  language and art,    PROLARTI's prototype for Origins of  Communication  will focus on their differences as well.  Language,  being primarily a symbolic system of signs, stands in contrast to  iconically-based systems, such as art.  The shift in emphasis as  exemplified by PROLARTI's prototype of The Origins of Communication  aims to not only broaden the study of language to include all  communicative processes--nonverbal forms (glossed here as \"art\") as  well as verbal--but to expand the teaching of undergraduate courses  on linguistics by incorporating multimedia and interactive material  from the life and social sciences as well as the humanities.",
