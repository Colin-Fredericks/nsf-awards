 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413299  Garvine    This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in coastal  oceanography between two research teams led by Richard W. Garvine, University of  Delaware, and A.E. Hill at the School of Ocean Sciences, University of Wales.  The  objective of the research is to directly observe, using free-drifting buoys, the flow  regime of baroclinic gyres (or spirals) in shelf seas which form in spring/summer  each year. These gyres are produced in topographical depressions by differing  amounts of tidal mixing between the shallow edges and deep center of the  depressions.  Though a newly discovered phenomenon, seasonal baroclinic gyres  appear to have important ecological consequences for dispersal of contaminants in  coastal waters, on retention of planktonic larvae, and on the nature of shelf sea  circulation.    The researchers will conduct joint field observations of seasonal baroclinic gyres off  the coast of Scotland and then apply a series of modeling studies to the  observational data.  The United Kingdom will provide ship time on the research  vessel RRS Challenger.  By combining the modeling capabilities and observational  resources of the two research groups, especially in satellite-tracked drifters, the  researchers will obtain optimal coverage and resolution of shelf sea circulation.",
