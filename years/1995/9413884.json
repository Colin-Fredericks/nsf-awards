 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kushner  This conference is the second held devoted to RNA processing and mRNA decay in prokaryotic cells. The objectives this time focus more on the processes of RNA decay and processing. Because of the rapid progress in the area of eukaryotic mRNA (messenger) decay, one session is being held as well on that topic.  Other topics discussed include biological systems affected by RNA decay, properties of cis-acting elements that affect mRNA decay, mechanistic features of protein and protein complexes involved in mRNA processing and decay, and mRNA decay in organisms other than E. coli.  Because of its importance in mRNA decay and the apparent existence of eukaryotic cDNAs that can complement its activity, an entire session is being devoted to the enzyme RNase E.  %%%  There have been no other meetings devoted to this subject since 1991.  The field is making rapid progress in understanding this important aspect of the regulation of gene expression.  Understanding this process will contribute to maximizing gene expression in a number of areas of biotechnology.   ***",
