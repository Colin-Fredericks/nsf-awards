Tripathi, Chair, Department of Computer  Science, University of Maryland and Pankaj  Jalote, Dept. of Computer Science, Indian  Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. This  project addresses a number of design and  analysis issues relating to replicated systems.   Its basic goal is to enable the designer to  analyze replicated systems for the purpose of  predicting performance and tuning them to  obtain the highest availability.  The most  important issues include: availability  analysis, the effect of parameters such as  degree of replication and node/network  reliability, parameters to maximize system   availability, and preferred protocols.    Scope:  Considering the growing need for  computer systems that offer high availability,  this research is timely and has broad  application potential.  The P.I.s have  complementary expertise in two areas critical  for the research.  Jalote is internationally  known in fault-tolerance and software  engineering.  Tripathi is an accomplished  computer scientist and well known for his work  in performance evaluation.  Computer science is  an area of  exceptional strength in India and  the IIT Kanpur one of the top research  institutions in this field.  The collaboration  should be productive with many mutual benefits  anticipated.    ***",
