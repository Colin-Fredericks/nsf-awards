The research component will focus on a   mechanical approach to biological pattern formation.  This interdisciplinary   modeling project will focus on studying and constructing realistic model   mechanisms that capture key biological processes that may be involved in   spatial patterning and showing how they are orchestrated.  Model   applications will include mechanisms for the generation of embryonic   fingerprints.  Particular emphasis will be placed on (i)  development of   analytical and numerical techniques for the solution of model equations,   such as perturbation theory and the use of the level set approach for the   solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations coupled with parabolic   equations, (ii) biological interpretation of the results in terms of insights and   predictions, (iii) model comparisons based on currently known biology, and   (iv) model refinements as they apply to specific biological patterning   problems such as the development of fingerprints.  It is expected that this   work will result in a much better understanding, both mathematically and   biologically, of the mechanical effects of cell traction on cell motion and   cell aggregation within embryonic tissues, and should, therefore, provide   significant insight into how this relatively new mechanical approach to   modeling biological patterns could be used to address pattern formation   problems in developmental biology.  The education component will focus   on an interdisciplinary mathematical modeling curriculum for   undergraduate and beginning graduate students.  It is proposed to design,   develop, and implement a coordinated biomathematical modeling   curriculum for life science students that will initially be adopted at the   University of Massachusetts, Amherst and, therefore, available to the other   four colleges (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith) in the Five   Colleges Consor tium through the established student and faculty exchange.    The curriculum will consist of two parts:  the first part will be a bridge   between calculus and its applications and it will involve technology in the   classroom.  It is expected that this course will provide the textual material   necessary to support a substantial modeling course.  The second part will be   a sequence that will introduce students to contemporary biomathematical   modeling.  It is expected that this course will cover quantitative topics that   will help life science students deal with the numerical and technical   information they will encounter.  Regular meetings with undergraduate   course directors and other interdisciplinary faculty members will be an   important part of this mission.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-  wide  program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single   program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally underrepresented in science   and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance   the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic   careers which include both research and education.",
