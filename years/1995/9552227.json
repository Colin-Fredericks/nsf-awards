 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a multidisciplinary, applications-oriented  laboratory course providing hands-on experience in the  acquisition and analysis of dynamic data.  Although the  Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments have been  providing courses in noise control, dynamic systems analysis,  vibrations, electronic signals and systems, and communications,  their laboratories are not sufficiently equipped to demonstrate  and reinforce the principles taught in these courses and students  have had little or no exposure to industrial applications of  dynamic data acquisition and analysis.   This new lab course  remedies these deficiencies, strengthens existing curricular  strands, and provides students with the training necessary to  pursue more sophisticated projects in their Capstone design  courses.  The new course initially is divided into five modules,  each centered around specific applications of signal analysis  such as speech encoding and enhancement, machinery sound power,  and machine condition monitoring/diagnostics.   The modules can  be modified and more modules added as technology and industrial  needs change.   Representatives from industry are being asked to  assess the contents and methods of the course.   The course  directly affects 70 - 100 engineering students a year.   A  laboratory manual with instructor's supplement is also being  developed.",
