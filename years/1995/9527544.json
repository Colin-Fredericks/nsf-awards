 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527544  Morton  Current trends in the computational sciences lean toward distributed and parallel computing as a tool for flexible and efficient problem solving across a broad spectrum of disciplines.  Businesses increasingly depend on client/server computing platforms for achieving flexible network capabilities with outside entities, such as the emerging \"Information Superhighway.\"  Meanwhile, parallel processing methods are increasing utilized to solve large-scale problems in shorter periods of  time.    While the issues of client/server programming and parallel processing of large-scale problems are considered  mainstream\" in major research centers and organizations, institutions such as Cameron University lack local access to such technology and are unable to benefit from the advantages of these approaches.  With the introduction of large amounts of free, reliable software, along with low-cost hardware, much of this technology is now accessible to those with appropriate computing skills.  The PI intends to make use of these resources, demonstrating the enormous benefits that such use provides to small undergraduate institutions, while providing an infrastructure for education and research activities in parallel and distributed computing at Cameron University.",
