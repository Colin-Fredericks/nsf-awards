 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor  Mark A. Johnson of Yale University will continue and extend his research in the  development of a general spectroscopy for anion-molecule complexes. Weakly bound  excited states of ion-molecule complexes of the type (X-).CH3Y  will be investigated by  high resolution spectroscopy to obtain structures of nucleophilic substitution reaction  intermediates.  For this purpose a pulsed field detachment method is to be developed  as  a general spectroscopic tool.  The goals of this research are the determination of the  equilibrium geometries of the complexes, to achieve selective excitation of the complexes  near the transition states for Walden inversion, to determine detailed reaction rates for  laser-triggered reactions and the measurement of product recoil kinetic energy distributions,  and to extend these methods to solvated reaction intermediates.  Molecular level reaction  theory is at the forefront of contemporary research in physical chemistry.  Reactions involve  excited electronic states of single molecules, ions, as well as of molecular and ion-molecule  complexes.  The transition state that lies between the reactants and the products is of prime  concern and this research is concerned with developing suitable methods for its  investigation.  The overall aim of this investigation is to obtain a better understanding of  reaction dynamics.",
