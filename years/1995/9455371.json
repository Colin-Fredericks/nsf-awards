 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455371  Bykerk-Kauffman  A college-level Earth Science course, that enrolls both prospective  elementary school teachers and prospective secondary school science  teachers, is being redesigned. Project goals are: (1) to increase  student understanding and appreciation of science in general and  the earth sciences in particular; and, (2) to teach a course that  serves as a model of good science teaching aligned with the state  and federal science education standards.  This redesigned course  emphasizes constructivist hands-on activities, conducted in small  cooperative groups, placing students--not instructors--at the  center of attention. It demands depth of understanding of a few  important topics, not superficial memorization of many terms and  facts. The redesigned course integrates the various sub disciplines  within the earth sciences and emphasizes the underlying themes that  unite all sciences. The course connects science with students'  everyday lives and incorporates the history of science, revealing  science as a human, not alien, endeavor. Finally, assessment is as  \"authentic\" as possible, testing what is truly valued, not just  what is easy to test.  Evaluation of the course before, during and  after the implementation of the innovations will test the success  of course innovations. Results will be presented at conferences, as  published articles, as a published activity manual, and in faculty  workshops.",
