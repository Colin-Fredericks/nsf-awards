The  specific approaches to these problems include: (i) the nature of  the excited state of the special pair primary electron donor, 1P,  which initiates charge separation probed by resonance Raman and  higher order Stark spectroscopies; (ii) distinguishing one step and  two step electron transfer by measurements on RCs in which  components are modified or removed by genetic engineering; (iii)  electric field modulation of the spontaneous fluorescence from 1P  to determine whether the field affects the primary charge  separation step and the direction of the electric dipole moment  whose formation competes with 1P decay; (iv) studies of the  interaction between the bacteriochlorophyll molecules comprising P  and the protein environment by converting residues which make  functionally specific interactions with P into glycine, creating  cavities which can bind exogenous organic molecules to modulate  photosynthetic function; and (v) the origin of unidirectional  electron transfer probed by site specific mutagenesis based both on  measurements of dielectric asymmetry and an evolutionary analysis.  %%%  The initial electron transfer events in photosynthetic RCs are the  key energy transduction and storage mechanisms essential for all  aspects of life on earth. Studies of this system, both at the  detailed molecular level and from a more global perspective, can  offer approaches for improving natural photosynthesis and modeling  artificial photosynthesis. The photosynthetic apparatus is largely  a membrane protein complex whose structure elucidation over the  past 10 years has provided, for the first time, information on the  folding and organization of membrane proteins. It is likely that  within the next 5 years, the overall organization of the  photosynthetic membrane will be fully characteriz ed, a unique and  major achievement in biology. Electron transfer in photosynthetic  proteins provides a paradigm for understanding the factors that  control the rapid movement of electrons on the nanometer scale, and  thus have greatly influenced thinking and prospects for molecular  scale electronic devices. This research focuses on understanding  the mechanism of the earliest, light driven electron transfer  reactions, the unique excited state properties that lead to  efficient charge separation, and the interactions between the  chlorophyll type molecules and their protein environment which  modulate the properties of these chromophores and uniquely  determine the direction of electron flow.  ***",
