 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412381  Knauft / Wardlow       This project involves the dissertation research of an  anthropology student from Emory University.  The student  will study the socio-cultural repercussions of sexually  transmitted diseases (STDs) in a tribal society of Papua New  Guinea.  The project will focus on how women in this society  use this disease category to gain moral social status, by  accusing men of spreading the disease.  Using in-depth  interviews with two samples of women, 50 who reported STD  and 50 women who have not, the project will analyze women's  choices, rhetoric, and social status.  In addition the  project will analyze data from records of clinics on the  prevalence of STDs.        This research is important because it will provide a  valuable case study of the impact of STDs on a tribal  population.  By studying the variations in how diseases  impact on women's lives and how women use the existence of  STDs to negotiate for more autonomy and social status, the  project will advance our understanding of gender relations  in traditional societies and of the cultural interpretations  of STDs. Improvements in our knowledge of how people  interpret the meaning of STDs is a necessary step towards  designing interventions that work to control the diseases.",
