 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416240  Hushmand  On October 9, 1993, new Federal minimum design standards for  Municipal Solid waste landfill Facilities (MSWLF) were released  which impacted the seismic design of landfills.  However, these  new standards combined little information and almost no  guidelines for establishing the seismic performance of landfills.  On January 17, 1994, the Northridge earthquake provided the first  recorded set of strong accelerations in the OII landfill, the  only landfill in the United States which is instrumented with  strong-motion recorders, thus providing a rare opportunity to  analyze a well-documented case history, and to develop guidelines  for the seismic performance of landfills.    The objective of the proposed research is to analyze the strong  motion recordings and the surveyed displacements at the OII  landfill after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  Several types of  dynamic analyses will be used to calculate the ground  accelerations, and the permanent ground displacements.  The  specific objectives are to determine the wave velocity and the  damping properties of landfill materials that simulate the  landfill response.  These backfitted data will be compared to the  wave velocities that are measured from geophysical and surface  wave measurement techniques, in an effort to assess the  applicability of the wave velocity measurements in extremely  heterogeneous media.  The method of analysis will include  conventional engineering methods (e.g. equivalent linear methods  such as QUAD4) and more advanced plasticity models and finite  element models such as LINOS.  Comprehensive models will be  developed that include nonlinear behavior of landfill materials,  two dimensional geometries, and wave propagation and reflection.  Recommendations will be made for the optimal way to monitor the  seismic performance of landfills.    The data collected and generated during this research will be in  digital format to the database of the Southern California  Earthquake Center at the University o f Southern California.  ***",
