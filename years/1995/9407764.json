 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1987, the Plant Resources Center which contains The University of Texas (TEX) and Lundell (LL) Herbaria was given 5000 square feet of new, renovated space to accommodate the growth engendered by the receipt of the remainder of the Lundell collection (60,000 specimens) and the Moldenke collection (6475 specimens).  However, in addition to these collections, the PRC has grown by about 100,000 specimens  over the last five years.  The combined influx of the Lundell material and additional growth has now saturated all of the space provided by the University.  Beginning in 1994, the PRC will receive a large collection of 11,600 specimens from Dr. Paul Fryxell. The Fryxell material which consists primarily of Malvaceae will Compliment the collections in the PRC because the majority of the specimens are form Mexico and Latin America.  Dr. Fryxell plans to spend most of the year in Austin where he will continue his research and help curate the Malvales.  In addition, the PRC was given a notable collection of North American Yucca specimen (155 numbers) that it must sort, label, and mount.   This collection will ultimately be one of the most complete collections of North American Yucca in the World.  The University of Texas has shown its continued support for the PRC by providing another 3000 square feet of space that it has agreed to renovate at a cost of $20,000.  In addition, beginning in the summer of 1994, the University has agreed to fund the equivalent of an additional full time position for the PRC.  The University cannot, however, provide cases for the space.  Funds will provide herbarium cases for the new floor and for one half-time graduate student Curatorial Assistant to incorporate the Fryxell collection,  help prepare the Yucca material, assist in shifting the herbarium, and make necessary additions to the  type register.",
