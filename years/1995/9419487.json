 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA sequence determinations are of fundamental importance for studies  in many areas of the biosciences. including functional biochemistry,  cell and molecular biology, population genetics, and molecular  systematics. The purpose of this proposal is to streamline DNA  sequencing at Arizona State University by seeking funds to establish a  DNA sequencing facility. The major piece of equipment for this facility  will be an automated DNA sequencer, which currently is not available at  our University and which is requested in this proposal. About 20 groups  at Arizona State University routinely use DNA sequencing in their  research, and a large number of graduate students, undergraduates,  postdoctoral fellows, staff, and faculty will benefit from the  establishment of a DNA sequencing facility with an automated sequencer.    The sequencer requested utilizes an infrared laser diode to excite  fluorophor-labeled DNA that is size-separated by gel electrophoresis.  Fluorescence from the fluorophor is detected, and simultaneous scanning  of four sequencing lanes over time can provide a DNA sequence of 800  nucleotides or more with over 99% accuracy in a highly cost-effective  manner. With the equipment requested, 22 samples can be sequenced  simultaneously. Apart from providing a 30% cost-share in purchasing  this equipment, the University also will create a staff-level position  for an individual to run the DNA sequencing facility and will bear most  of the personnel cost involved. A Ph.D.-level research scientist  (already on staff) will supervise the facility. Nominal user fees  (about $5 per sequence) will be charged to cover the cost of chemicals,  the DNA sequencer service contract, and a small part (about 20%) of the  technician's salary. This facility will provide a highly effective and  economic mechanism to obtain and analyze DNA sequence information. An  additional benefit is that DNA sequencing becomes accessible to a large  number of graduate students who work in research areas (for examp le,  systematics and population biology) that would benefit from DNA  analysis, but for whom DNA sequencing facilities currently are not  readily available. Also, many undergraduate projects, which usually  preclude use of radioactivity, could include DNA sequencing. Another  significant advantage of acquisition of an automated DNA sequencer is  that when DNA sequencing becomes more efficient, students will be able  to gather and analyze sequence information more expediently, leaving  more room for emphasis on training in other important areas.",
