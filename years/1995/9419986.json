Most of these preferences and aversions are learned.  The mechanisms involved in this learning are quite complex,  involving both the sensory qualities (taste and odor) and  the dietary value of the food.  For example, rats can learn  to prefer an arbitrary flavor (such as unsweetened cinnamon)  if it is associated with a food that has either calories or  a good taste (such as sugar). Previous work has suggested  that tastes are more easily learned as the basis for  aversions while odors are more easily the basis for learned  preferences.  Capaldi will carry out a series of experiments  which will investigate the relationships between preferences  and aversions on the one hand and odor and taste on the  other in an attempt to determine why this might be the case.  The results will reveal new information about learned food  preferences and aversions, with important implications for  both general learning theory and the understanding of the  origins of human food choice.",
