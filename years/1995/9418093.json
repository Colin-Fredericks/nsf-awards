 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to establish a  palynostratigraphic framework for the Permian to  Triassic sedimentary rocks of the central Transantarctic  Mountains.  This will help provide a chronostratigraphic  reference for Antarctic studies.  Palynomorph data can  also add to knowledge of the composition of the Permian  and Triassic floras and has important biogeographic and  paleoclimatic implications.  This research will give a  clearer picture of the timing and nature of southern  high latitude biotic and climatic changes which are  vital for understanding causes and effects of the end-  Permian global biotic crisis and mass extinctions.    This work will concentrate on the Shackleton Glacier  area and includes one field season to collect samples  and two years of laboratory work.  Existing rock  collections as well as samples collected by other  geologists working in the Shackleton Glacier region will  also be utilized to obtain as complete a stratigraphic  section as possible.  Correlations will be made with  other parts of Gondwana and palynological data will be  integrated with other fossil and lithologic data to  establish a sound, process related stratigraphic  framework.    Field work will focus on the post-glacial sedimentary  units of the Victoria Group (Beacon Supergroup): the  Mackellar, Fairchild, Fremouw, and Falla Formations, and  their equivalents.  Except for marginally brackish,  inland-sea Mackellar beds, the succession consists of  fluvial and lacustrine deposits.  Palynomorphs in these  rocks are almost entirely spores and pollen from land  plants, with occasional acritarchs.  The zonation will  build upon and formalize the preliminary zonation  established previously for southern Victoria Land.    Fossil spore and pollen assemblages can indicate their  parent plants and thus reflect at least part of the  indigenous vegetation.  This information can be added to  other plant fossil (leaves, wood, et cetera) and  paleosol data for paleoclimatic interpretations.  Certain p alynomorph taxa (and assemblages) have specific  biogeographical or environmental implications.  Furthermore, stratigraphic and geographic distribution  patterns of the palynomorphs yield information on  evolutionary trends and rates, provincialism of the  floras, and dispersal pathways.",
