 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423097  Havrilesky    This project involves an extension of prior research supported by  the National Science Foundation by these investigators.  The  research program involves the study of political pressures  exerted on individual members of the Federal Open  Market  Committee (FOMC) the principal policymaking unit of the Federal  Reserve, and the responses of those individuals to these  pressures.  The earlier project developed an econometric  methodology for estimating monetary policy reaction functions for  individual FOMC members.      In this investigation, the researchers update the coding of their  data set describing policy preferences of individual FOMC members  using the newly released transcripts of post-1`976 meetings.   Using the updated data, individuals' reaction function parameters  will be estimated and tests of hypotheses concerning political  influences will be undertaken.  This research will help to  provide a rigorous descriptive history of monetary policymaking  since 1976; it will also provide more current evidence concerning  the internal response of the Federal Reserve to its economic and  political environment.  The data set created will provide a  useful resource for scholars investigating monetary policymaking  in the future.  ***",
