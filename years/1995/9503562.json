The proposed study area is  the depth interval from 100-2000m at 71 W, a region that is  physically representative of much of the margin.  A complete depth  transect in this region will significantly advance our ability to  incorporate margin processes in quantitative models of global  chemical cycles.  The proposed measurements will differ from  previous flux determinations on margins in several respects.  (1)  Flux chamber deployments will be 4 days long, 2-3 times longer than  most deployments in rapidly accumulating, high-flux sediments. This  increased length will define several processes important in  sediments of this type.  In situ measurements will be made of  solute transport by macroninfaunal irrigation in offshore margin  sediments.  Significant improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio  in alkalinity, dell-13C (totalCO2), and dissolved organic carbon  fluxes will be achieved thus providing new information on the  contributions of DOC and above-saturation horizon dissolution of  CaCO3 to the benthic carbon cycle. (2) Flux experiments will be  carried out in duplicate at each of 8 sites, and will be  accompanied by extensive, in situ microelectrode profiling and both  high-resolution and \"standard\" pore water sampling.  Flux chamber  and coring operations will be carried out via submersible, allowing  the combination of measurements to be made in a relatively small,  visually homogeneous area.  The number an combination of  measurements will allow improved evaluation of intra-site  variability over what has been possible in past experiments,  increasing confidence in trends of flux vs. water column depth.   (3) At shallower sites (100-1000m), the increased length of flux  chamber deployments would lead to extensive depletion of O2 in  chamber water.  To counteract this effect (with its potentia l  undesirable consequences are designed to maintain the O2 in  chambers are designed to maintain the O2 level close to that of  ambient bottom water.",
