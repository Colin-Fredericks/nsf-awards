 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420077  Bellamy       A joint conference on topology and dynamical systems will be  held at the University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, from March 30  to April 2, 1995.  This is one of a series of annual conferences  dating back to 1967 (for the topology part), and well over 200  mathematicians are expected to attend.  Over the years this  conference has managed to maintain its traditional identity and at  the same time to expand its breadth.  In particular, dynamical  systems was integrated into the conference in 1987 and has since  become one of the central topics, with those aspects of the subject  that have strong links to the more traditional areas of the  conference having been emphasized.       There will be seven major one-hour addresses and twenty-one  invited half-hour talks.  There will be three additional concurrent  sessions of aproximately twenty-eight fifteen-minute contributed  talks, and students will be encouraged to participate.  Major  addresses will be given by Hames A. Yorke (U Maryland), John W.  Milnor (SUNY at Stony Brook), James T. Rogers (Tulane U), Mary  Ellen Rudin (U Wisconsin), John H. Hubbard (Cornell U), Mladen  Bestvina (U of Utah), and Ruth M. Charney (Ohio State U).  ***",
