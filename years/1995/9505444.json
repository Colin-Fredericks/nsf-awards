 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. David Hales of Hendrix College will study the dependence   of of gas-phase ion-molecule reactions on ion internal energy.  To   accomplish this task two different experimental techniques will be used.    In the first, evidence will be sought for reactions which take place   within ionized clusters of molecules produced in a supersonic expansion   and ionized by electron impact.  Collisional relaxation of an ion in a   cluster involves potentially reactive interactions.  The second technique   involves discharge ionization within a high pressure flow tube prior to   expansion of the gas mixture into a vacuum.  In the pre-expansion   environment the ions undergo many thermalizing collisions with the buffer   gas for each collison with a potenntially reactive molecule.  The ions   which exit the flow tube are probed with a time of flight mass   spectrometer.  Differences in the results between the two techniques will   be analyzed in terms of the different environments in which the reactions   take place.  This research involves the participation of undergraduate   students.  Ion-molecule chemistry is one of the intensely pursued areas of   contemporary reaction chemistry.  This research will contribute to a   better understanding of the reaction processes that occur in different   gas phase environments, and the results will be of use in applications   such as atmospheric chemistry and others.  This research will be   conducted in an undergraduate college and will involve undergraduate   students.",
