 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424226  Crocker    A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Astronomy will  be operated at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa during the  summers of 1995, 1996, and 1997.  The major focus of the research for  the student projects at this site is in the areas of Astronomy and  Astrophysics.   The students will be working with the Astronomy group  within the Department of Physics and Astronomy.    There are six academic faculty, one research professor, five  postdoctoral researchers, and 12 graduate students in the Astronomy  group. It is planned to have five REU summer students each year.  The  summer program will run for 10 weeks and will offer a summer stipend  for the students of $2700.  Free housing and some travel support will  be provided.    The student participants will be chosen on a competitive basis from  applications from around the country, but the heaviest recruiting will  be in the mid-southern United States.  The students will be involved in  research activities and will also take part in coordinated seminars on  science and general scientific techniques.  These activities will help  the undergraduate students develop good research skills and will  introduce them to current research topics.  The student projects are  designed so that the students will complete a particular research  project and that there will be scientific results obtained by the  students that are publishable in a first rate scientific journal.   Selected students will be supported to attend and present papers at  professional scientific meetings.",
