 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) techniques and  associated surface physics tools into the laboratory program.    An existing UHV system is being equipped with a  3-micrometer-resolution electron gun (to produce  secondary-electron and x-ray emission and allow SEM imaging), an  Ar ion gun (for sample sputter cleaning), and electron and x-ray  detectors, together with electronic units necessary for control  and measurement.   The resulting multipurpose facility enables  students to carry out a variety of observations and measurements,  including sample surface imaging and the study of electrons and  x-rays emitted when a clean surface is struck by an electron or  photon beam.   Existing photoelectric effect and x-ray spectrum  experiments in the sophomore Atomic and Nuclear Physics course  are being improved, new experiments on Auger spectroscopy and  electron field emission are being developed for the junior  Contemporary Experimental Physics course, and a variety of  student research projects are now possible in the junior-senior  Special Project laboratory.   The facility represents a unique  effort to provide research-style tools and techniques to students  while keeping costs far below those of high-performance  commercial equipment.",
