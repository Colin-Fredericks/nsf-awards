 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504067  Serene  The purpose of this project is to develop parallel algorithms for many-body calculations for model systems and materials.  The first goal is to elucidate the behavior of phase transitions for these models in self-consistent perturbation theories.  In the vicinity of a phase transition, fluctuations of arbitrarily large length scales contribute to macroscopic thermodynamic properties, so large system sizes are required to quantitatively determine the properties of the phase transitions.  In addition, a quantitative description of a phase transition requires accurate evaluation of small differences between macroscopically-sized free energies, for which a more accurate algorithm for evaluating infinite frequency sums was recently developed.  This parallel algorithm can be extended from models to real materials, however the inclusion of multiple bands and the long-range Coulomb interaction requires substantial algorithm development.  The second goal is to make progress in this direction, starting with development of algorithms for density response in the Random Phase Approximation and aiming towards the evaluation of self-consistent GW self-energies.",
