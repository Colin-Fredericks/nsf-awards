 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is extending the Alewife multiprocessor to explore two  aspects of future scalable multiprocessors.  One aspect is  protection.  Protection is required on accesses to hardware  resources, with as little software overhead as possible.  For  example, when a message sender and receiver are part of the same  application, they should be able to directly access network  hardware.  The other aspect is address translation, so that each  application can have its own address space.  All processors  executing an application must have the same address space, however.   To ensure this, memory mapping hardware is placed at each node of  the multiprocessor, and must be kept coherent.    The FUGU system provides three modes of interprocessor  communication.  Shared memory is provided by hardware synthesized  messages among nodes, which maintain cache coherence.  Short  messages can be sent directly by performing loads and stores to I/O  registers that are in each node's address space.  Longer messages  are managed by a DMA engine that is separate from the processor.    Translation and protection for shared memory and for short messages  are provided by hardware enhancements that maintain coherence in  the translation lookaside buffers and ensure that messages are  received only by the processes that they are addressed to.  For  long messages, only minimal support for address translation is  provided by the hardware since the need for such translation is  likely to be rare.  Any needed translation will be provided by  software.",
