 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522299  Beamon   This is a research planning grant whose objective is to undertake a study involving the incorporation of reliability issues in the design of fixed-path material handling systems. A fixed-path material handling system refers to a class of material handling devices that operate on dedicated paths.  The research is built on the premise that reliability issues can affect the performance of automated fixed-path material handling systems and that the use of appropriate performance and reliability measures will allow for a more accurate and realistic evaluations of such systems. With this premise, the research aims to pursue (1) the development of quantitative methods for defining, modeling, and measuring system failures, reliability, and performability for fixed-path material handling systems, and (2) the  determination and modeling of relevant trade-offs between systems design and material handling reliability or performability. The developed procedures will enable fixed-path material handling systems designers to design, compare, and evaluate the true performance characteristics of such systems. The work to be undertaken during the life of this grant will be exploratory in nature. The research outcome will be used in the preparation of a more detailed proposal aimed at an in-depth pursuit of the research concerns explored under the research planning grant.    Material handling, as a key component in most manufacturing systems, have been well recognized as a major contributor to production cost. Material handling provides the link between machines stations in the flow of material. In highly automated manufacturing systems such as a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), the consequences of a material handling system failure is a complete shut down of the entire operation. Not only does this result to increase in production cost but also increased order throughput time and missed order due dates. The work undertaken in this research can lead to improved system design to lessen failure  frequency, provide an assessment tool for the need of a preventive maintenance program, and also as a tool to evaluate alternate material handling systems and designs. It will also contribute to a better understanding of the stochastic behavior of a material handling system.",
