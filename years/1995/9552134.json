This  program adds new laboratories that make use of microscope-based  methods that allow examination of dynamic phenomena in cells, for  instance immunocytochemical, autoradiographic, and in situ  hybridization methods.   The implementation of such new  techniques, as well as the addition of a microscopy component to  several existing labs, requires new and expanded microscopy  facilities.   In addition to scientific goals, these enhanced  laboratories satisfy several pedagogical goals: to demystify  science, to provide an opportunity for real discovery, and to  learn to communicate ideas and think critically.",
