 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David Waldeck, University of Pittsburgh, is supported by a   grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to   continue his research involving time-resolved spectroscopic studies of   hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes.   Waldeck's prior work involved   measurements of rotational diffusion using optically heterodyned   polarization spectroscopy  and fluorescence depolarization.  The current   project extends this work to obtain a deeper understanding the dynamics   of hydrogen bonded complexes and intermolecular bonding.  He will use the   same experimental techniques,  polarization spectroscopy and fluorescence   depolarization, to study the mobility and flexibility of hydrogen bonded   guest molecules as a function of binding enthalpy and topology.    Experimental studies will be conducted on a variety of host/guest systems   in unassociated but dipolar organic solvents such as trichloro methane   and dimethyl sulphoxide, and comparisons made with theory.  The principal   goal of the research is to understand how the position and strength of   hydrogen bonds determine the flexibility of intermolecular hydrogen   bonded complexes, and to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of   such complexes.  These studies are important because they should elucidate aspects of   dynamics which are important in chemistry and biology.  In biology, the   flexibility of a guest molecule in a host is likely to be of critical   importance for the binding of biological molecules and for enzyme   activity.  In chemistry, the frictional coupling which occurs between a   molecular moiety and a solvent when the moiety is moving in a potential   is at the core of understanding the dynamical influence of a solvent on a   chemical reaction.  The studies being undertaken by Waldeck will have a   direct bearing on these larger and more complex issues.",
