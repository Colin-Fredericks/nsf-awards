 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Yi Lu, of the University of Illinois,  is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and  Organometallic Chemistry Program under a Faculty Early Career Advancement Award for   biomimetic studies of enzyme function.  Site directed mutagenesis will be used to alter the protein  environments of small metalloproteins such as azurin and cyctochrome c peroxidase in an effort to  induce them to become functional mimics of cyctochrome c oxidase and lignin peroxidase,  respectively.  The primary objective of this work is to obtain structural and mechanistic  information about the function of the active site that is difficult or impossible to obtain for the  larger, more complex proteins.  A variety of techniques will be used to study the genetically  engineered proteins including UV-VIS, EPR, MCD, NMR, ENDOR and EXAFS spectroscopies.   When possible x-ray structures on the modified proteins will be obtained.  The teaching plan  outlines methods for introducing modern research methodology into undergraduate laboratories  with emphasis on the first year advanced chemistry laboratory.  Also detailed are plans for training  graduate research students in the recently developed Biomolecular Chemistry program at the  university, which aims to foster interdisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry and  biology.    A major challenge for the chemical industry, which continues to enjoy a favorable trade balance, is  to develop new processes that are still low-cost and high yielding, but are environmentally benign.   Small, properly designed proteins may serve as catalysts for certain processes, which would be   entirely nonpolluting since the reagents, catalyst and products (new proteins) would be  biodegradable.  The studies to be conducted in this project will support the ultimate design of  such small proteins.  For the chemical industry to convert to such manufacturing processes will  require scientists who are skilled in several areas besides chemistry.  Interdisciplinary research  training such as  that envisioned by Dr. Lu for graduate students in the Biomolecular Chemistry  program is crucial to the development of such highly skilled scientists.",
