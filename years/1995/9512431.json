 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512431  Superfine    Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has given scientists and  engineers the ability to map a wide range of physical  properties of surfaces, such as topography, friction,  conductance, with lateral resolution measured in nanometers.  However, instruments are needed which allow us to change the  sample with the same ease that we now characterize it. The  nanomanipulator project will develop an intuitively natural  user interface for scanning probe microscopy and manipulation.  The interface addresses the two aspects most important when  using SPM: representing the data and controlling the SPM tip.  For the former, the project will develop a virtual-reality  interface which presents data from the SPM with a stereoscopic  three-dimensional rendering presented on a monitor. For the  latter, the interface uses a manual force feedback input device  which allows the user to control the position of the SPM tip on  the nanometer scale through the lateral motion of a hand-held  stylus, and simultaneously feel the tip/sample force through  the force feedback feature. This enables a user to place the  nanometer-sized microscopic tip on a specific feature, and to  sense its changing topography while the feature is being  modified. In this way, the finest features of an electronic  device or the dissection of a chromosome can be efficiently  tailored.  %%%  The nanomanipulator project will develop a unique instrument  for the manipulation and modification of materials on the  nanometer length scale, which will be used in a wide range of  experiments in materials science, physics, biochemistry, and  computer science. The nanomanipulator is designed to be  assembled from commercially available components and a major  commercial instrument company is an integral part of the  project. This assures that the instrument, as designed and  completed, will address the generic needs of the microscopy  community.  ***",
