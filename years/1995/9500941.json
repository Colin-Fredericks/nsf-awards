 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the study of p-adic symmetric spaces, the  arithmetic of modular forms, and a number of computational and  algorithmic questions in number theory and algebraic geometry. In  the general area of p-adic automorphic forms, known results about  the relationship between analytic functions and measures on the  p-adic upper half plane and measures on its boundary are  generalized to Drinfeld's higher dimensional p-adic upper half  spaces. Such results have implications for the geometry of  algebraic varieties which are uniformized by the Drinfeld spaces,  including certain Shimura varieties and Drinfeld modular  varieties. They also have important consequences for the p-adic  representation theory of the general linear group. In the area of  modular forms, the principal investigator is continuing to study  questions relating to the \"exceptional zero conjecture\". Finally,  earlier work on algorithms for computing Picard-Fuchs  differential equations and the Gauss-Manin connection are  extended.      The research in this project lies in the general areas of  arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms. Algebraic geometry is  one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics. In the past ten  years, it has blossomed to the point where it has solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures in  the plane defined by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field utilizes methods not only from  algebra, but also from analysis and topology; conversely, it is  extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics. Automorphic  forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the  nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus  long realized that many objects of fundamental importance are  non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is principally  concerned with questions about the whole numbe rs, but in its use  of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical  roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in  theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
