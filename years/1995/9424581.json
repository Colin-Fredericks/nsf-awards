 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports research on the non-perturbative modeling of the quantum  gravitational back-reaction on inflation between Richard P. Woodard of the University of Florida, and  Nicholas C. Tsamis of the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH) in Greece.  The  objective of their research is to develop a non-perturbative technique by modeling the infrared sector  of quantum gravity numerically and then evolving the universe through the extinction of inflation.  The investigators have used the symbolic manipulation program Mathematica, which is supported at both  FORTH and the University of Florida, in their analysis of the perturbative problem.  This jointly  supported facility will also enable their current research.  If the investigators' analysis is  successful, it may be possible eventually to predict the reheating temperature, the spectrum and  magnitude of density fluctuations, for the universe's response to the electroweak and chiral symmetry  breaking phase transitions, and for whatever residual inflationary effect is currently being  experienced.",
