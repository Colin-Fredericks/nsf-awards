 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521208  Edwards  Reproductive behaviors are essential for the survival of all  species.  Testicular hormones are required for reproduction, and  hormones activate mating in males by actions that increase the  sexual responsiveness of males to females.  For many species,  sexual status is communicated by odors, and olfaction makes an  important contribution to sexual arousal in males.  Dr. Edwards  proposes to examine the neural pathways through which the olfactory  system and populations of hormone-sensitive neurons in the brain  regulate male reproductive behavior.  Neuroanatomical techniques  will be used to identify androgen-sensitive neurons and neurons  active during mating.  Special attention will be given to a brain  region that includes the zona incerta and central tegmental field.   Restoration of mating in castrate males by incerta/tegmental  testosterone implants can show the importance of the region for the  hormonal regulation of copulation.  Large lesions of the  incerta/tegmental continuum eliminate mating.  Studying the effect  of small lesions to this region can help identify neuronal cell  fields essential for copulation, and provide a foundation for  studies designed to reveal the projection systems through which  androgens exert their effects on reproductive behavior.  Because  the studies include measures of sexual behaviors (erection, sexual  approach towards a female), they have relevance for understanding  how male reproductive behavior is represented in the organization  of the brain in many species, including man.",
