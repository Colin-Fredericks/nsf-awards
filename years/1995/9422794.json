Given the changing face of America's workforce, the  objective of this project is to better understand how a divers  workforce affects the activities of the firm.  Specifically, a  theoretical framework is developed to capture the impact of  worker heterogeneity on organizations, and its testable  implications are explored.  The spirit of this research is that  workforce diversity impacts organizations both within their  boundaries and in the interface with customers.  In both of these  of settings, information is exchanged and miscommunications are  assumed to lower the efficiency of the firm.  This assumption of  lower communication costs between similar-type agents formalizes  worker heterogeneity as a form of human capital and facilitates  the matching of a firm's distribution and customer populations to  minimize delivery costs.  ***",
