 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421933  This project is for the study of all state research and  development expenditures for Fiscal Year 1994.  The project  will test a model for collecting accurate information on an  annual basis.    The approach described is to collect information through  close interaction with all 50 states, as well as selected  regional groups and national organizations dedicated to  state issues.  The resulting network of state officials will  provide guidance to the overall research project while also  collecting vital data through an extensive survey.  Battelle  will analyze the data, addressing a list of questions  identified in the proposal and the course of the project  concerning state research and development expenditures.    Upon completion of the project, a structure will be in place  for annual studies of state R&D activities.  Also an  accurate characterization of state involvement in research  and development will be prepared for distribution to state  and federal leaders in science and technology, science  policy researchers and others interested in the patterns of  U. S. research and development investment.  The data and  analysis will be of great value for policy formulation,  program development and program evaluation.",
