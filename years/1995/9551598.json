 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a new laboratory that involves students  in all aspects of integrated circuit design and fabrication.    The university is implementing the laboratory in a \"simulated  corporate environment\" that emphasizes technical communication  skills and teamwork for engineering students.   In the laboratory  students (1) gain hands-on experience with computer-aided design  tools for designing integrated circuits; (2) fabricate designs  through NSF-sponsored facilities (MOSIS); (3) conduct  measurements on fabricated chips; (4) work in teams to achieve  overall success; and (5) develop written, verbal, and e-mail  communication skills.  In the laboratory, students participate as  \"employees\" of a VLSI design \"company\" working in different  divisions to solve a common problem.   The company framework is  being created through local area network (LAN) of 10 Pentium--  based computers.   This project is equipping the LAN with  additional software to allow for circuit simulation, physical  circuit layout, word processing, presentation, data analysis, and  electronic mail.   For the accurate measurement of fabricated  chips and comparison of designed values, two pieces of additional  test equipment are being added to pre-existing lab facilities.   The \"simulated corporate environment\" was designed to prepare  engineers for situations in the workplace, where they evaluate  problems, define potential solutions, form plans of action, and  communicate ideas to peers and superiors.   This laboratory will  be critically evaluated by students, faculty, and industry  contacts to confirm its value in engineering education.",
