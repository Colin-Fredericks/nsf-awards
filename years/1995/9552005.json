 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an undergraduate laboratory in which the  thermal behavior of electronics is used as a means of teaching  the fundamentals of heat transfer.   Essential heat transfer  principles are taught using apparatuses that model or simulate  actual thermal characteristics of electronic components and  systems.   This laboratory supports a heat transfer course  required of Mechanical Engineering Technology majors at the  university.   Ancillary uses of the laboratory in thermodynamics,  fluid mechanics, and electronics courses are also supported.  As  a result of the dramatic increase of electronic packaging  densities driven by requirements for more computing power and  real-time communications, thermal control of electronics has  become a critical technology.   The degree and specificity of  heat transfer education invoked by this technology pose unique  demands on today's technology graduates.   This project helps  satisfy those demands by introducing engineering technology  students to thermal control techniques for electronic equipment.    Because thermal engineering of electronics has been identified as  a critical technology for the economic competitiveness of the  United States, this project has the potential of having a  significant impact.",
