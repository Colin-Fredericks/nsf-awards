 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry at the College of the Holy Cross has a long tradition of excellence in instruction, curriculum innovation, research training and research.  In 1990, the College ranked 13th out of 925 private, undergraduate institutions, in the number of graduates earning doctorates in chemistry from 1979 to 1988. At Holy Cross, research training begins at the student's first year through a research-oriented curriculum called Discovery Chemistry.  Students learn through active participation with other students and faculty.  This joint effort fosters cooperation instead of competition, and illustrates to students the dependence each scientist has on the entire scientific community.   In addition to the department's commitment to research training, eight of nine faculty members maintain active  chemical research programs in organometallics, analytical chemistry, photochemistry and medicinal chemistry.  Research is conducted in Haberlin Hall, a 1959 structure that is home to the department.  The present configuration and antiquated condition of the building impedes research by isolating laboratories from departmental activities that limits contact opportunities students or other faculty have with the research facilities on a regular basis. To improve this situation, the College, with assistance from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, will  consolidate and renovate research space to establish a research complex.  The HVAC system, interior surfaces, fume hoods, benches and storage areas will also be upgraded.  These renovations will foster collegial interactions, promote collaborative investigations and better support the modern research methods of the Department.  The project is in harmony with the Department's overall emphasis on cooperative learning, and it will continue to enhance the strong record of research and research training at Holy Cross.",
