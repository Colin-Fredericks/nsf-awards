 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networked Financial Simulation Using LambdaMOO Technology   Given recent advances in network and MUD (Multi-User Domain)  technology, it is now possible to build a networked simulation of  the international financial system containing within it several  simulated national financial systems. We propose to build that  simulation, and to call it Money MOO.  Few current financial or  economic simulations illustrate interactions inside the financial  system as a whole. Fewer still combine national and international  financial systems to illustrate their interconnectedness. Although  the economic system itself is dependent on interactions among  individuals and institutions, currently available simulations do  not typically base their outcomes on that reality. Instead, most  existing financial simulation software is designed to be used by an  individual student working in isolation, not cooperating or  interacting with other students.  Our proposed simulation, Money  MOO, will have the following characteristics:  a. The simulation will be interactive and its outcomes will depend       on the combined decisions of the student-players.  b. The simulation will be made freely available to all educational       institutions through the Internet.  c. The simulation will be fun to play. It will be a version of the       most popular networked interactive game format which exists,       the Internet MUD.  This networked simulation tool will permit courses such as  Introductory Macroeconomics, Money and Banking, and Financial  Institutions and Markets to be taught much more effectively than  they can be if the only available tools are textbooks and  single-user simulations.",
