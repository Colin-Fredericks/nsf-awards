Current agents can achieve low-level  execution goals such as object avoidance, but lack the ability to  reason about and to carry out multiple interacting tasks.  Integrating planning and execution by a robot is a complex task,  requiring learning from prior experience to improve significantly  the overall capabilities of the intelligent agent. We will  explore the integration of planning, execution, and learning,  where the robot's successes and failures are incorporated into a  knowledge base to improve future goal-achievement performance.  This project entails the investigation of a variety of system and  knowledge engineering issues, including: communication between  the planner and the executor; interaction between the robotic  agent, the planning system, and the human user who may, at any  time, request that certain tasks be performed; and gathering and  interpretation of information to learn from experience.  The  scientific goal underlying this research is to understand the use  of past experience to solve problems in complex situations  affected by multiple factors with different degrees of  controllability and interdependency.  Even partial achievement of  this goal could be of great significance to both the robotics and  cognitive science or artificial intelligence research  communities, bridging the representation and reasoning gap  between high level planner-learner and autonomous agent executing  tasks in the real world",
