 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project designs a set of nested or interrelated experiments  employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as a  technique that exposes students to the use of this versatile  instrument at ever-increasing levels of sophistication.   Because  the intent is to incorporate GC-MS in the introductory general  and organic chemistry laboratory sequences, an  instrument-intensive research-like experience has been designed  for each laboratory sequence around an interdisciplinary theme:   Environmental Chemistry for the general chemistry laboratory  (analysis of an artificial \"gasoline\" mixture followed by water  and soil analyses contaminated with gasoline and/or pesticides)  and Plant Assays for the organic chemistry laboratory (a fatty  acid, methyl ester analysis of a plant extract using standards  synthesized by the students and synthesis, identification, and  characterization of a series of plant growth hormones).   The  assumption in designing each project in this manner is that  students gain sufficient mastery in GC-MS by a sequential series  of applications and that exposure to modern instrumentation,  especially in a hands-on format, is highly desirable.   The  thematic basis for the projects creates links with the related  disciplines of geosciences and biology.   Many aspiring premeds  take biology, if not geology courses, so the bridging laboratory  concept helps those students see the relevance of their  laboratory work from several disciplinary perspectives.  In both  the general and organic chemistry laboratory sequences, the  organizational paradigm of \"Synthesis, Structure, and  Identification\" is enhanced by the integration of the GC-MS with  its dual capability of separation and identification.",
