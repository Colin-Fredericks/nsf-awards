 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422075  Hough    Radio and optical studies of quasars will be carried out in order to  contribute toward the unification of the physical models which describe  the active galaxies and quasars.  Quasars are thought to be young,  distant, powerful galaxies that may harbor supermassive black holes in  their central regions.  However, they may be just an extreme example of  the general phenomenon of active galaxies in which unusually large  power output from the nuclear regions is observed.  In order to test  the various hypotheses that attempt to unite the theories about the  quasars with other active galaxies - including BL Lac objects, radio  galaxies, and Seyfert galaxies - a carefully selected, complete sample  of twenty-five of the most powerful quasars known will be studied.  Radio telescopes working in unison as interferometers will be used to  Make radio wavelength images of the quasars, from their very centers to  huge radio-emitting regions up to a million light-years away. The time  sequences of images for the central regions will permit a study of  apparent faster-than-light, or \"superluminal\", motion observed in these  quasars.  Optical observations will be made to obtain the spectra of  the light emitted from these quasars, and hence we will learn something  of the physical state of the gas surrounding the central object.  The  statistics of various radio and optical properties of these quasars  will be used for rigorous tests of \"unified models\".  The results of  the observations may possibly be used to calculate the size and age of  the universe.  Additional observations, which will push the resolution  limits of the radio astronomy techniques, will be carried out.",
