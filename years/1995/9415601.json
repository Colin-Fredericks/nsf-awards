The  monsoonally forced Arabian Sea ecosystem is one of the most  productive in the world, but with sharp, seasonal contrasts  in production and sedimentation.  The system is unusual  in  the distribution and comparison of its fauna, and in the  pathways by which surface production is distributed into the  water column and sea floor.  The Somali coastal upwelling  zone is a productive region supporting a high-biomass, low-  diversity pelagic fauna, and the equatorial Indian Ocean is  a typical oligotrophic zone with a high diversity of  inadequately  known species.  Many questions remain to be  answered on the role of such processes as defecation and  diel vertical migration of large organisms in regulating  vertical fluxes of material in these contrasting regimes.        Specific objectives of the study include: 1)  determination of distribution and abundance of  macrozooplankton and fishes; 2) determination of the extent  and timing of diel vertical migration of zooplankton and  fish; 3) examination and quantification of stomach contents  and egestion rates of macrozooplankton; 4) use of trawl  collections to provide ground-truth calibration of  concurrent acoustic sampling by other investigators; and 5)  analysis of the species diversity and zoogeography of  macrozooplankton and fishes in the Arabian Sea and adjacent  equatorial Indian Ocean.       Our results will contribute to understanding community  structure and trophic dynamics in the Arabian Sea and Indian  Ocean pelagic ecosystems.  The cruises will be concurrent  with two of the JGOFS Pelagic Process cruises, and our data  will bear on JGOFS objectives of measuring and understanding  vertical fluxes in the Arabian Sea.",
