 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Benny Gerber, U. C. Irvine, is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the dynamics of   molecular reactions in clusters.  Gerber will study photochemical   reactions in hydrogen bonded and in van der Waals cluster as well as   collision-induced reactions of atoms with such clusters.  Research will   be conducted in four areas: 1) The study of possible collective reactions   induced by UV excitation of hydrogen bonded clusters; 2) Differences in   reactivity between solid-like and liquid-like states of clusters; 3)   Electronic relaxation of excited atoms and molecules solvated in   clusters; and 4) Photodissociation / recombination on the electronic   ground state of molecules in clusters.  A combination of classical MD and   semiclassical wavepacket treatments will be employed.  A semiclassical   technique will be used to preserve zero point energy in the molecular   dynamics treatments which employs wavepackets for stiff vibrational modes   and classical dynamics for soft modes.  The study of molecular reactions in clusters is of primary importance as   a technique for gaining additional insight into the effects of solvation   upon chemical reactions.   Experimental and theoretical conditions can be   varied in a systematic fashion from relatively small clusters consisting   of a few  isolated molecules all the way to large clusters which mimic   condensed matter in the bulk solution.",
