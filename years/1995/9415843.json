Janette Murillo de Nava, under the  direction of Dr. Donn Gorsline, University of Southern  California, Los Angeles, on coastal studies in Baja  California Sur, Mexico.  The goal of the project is to  obtain a comparative understanding of little known arid and  semiarid coastal types.  Emphasis will be in two areas: the  fan-deltas of the Gulf of California coast of Baja  California Sur  and the semi-arid Magdalena Coastal Plain of  the Central Pacific coast of Baja California.  These  tectonically active areas provide a unique opportunity to  contrast broad coastal plain evolution with steep mountain  fan-delta coasts under similar climatic conditions.    Fan-delta deposits are very important potential  stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoirs.  In the study area  they serve as ground water reservoirs and as main habitation  areas.  An understanding of their geometry, architecture,  physical properties and physiography is thus of considerable  significance.  Modern work on fan-deltas has been mainly  done in glacial or humid areas and models for the deposits  are based on outercrops in East Greenland and their  occurrences in the North Sea.  By diversifying the climatic  and physiographic setting, this study will provide an  important addition to the field of sedimentology and to  ongoing studies in Arctic fjords and protected waters  elsewhere.    ***  .",
