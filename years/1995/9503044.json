 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ripon College  This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of   the research and teaching activities of Dr. Colleen Byron. The research   plan involves the characterization of the electron transfer properties of    the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCD) by electrochemical,    spectroscopic and synthetic organic techniques. The research will focus   on the role of substrate and/or product complexation on the electron   transfer properties of GCD, and the effect of alterations of the GCD   aminoacid sequence, particularly near the active site, on the electron   transfer properties of GCD.  Dr. Byron's teaching plan will focus on   development of the analytical, organic and biochemistry courses. She will   update these courses  to include topics and laboratory experiments of   societal and environmental  relevance and emphasize interdisciplinary   science.  She will also coordinate a chemistry seminar series and   continue activities in undergraduate advising and mentoring.  Apart from the inherent advancement of  our understanding of electron   transfer in enzymatic systems, this research will address specific issues   relevant to  the metabolism of certain aminoacids by GCD at a molecular   level  and the role of mutations in GCD  deficiency. The involvement of   undergraduate students in the implementation of the research will have a   significant educational value.",
