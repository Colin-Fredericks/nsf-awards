Scranton      The emission of VOCs from curing inks, films, and coatings is a leading cause of atmospheric pollution.  VOCs impart desirable viscosity and cure rate properties to ink and coating formulations.  An ink or coating formulation must be sufficiently fluid to be easily applied (often onto a rapidly moving substrate through a series of transfer rollers), but must cure rapidly to a hard film.  These demands have been met through the use of rapidly evaporating organic solvent in the ink and coating formulations.  This work investigates the use of cationic photopolymerization of diepoxides and bisvinyl ethers for such inks and coatings.  This process emits no VOCs.  This is a fundamental experimental and theoretical investigation of this process including developing detailed profiles of the reaction temperature and the extent of reaction as well as the physical, mechanical and thermal characterization of the final films.    The principal investigator is presenting the results of this research at a \"Mr. Clean\" conference at Cocoa Beach, Florida on October 18-21, 1994.",
