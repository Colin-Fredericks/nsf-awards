Funding is  provided through the Divisions of Materials Research,  Mathematical Sciences and Advanced Scientific Computing, as  well as by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  The  research combines algorithm and code development with  materials theory to address important materials problems for  which computational breakthroughs can produce large payoffs.  As such, the research spans the strategic initiatives in  High Performance Computing and Communications and Advanced  Materials and Processing.    The halogen-bridged transition-metal linear-chain compounds  are unique in their wide chemical tunability with respect to  their ground state and their energy gap.  Momentum-space  computation has indicated that these materials may have  technological importance.  Real space computation will allow  much larger systems to be studied due to transitioning from  calculations scaling as the cube of the number of particles  being considered to those scaling linearly with the number  of particles.  The larger systems will enable more accurate  optical properties to be calculated and enable accurate  treatment of defects, including polarons and solitons, which  will allow realistic calculations of optical and magnetic  properties.  Computational aspects of the work include  development of specialized parallel sparse matrix  algorithms; use and development of load-balancing  heuristics; development of parallel disk-based algorithms  for fast Fourier transforms and other matrix operations;  and, use of shared data-space model such as provided by High  Performance Fortran.  Codes will be run on a variety of  platforms.  %%%  This award is one made through the FY95 Computational  Approaches to Real Materials competition.  Funding is  provided through the Divisions of Materials Research,  Mathematical Sciences and Advanced Scientific C omputing, as  well as by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  The  research combines algorithm and code development with  materials theory to address important materials problems for  which computational breakthroughs can produce large payoffs.  As such, the research spans the strategic initiatives in  High Performance Computing and Communications and Advanced  Materials and Processing.    The research will focus on a class of materials called  halogen-bridged compounds.  These compounds can be readily  modified by varying their structure and components in order  to achieve desired electronic, optical and magnetic  properties.  Thus, they are Odesigner materials.O  Present  computational techniques only hint at these possibilities.  The present research will develop computational techniques  in order to deal with much more realistic systems of these  compounds.  Consequently, successful completion of this  research will advance computation on state-of-the-art  computers, will assist in fundamental understanding of the  properties of these compounds and will enable the accurate  design of a class of materials for a variety of  applications.  ***",
