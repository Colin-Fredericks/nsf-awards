 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ferring    With National Science Foundation support Dr. C. Reid Ferring and  his colleagues will conduct geological and archaeological  research in the Diliska Gorge region of the Republic of Georgia.  Past work by this team has demonstrated the presence of lake and  river sediments which extend along the gorge over a distance of  ca. 15 km. Preliminary evidence indicates that these deposits  date to the early part of the Pleistocene and well preserved  remains have been discovered in them. Dr. Ferring and colleagues  will undertake a detailed geological survey of the area and  collect geological samples which will permit age determination.  They shall analyze faunal materials and search for archaeological  remains. If successful, this project will lay the groundwork for  a longer term collaborative Georgia-U.S. research endeavor.    Scientists know that the roots of the human lineage can be traced  back to Africa and that the earliest stages of human development  took place there. They are interested in how and when the first  hominids appear outside this region because of the insight this  information will provide into developing abilities to cope with  the environment. Recently early hominid remains were discovered  at the site of Dmanisi which is located in Georgia. Their age is  significantly greater that one would have expected and interest  in this region, which may lie on the original route out of  Africa, has increased. Dr. Ferring's search for early  archaeological sites and the stratigraphic and chronological  framework he will establish, will increase understanding of early  hominid prehistory and behavioral development. It will also  further collaboration between U.S. and Georgian scientists.",
