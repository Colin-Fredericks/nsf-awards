 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on enveloping algebras, differential  operators and quantum groups.  The principal investigator will  study primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra of a classical  Lie superalgebra.  He will also study links in multiparameter  quantum function algebras and the coradical filtration for the  corresponding enveloping algebras.  The goal is to understand the  structure of certain Hopf algebras arising in the theory of  quantum groups.  Finally, the principal investigator will study  the K-theory of differential operators of toric varieties.  This  research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring is an  algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication  defined on it.  Although the additive operation satisfies the  commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to  do so.  An example of a ring for which multiplication in not  commutative is the collection of nxn matrices over the integers.   The study of noncommutative rings has become an important part of  algebra because of its increasing significance to other branches  of mathematics and physics.",
