 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation has three major objectives: (1) to   add new  algorithms and methodologies to the repertoire of   geometry techniques, including new approximation methods and   algorithms that are simpler and easier to implement than   ones; (2) to formulate precise algorithmic versions of a   large body of  geometric problems from allied fields, in such a way that the   of computational geometry can be applied successfully and so   that the  community of largely theoretical computational geometers can   properly exposed to the more practical applications of the   (allied fields include cartography, computer vision,   design, graphics, manufacturing, etc); and (3) to disseminate  methodologies of computational geometry to applied   researchers who  work in allied fields but who have been largely unaware of   progress in  computational geometry, particularly since it has been   construed as a  primarily theoretical instrument.  The third objective is   through discussions of research directions with contacts in   research labs and through publishing papers for conferences   and in  journals whose readership includes a breadth of engineering   disciplines.",
