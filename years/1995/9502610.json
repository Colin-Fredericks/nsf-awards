 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502582  Murat Azizoglu    This proposal outlines a career development plan for the principal  investigator with a coherent integration of research and teaching   goals.  The research program addresses important issues in the  design of all-optical wide area networks.  The education plan  includes development of graduate-level courses on optical  communication systems and all-optical networking, integration of  communication networks into undergraduate curriculum and  development of a laboratory in which the students can  design, implement, and test prototype optical networks.    An all-optical network is a network in which the signals remain in  the optical domain from the source to the destination.  This  approach eliminates the speed mismatch between optical and  electronic devices by avoiding optical-to-electrical signal  conversion within the network.  When the electronic processing is  limited to the terminal nodes as prescribed, several challenging  problems arise which require new and innovative approaches. Among  these issues are traffic scheduling in circuit- and packet-switched  networks with Wavelength Division Multiple Access, all-optical  interconnection of all-optical LANs, dynamic vs. static  wavelength assignment in interconnecting bridges, and architectural  issues in interconnected networks. Solution to such problems must  take into account optical device limitations, such as laser tuning  delay and finite number of resolvable channels.",
