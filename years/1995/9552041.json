The Mechanical Engineering  Department of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez offers two  compulsory courses, a lecture course (INME 4055) of 3 h/w and a  laboratory course (INME 4056) of 3 h/w, to the senior undergraduate  programs of Mechanical Engineering as well as Industrial  Engineering Departments.    While the lecture course INME 4055 deals extensively with the  theories and analyses of metalforming processes, such as rolling,  extrusion, forging, drawing, high energy rate forming, etc., the  laboratory course INME 4056 offers no experiment on metalforming,  that is needed for complementing theory with laboratory practice.  The laboratory offers practice on machining, casting, welding and  metrology. A total void of laboratory in the area of metalforming,  therefore, produces an extreme imbalance of practical experience  between material removal processes (machining, grinding etc.) and  material forming processes (bulk deformation, sheet metal forming  etc.). This proposal, if and when accepted, will serve the propose  of filling the void between theory and practice in INME 4055 and  INME 4056.",
