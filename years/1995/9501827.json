 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Phillip Grandinetti   of Ohio State University will apply recently developed two dimensional   NMR techniques and Dynamic Angle Spinning to characterize structures in   silicate glasses.  Structural distributions in alkali and alkaline   network modified silicate glasses will also be studied to quantify   changes in angle distributions, non-bridging oxygen environments, and   silicate species distributions as functions of composition.  This   information will be used to refine potential functions used in molecular   dynamics simulation studies of the structure and dynamics of glasses.    The educational component of this program will focus on improving   faculty-student contact in the general chemistry course, using a database   to help instructors identify students with difficulties and implement   strategies for improvement, and developing new courses in NMR and Data   Acquisition and Analysis.  The design and preparation of glasses is made difficult by the lack of   sound theoretical models relating composition and structure to   properties.  Professor Grandinetti will use NMR techniques to provide   experimental structural data which can confirm the basis of theoretical   models and improve their predictive capabilities.  Such information will   also be of value in NMR studies of related systems such as ceramics,   catalysts, and biopolymers.",
