 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9511552  Wu    This award supports collaboration between Jiezie Wu, Jain-  Ming Wu, University of Tennessee Space Institute, George  Carnevale, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and Tong  Binggang, Yin Xieyuan, and Ma Huiyang, University of Science  and Technology, Hefei, China, on the mechanism, receptivity,  and control of compressible, heat-conducting vortices.  The  project proposes a thorough and detailed investigation of  the stability and mechanics of compressible vortices, and  concerns questions which are both of fundamental importance  and practical relevance.  The Chinese partners are from the  University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), a key  university affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  USTC received funding from the Chinese NSF for a \"key\"  project on the mechanisms of vortices, separation, and their  control in complex gaseous media.  This entitled USTC to a  large influx of funds (by Chinese standards) and provides a  valuable opportunity for US researchers to take advantage of  complementary research and instrumentation.  The structure,  instability, and breakdown of a vortex core have been  studied intensively over the past few decades because of the  relevance to almost all fluid systems with small viscosity  in nature and in technology.  The proposed work could  represent important progress in understanding more  compressible and heat conducting vortical flows, ranging  from geophysical vortices such as hurricanes and tornadoes,  to vortices in technology such as the vortex system around a  supersonic aircraft.  ***",
