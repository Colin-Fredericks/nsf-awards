 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andrews    Under the direction of Dr. E. Wyllys Andrews, Ms. Kathryn Sampeck  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological research in the Rio Ceniza Valley region in  Western El Salvador. The zone is virtually unknown  archaeologically, although its colonial economic importance  resulted in a great deal of documentation. Ms. Sampeck will  examine the late preconquest and early conquest history of the  region. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area was the  center of one of the most powerful regional states in  southeastern Mesoamerica. The power and prosperity of this  \"Izalco Pipil polity\" was likely due to its prominence in the  cacao trade, with cacao functioning as a kind of money in pre-  Hispanic economy. The Pippil were probably producing not only for  local use but for a broader market. With the incorporation of the  region into the Spanish empire, Izalco was propelled into the  global economy. The agricultural system was drastically altered  as local inhabitants shifted to the cultivation of indigo for a  world market. Ms. Sampeck wishes to examine the social changes  which accompanied this shift. To accomplish this she will conduct  an extensive survey of the region and collect surface material.  This will be followed by selected excavations. The ceramic,  lithic and other cultural materials collected will be analyzed to  allow reconstruction of social organization and changes which  occurred over time.     Small scale societies respond to both local and global pressures  and archaeologists have suggested several ways in which groups  may respond to such often conflicting demands. The Izalco region  provides an excellent situation within which to examine this  issue because archaeological and ethnographic data document the  transformation from a strictly local society and economy to one  which is rapidly enmeshed in a much broader world. The research  will provide data of interest to Middle Americanist  archaeologists and assist in the trainin g of a promising young  scientist.",
