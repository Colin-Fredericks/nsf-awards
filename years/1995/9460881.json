 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for faster, smaller, and more efficient electronic devices has grown considerably owing to the miniaturization of a variety of electronic components. Hence, computer chips and other microelectronic components are currently undergoing an explosive growth in the number of devices packed per unit area. As the packaging density (number of devices) of these microelectronic devices advances from very large scale integration (VLSI) to ultra-large scale integration (ULSI), the heat dissipated by these devices has also increased substantially. This has necessitated the research and development of low thermal expansion/high thermal conductivity composites for thermal management applications. In this Phase I effort, Materials Modification, Inc. will develop nanocrystalline tungsten-based (W-Cu) composites using a dual stage process followed by rapid consolidation. Phase I will focus on optimization of synthesis, consolidation, and characterization of the properties. Phase II will concentrate on optimization of process-structure-property parameters and the production and testing of prototypes (substrates) in both laboratory and field equipment in conjunction with two major manufacturers. Coordination has already been initiated with each of these manufacturers for this effort.",
