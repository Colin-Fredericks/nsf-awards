 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507375  Bohnert  This research focuses on the genes and proteins in plants  catalyzing an essential pathway in all organisms, the  biosynthesis of myo-inositol, MI.  The enzyme MI-IP synthase  converts glucose 6-phosphate to myo-inositol 1-phosphate and  a phosphatase produces MI.  The two products of the pathway  play a central and essential role in providing signalling  molecules, in membrane biogenesis and - in plants -  phosphate storage, the production of oligosaccharides,  vegetative carbohydrate storage, and the production of gums  and mucilages.       An extension of the pathway beyond MI is the inositol  methylation pathway which produces a number of mono- or di-  methylated inositols.  The methylated inositols may have a  function in osmotic adjustment with the methyl groups  provided follwing an increase in photorespiration under  stress conditions.  Methylated inositols are found in  species that tolerate high salinity or drought conditions.  Families with predominantly or exclusively glycophytic  species that are not drought tolerant seem to lack gense  that lead to an extension from MI to, for example, D-  pinitol.       To address this point, Drs. Bohnert and Jensen propose  a comparative molecular, biochemical and physiological  analysis of MI biosynthesis and the extension of the pathway  to D-pinitol.  First, the biochemical characteristics of the  pathway enzymes, flux and flux control for carbon  partitioning from glucose 6-phosphate will be anlyzed in the  glycophyte, rice, and in a halophyte, ice plant.       MI biosynthesis is localized to the cytosol and  chlorophlasts.  Thus, one analysis will be to gauge the  control of relative fluxes through either pathway, and,  also, on the stability or sensitivity of MI biosynthesis to  external factors in each pathway under stress conditions.       Additionally, there are questions about the genetics  and genes of the pathway.  What is the genetic makeup of the  pathway?  How many - different - gense are there for the  enzymes in  each pathway, and how is the pathway controlled  during development and in which tissues and cells?  Is there  a difference in control distinguishing the glycophyte and  the halophyte during stress-free growth and under stress?",
