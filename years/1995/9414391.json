 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414391  Turkevich  It is proposed to repeat the determination of the half-life of  238U for producing 238Pu, which has a half-life of 88 years.  The  decay rate of this heaviest available nucleus by a second-order  weak process (double beta decay) tests our understanding of the  nuclear structure of heavy nuclei and of the nature of the  antineutrinos that are thought to be involved.  The rate to be  confirmed is 12 orders of magnitude times slower than that of  alpha decay of 238U, discovered about 100 years ago, and is one  of the slowest spontaneous processes that has been measured.  A  radiochemical method will be used to isolate the 238Pu that has  accumulated in about 50 years in about 7kg of uranyl nitrate. The  amount of 238Pu will be determined by measuring the  characteristic alpha particles in special detectors with very low  backgrounds.  A parallel blank experiment using the same  chemicals will be carried out to make sure that no plutonium has  been introduced.  The results should have more statistical  significance and be more easily defended against criticisms of  the earlier work.  Recent theoretical predictions of the double  beta decay rate in 238U differ by two orders of magnitude, but  are expected to improve. Extensive and increasing world-wide  radioactive contamination by 238Pu is another important reason  for checking the experimental results now.  A sample of 1945  uranium salt is available for the experiment.***",
