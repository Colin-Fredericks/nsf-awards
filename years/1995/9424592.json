 "awd_abstract_narration": "Waltman       The investigator develops and analyzes a class of biological  models generally described as chemostat-like models.  While  ordinary differential equations techniques have been effective for  the basic models, effects such as diffusion and transport require  system of reaction diffusion equations.  The basic techniques are  those of monotone dynamical systems on infinite dimensional  spaces.  The effect of delays (for example the cell cycle) can also  be described in such a context.  General techniques for competitive  systems on products of ordered Banach spaces, developed in  previous work, seem to be applicable.  Plasmids are often used in  the manufacture of products by genetically altered organisms.  Because the plasmid can be lost in reproduction and because the  plasmid-free organism is often a better competitor, coding for  antibiotic resistance is often included on the plasmid and an  antibiotic used in the feed bottle.  The differential equation  models describing chemostats with inhibitors and plasmids are no  longer monotone.  The project undertakes the mathematical analysis  of such models.       The chemostat is a basic piece of laboratory apparatus that  models a bio-reactor.  The mathematical description of such models  takes the form of systems of ordinary differential equations.  If  the basic assumption of well mixing is removed from the model  (there is evidence that it is not satisfied in general) more  complicated equations result.  The project undertakes the analysis  of such model equations using the modern techniques of dynamical  systems.  The general view is to use the mathematics to point the  way to biological (or chemical engineering) experiments with the  hope of building better bio-reactors.",
