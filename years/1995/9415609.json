Miller of  Temple University and Jacky Cosson of the Marine Biology  Center, Villefranche Sur Mer, France.  The objective of  their research is the study of fertilization patterns and  behavior in marine invertebrates. They will perform a  detailed study of salps, which are found in abundance in  warm-temperate to tropical waters. Their existence in huge  swarms makes them important in the economy of the ocean.  The project addresses ways to improve the chances of  fertilization and will provide important information about  coordination of reproduction in salps and other zooplankton.    Dr. Miller brings to this collaboration extensive expertise  in marine biology.  He has wide experience in studies of  fertilization of marine invertebrates. This is complemented  by the French investigator's expertise in biophysics and  molecular biology and in flagellar behaviors of protozoa.  The project will advance understanding of fertilization  behavior in primitive invertebrates that can be used as a  model for future investigations of similar problems in  marine vertebrates.    ***",
