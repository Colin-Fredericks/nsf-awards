 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    ESI-9550040    This five year project will provide 45-days of physics content and  leadership training each year for 24 Texas physics teachers. One  cohort will begin in the first year and continue for three years  while the second cohort will begin in year three and continue for  the final two years. These 45-days include 2-week summer  institutes, a series of academic year(AY) follow-up workshops on  supplementary topics and a series of visits to their classrooms.  Leader teachers can earn 3-semester hour of graduate credit each  year. Those participating for the full three years will be enhanced  in all the typical areas of introductory physics. Following each  summer's workshops they will conduct second tier workshops for  colleagues in grades K-12 in their local district and surrounding  districts. These workshops will also provide their colleagues with  a minimum of 100 hours of teacher enhancement. In addition to  professors from Texas A&M University the strong network of Texas  physics teachers built around the Texas Physics Teacher Resource  Agents will have an instructional and networking role in the  project.",
