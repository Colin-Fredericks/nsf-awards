 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program is a new grant to Professor Harry Dorn of  Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The objectives are to prepare and characterize large fullerenes and  metallofullerenes. Through the use of various magnetically active nuclei and the technique of  Dynamic Nuclear Polarization, the principle investigator will characterize a novel group of large  fullerenes with endohedral and exohedral metals. These unique hydrocarbon systems are reported  to have relevance in applications such as nonlinear optics and high temperature  superconductivity.  Studies such as those funded in this grant will enhance the understanding of  nuclear-electron interactions in these interesting molecules which is germane to both of the above  mentioned scientific areas.      The investigation of novel materials which have reported properties of value to optical and  magnetic systems will serve the public sector very well. This proposal is such an investigation.  These types of complexes are reported to have promise in the areas of nonlinear optics and high  temperature superconductivity. A detailed plan to prepare and characterize these unique  complexes is well thought out and described by the principal investigator.",
