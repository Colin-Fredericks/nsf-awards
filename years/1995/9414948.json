 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millersville University, located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is one of the 14 state owned institutions of higher education that comprise the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.  The mission of the institution, inclusive of the sciences, is to provide excellent programs conforming to the higher standards of a traditional liberal arts education.  To emphasize its commitment to science, the University and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are providing the resources required to construct a new science building, the centerpiece of a science complex that includes the existing science facility, Roddy Hall.  Obsolete space vacated by the Chemistry Department in Roddy will be available for the Computer Science Department, currently residing in Wickersham Hall.  Relocating Computer Science to the 30 year old building, will allow all the science departments to be in close proximity physically, as well as establishing collaborative efforts between scientific disciplines.  It is for this purpose, that funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program have been awarded to Millersville University.  A former chemistry laboratory and support space will be renovated and remodeled to accommodate the needs of the research and research training program of the Computer Science Department . Space will be reconfigured by the removal of existing walls and equipment such as workbenches and fume hoods. The improved space will provide modern research facilities for faculty engaged in Robotics, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Scientific Visualization, and Real-Time Systems Engineering.  Scientific Visualization research will focus on high-performance 3D computer graphics for scientific modeling, vitural world modeling, and virtual reality simulations for research training and experimentation in the natural and physical sciences.  All science students will benefit from this project, giving them opportunities to engage in research and learn high performance computer visualization techniques at the undergraduate level.  With the improved facility there will be increased student involvement in collaborative, scientific investigations with faculty, generating quality senior research projects that may facilitate student interest in pursuing additional scholarly activities, as well as attracting prospective students and new research faculty.",
