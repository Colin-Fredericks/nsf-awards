 "awd_abstract_narration": "NCR-9501452  Goldsmith, Andrea      The broad goal of this research is to address fundamental issues in  the design, analysis, and implementation of wireless networks.   Issues treated will cross traditional boundaries between signal  processing, communications, and networking.  The work will first  develop a networking, architecture and protocol suite to support  the internetworking of wireless subnetworks.  A hierarchical  network infrastructure will be considered that exploits the  broadcast capability and power control of radio channels.  Optimum location of multimode gateways and hierarchical databases  to aid in mobility management and routing within this  infrastructure will be determined.  Optimization techniques for  efficient allocation of spectrum will be studied using techniques  from dynamic programming. Formal methods for obtaining and  analyzing channel policies will be developed and applied  to analysis and design issues.  Joint source/channel coding  techniques to minimize end to end distortion will be examined.   Emerging wireless applications will be considered and a global  networking infrastructure to support these applications will be  sought.  The education component will develop innovative and  dynamic course programs at the undergraduate and graduate level in  wireless communications, networks, and dynamic programming. These  activities will encourage industrial collaborations.",
