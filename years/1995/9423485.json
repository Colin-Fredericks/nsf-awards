Surface water exchange through the Arctic  Gateway at Fram Strait accounts for about 90% of the Arctic heat  budget and so this region may have played a major role in  glacial-interglacial Arctic climates during the Quaternary.  The  major objectives of this research include documenting the  Quaternary history of Arctic climates and investigating the role  of surface to intermediate water exchange through the Arctic  Gateway in late Quaternary glacial-interglacial Arctic climates.    Two sedimentary sequences on the Yermak Plateau, recently drilled  by Leg 151 of the Ocean Drilling Program, provide the first  opportunity for high-resolution studies of the Arctic Gateway  region.  This project will generate high-resolution isotopic and  faunal records based on planktonic and benthic foraminifera from  sites 910 and 911 forming a depth transect on the Yermak Plateau  (at 556 and 902 m water depth, respectively).  Planktonic  records, with about 4,000 year resolution, will be spliced  together from both sites to form a composite record of surface  water environments throughout the Brunhes Epoch (late Quaternary  to present).  Benthic records, with about 10,000 year resolution,  will also be compiled.  When combined, these records will allow  detailed comparison of surface waters to intermediate water  environments for areas with 550 and 900 m water depths.  These  data will allow detailed reconstruction of surface to  intermediate water hydrography during the Brunhes Epoch.   Extended records at site 911A will provide the first long-term,  high-resolution records of Arctic surface and intermediate water  environments throughout the Quaternary.    These hydrographic interpretations of the integrated isotopic and  faunal records will test hypotheses about the role of this  oceanic gateway in regional and global climatic change.  The  results will bear on the importance of meridional heat transport  by  Arctic Gateway surface currents during intervals of global  warmth and during important climatic transitions.  The intervals  of greatest interest include the mid-Quaternary climatic  transition from about 1.2-0.6 Ma, and glacial-interglacial cycles  of the Brunhes Epoch.  The records obtained will greatly improve  our understanding of the influence of the Arctic Gateway region  on the global climate system during the Quaternary.  In  particular, this work will examine the role of Arctic Gateway  paleoceanography in the Quaternary glacial evolution of the  Northern Hemisphere.  Lastly, it should provide insights into the  future response of Arctic climates to projected global warming.",
