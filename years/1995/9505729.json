The workshop is  being sponsored by NSF, NOAA Coastal Ocean Program, and EPA  Office of Research and Development.  The workshop's goal is to  identify mechanisms by which marine laboratories can best address  national needs in coastal monitoring and research.  The potential  role(s) of marine laboratories will be discussed in light of  several areas of interest: 1) multidisciplinary research that  transcends scales of biological organization from molecules to  organisms and ecosystems; 2) multidisciplinary research that  transcends the traditional boundaries of ecosystems constituting  the land-sea interface from drainage basin to coastal ocean; 3)  cost-effective monitoring networks that will not only document  environmental variability and detect trends but will also provide  a framework for hypothesis testing to reveal causes and  consequences of such trends; 4) information flow and liaison  between the research community, federal and state agencies, and  the public; and 5) regional distributed data and information  management systems for scientific analysis and the formulation of  integrated strategies for coastal zone management. The workshop  is to organized under the auspices of the National Association of  Marine Laboratories (NAML).",
