 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Collections project will address the difficult job of assisting and facilitating the salvage and preservation of a valuable Russian collection of natural sounds.  These irreplaceable recordings currently exist on archaic and rapidly degrading media and reside in a physical facility that dose little to augment their state of preservation and availability for use by other scientists.  The project is a first-class collaboration between the Library of Natural Sounds (LNS) at Cornell University and Russian Phonoteka of Animal Voices, (PAV).  Original recordings will be transcribed to more modern media with duplicate recordings being made and housed at different sites. Through the LNS, availability to other user scientists will be greatly enhanced and the latest technologies for natural sound preservation will be employed.  Collections such as these will continue to increase in both basic and applied value as reference materials for basic research in animal vocalization and communication, as sources for identifying species for environmental assessments, and as contributors  to the increasing array of commercial products that utilize natural sounds in their production.",
