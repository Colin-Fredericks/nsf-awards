 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423694  Davis   This research explores the feasibility and the effectiveness of using parallel algorithms for solving production scheduling and other related problems is a distributed control manufacturing environment.  Under a parallel, distributed control architecture, a problem is partitioned and solved simultaneously by several processors, with each processor contributing only a portion of the total time to the total solution time.  A mixed integer programming formulation of the job shop scheduling program is used as the general model structure for the research.  The model is then transformed through parameter adjustments into other scheduling scenarios (e.g., flow shop problem).  The emphasis is on permutation schedules.  A set of permutation schedules is formulated using an n-ary structure.  The branching variable in the n-ary tree is the position of each job in the sequence.  This structure is common to many branch and bound solutions for sequencing and scheduling problems.  Using a depth first search rule through the n-ary tree, all job sequences are implicitly evaluated to solve the problem.  Several sample problems will be solved.  Using the results from the sample problems, the behavior of parallel algorithms in a distributed control architecture will be characterized in terms of  algorithmic solution time, communication overhead due to data exchanges between processors, and other algorithmic overheads due to start up, search, and wind down.   As earlier research has established, scheduling problems of practical sizes are very computationally intensive and when left to a single processor, can take an extremely large amount of time to solve, especially if exact solution approaches are employed.  Parallel programming offers some promise in reducing the computational load on a processor to solve a problem.  Therefore, any insights gained in solving this class of problem will offer some economic benefits to several sectors of the economy given that scheduling problems are encountered in  several areas of life.  In addition, there are several other classes of problems that behave alike and are similar to scheduling and sequencing problems.  These classes of problems stand to gain if  progress is made in solving scheduling problems.",
