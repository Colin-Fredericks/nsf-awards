 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to support the early career development  of the Principal Investigator in her position as a new faculty  member in the School of Physics and Astronomy of the University of  Minnesota.  This position requires both excellence in scientific  research, excellence in teaching, course development, and community  outreach activities.  The research component of the proposal is  focused on the kinetic physics of the Earth's magnetotail,  including data analysis, numerical studies, and both inputs to and  comparisons with various theoretical models of the magnetosphere.   Previous studies of electric field data in the magnetotail have  shown that the variable part of the field is usually one to two  orders of magnitude larger than the background field.  These  variable fields, including waves and large amplitude spikes, will  have a large effect on particle distributions as has been shown in  preliminary numerical studies.  It is proposed to characterize  statistically the parameters of the waves and spikes using data  from the ISEE-1 and Geotail spacecraft.  The results will be used  to provide empirical dissipation coefficients for use in MHD  simulations and global models and to develop a more realistic  electric field model for inclusion in the numerical study of  particle trajectories in the magnetotail.  The particle  distributions will then be compared to those observed on the  AMPTE/IRM spacecraft (as well as other plasma data).  As part of  this comparison, the nature of the complex distributions observed  at the plasma sheet boundary will be examined including effects  such as acceleration of electron beams in slow mode shocks and the  mapped location of the auroral zone/polar cap convection boundary.     The educational component will be focused primarily in two areas,  both of which have very high priority for the School of Physics and  Astronomy.  The first is improvement in the lower division physics  with calculus class which is the main introductory physics clas s  for engineers, physicists, and chemists with approximately 1200  students per quarter.  Modification of this course and TA training  for the course are an ongoing effort.  The second is inclusion of  undergraduates in research which has been a longstanding priority  for the PI.  In addition, there are many ongoing projects including  local efforts to improve K-12 science teaching, development of new  undergraduate courses, and outreach activities to share the  excitement of physics research with the community in which the PI  will participate, particularly in the later years of the proposal.",
