 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355668  Brittain    This is a three-year project to work comprehensively with 72  elementary schools over the next three years -- providing each with  one year of intensive site-based training focused on Using the  Outdoors to Teach Experiential Science (UTOTES).  Over the three  rears, approximately 1000 teachers will have been reached.  Each  school will select 16-24 teachers to participate in six site-based  training sessions -- with the principal and one or more community  resource persons also participating.  During these sessions, the  following will be the main emphasis:    (1)  Teachers learn how the natural world can be used to motivate  and teach children and how to use school grounds to develop  curriculum and support the teaching of hands-on life, and physical  science.    (2)  Teachers learn how to use the interdisciplinary nature of  science to assist teaching in other subject areas, and    (3)  The principal/community leaders learn the value of school site  improvements -- through projects such as butterfly gardens,  miniponds, and bird feeding/observation stations.    Comprehensive team-building forms a local \"critical mass\" of effort  for \"hands-on\" teaching, with UTOTES giving teachers the confidence  and know-how to take students outdoors and to also bring nature  into the classroom for a myriad of instructional purposes.    The project requested $718,793 from NSF with institutions/agencies  and school districts providing 107% of the National Science  Foundation in cost sharing.",
