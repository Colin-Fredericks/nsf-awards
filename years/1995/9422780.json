The  research models CMEs as large-scale (e.g. national or  global) networked hypermedia environments, of which the  Internet is the first and current global implementation.  The central thesis is that a CME is fundamentally different,  in nature, scope, and characteristics from other media.  Traditional media include both mass media (e.g. television,  radio, newspaper, magazines and direct mail), as well as  personal communications (e.g., word-of-mouth).  Numerous  characteristics differentiate CMSs from traditional media.  This research will investigate both decision-making  characteristics which affect consumer behavior in a computer-  mediated environment, and media characteristics which are  intrinsic to this environment and have implications for  marketing and communications strategy.  The goals of this  planning stage are: 1) a comprehensive literature review  encompassing all disciplines relevant to CMEs, including  marketing, behavioral decision theory, consumer behavior,  advertising, communication, psychology, computer-mediated  communication, and computer science; 2) a proposed  integrated theoretical framework for marketing in a computer-  mediated environment; and 3) a consequent set of testable  propositions that flow from the framework which will form  the foundation for a longer term research program on CMEs  and marketing theory.",
