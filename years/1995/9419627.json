 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this application is to replace inoperative equipment  and to upgrade obsolescent equipment of the shared instrumentation  facility of the department. Each of the investigators on this  application is involved in the preparation of pure proteins and nucleic  acids and the study of their properties, structure, and function. These  purifications require both low and high speed centrifugations. Most  also involve the separation of complex mixtures of biomolecules into  pure constituents. Recent technological innovations have made such  separations much faster and simpler. To this end, we are requesting a  perfusion chromatography apparatus with suitable detectors. Many of the  activity measurements and most of the sequencing reactions involve  radioactive assays. To this end, we are requesting a scintillation  counter.    All instruments will be used on a shared basis. Experience shows this  to be the most cost-effective way to use modern instrumentation.  Individual users will contribute to the maintenance contracts of these  instruments once the warranties expire. The sharing of maintenance  contracts is also the most cost-effective way of using the equipment.",
