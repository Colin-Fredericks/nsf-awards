 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need to design, assemble, and manipulate synthetic models  of  the  physical  world is common to many task domains  in  science,  engineering, education, and medicine. In robotics, attention  has  focused  recently on modular robots and modular  robot  tasks.  A  modular robot is one which is assembled from a predefined set  of  parts.  Typically, the set of parts is a small set; however,  the  space  of  robots that can be built from the parts set is  large.  This  research  focuses on creating powerful interactive  virtual  environments  that  will  enable  users  to  modify,  study,  and  experiment  and  interact with modular robots and  modular  robot  tasks.   This  research  explores  the  creation  of  a  software  environment  in  which one can take things apart  and  reassemble  them  (perhaps  incorrectly!); design, build and experiment  with  simulated physical mechanisms and objects; and in general explore  and  manipulate  the environment without being  limited  to  some  small  set of anticipated actions. A fundamental requirement  for  such  an  environment is that it possess physical solidity  -that  is,  objects  in the environment must be treated as  impenetrable  objects. Modeling physical solidity in simulated environments  is  extremely  difficult and as yet has only been  dealt  with  on  a  special-case basis. The research work in this project centers  on  constructing  and demonstrating virtual environments  that  model  contact,  collision and friction in a general manner.  Topics  of  concern  are  fast  compute-times, an  extremely  high  level  of  reliability, and the ability to handle a diversity of models  and  environments.",
