More specifically, this study is conducted in   the domain of words for colors. Words for colors have been and   remain a key domain in which to study the relation between   perception and language because colors themselves are objectively   describable independent of the words used to name them in any   particular language.     For a study of this kind to be interpretable in general terms it   is essential that data be gathered, not only from familiar   languages of developed regions of Europe, America and Asia, but   also from unwritten languages spoken by peoples at relatively   simple technological levels in all parts of the world. Otherwise   the findings may merely reflect aspects of technologically   advanced societies, rather than revealing properties of homo   sapiens. For this reason a survey of 111 unwritten languages,   distributed world-wide, was conducted in a prior phase of this   study.     The meanings of the principal words for colors in each of these   languages are established by obtaining from twenty-five (or   occasionally fewer) speakers of each participating language that   speaker's word for each of 320 colored stimuli, chosen to give a   representative sample of all the colors visible to humans.     Analysis of the stage of basic color term evolution of each   language will be assessed. A set of detailed hypotheses regarding   how the two original basic color terms, (white or red or yellow)   and (black or green or blue), are eventually divided into the   separate fundamental categories: black, white, red, yellow,   green, blue will be investigated with regard to the full set of   data on 111 languages. Separate hypotheses regarding derived   categories such as purple, orange and brown and heterogeneous   categories, such as 'desaturated'/'muddy-colored', will also be   tested against the full data set. Ca tegories comprising both   yellow and green are known to exist. They pose special problems   for the psychophysical derivation of the evolutionary sequence of   basic color terms; this problem will also be addressed. Special   attention will be paid to color categories that appear in the   data which are not related in a simple way to the   psychophysically established basic color sensations. Special   attention will also be paid to inter-speaker variation in each   language set and its relation to the evolutionary status of the   language community taken as a whole.",
