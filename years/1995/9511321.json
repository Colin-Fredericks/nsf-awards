 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is supported by the Joint NSF/Private Sector  Initiative and focuses on the following two closely related  questions:  Do individuals make reasonable financial  decisions for savings and retirement?  How do various forms  of financial education affect financial behavior?  The  cooperating organization is the Smith Richardson Foundation.  Numerous previous authors have documented the poor quality  of personal financial decisions, and several studies have,  in particular, found that Americans save too little for  retirement.  The adequacy of saving for retirement among  younger Americans has, however, proven controversial, in  large part beaause pertinent economic developments over the  next 30 to 40 years are highly uncertain, and may profoundly  affect retirement prospects.  Previous research has also  shed considerable light on the general public's level of  economic and financial literacy.  However, few determinants  of economic literacy have been studies (aside from formal  education among high school students).  The determinants of  financial knowledge among adults are essentially unexplored,  and virtually nothing is known about the effects of  knowledge on financial behavior.  Finally, the existing  literature has not systematically considered the effects of  financial education on financial decisions; nor has it  evaluated the various mechanisms (knowledge, comfort, or  habituation) through which financial education may affect  behavior.  Thus, a central objective of this research is to  examine financial education as an important dimension of  human capital accumulation.  The study will focus on the  analysis of three extremely promising and previously  unexploited data sources.  The first is a series of  household survey sponsored by Merrill Lynch; the second is a  series of unique employer surveys undertaken by KPMG Peat  Marwick; and the third is an extensive 401(k) database  compiled by Hewitt Associates.  The research is of direct  relevance to private firms interested  in using education to  alter the behavior of participants in contributory  retirement plans.  Indeed, it bears on the continued  viability of 401(k) plans, and the relative merits of  defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  In  addition, the research has potentially important  implications for national economic policy, including  strategies for promoting national saving, the design and  implementation of education curricula, pension policy,  information policy, and securities regulation.",
