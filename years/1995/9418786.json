 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418786  Dymond  This project will analyze an existing suite of both sediment trap  and ocean bottom samples from the Ross Sea for barium and other  refractory elements (aluminum, sodium, vanadium, iron, thorium, and  tin), and evaluate barium as a proxy for biological productivity  and carbon export to the seafloor of the Ross Sea.    These analyses bear directly on the question of how much and how  quickly anthropogenic carbon dioxide is distributed among the  various global carbon reservoirs.  If the \"new\" atmospheric carbon  is sequestered in non-atmospheric reservoirs within a relatively  brief period, then the expected global warming will be reduced;   however it is also possible that any global warming enhances the  flux of carbon (and other greenhouse gases) from non-atmospheric  reservoirs to the atmosphere, enhancing the expected global  warming.  While little is currently known about the planetary  response, it is thought that oceanic processes, particularly  changes in ocean fertility and interactions between ocean fertility  and circulation, are defining factors in these questions.    Time changes in the oceanic carbon reservoir are related to ocean  productivity, and must be inferred from proxy observations.  The  disadvantage of the most widely used proxies -- organic carbon,  calcium carbonate, and opal (silicon dioxide) -- is that they  cannot distinguish between variable preservation rates and variable  productivity rates.  This project will link these proxies with the  flux of barium through the water column and in the sediment, and  constrain the extent of barium recycling with the refractory  element data.  This analysis will additionally help define the  strength and source of lateral carbon input to the Ross Sea.   Results from this study will be integrated with other continuing  studies to produce a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling  in the Ross Sea and in the Southern Ocean in general.  ***",
