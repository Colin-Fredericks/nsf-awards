Stations were  clustered in the high damage zones as well as along two linear  arrays that extended through the station clusters into the  aftershock zone.  One objective was to investigate whether the weak  ground motion from the aftershocks could be used to understand the  damage from the strong ground motion of the main shock, the  question of strong-motion linearity.  Over 300 aftershocks were  recorded.  Preliminary analysis reveals that badly damaged areas do  indeed see large aftershock amplitudes relative to those of  undamaged areas with some exceptions.  This work seeks to analyze  systematically the propagation from the hypocentral zone to the  stations of the array to explain how propagation and site effects  contribute to the damaging ground motion.  Strong aftershock  shaking will be compared with detailed maps of red-tagged zones  provided by the LA City Council.  This project is a contribution to  the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported  by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation.  ***",
