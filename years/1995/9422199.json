 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates on the study of communication  complexity, an important aspect of distributed computing,  using a continuous  model of H. Abelson.    It focuses on the development of a general method  for  establishing lower bound results on communication complexity  as well as to  obtain lower bounds for some important  concrete problems.  For that purpose, a  study is conducted  to understand the geometric structure of continuous  distributed computations and to seek a mathematical  characterization of  communication complexity.  Relations of  the mathematical structure of the  computational problem to  its complexity are explored.  Connections between the  characterization of communication complexity and the  classical Pfaff's problem  and between the design of  distributed algorithms and Hilbert's 13th problem  will also  be investigated.  Several conjectures about lower bounds are  tested  with the hope that a proof or disproof will result.  The tools and techniques  used in this study come mainly from  several branches of continuous mathematics  such as analysis,  differential geometry, and topology.    To aid the  computation of lower bounds on communication  complexity, a Mathematica symbolic  computing software  package is expanded and refined.  This package is important  for performing experiments in order to formulate and help  prove conjectures  about the lower bounds for various  problems.    An important part of this  project is the summer research  experience for undergraduate students under the  NSF Research  Undergraduate Institutions Program, who are directly  involved in  various aspects of this research.",
