Males  of  these  treefrogs produce a small set  of  stereotyped,  unlearned  signals,  and  females  base  their  choice  of  mates  entirely  on  these  signals.  The use  of  synthetic,  computer-  generated sounds in playback experiments will be used to identify  the  exact  acoustic  criteria extracted from  these  signals  by  females  from different populations throughout the range  of  the  complex.  A  major  selective factor that may  shape  differences  between  populations is the complexity of the acoustic community,  and  female selectivity will thus be compared between populations  where  two,  genetically incompatible members of the complex  co-  exist  with  populations in which only a single  species  occurs.  Further  experiments  will  explore  the  effects  of  increasing  acoustic  complexity  (background noise and number  of  competing  signalers)  on intrapopulational mate choice. Finally,  the  gray  treefrog  complex consists of three lineages of tetraploids  that  have  acoustic signals with similar acoustic structures.  Because  these  lineages are thought to have arisen independently  and  in  one  generation by autopolyploidy (doubling of chromosome numbers  caused by environment factors), the question of how they achieved  behavioral  isolation  from their diploid ancestors  arises.  The  hypothesis  that  the  changes  in  cell  size  and  number  that  accompanies autopolyploidy have behaviorally important effects on  call structure, female-choice criteria, or both will be tested by  creating  artificial  polyploids from the  cold-shocked  eggs  of  diploid individuals.",
