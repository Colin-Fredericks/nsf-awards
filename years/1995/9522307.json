 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522307  Federoff, Howard    The study of the structure and function of the central nervous  system is frequently best elucidated by overproduction or  underproduction of the neurochemicals involved in normal neural  function.  However, at present, there are no molecular mechanisms  to control the expression of the genes encoding these chemicals at  different sites within the brain or at different times during or  after development of the brain.  Conventional approaches to over-  or underexpress these genes have significant limitations, the worst  outcome is the loss of function mutation causing embryonic  lethality.  The present proposal outlines an innovative mechanism  to specifically over- or under expression genes in the central  nervous system at specific times and in specific places.  These  studies will employ the cre-loxP system to generate genetic  mosaics.  cre is an enzyme recognizing specific DNA sequences  (loxP) and initiating recombination at these sites.  Specific  transgenes are designed incorporating loxP sites in their structure  in advance of a DNA expression cassette. After incorporation into  the genome organisms are exposed to genetically engineered herpes  simplex viruses containing the cre gene.  Upon infection cre is  expressed, inititing recombination at available loxP sites and  over- or underexpression of the targeted DNA cassette.  This  proposal is appropriate for a SGER award because the studies are  innovative and highly risky.  These studies, if successful, give  this investigator the potential to control the expression of genes  in virtually any tissue at any time and could lead to major  advances in our understanding of basic brain mechanisms, having  direct implications for health and disease.",
