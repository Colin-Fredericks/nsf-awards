 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506192  Marks    Very little is known about the mechanisms that control cell fate in  plants. The development of hairs (called trichomes) on the leaves  of Arabidopsis thaliana plants is being used as a model to study  cell fate in plants. Two genes that are required for the commitment  of leaf epidermal cells to enter the trichome developmental pathway  are TTG and GL1. Mutations in these genes results in a loss of  trichome initiation. Both of these genes are thought to function as  transcription factors that regulate other genes required for  trichome morphogenesis. This proposal will further the study of the  role of GL1 in trichome development and also extend the  characterization to the TTG gene. The proposed experiments will  provide information on how GL1 and TTG are regulated and will  identify genes that are regulated by GL1 and TTG. The expected  significance of this work is tow fold. first, it provides a  convenient system to study cell fate in plants. Second, trichome  developments provides a practical model. Trichomes on many plant  species serve as a barrier between the plant and a hostile  environment. many crop plants such as Canola lack protective  trichomes. The ability to manipulate  the morphology, density and  placement of trichomes on Arabidopsis plants is rapidly evolving.  It is hoped that the information learned about Arabidopsis can be  applied to Brassica species and other crop plants.  ***",
