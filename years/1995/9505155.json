 "awd_abstract_narration": "Todd       The investigator and his colleagues undertake broad studies  of optimization algorithms and the mathematical theory underlying  them.  The project covers continuous and discrete optimization  algorithms, both exact and approximate, their computational  complexity, practical large-scale implementation, performance  guarantees (in the case of approximate algorithms), and  applications in the physical sciences such as elementary particle  tracking, as well as more conventional applications in  manufacturing and logistics.  Particular projects include:     - a continuation of large-scale computational testing of       implementations of minimum-cost network flow algorithms;     - development and testing of algorithms for large-scale       nonlinear minimization problems with bound constraints;     - performance guarantees for efficient approximation       algorithms for machine-scheduling problems with budget       constraints and for other combinatorial optimization problems;     - development of more efficient interior-point methods for       convex programming and for linear programming problems       where no initial interior feasible solution is known;     - studies of the polyhedral structure of combinatorial       problems in graph theory and partially ordered sets, as well       as in applications such as crew scheduling -- computational       implementation and testing have been an integral aspect of       these studies; and     - further development of complexity theory for continuous       nonconvex problems.  These projects range from modeling through algorithm development  and analysis to implementation and testing.       Optimization addresses questions like:     - How do you schedule the production of hundreds of items with       varying demands over several months to minimize setup and       holding costs, subject to resource limitations and       capacities?     - How do you determine the geometric conformation of a protein        (how it ``folds\") given an approximate en ergy functional for       any position?  Indeed, complex systems arising in the engineering, physical, and  biological sciences, and in the manufacturing and service  industries, involving hundreds to millions of interacting  variables, frequently lead to optimization problems when one  wishes to control or predict their behavior.  The investigators  study a number of specific projects related to modeling and  algorithm development for a variety of applications, ranging from  traditional settings like resource allocation, planning,  logistics, and distribution problems to new application areas  such as airline crew-scheduling, elementary particle tracking,  and shop scheduling.  A common thread is the search for efficient  methods to solve exactly large-scale instances of such problems,  or, if that is not likely to be possible, for efficient  algorithms that are guaranteed to obtain a solution that is close  to optimal in a precise sense.  The investigators also test these  algorithms computationally on representative instances of such  problems using serial and parallel computers.",
