 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410700  McLaughlin       This project is concerned the problem of determining  which properties of an elastic membrane can be deduced from  knowledge of the natural frequencies and the nodal lines of  the membrane.  The nodal lines are places on the membrane  where there is no excitation when the membrane is excited at  a natural frequency.  There are two major  parts to the  project.  The first is to obtain perturbation results for  the natural frequencies and mode shapes.  Since the  frequencies are not well spaced in higher dimensional  problems, small divisor problems must be solved. The second  major part of the project is related to the fact that nodal  domains (connected domains in the membrane defined by the  nodal lines) can be long, thin strips whose diameter is as  large as the diameter of the membrane.  What is required  then is to define approximate nodal domains whose diameter  goes to zero as the order of the eigenvalue goes to  infinity.       The goal of this research is to establish methods for  finding properties of vibrating systems from indirect  measurements, in particular, measurements of natural  frequencies and nodal lines.  The natural frequencies can be  determined by spectral analysis of impulse response data.  The nodal lines can be measured by directing a laser at the  vibrating surface when the membrane is excited at a natural  frequency.  The lines where the Doppler shift in the  backscatter is minimized are the nodal lines. From this data  the amplitudes of external forces on the membrane and an  expression for a (nonconstant) density of the membrane may  be determined from explicit formulas for these quantities.  These formulas are expected to be very useful for obtaining  efficient numerical algorithms to identify the quantities in  question.  ***",
