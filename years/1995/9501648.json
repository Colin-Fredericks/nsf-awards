 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501646  Gedra  The objectives of the research are to include the effects of  various typed of system security into power system pricing.   Another objective of the research is to evaluate a particular  transmission pricing methodology which has been proposed  recently.  These are very important issues in the wake of the  1992 National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) which, among other things,  deregulates generation and requires open access to the  transmission.  The utility industry will become increasingly  competitive as a result of the Act, and systems are expected to  be increasingly stressed.  Some fear that, in a competitive  environment, system security will be neglected.  It is important  to include security in the pricing of electricity to encourage  security resources to be availa`le at the right location when  they are needed to encourage users to facilitate rather than  hinder system security.  At the same time, proper security  pricing will help to prevent unneeded or inefficient expenditures  to increase security, thus jeopardizing a utility's competitive  position.  Proper transmission pricing is also essential to the  efficient functioning of the newly competitive market in  generation.    ***",
