 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423522  Ricklefs  The environment of the high arctic imposes two critical limits to   the existence of many forms of life.  One includes the extreme  physical conditions of the environment:  cold temperatures, high  wind velocities, and low precipitation.  The other is the  briefness of the growing season.  This environment is especially  stringent for sandpipers (Scolopacidae), which occupy their arctic  breeding grounds for as little as two months, and whose chicks are  among the smallest of warm-blooded animals.  This research project  will utilize detailed measurements of the growth and development,  energetics, thermal environment, food supply, and parental care of  scolopacid chicks to discover how these birds exploit the arctic  environment so successfully.  Cold temperatures require a high  capacity for generating metabolic heat; short breeding seasons  require rapid growth. Therefore, the combined stresses of low  temperature and short season would seem to push small homeotherms   to the limit in the high arctic.  The problem of resolving  compromises between the conflicting functions of growth rate and  heat generation is an excellent model for understanding how the  design of the organism relates to its environmental setting. Field  and laboratory measurements will be used to determine the forms of  relationships and quantify the coefficients in a mathematical  model of the scolopacid chick.  The essential elements of the  model encompass the internal organization of the chick and the  relationship of the chick to its environment. The model changes  continuously as the chick grows, and growth is simulated by  expressions relating growth rate to functional capacity of tissues  and functional capacity to the proportion of adult size achieved.   Laboratory and field work will provide data to evaluate the  scolopacid chick model.  Laboratory investigation will focus on  components of energy budgets, capacity of chicks to generate heat   in response to cold stress, loss of heat from the b ody, including   that caused by evaporation from the respiratory surfaces, and  tolerance of body cooling. Observations of free-ranging chicks in   natural family groups, using radio-tagged individuals where  practical, will help to validate the results from penned birds.   Conditions of the thermal environment and the availability of food  items will be monitored continuously to provide data on the range   and temporal variability of these factors.",
