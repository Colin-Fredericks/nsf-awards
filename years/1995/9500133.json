 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500133  Szeri   Grinding is used on a significant percentage of precision products made in the US, and is the preferred machining technique for ceramics and composites.  High temperatures on the surface of the grits and the materials being ground can lead to thermal damage or dimensional changes in precision components, premature wear of abrasives.  This project's goal is to predict the temperature field that a workpiece surface experiences when it is ground with a coolant emulsion.  The technical approach is to model the flow and heat transfer that occurs at the grinding interface between the abrasive wheel and workpiece by treating oil-in-water coolants as a homogeneous mixture.  Because this is a difficult modeling problem, a experimental program to verify the model predictions using an existing experimental rig.  The research will be a collaborative effort involving the University of Delaware, the University of Pittsburgh, NIST, Eaton Corp.'s Research Center and Norton Co.   The application and impact of these results are: prevention of thermal damage that can lead to premature failure of precision parts, higher productivity due to better control of the wear of expensive abrasives, and shorter lead times in setting up new abrasive processes.  An analytical model may also be a way of assessing if it is possible to eliminate a fluid, thereby eliminating the environmental cost of disposal.  ***",
