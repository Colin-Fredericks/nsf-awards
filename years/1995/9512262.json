 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater is committed to enhancing the  research experiences of undergraduates. During the past two years this  commitment has been reflected in substantial expenditures to improve  the science research laboratory facilities. This proposal requests  $97,932 in funding to obtain new research instrumentation for the  University's Biotechnology/Molecular Physiology and Biochemistry  Laboratory. A matching fund has also been pledged by the University.  The growth chambers, centrifuges and the protein purification and  measurement systems detailed in the proposal are currently being used  in every modern biotechnology laboratory in the United States. The  equipment that would be purchased will significantly strengthen  faculty research and instruction in biotechnology and protein  biochemistry analysis.    This equipment will also provide our students with hands-on  experience with state-of-art technology in scientific analysis and  research. The experience and education made possible by this  modern research instrumentation will significantly enhance the  productivity of teachers and scientists educated at the University.  Acquiring this equipment is the next logical step in the continuing  development of research facilities in the Departments of Biology  and Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.",
