This processing extension will  permit regrowth of modulation-doping, contacting and  isolating layers on patterned heterostructures prepared with  in-situ etched and clearned regrowth surfaces.  The  processing extension will have the following capabilities:  low-damage electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma  reactive ion etching of III-V semiconductors; ECR hydrogen  plasma cleaning of etched substrates; surface cleanliness  monitoring by Auger spectroscopy; and in-vacuum transfer of  patterned substrates into the MBE growth chamber.  The  properties of strained and unstrained uniform quantum wires  fabricated by etching through quantum wells and regrowth  with modulation-doping layers on the sidewalls will be  studied.  A heavily-doped gate electrode layer in the  regrowth sequence will permit carrier density modulation in  these wires independent of the confining potentials  determined by the original heterostructure.  Analogously, by  pregrowing the appropriate barrier potentials, gated 2-  dimensional tunneling structures and superlattices in III-V  heterostructures will be fabricated and their transport and  optical properties will be investigated down to the quantum  dot limit.    %  This equipment will be used by a group of investigators  having complimentary expertise ranging from semiconductor  epitaxial growth to nanofabrication and from transport and  optical characterization to device physics and engineering.  It represents fundamental materials research important for  understanding processing of semiconductor materials, and is  ultimately relevant for manufacturing.",
