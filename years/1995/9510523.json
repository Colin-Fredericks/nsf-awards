 "awd_abstract_narration": "Speth    Under the direction of Dr. John Speth, Mr. Renato Kipnis will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological excavation at two sites - Grande Abrigo de Santana  do Riacho and Lapa do Boquete - both located in eastern Central  Brazil. Primr excavations at both indicate that they have  excellent organic preservation, including rich botanical and  animal remains, perishable wooden and reed artifacts and human  burials. They have several occupation levels that span most of  the last 12,000 years. Through his excavation, Mr Kipnis will  increase the samples of floral and faunal remains as well as  cultural artifacts such as ceramics and stone tools. Excavation  will be specifically aimed at recovering controlled samples which  will permit quantitative analysis and intra- and inter-site  comparison. Sediment column samples will be collected for pollen  analysis. On this basis it will be possible to reconstruct  detailed changes in environment and document human response to  these.    The goal of this research is to investigate how human societies  at a simple level of cultural and technological organization  adapt to severe environmental change. Over the last 12,000 years  such variation has occurred in Central Brazil and these two  archaeological sites with excellently preserved remains offer Mr.  Kipnis to address this question. Archaeologists have posited  different adaptational strategies. One involves resource  diversification and intensification where the focus is on change  in local use of the environment. Another is primarily social and  involves the establishment of networks among groups and the  increased movement of goods and individuals. The work which Mr.  Kipnis will conduct should help to determine which of these  alternatives is most likely.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on how societies interact with their environment and assist in  the training  of a promising young scientist.",
