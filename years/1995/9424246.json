The University of Maryland, Department of Astronomy, is hosting  the annual meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP)  from June 24-28, 1995.  As part of this meeting, the Department of  Astronomy has sole responsibility for organizing a Science  Symposium.  The title of the symposium is \"Clusters, Lensing, and  the Future of the Universe\".  It  will be held at the College Park,  Maryland campus of the University of Maryland from June 26 to 28 ,  1995.  It is anticipated that approximately 150 professional  astronomers will attend and participate in the symposium.  A  smaller and unknown number of amateur astronomers are also likely  to attend.    The primary purpose of this symposium is to bring together  people working on three of the major unsolved problems of modern  astrophysics, in the expectation that the problems (and their  hoped-for solutions) have aspects in common.  Roughly, the  questions can be phrased as (a) How should we describe the  largest-scale structures in the universe? (b) How did the  structures form without producing stronger imprints in the cosmic  microwave background radiation? and (c) Which values of the  standard cosmological parameters and of the inflationary universe  model parameters best describe the universe during the epoch of  galaxy formation, the present time, and the long range future?  The  intended format of the symposium includes about 20 reviews by  invited speakers, each accompanied by a couple of shorter  contributed talks; and a number of poster paper contributions on  related topics.",
