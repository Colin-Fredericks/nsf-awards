 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411829  Shapiro, Lynda P.  This project, conducted by the Oregon Institute of Marine  Biology, will provide for institutional planning activities.  The facility has undergone a recent expansion, resulting in  a doubling of resident faculty, an even greater increase in  support staff, and a four-fold increase in active research  programs.  The expansion has also resulted in augmentation  of graduate program, and increased use of laboratory  facilities by visitors.  The increase in active, funded  research programs has carried with it an increase need for  reliability in support of these programs.    Specifically, the project will aim to develop a logical Long-  Range Planning Document that will allow the institution to  plan and articulate a program based on new and innovative  ways to support and promote research and education.  The  Document will guide future growth, and allow the use of  existing space more efficiently and appropriately relative  to plans for growth.  There will be two inter-related  aspects:    1)  As a prerequisite to long-range facilities planning,  faculty and staff, with the aid of a Facilitator, will  develop a long-range Plan for Research and Education at  OIMB.  This plan will articulate the needs and expectations  of new faculty, and will document a guideline for future  growth.    2)  The Facilities Plan will be based on a thorough study of  present needs and future plans, and architectural studies of  all buildings.  The product will be recommendations for more  efficient use of space and further recommendations based on  improved laboratory safety and access, with cost estimates  and prioritization of recommendations.",
