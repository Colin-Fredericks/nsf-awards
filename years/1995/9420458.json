 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420458  Frydman  This project focuses on nuclear magnetic resonance  investigation of order and dynamics in liquid-crystalline  polymers.  These new materials play special roles in several  structural and electronic applications.  Their main  characteristics are a strong affinity towards the formation  of liquid-crystalline solutions, and an ability to retain  these solution arrangements upon going into the solid state.  This combination makes possible the generation of highly  ordered macromolecular materials with valuable mechanical,  thermal and non-linear optical properties.  Further advances  in the practical utilization of these polymers are  intimately linked to understanding the ways in which  chemical structures and external factors such as flow  fields, can control their dynamics and orientations.  These  aspects are explored using state-of-the-art multidimensional  nuclear magnetic resonance in both the liquid-crystalline  and the solid phase, as well as gradient-based magnetic  resonance microscopy methods.  These experiments rely  extensively on a specialized technology whose  purpose is  the characterization of local anisotropic environments at  molecular and supramolecular levels.  They involve the use  of high-temperature dynamic-angle assemblies for studying  molten thermotropics, of variable-angle spinning probeheads  for solid-phase analyses of order and reorientations, and of  rheo-imaging instrumentation for the investigation of flow  in lyotropics.  Using these techniques it will be possible  to probe how local mesomorphic order in thermotropic liquid-  crystals depends on chemical composition; how much of the  liquid-crystalline order of these systems is preserved upon  cooling them into glasses; how solid-phase chain dynamics  affect the alignment of these polymeric glasses and what is  their exact nature; and how different types of flow and  diffusion impart a net anisotropy of solutions of liquid-  crystalline polymers.  An important aspect of these  experiments is the ir reliance on the natural-abundance  observation of  13C spins, a method that imposes no  preconditions on the type or origin of the samples under  study.  Thus, the materials to be analyzed include  homopolyesters with high melting temperatures, commercial  thermotropic copolymers, complex molecular blends of liquid-  crystalline and random polymers, and corrosive lyotropic  solutions.  %%%  All these are highly relevant systems, whose better  understanding should have a significant impact on their  practical application.",
