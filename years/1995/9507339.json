 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507339  Sundaresan    The meeting on Signalling in Plant Development will be held at the  Cold Spring Harbor laboratory from September 27 to October 1, 1995.  It will be an open international meeting that will be devoted to  recent advances and discoveries at the interface of two swiftly  progressing fields - signal transduction mechanisms in plants, and  the molecular biology of plant development. The development of a  higher plant is regulated by a multitude of signals from within and  without, that evoke both generalized and specific biological  responses, and elucidation of the mechanisms of signalling is vital  to understanding plant development. The emphasis of the forthcoming  meeting is on interpreting and integrating new finding on the  mechanisms of signal transduction within the context of plant  development. The need for such a meeting is evidenced by the rapid  advances during the last few years, e.g. cloning of regulators of  photomorphogenesis, elucidation of the roles of calcium and cGMP in  the developmental response to light, cloning of regulators of  pollen-stigma interactions, cloning of genes that control flowering  time, and cloning of genes involved in pathogen recognition. The  meeting will allow presentation of recent results and methodologies  in these different topics within a common framework, in an  atmosphere of face to face contact. In keeping with the traditional  format of Cold Spring Harbor meetings, the oral presentations will  be primarily on new unpublished finding. and particular  encouragement will be given to presentations by younger scientists.  The areas to be covered by the meeting are: 1) Germination, 2)  Photomorphogenesis, 3) Vegetative growth, 4) Flowering, 5)  Pollination and fertilization, 5) Fruit development and  embryogenesis, 6) Altered developmental programs- environmental  effectors and 7) Altered developmental programs- biological  effectors.  ***",
