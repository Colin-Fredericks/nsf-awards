 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of catalysts for  enantioselective 1,4-additions of non-stabilized carbanions  (Grignard and dialkylzinc reagents) to alpha,beta-unsaturated  carbonyls.  The investigation will involve the synthesis of  tridentate ligands, preparation and characterization of Cu(I) and  Ni(II) coordination complexes and the examination of the complexes  as catalysts for asymmetric conjugate addition.  The focus of the  educational plan involves the teaching of both chemistry majors and  non-majors,the involvement of undergraduates and graduate students  in laboratory research and an active involvement in outreach.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research and educational plan of Dr. Erick M. Carreira of the  Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of  Technology.Professor Carreira will focus his research efforts on  the design, synthesis and development of catalysts for chiral  carbon-carbon bond formation. The focus of Professor Carreira's  educational plan involves the teaching of both chemistry majors and  non-majors,the involvement of undergraduates and graduate students  in laboratory research and an active involvement in outreach.",
