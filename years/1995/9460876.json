 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the increasing environmental hazards posed by automobile exhaust emissions, alternative fuels, such as ethanol/gasohol, CNG, and hydrogen, and electric propulsion have been proposed to power future automobiles. Nevertheless, these hybrid vehicles suffer a significant loss in the combustion efficiency resulting in a rather slow acceptance by the public. In order to enhance the combustion efficiency of these alternative fuels, a novel, erosion-resistant spark plug (railplug), based on the plasma railgun principles, is proposed. The railplug electrodes require high-temperature strength, excellent electrical/thermal conductivity, arc/plasma-erosion resistance to survive in the harsh environments where they operate. Current electrode materials, such as steel, Ni-Mn-Cr alloy, and platinum-coated nickel, fail prematurely in plasma environments due to their inferior erosion resistance and poor high-temperature properties. In the Phase I, Materials Modification, Inc., will develop nanocrystalline refractory composites for railplug electrodes using chemical reaction methods. These composites will be consolidated using rapid consolidation methods that facilitate the achievement of near-theoretical density, in a very short time, at substantially lower processing/manufacturing costs. Phase I will focus on optimization of synthesis, consolidation, and characterization. Phase II will concentrate on optimization of process-structure-property parameters and the production of prototypes for lab and field evaluation. This should rapidly lead to a collaboration with a major manufacturer in the Phase III for incorporation into automotive systems.",
