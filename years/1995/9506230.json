 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506230  Bloodgood    Whole cell locomotion alone a solid substrate involves a  carefully choreographed sequence of events that requires the  cell surface to exhibit both sensory and motor functions,  which must be carefully integrated.  Chlamydomonas exhibits  gliding motility along a solid substrate, and this form of  whole cell locomotion is dependent upon the activities of  the flagellar surface.  Previous work from this laboratory  suggests the existence of a signaling pathway (involving c  calcium and protein phosphorylation) that couples the  sensory and motor functions of the flagellar surface.  Crosslinking of a population of 350 kD flagellar membrane  glycoproteins results in calcium influx followed by the  dephosphorylation of a 60 kD flagellar phosphoprotein that  binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the flagellar membrane  through its association with the 350 kD glycoprotein.  In a  manner not yet understood, these initial signaling events  result in activation of a flagellar motor protein complex  that derives the movement of the 350 kD glycoproteins within  the plane of the flagellar membrane thereby bringing about  locomotion.  The experiments outlined in this proposal will  extend our understanding of the flagellar signaling pathway  by which sensory and motor events at the flagellar surface  are coupled.  In  particular, efforts will be focused on  characterizing the functions performed by the 350 kD  flagellar membrane glycoprotein and the 60 kD flagellar  phosphoprotein.  These proteins will be cloned sequenced.  A  library of non-gliding mutant cell lines obtained by  Kozminski and Rosenbaum using insertional  mutagenesis/tagging will be screened for defects in the 350  kD glycoproteins, the 60 kD phosphoprotein, and steps in the  signaling pathway that induces the dephosphorylation of the  60 kD phosphoprotein.  These mutants hold the promise of  providing an alternative approach to cloning genes encoding  the 350 kD glycoprotein, the 60 kD phosphoprotein, and  other, curren tly unknown, components in the signal  components of the signaling pathway.  Functional analysis of  the 350 kD flagellar membrane glycoprotein and the 60 kD  phosphoprotein will be performed by directed mutagenesis of  cloned DNAs coupled with transformation of Chlamydomonas and  characterization of the transformants.  In parallel with the  molecular approaches to understanding this signaling pathway  and, in particular, the function of the two key players  identified to date, biochemical approaches will be utilized  to ask a number of functional questions: 1) Is the 60 kD  phosphoprotein a protein kinase? 2) Does the phosphorylation  of the 60 kD phosphoprotein regulate its function and/or its  association with he 350 kD membrane glycoprotein? 3) What is  the binding site on the 350 kD glycoprotein to which 60 kD  phosphoprotein  binds? and 4) Does the Chlamydomonas  flagellar homologue of the calcium dependent protein kinase  (CDPK) from higher plants play a role in the signaling  pathway?  Monoclonal antibodies to the 60 KD phosphoprotein  will be obtained and utilized for quantitating the 60 kD  phosphoprotein using ELISA and Western blots, purifying the  60 kD phosphoprotein by immunoaffinity chromatography, for  characterizing the non-gliding cell mutants and for  screening a lambda gt11 expression library.  These  experiments, utilizing a combining of biochemical and  molecular approaches, hold the promise of greatly extending  our understanding of the regulation of whole cell  locomotion.  %%%  The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas, is a model system  for studying gliding (not swimming) motion of cells with a  whiplike \"tail\" or flagellum. This study explores the  coordination of events which bring about the gliding motion  in Chlamydomonas.  A complex of proteins found within the  flagellum mediates the gliding motion.  The complex is  comprised of a larger protein containing covalently-attached  sugars (350 kD glycoprotein) and a smaller protein  containing covalently attached pho sphates (60 kD  phosphoprotein).   The genes for these proteins are cloned  and sequenced.  Mutant forms of the genes are identified in  existing mutant libraries of non-gliding Chlamydomonas.  These mutant libraries are also the source of  genes  important in the signaling mechanisms involved in flagellar  gliding.  Mutant forms of the genes will also be synthesized  and re-expressed in Chlamydomonas.  Biochemical analysis of  proteins which mediate the gliding motion are pursued to  identify the biochemical function of the proteins.  the 60  kD phosphoprotein will be purified and the following  questions answered: Does it phosphorylate components of the  flagella?  Is the phosphorylation which it shows necessary  for its activity? How does it interact with the 350 kD  glycoprotein?   Other proteins known to be signaling  mediators and also found in Chlamydomonas will be identified  as candidates for coordinating a part of the gliding motion.  This work is part of a larger question about the mechanism  of cell motility and how cellular motors are coordinated to  produce motion.  Application for this work could be found in  the area of how molecular machines are coordinated and  synthesized.  ***",
