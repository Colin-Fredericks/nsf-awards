 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454413  Hamner    The collaboration between the UCLA Marine Science Center and the  Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is designed to create  a cadre of 160 teachers (grades 5-12) trained to change and  strengthen science instruction throughout the system using a marine  science model.  This model has been developed over a period of  three years and was funded by NSF.  This model (i.e., Marine  Science Teacher Education Program: M-STEP) enhances the science  skills of teachers in a classroom and ocean-b program that  emphasizes a marine thematic integrative science approach to  Science education.  The ocean sciences are interdisciplinary so  that they taught as an integrated, problem solving, hands on  curriculum using the common theme of the marine environment.    Experiences in the Leadership In Marine Science Program (LIMS) will  develop in teachers the skills necessary to conduct classroom,  laboratory and field research in marine sciences with their  students.  They will also be effective leaders in peer training.   Because of LAUSD's new cluster organization of schools, these  teachers will impact four school clusters consisting of elementary,  middle, and senior high schools with about a total of 35,000  students.    The program is aimed at systemic change through this integrative  and thematic approach to science curriculum organization.  It is  designed not only to change the way that science is delivered in  these clusters, but it is also focused on attracting young minority  students into universities and into the sciences.  It provides and  presents a vehicle for further professionalization of teachers by  offering new science content, leadership skills development,  collaborative peer teaching training, and the improvement of what  is taught and how it is delivered in the classroom of the LAUSD.   LIMS teachers will provide the first cluster-based science  dissemination programs for LAUSD.",
