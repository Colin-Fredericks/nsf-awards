 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503079  Edwards  This is an award to provide the support this investigator  requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science  Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  which has the intent of encouraging the early development of  academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The research this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving our  fundamental understanding of factors that result in corrosive  behavior of materials used in distribution systems for water.  The investigator's education plan involves exploring changes in  basic course structure that include active learning, development  of supportive learning environments in the classroom and  implementation of a reward structure that encourages development  of non-traditional target skills such as teamwork, class  motivation and interest in learning outside the classroom.    Materials used in constructing water distribution systems are  subject to corrosion over long periods of time which reduces the  effective life of the system's components and has a potentially  degrading effect on the quality of water delivered to users  through the distribution system.  Procedures to adequately  determine the effect of corrosion can be useful in the improving  the engineering design of water distribution systems.  The  teaching plan this investigator plans to pursue seeks to  implement and evaluate new approaches to learning in the  undergraduate engineering classroom environment that will improve  the way in which undergraduate engineering courses are taught.  ***",
