 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Miller, University of California Berkeley, is supported by a   grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to   continue his research on the theory of chemical dynamics.  The goal of   Miller's research is to develop the theoretical concepts and   methodologies that can provide a quantitative description of chemical   dynamics, a kind of ab initio chemical dynamics akin to the ab initio   quantum chemistry of electronic structure theory.  Challenging and novel   applications of these approaches to specific chemical systems will also   be carried out when they illustrate or demonstrate the new methods and   concepts or when the specific application is of importance in its own   right.  The primary focus is on the dynamics of chemical reactions, but   other dynamical processes are also treatable by these approaches.  The   proposed research deals with both the most detailed level of description   (state-to-state reactive cross sections) and also more averaged   quantities (cumulative reaction probabilities and rate constants).    Methods are proposed for providing an absolutely rigorous treatment of   simple chemical reactions, and approximate methods for describing more   complex chemical systems, for which completely rigorous calculations are   not feasible, are also pursued.  Miller's research is directed at the most fundamental level of chemistry,   i.e., the chemical reaction taking place in the gas phase between two   colliding molecules.  This very basic, yet highly complex, process is the   simplest chemical reaction to which theory can be rigorously applied, and   forms the basis for understanding all other more complex chemical   processes.",
