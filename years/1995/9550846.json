 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an undergraduate neurophysiology  laboratory.   The laboratory is equipped with four-student  electrophysiology rigs, including microscopes, intra- and  extra-cellular amplifiers, Apple computers, and MacLab software.    This laboratory serves students who major in neuroscience,  psychology, and biology and is used in both lower- and upper-  division courses.   It is used to demonstrate experiments to  first-year students and to allow them to conduct a simple  experiment.   In the upper-division course, Fundamentals of  Neurophysiology, the rigs are used for a series of challenging  laboratories that teach students how to use the equipment, design  experiments, analyze data, and present their results both orally  and in writing.   The exercises focus on invertebrate  preparations and emphasize the principles of both cellular and  behavioral neuroscience.   The laboratories bring to life  concepts that students only read about until now and should  encourage some to pursue further studies in neurophysiology.    During the academic year and summer, many students conduct  independent research under the supervision of faculty members.    The rigs are available for such projects and for students who  focus on neurophysiology for their senior theses.   Finally, the  PI can use the equipment to develop new neuroethological  preparations suitable for undergraduate laboratories.",
