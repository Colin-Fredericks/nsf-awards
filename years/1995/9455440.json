 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent reports on the state of science education have identified  a need for more process-oriented, multidisciplinary science  courses; these reports also call for science courses that are  integrated within a coherent general education program. This  project will develop a two semester laboratory-based introductory  science course taught collaboratively by twelve faculty members  from six science disciplines. Called The Natural World, this  course will be modular in nature and centered around  multidisciplinary topics of current relevance.    The Natural World will emphasize the basic foundations of natural  science, science as a way of knowing, the uses of science,  historical influences on the development of science, and the  interrelationships between science and culture. A unique aspect  of the Natural World will be its integration within a new core  curriculum of 38 hours that integrates the various academic  disciplines within a set of comprehensive and cohesive  interdisciplinary courses. The Natural World will be linked to  two humanities courses students will be taking concurrently.    Ten modules of interdisciplinary topics will be developed for use  in introductory science courses, each to include an instructors  guide, a student guide, suggestions for student and teacher  readings, writing assignments and laboratory exercises that  involve collaborative and discovery-based learning.",
