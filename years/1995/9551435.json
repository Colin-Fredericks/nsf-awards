 "awd_abstract_narration": "For undergraduate students enrolled in Cedar Crest College's  Introduction to Culture and Society, Research Methods and Design,  and Evaluating Human Service Organizations courses, analyzing the  interrelationship between human social organization and behavioral  processes takes on both theoretical and applied (i.e., \"real  world\") dimensions.  Though traditional pedagogical techniques  (e.g., textbooks and class discussion) explore this important  connection, without \"hands-on\" experience, students are left to  wonder how generalizations offered by sociology (and all social  sciences) are developed.  Such suspicion affects the very  foundation of their learning experiences and may prevent the  integration of course lessons in their personal and, ultimately,  professional lives.          To address this critical need for linkage and hands-on  experience, three computer-assisted instructional (CAI) programs  with a history of reliability and classroom use, Data Happy!  (Carter, 1995), Survey Research: A Computer-Assisted Introduction  (Bainbridge, 1989) and SPSS/PC+ Studentware (Norusis, 1991), will  be integrated within Introduction to Culture and Society, Research  Methods and Design, and Evaluating Human Service organizations  micro-computer classroom labs, based on funds made available  through NSF's ILI-IP Award and Cedar Crest College.  The role that  each CAI program plays in course labs is threefold.  First, to  enhance the students' understanding of key theoretical concepts and  their importance in sociology by examining how these concepts have  been used in sociological research.  Second, to provide exercises  on elementary or advanced data analysis and its connection to the  problem of establishing causality in order to facilitate a working  knowledge and critique of sociological frameworks.  Finally, to  challenge students to continue to use real data and explore, test,  and apply the insights of sociology to social conditions and  circumstances in their communities.",
