The primary objective of the proposed effort is to re-examine, extend and generalize a model that the PI has developed for the flame speed dependence in terms of  curvature, strain and non-steady effects in the thin premixed flamelet regime.  Specific topics will include the investigation of the following: (1) time dependent flame structure in which unsteady perturbation and large amplitude solutions will be considered, (2) propagation in near-stoichiometric mixtures, (3) effects of nonuniform mixtures on the unburned gas, and (4) effects of interactions of a premixed flame with surfaces and in confined environments.  The general methodology will involve the use of large activation energy asymptotics based on one-step global kinetics, with the addition of allowing for density changes from unburned to burned gases.",
