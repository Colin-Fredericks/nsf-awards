 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science Department at SUNY Geneseo has developed a  \"three-fold\" introduction to computer science, whose central  mission is to give students rudimentary but real ability in all  three methods of inquiry. The Department is offering a faculty  enhancement workshop for instructors interested in adopting this  curriculum. The curriculum contains relatively abstract material,  material that is often not what students expect. A number of active  learning techniques are essential if students are to master this  material. The workshop presents the rationale behind the new  curriculum, and provides intensive introductions to using and  developing the kinds of active learning materials that have  succeeded at Geneseo. The workshop consists of a primary meeting in  June of 1995, and a follow-up meeting in June of 1996. Between  these meetings, participants will integrate elements of the  three-fold introduction into their own curricula. This workshop  improves participants' undergraduate computer science programs  through direct training, evaluation of each other's strategies for  adopting the three-fold introduction, and ongoing dissemination of  materials (both at the meetings and via Internet).",
