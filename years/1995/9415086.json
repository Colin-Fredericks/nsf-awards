 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dodgson  NSF-supported renovations within Giltner Hall at Michigan State University will  support research and research training activities of the Microbiology Department in  microbial diversity, physiology, and genetics.  The department is home to the NSF  Science and Technology Center for Microbial Ecology (CME).  Giltner Hall was  constructed in 1952; the laboratory facilities are considerably outdated for modern  science and inefficiently designed for research interactions.  The renovations will  impact nine faculty directly and a substantial portion of the Department s more than  70 graduate students.  The renovation will involve the basement and floors one through three of the central  section of Giltner Hall and will be directed at correction of a number of deficiencies.   Laboratory space will be re-configured to improve efficiency and to cluster faculty by  major interest area.  In addition, the project will reorganize space to reduce safety,  security, and accessibility problems that occur with the current mix of general  classroom space and research space, and it will address major systemic problems such  as lack of temperature control and a poor air handling system.  A new HVAC system  will be installed to correct problems with space overheating, equipment failures and  researcher discomfort.  The new mechanical systems will also greatly reduce airborne  contaminants, as circulated air will be filtered, and new ceilings will be installed to  cover exposed overhead pipes.  New laboratory benches will be added to increase  work surface space,  and a new self-contained warm room,  walk-in incubator, and  two new autoclaves will be installed.  Two of the nine faculty directly impacted by this renovation activity will move from  other campus locations to join fellow faculty in research activities which are expected  to provide future benefits in biotechnology, global change, and environmental  research.  In addition to ongoing laboratory-based research efforts, the department is  managing  the Bergey s Manual Trust, and the collection and archival activities of two  major bioninformatic projects.",
