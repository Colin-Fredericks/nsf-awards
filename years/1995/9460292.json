 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to use the solubilized membrane as the electrolyte in internally humidified proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and to develop a rapid method for its application on electrodes. The solubilized membrane forms tenacious deposits on electrodes and have the desirable properties of an electrolyte for the said purpose. The research objective is to develop an appropriate and rapid method for application of electrolyte on electrodes. The method of brushing produces nonuniform deposits. The method of spraying can be developed as a viable method that can be made rapid and automated. Two solubilized membranes of different equivalent weights will be used in the experiment. The quality and characteristics of the electrolyte deposits will be evaluated in 25 and 50 cm2 active electrode area fuel cells and also in a three-cell stack. Cells will be tested without external humidification at 30-70\u00ddC and 0-20 psig pressure. Fuel cells will be assembled with a proprietary plastic film gasket that will be placed symmetrically around the electrode edges. Estimation will be made on the amount of active Pt surface area and the extent of cross-leaks, if any, across a fuel cell. Anticipated benefits include the availability of a high performance polymer electrolyte for the PEMFC and the use of much less electrolyte material for the fuel cell.",
