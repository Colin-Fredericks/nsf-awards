 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500491  Shiffman    Shiffman will continue his research on complex varieties and meromorphic mappings.  He will investigate the Kabayashi-Royden infinitesimal pseudometric and Kobayashi pseudodistane with a goal towards obtaining a better understanding of the concept of hyperbolicity for projective manifolds.  He will also return to the topic of value distribution theory and will seek new defect relations for meromorphic maps and for sections of vector bundles.    Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex  variable.  It became clear early on that the theory differed  widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was far more  difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity  with partial differential operators of first order.  It thus grew  as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic  mathematical forms.",
