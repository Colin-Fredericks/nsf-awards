 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550692  Travis    The purpose of the Research Careers for Minority Scholars (RCMS)  Program at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is to  increase the number of minority student graduating in mathematics  and statistics, to enhance their educational achievements, and to  increase the number who attend graduate school and pursue careers  in these fields.  To this end, UTSA will make available  scholarships to talented undergraduate students.  We will identify  and recruit 18 honors minority students (4 each of freshmen and  sophomores and 5 each of juniors and seniors) to participate in the  program.  The program will be strongly research oriented and the  capstone will be a mentor relationship between research faculty and  RCMS Scholars.  The faculty participants will be asked to commit  themselves to mentor relationships with students, to encourage them  to pursue graduate training, and to assist in addressing and  solving academic and personal problems.  Program elements include  (1) Mentor relationships with a faculty research mentor and  graduate student; (2) An EXCEL Summer Bridge Program for in-coming  freshman; (3) Curriculum enhancement, using Calculus as the anchor;  (4) Summer research internship in mathematics and statistics; (5)  Honors Research and Professional Development Seminars; (6)  Undergraduate Research courses; (7) Distinguished Guest Lecturer  Series, utilizing minority role models in the science; (8)  Participation in at least one professional meeting at the state or  national level during the academic year; (9) Special Workshops such  as Preparing for the GRE and Getting Into Graduate School; (10)  Academic and career advisement; and (11) Aggressive retention  efforts.",
