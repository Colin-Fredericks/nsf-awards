 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this effort is to explore the concept of dominant  edges and dominant tasks for scheduling parallel programs on a  distributed  memory processing system.  A dominant edge will play  a crucial role in  generating a task schedule because of the  associated communication cost.  A  dominant task is a coarse  grained task with low run time overhead such that  they can be  rescheduled on a different processor to achieve a load balance.  Thus all remaining (non-dominant) tasks will be allocated  statically to  processors.    This project will build on the earlier work on Threshold  Scheduling, where the degree of parallelism is treaded off for  the schedule  length.  In this project, the goal is to investigate  the threshold scheduling to  enhance unified data and code  partitioning for a family of distributed memory  architectures  including Touchstone Delta and Paragon.  This will involve the  formalization of feasibility conditions and optimality  conditions.  A  feasibility condition guarantees that the schedule  delay of a task from its  earliest start time is below the  threshold and an optimality condition used a  merit function to  decide the best task-processor match for a set of tasks  competing  for a given processor.",
