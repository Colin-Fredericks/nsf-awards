A  major role envisioned for the vBNS is to serve as a platform for  research on very high speed networking and networking applications.   Now that the vBNS project is underway, it is time for the research  community and those responsible for the vBNS  to begin a closer  dialog on what research can and will be done on the vBNS and how  the researchers will gain access to the infrastructure. The  Computing Research Association will sponsor a workshop to start  that dialog.  Approximately thirty researchers in networking and  applications, from academia and industry, will meet in Washington  DC on June 22 and 23, 1995.  together with government agency  officials and vBNS designers and operators, they will discuss the  current and likely future research agendas in high speed networking  and the implications of those agendas for the vBNS as an  experimental environment.",
