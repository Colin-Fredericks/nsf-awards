Typically singularities in the value-function occur as  extremal trajectories need to be terminated because they lose optimality.  The relation to conjugate points and cut-loci of competing control strategies  will be investigated. The nonuniqueness of optimal controls on the cut-locus is  the primary source for nondifferentiability of the value function.  The main tool in this analysis will be a geometric theory of conjugate  points and corresponding construction of a field of extremals. When the  flow of extremals covers the state space 1-1 and smoothly, the value  function and corresponding regular synthesis of extremals can be  constructed by the method of characteristics analogous to classical  Hamilton-Jacobi theory. This construction can be done piecewise and as  such directly applies to broken extremals. It also has the advantage that  it can immediately be localized and Jacobi type sufficient conditions for  local optimality can be attained for broken extremals. It is intended  to develop a theory which applies to arbitrary piecewise smooth  extremals unifying existing concepts for nonsingular extremals with  those for bang-bang trajectories. For nonsingular  extremals (which satisfy the strengthened Legendre condition) the usual  Riccati equations for characterizations of the conjugate points are  obtained while for bang-bang controls the conjugate points reduce to  certain switching points.  Special emphasis will be given to optimal control systems with a  compact control set and a Hamiltonian function which is  quadratic, more generally strictly convex in the control. Under generic  conditions the Maximum principle generates a piecewise defined dynamical system  on the cotangent bundle for which still local existence and uniqueness  properties hold, a so-called hybrid system.  %%%  Using a field theoretic  approach the links between geometric properties  of extremal trajectories and singularities of the value function will  be investigated.
