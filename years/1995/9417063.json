Florida State University  Title: Hydrology and Regional Climatology of the East African              Lakes: Applications for Paleoclimate Studies    This award supports a study of the climate history in the area of  the East African Lakes.  The primary goal is to quantify the  hydrological balances of the East African lakes in order to  facilitate interpretation of their long-term histories in terms of  regional and global climate.  The second goal is the production of  a regional data base of climatic and hydrologic information  relevant to the project.  The work will involve five main tasks:         1. Archiving relevant climatic and hydrologic information for       each lake; 2. Assessment of means and temporal variations of       key climatic elements; 3. Reconstruction of historical       fluctuations of East African lake and catchments; 4.       Derivation of a water and energy balances model for lakes and       catchments;  5. Application of models to historical lake       levels of Lake Victoria.    One major result of the project will be a record and analysis of  climate and lake levels in East Africa during the past two to three  centuries.  It will help to determine the nature and degree of  response of the lakes to global and regional climate, including lag  relationships between climate and lake-level fluctuations.  The  study will help to uncover the relationships between climate of  this region and climate variability in other areas of the tropics  and in the higher latitudes.  The results will also provide a  framework for the interpretation of long-term ecological changes in  the lakes.",
