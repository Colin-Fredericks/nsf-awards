 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455656  Laws  Funding from NSF would support the development of five new upper  level courses in a renovated physics curriculum. Since only about  3% of students in introductory physics courses nationwide continue  on to upper level courses, the curriculum must be made more  appealing and the aims broader. Traditional curricula have been  directed almost exclusively toward the training of undergraduates  for graduate school and thence to becoming \"physicists.\" Without  sacrificing that goal, the aims of the undergraduate program can be  broadened to provide benefits to those who will apply their  conceptual understanding and logical problem solving abilities to  a wide variety of future activities.  Courses within the model  Dickinson College physics major curriculum will be  project-centered, dealing with real-world topics that appeal to  students' curiosity. Learning is thereby motivated not by a vague  possibility of future usefulness, but by an immediate need for  understanding in order to deal with the course projects. This  approach is an outgrowth of the Workshop Physics introductory  courses developed at Dickinson College, a program that has been  used at many other institutions. In a similar way, the new  curriculum, the newly developed courses, the project modules, or  supporting materials can be useful to other institutions.  Projects  included in the new courses will overlap topics covered in  traditional courses, but will provide new emphases. For example,  experiments with chaos will be incorporated into the dynamics  course; magnetic resonance imaging will join other modern physics  topics in Medical and Radiation Physics.",
