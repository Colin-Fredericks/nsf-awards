 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds student work stations, a network server, and  classroom equipment to reinforce and expand dramatically the  capabilities of the laboratory portion of an introductory  psychology course that serves as the science distribution  requirement for half of the student body.   With this equipment,  hypertext is used to integrate the materials from lecture,  laboratory, library, and video resources, making them available  both at 15 laboratory work stations and to individual students  through the campus network (dormitories and computer work rooms).    This instructional lab network makes it possible to use new  types of pedagogical material:  QuickTime video segments,  animated illustrations of dynamic processes, and a readily  accessible file of slides, overheads, and graphics currently  scattered among faculty.    The intended effect is fourfold:  to  give students experience with methodologies that were previously  unavailable at the introductory level; to provide the means to  explore more actively the methologies and often encyclopedic  content of introductory psychology; to teach the use of  network-available library resources; and to exploit the potential  of networked stations to collect, collate, and display data so  that students have more time for interpretation and consideration  of possible alternative hypotheses.",
