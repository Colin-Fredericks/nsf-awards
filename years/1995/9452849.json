This is a fully bilingual English\\Spanish  publication designed to encourage Latino students to develop  language skills as well as turn their interest to the world of  scientific discovery.  The magazine is geared towards students in  grades 3-6, and presents science information and experiments in  stimulating graphic formats and poses interesting and relevant  questions for children based on current scientific developments.   In an effort to provide positive role models for children of  Hispanic descent, the magazine highlights historical and  contemporary contributions and accomplishments of Latino  scientists.  The magazine also strives to foster a multicultural  perspective by presenting science and technology issues faced by  selected communities in various stages of economic development to  Latino children in an attempt to strengthen their identification  with their national origin and ethnic heritage.  Initially, two  issues are being produced with plans to produce fourteen issues  over a four year period.  The ultimate goal is for the  publication to become self-sustaining after the development  period.   ***",
