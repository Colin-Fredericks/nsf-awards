 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505806  Hood  This research is based on the hypothesis that the chronic effect of  NO2 on protein structure and function is due, in part, to the  reaction of this oxidant pollutant with specific basic amino acid  side chains and that such reactions are potentiated by formation of  oxidant radicals resulting from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated  fatty acids (PUFAs).  Preliminary data suggest that NO2 reacts with  the E-amino group of lysine residues and with the amide nitrogen of  surface exposed lysine and arginine residues in the polypeptide  backbone which can result in polypeptide bond cleavage.  In vitro  NO2 exposures of a series of decapeptides followed by exposures of  recombinant  1-PI (a 53kDa protein which protects the critical  structural protein, elastin, from proteolysis by elastase) will be  performed to determine the susceptibility of these polypeptides to  pollutant oxidants.  NO2 exposures of selected decapeptides and of  proteins, followed by exposures of inhibitors and unsaturated  hydrocarbons as well as membrane entrapped inhibitors analyzed by  Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry, 15N-NMR, 13C15N-NMR, and  1H-NMR and Gas Chromatography will identify specific NO2 derived  adducts. These studies will also determine whether the autoxidation  of unsaturated fatty acids contributes to polypeptide inactivation.  The in vitro exposure studies will be conducted using well   defined systems, providing accurate quantitation and biochemical  characterization.  The target molecules chosen are relevant to the  mechanistic study of conformational transitions in proteins as a  result of oxidant exposure.  %%%  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and its associated NO (x) (nitroxide) species  are examples of atmospheric pollutants derived from fossil fuel  combustion and cigarette smoke.  Combustion processes initially  produce nitric oxide, which is then oxidized in the atmosphere to  the much more reactive NO2 species.  This photochemical process is  responsible for the daily variations i n nitroxide concentrations in  large metropolitian areas.    Very little effort has been directed at the possibility that  oxidants, such as NO2, may directly alter the structure of  proteins.  Based on the oxidation-reduction potential of NO2 in  neutral aqueous solutions, it has been postulated that NO2 exhibits  a high degree of selectivity among the molecular constituents of  living cells.  This research will examine the effects of NO2  exposure on selected peptides and proteins.  Structural changes  will be determined and the susceptibility of these protein  structural changes to different conditions of oxidant exposure will  be evaluated.   ***",
