 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SUNY \"Pre-Precalculus Project\" is aimed at a large and  growing number of mathematically underprepared and/or unmotivated  students at both two- and four-year colleges. To address the many  special needs of students who fail to achieve in courses such as  introductory or intermediate algebra at the college level, this  project is developing a new approach to pre-precalculus featuring  a revamped curriculum involving contextual problem-solving, an  integrated use of technology, an improved pedagogy emphasizing  active, collaborative efforts by students and faculty, and  authentic assessment tied more closely to the course and real  world skills. A series of curriculum development workshops over a  two-year period is addressing these issues. The goal of the  project is the design of a sequence of two 4-hour pre-precalculus  courses and the creation of the instructional materials to  support them. These two courses are replacing all developmental  college mathematics courses prior to precalculus. As a result of  the diversity and expertise of this coalition of twelve SUNY  two-and four-year colleges, the project plans to empower students  with the mathematics they need in order to survive and flourish  in an increasingly technological and sophisticated 21st Century.  The model and materials developed by the project are appropriate  for many such underprepared students throughout the country.",
