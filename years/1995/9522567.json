 "awd_abstract_narration": "St. Lucian children are confronted with a complex sociolinguistic  environment in which they receive highly variable, multilingual  input. As they acquire language they must learn to control  multiple varieties or codes, including a French-lexicon creole  (Kweyol), various emergent forms of English-lexicon creole, and  \"standard\" English(es). In the course of developing the  communicative competence to use these different varieties in  pragmatically and culturally appropriate ways, these children  acquire detailed knowledge of a great degree of both linguistic  and sociocultural variation, as well as an intimate understanding  of how these two orders of variation are interlinked in St.  Lucian society. In the process, they learn to draw on these  language varieties as a rich cultural resource for setting forth  their emergent identities and negotiating various types of social  interactions. These developmental processes will be investigated  through a language socialization study. The language acquisition  process will be longitudinally documented in six children of  differing social backgrounds. Regular periodic audio recordings  will be made of the children's speech interactions with various  interlocutors in a variety of naturalistic settings. These  recordings will be annotated in detail and transcribed in  cooperation with local consultants so as to place the recorded  utterances in ethnographic context. The course of language  acquisition will be analyzed with regard to the extent to which  different varieties are used in each child's verbal environment,  the differing structural features of those varieties, the  differences in pragmatic salience among particular forms and  variants, and the sociocultural norms of their use. This research  will yield insights into how children acquire communicative  competence in multilingual settings, and how knowledge of  linguistic variation and the social differentiation it indexes  and encodes forms an essential part of the overall cultural  competenc e of persons living in creole societies. More broadly,  the study will contribute to theoretical understandings of how  multilingual communities are constituted and organized; and it  will provide insight into how individuals apprehend their social  worlds and how they use language in asserting and managing their  often shifting identities in these heterogeneous (and today,  increasingly prevalent) settings.",
