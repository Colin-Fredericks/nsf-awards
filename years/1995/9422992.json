The organizers are Dr. Robert E. Green, Jr.,  of the Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at the Johns Hopkins  University and Dr. Ludek Ptacek of the Institute for Material  Engineering at the Technical University of Brno.  At the workshop  experts in technologies of nondestructive methods will meet with  engineers and materials scientists to explore potential  applications of nondestructive characterization and discuss  solutions to problems encountered in industrial practice.      Properties of special interest to the participants are elastic  moduli, microstructure, residual stress, dislocation density,  porosity, fiber/matrix volume ration, and cure state.  Presented  papers will address the application of nondestructive techniques  for optimization of the processing and properties of polymers,  ceramics, and composites; the development of synthetically  structured materials; the measurement and characterization of  semiconductors and amorphous metals; and the growth of perfect  electronic and optical crystals and thin films.  These technical  presentations and resulting discussions are intended to foster  stronger links among the U.S. and Czech research communities with  the primary goal of identifying topics for future cooperative  research in the strategic areas mentioned.  ***",
