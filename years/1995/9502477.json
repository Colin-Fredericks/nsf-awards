The research centers  on nonlinear control of dynamical systems with reduced  control authority and application to autonomous underwater  vehicles (AUV).  The results of the research will have a  significant impact on the efficiency and reliability of  AUV's which are increasingly in demand as they are expected  to play a central role in scientific, environmental,  industrial and military underwater missions.  At the same  time, control of dynamical systems such as AUV's provides an  exciting new topic of research that attracts the interest of  students and can be used inside and outside the classroom to  motivate fundamental learning and to introduce undergraduate  and graduate students to innovative research.    The goal of the proposed research is to develop a framework  for synthesizing control laws to govern the motion of  dynamical systems which have a reduced number of independent  control inputs as compared to typical usage (also referred  to as under-actuated dynamical systems).  The reduction in  control authority may be the inadvertent result of an  actuator failure or the deliberate result of an economic  design choice.  Accordingly, this research will provide  solutions for (1) improving system fault tolerance by  exploiting built-in system redundancy and enabling systems  to adapt to changes in control authority such as an actuator  failure and (2) choosing the number and types of control  actuators and actuator configurations in control system  designs to best achieve desired performance results.  The  research is applicable to AUV's as well as to other systems  including spacecraft, mobile robots and vibratory actuators.  ***",
