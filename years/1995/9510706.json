 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general problem this research addresses is the nature of  multi-dimensional linguistic composition. Natural language  expressions display properties in a variety of dimensions: they  have properties linking them to the physical world; they are  syntactically categorized; they support pragmatic and semantic  interpretation. The properties of basic expressions may be  assumed to be finitely stipulated or listed, as in a dictionary  or its mental counterpart. The properties of complex expressions  cannot be assumed to be encodable this way, but must be derivable  in a way that depends both on the correlative properties of their  component parts and on their mode of combination. This question  of linguistic composition arises with regard to each dimension;  moreover, it arises in a generalized form across dimensions,  since composition in one dimension may affect or depend on  composition in another. Although there are a variety of solutions  to this problem instantiated in existing grammatical  architectures, the question deserves to be studied more sys-  tematically, since the interrelation of properties of different  kinds forms the basis of the unbounded creative character of  natural language and its expressive power.       The investigation here views linguistic composition as a  problem of resource-sensitive grammatical inference in a system  of labeled deduction: the component parts of an utterance are  taken to be a structured set mf premises from which a coherent  global structure for the utterance is sought within a particular  system of deductive postulates. This point of view connects  directly with two recent trends in logic: the rise of interest in  substructural logics and the investigation of labeled deduction.  The research will exploit the results in these areas for  applications to the study of grammatical architecture and the  dynamic flow of grammatical information within and across  different dimensions in the course of composition.       The principal research goals are:  1) to gain insight into  the nature of multidimensional composition through the  construction and systematic study of appropriate models based on  logical principles; 2) to connect these insights to the analysis  of a broad range of linguistic phenomena; and S) to show that the  resulting framework offers a unifying perspective on current  grammatical theories.       The expected results of the research include a monograph  describing the range and power of the known landscape of  grammatical logics and a computer implementation of such a system  with robust empirical coverage of English.",
