 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419093  Feldmann  All plants contain epicuticular wax (EW) on the surface of  the cuticle.  Scanning electron microscopy has revealed that  in many plant species the EW consists of an amorphous ground  layer covered by rod-shaped structures and irregular shaped  plate-like structures with rounded edges.  The wax is  composed of a mixture of long chain aliphatic compounds  which can be isolated by dipping an aerial portion of the  plant into chloroform or hexane for a few seconds and then  evaporating the solvent.  The aliphatic compounds include  alkanes, esters, beta-diketones, aldehydes, primary and  secondary alcohols, ketones, free acids, and triterpenes.  There is tremendous diversity among plant species both in  the number of chemical classes present in a wax and in their  relative abundance.  Even within an individual plant the  vairous organs can be characterized by quantitative and  qualitative differences in the EW composition.    The wax biochemical pathway is poorly understood and even  less is known about the export of these molecules through  the cell wall and cuticle to the surface.  However, a large  number of EW mutants have been isolated in Arabidopsis,  which allows the investigator to take a genetic and  molecular approach to dissecting the epicuticular wax  pathway.  The objective of this proposal is to clone and  characterize two of these genes, CER4 and CER21.  The  mutation at the CER4 locus eliminates the accumulation of  primary alcohols whicle a mutation at the CER21 locus  eliminates nearly all of the aldehydes.  Both genes will be  sequenced.  Their expression level in leaves, stems and  siliques will be characterized during development.  Also,  the expression of the CER4 and CER21 genes will be studied  in plants grown under several encironmental regimes.  The  cell-type specific expression of these two genes will be  studied.  Subcellular localization will be performed via in  situ analyses with antibodies raised against the CER4 and  CER21 proteins.  Also s tudied will be the function of these  genes in the plant, i.e., are they important in  biosynthesis, transport, or regulation.    There is substantial evidence to show that the composition  of the EW is important in host plant selection by  herbivorous insects.  Modification of the EW via genetic  engineering methods should enable us to provide resistance  to various insect pests in a number of important agronomic  crops.  The results obtained from the modification of  Arabidopsis can be used to modify the waxes on agronomic  plants.",
