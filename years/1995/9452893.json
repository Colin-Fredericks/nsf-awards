The selected research areas are:  (1)  Biotechnology; (2) Materials Science; and (3) Science and  Engineering Infrastructure.  Each of the research areas hate  identified short, intermediate, and long range goals (up to the  year 2000) and devised strategies to:  achieve national and  international levels of excellence; strengthen human resources in  science and technology; create advisory councils of distinguished  researchers to guide project development; establish collaborative  agreement with national and international groups and laboratories;  and vigorously seek additional funds to build on the base provided  by EPSCoR.  Collaborative agreements have been made with the  Industry/University/Research Center, the Corporation for the  Technological Development of Tropical Resources, and the Puerto  Rico Scientific Community Council to promote and advocate for the  strengthening of the Commonwealth's science and engineering  community and the development of R&D in the private and government  sectors.",
