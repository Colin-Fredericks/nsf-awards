 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554230  Allen      The Darden College of Education at Old Dominion University(ODU), in conjunction  with the Norfolk Public Schools (NPS), will develop a proposal for a competitive  Networking Infrastrcture for Education project, in support of the Norfolk Public  Schools' PRIME (Public School Restructuring for Innovative Mainstream Education)  Project, a long term(10 year), comprehensive education restructuring initiative.  The  planning grant will make it possible to:    Develop a plan to network the six PRIME schools(complete building network), with  internet access from each class room; homes, schools, and community agencies will  eventually be linked;    Help fund release time for teachers and administrators to collaborate in the  development of the technology infrastructure plan and its instructional uses, and plan  for staff development to accelerate the learning curve for becoming technologically  exemplary teachers;    Collaborate with members of the national Academy of sciences Draft National  Science Education Standards and the National Council of Teachers of Math  Guidances in the development of a compressed, contextual, math and science  curriculum;    Develop a cadre of involved and committed parents at each school, from a cross  section of SES levels, who will be involved in planning grant activities, and to plan  school labs with labtop lending for parents and community, with school based  computer and telecommunications training;    Further seek and develop collaboration with industry and business, and strengthen  existing ties and forge new links with the U.S. Navy, which has a large presence in  the Norfolk area; develop links with social organizations, for example, libraries,  social services, and rest home for mutual benefit;    Develop a plan for a full scale test of curriculum compression; develop measurable  evaluation criteria for the effects of curriculum compression on student achievement  and teacher effectiveness, and to measure the effects of parental and community   involvement on student achievement.    Teams of teachers, administrators, parents, ODU faculty, NPS central office  personnel, and grant staff will meet for three weeks in July and August, 1995, and  once each month for seven months, in preparation for performing tasks such as:  gathering baseline data on current instructional technology practices, hardware and  software configurations, and parental levels of technological expertise using surveys;  consulting with members of the national standards of learning for math and science  communities, and assessment planners; developing business partnerships through  parental contacts and intensive direct solicitation; strengthening a partnership with  the Brunswick County Public Schools; identifying staff development imperatives,  technology, curriculum and change management.    A unique, systematic, restructuring project located in an economically challenged  area, PRIME is a prototype for school reform which may be replicated in any school  district.  PRIME, through its emphasis on technology and telecommunications, seeks  to completely redefine the process necessary to prepare students, including those  most at risk, for leading roles in a technological, multi cultural global village.   Technology will not be viewed as an \"add on\" to sustain the traditional curriculum.   The opportunities provided by a technologically rich environment will extend to  parents and community to overcome the isolation of poverty, create trust between a  cross section of the population, nationally and internationally, that would otherwise  remain isolated for each other.",
