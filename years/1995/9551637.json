 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)  instrumentation and analysis have great educational benefits for  both non-science- and science majors.   All students need to have  a realistic awareness of the potential and limitations of at  least some of the technologies that underlie current scientific  research.   Since non-science-majors may take as few as one  formal science course during their 4 years as an undergraduate,  it is critical that institutions provide them with exposure to  chemical technologies relevant to their future.   Science majors  additionally need an early introduction and continued exposure to  modern instrumentation since usage of such instrumentation is the  norm in the scientific research community.  The university has  chosen FT-IR instrumentation as a way of addressing these broad  educational goals for all introductory chemistry classes.    Non-science-majors learn how infrared spectroscopy may be used  for chemical identification in the context of environmental and  pharmaceutical applications.   Science majors strengthen their  understanding of principles of bonding and molecular structure  through FT-IR.   Students are also shown how spectroscopy is the  result of bonding phenomena and, conversely, how the  interpretation of spectroscopic phenomena yields information  about bonding and structure.   Furthermore, students learn  quantitative applications of FT-IR so they may apply this  technique to both qualitative and quantitative tasks of analysis.",
