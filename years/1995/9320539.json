The objectives are to: (1) examine and delineate the  applicability of existing analytical and numerical solutions to  the physical problem, (2) perform thorough parametric studies to  clarify the influence of important foundation and soil parameters  on the dynamic response, (3) identify and adapt relevant existing  theories to granular soil conditions by calibration, and (4)  develop more comprehensive solutions and formulas to deal with  the stress-induced heterogeneous soil conditions intrinsic to  this class of problems.    To achieve these goals, a fundamental series of experiments will  be conducted on a geotechnical centrifuge.  The interest is in  determining the foundation response in vertical, horizontal, and  rocking modes under earthquake and random loading.  Particular  attention is given to the development of a comprehensive data set  on the effects of: (i) foundation size, (ii) static foundation  load, (iii) nonlinearities due to dynamic excitation levels, (iv)  foundation shape, (v) embedment, and (vi) intrinsic and global  parameters on the dynamic response.    In addition to furnishing the much-needed physical basis for  further theoretical and numerical developments, this research  will allow the derivation of direct semi-empirical relationships  which can be of immediate value to designers.  ***",
