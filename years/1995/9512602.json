 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a consortium of five faculty members and their research groups in  the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University,  we propose the acquisition of a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)  Spectrometer. This instrument can detect the binding of biomolecules in  solution to a surface-immobilized ligand. The SPR instrument is  extraordinarily sensitive because it uses a laser at a precise angle to  excite the surface plasmons at the glass-gold interface of the SPR chip  (upon which the measurements are made). The change of angle of the  reflected minimum of intensity as a function of time is correlated with  binding of the biomolecule(s) in solution with the immobilized ligand.  Using this machine, it is possible to measure association and  dissociation rates of binding thereby providing both kinetic and  thermodynamic data from the same measurements. With the recent addition  of variable temperature capability entropic and enthalpic contributions  to binding energy can be separated.    We plan to follow several lines of research with the new instrument,  pertaining to: (a) the mechanism of transcription; (b) the mechanism of  the immune response; (c) signal transduction pathways; and (d)  drug/target inhibitory effects.    In parallel with the experiments mentioned above, we will develop new  SPR technologies; in particular we plan to design new SPR chips as  follows:    We propose a new paradigm for surface immobilization of biomolecules:  the use of mixed, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiols, a small  percentage of which have been derivatized to target particular classes  of biomolecules. We have already demonstrated the efficacy of this  strategy for a chip which selectively immobilizes histidine-tagged  proteins through binding to Ni(II). Use of the technique resulted in an  enhanced sensitivity of at least an order of magnitude. In addition to  further development of this chip, we plan to contruct a similar chip  for binding biomolecules to immobilized DNA. Lastly, we  propose the  development of a chip to display an array of small drugs to potential  putative target molecules.",
