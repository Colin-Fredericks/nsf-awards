 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423244  Glazman  The goal of this project is to develop a theory of charge  transport in an interacting electron system which is  confined to a wide channel.  The PI will investigate the  effect of a magnetic field on transport, and the structure  of the tunneling density of states on a two-dimensional  electron liquid in a weak magnetic field.  The study  includes finding the evolution of this structure with field  strength, disorder, and geometrical confinement and relating  it to the properties of the collective excitations of the  electron liquid.  The PI will use two approaches based upon  perturbation theory in the interaction strength and upon the  continuous medium description of the electron system.  The  project involves making specific predictions for the  observable characteristicq and comparisons with existing  experiments.  %%%  This theoretical project involves understanding the flow of  electrons, i.e., the current in a wide channel.  The PI is  known for using simple and intuitive physical pictures  rather than relying on more formal mathematical  developments.  He is considered one of the brightest  theorists in this area of physics in his age group.  The PI  will make specific predictions for the observable  characteristics and comparisons with existing experiments.  This work has applications to thin films and semiconducting  devices.  It is likely to lead to an improved understanding  of a number of experiments and is likely to have an impact  on future experiments.  ***",
