 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Harry Floyd Davis   of Cornell University will study the physical and chemical interactions   between neutral transition metal atoms and complexes and small covalent   molecules such as methane.  Laser ablation will be used to produce   sufficient quantities of transition metals which will react with a   molecular beam of the covalent molecule. Laser spectroscopies will be   used to excite the resulting complex in either the van der Waals region   or the insertion intermediate region of the potential surface.     Electronic excitation and vibrational overtone excitation will be used to   obtain information on excited state and ground state unimolecular   decomposition products by measuring angular distributions and branching   ratios. Studies of bimolecular reactions using different initial   electronic configurations of the transition metal will also be   undertaken.  The educational component of the program will involve   undergraduates in studying chemical reactions at the fundamental level in   a research environment less structured than regular undergraduate   laboratory sessions.  Transition metals are important in a wide variety of catalytic systems   involving organic and inorganic molecules.  Professor Davis will study   the effects of electronic structure and energy in reactions of transition   metal atoms with small covalent molecules.   A determination of these   effects is important in controlling reactivities and understanding the   mechanisms involved in catalysis.",
