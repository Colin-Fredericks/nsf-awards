The American investigator is Ivan  Sag and the French investigators are Anne Abeille and  Daniele Godard.  The objective of  their research is to  develop a description of the syntax of the French language  as a standard reference point for scientific study and as a  basis for the development of French language processing  computer technology.  The proposed research on French syntax  will be carried out within a linguistic framework developed  by the Stanford University group.  The framework is known as  Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).    Dr. Sag brings to this collaboration his expertise in  linguistics and computational linguistics.  This is  complemented by the French investigators' expertise in  French language and grammar.  As part of a larger  international collaboration, the French project will advance  Dr. Sag's effort to test his model as a standard for a  computational grammar and will provide linguists with a  comprehensive description of French grammar.  ***",
