The laboratory  exercises involve the use of the Xenopus oocyte expression system  to study the function of specific membrane receptors and  voltage-activated channels.  Poly(A)+mRNA for brain proteins are  injected into Xenopus oocytes, and the oocytes are assayed for  expression of brain proteins.  Patch clamping is used to determine  whether the expressed proteins are functional in the oocyte system.    The proposed project is innovative in its interdisciplinary and  collaborative approach to undergraduate teaching, and in its use of  highly sophisticated molecular biological and biophysical  techniques in the undergraduate teaching laboratory.  Students  learn first hand how these techniques have been used to achieve a  new level of understanding of both development and neurobiology.  The laboratories are investigative, in that students must design  experiments based on their knowledge of receptors and channels and  then carry out those experiments using the oocyte expression  system.",
