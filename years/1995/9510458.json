The objective of the research that these GOALI Fellows will participate in is a methodology to characterize geometric variations of aluminum automotive space frames, and to transfer these discoveries into industrial practice for the development and production of all-aluminum automobiles.  The research tasks are to determine the appropriate manufactured part models for aluminum space frame extrusions, and to identify the appropriate tolerance methods for space frames.  Alcoa has identified researchers to work with the U of MD-Baltimore County team, and has committed experimental and software support for this project.   Results from this collaboration will allow better fits in the aluminum space frame design for automobiles, reducing weight and increasing fuel economy.  These results will make manufacture of these frames possible in quantities needed by the automobile industry.  ***",
