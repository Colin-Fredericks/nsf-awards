 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553614  Fox  Natural ecosystems are rarely  pristine, almost all are modified  by anthropogenic effects to varying  degrees. Human activities are  rarely treated as integral parts of  those systems, either in research  or training. Ecological communities  are structured by top-down and  bottom-up processes and  interactions between them; human  activities affect the same  ecological processes in similar  ways. The University of California  at Santa Cruz recently initiated an  interdepartmental,  multidisciplinary program of  research and training (the Monterey  Bay Regional Studies (MBRS) program  ) focused on basic understanding of  regional coastal processes and  their relation to specific regional  issues. The regional approach  provides a foundation for  integrating research and training  across different research scales  and traditions. Scientists from  different disciplines engage in  multidisciplinary studies to  examine complex environmental  processes. Recently hired new  faculty, high student interest and  new doctoral program have rapidly  increased our capacity to train  students, but limited funds for  their support restrict our ability  to reach our potential. The quality  and innovation of our program and  the established need for  multidisciplinary training programs  in environmental biology make a  strong case for support of this  proposal. A Graduate Research  Traineeship will allow us to expand  the MBRS training component  significantly, and to attract  students seeking a broader,  multidisciplinary foundation for  their research. GRT students will  participate in symposia,  discussions, seminars and research  in projects supported by MBRS. In  addition, we will develop a  graduate seminar course, student  seminars and an apprenticeship  program aimed to encourage  multidisciplinary awareness and  respect.",
