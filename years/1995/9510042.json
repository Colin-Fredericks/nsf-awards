They are unique among the large lakes of  the world in terms of their sensitivity to climatic change, their  rich and diverse populations of endemic species, their circulation  dynamics and water-column chemistry, and their long, continuous,  high-resolution records of past climatic change in the tropics.         A comprehensive study of the large African lakes is long  overdue.  Societal need for the sustainable utilization of these  important natural resources offers a compelling reason for  examination of biological food webs, water quality and past climate  variability in East Africa.  These scientific and societal issues  have stimulated the initiation of the International Decade for the  East African Lakes (IDEAL).  The scientific issues to be addressed  by IDEAL were conceived and discussed at the IDEAL Symposium on the  Limnology, Climatology and Paleoclimatology of the East African  Lakes, held in Jinja, Uganda, February 18-22, 1993.   Recommendations from this meeting resulted in the publication of  the IDEAL Science and Implementation Plan.         This award provides funds for further planning, logistical  management and workshops for the paleoclimate initiative within  IDEAL.  Funds will be used for meetings of the American Steering  Committee of IDEAL, coordination between the paleoclimate community  and the other scientific and training initiatives within IDEAL, and  coordination with European and African components of IDEAL.  ***",
