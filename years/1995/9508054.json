 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508054  Heinz      Under the direction of the PI, the University of Chicago will acquire a  neodymium-yttrium lanthanum fluoride (Nd-YLF) and C02 lasers,  associated stabilization equipment, new diamond anvil cells and a high  pressure gas loading apparatus. This equipment will both modernize and  add many necessary improvements to the diamond anvil laboratory at the  University for research in high temperature, high pressure mineral  physics.  The PI's research focuses on the accurate measurement of  melting curves for mantle and core minerals so as to constrain the  maximum temperature of the lower mantle and the temperature of the  inner-outer core boundary, a fundamental problem in the earth sciences.  In particular, the acquisition of a stable high power Nd-YLF laser will  enable detection of the enthalpy of fusion for Earth materials in the  laser-heated diamond anvils.  The acquisition of the CO2 laser will  enable this laboratory to make melting measurements with bmth types of  laser for intra and inter-laboratory comparisons with the goal of  resolving these differences. Since the lasers couple with solids in  different ways, the types of materials that can be studied is greatly  increased by having both types of lasers.  Finally, due to the  stability of the new lasers, it will be possible to interface with the  synchrotron source currently being commissioned at the Consortium for  Advanced Radiation Sources (CARS) sector of the Advanced Photon Source  (APS), Argonne National Laboratory.      ***",
