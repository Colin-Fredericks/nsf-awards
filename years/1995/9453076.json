The project, TECH TREK, is an  informal, out-of-school, technology-learning opportunity directed at middle school age Cadette  Girl Scouts and adult Girl Scout leaders.  In collaboration with the Maumee Valley Girl Scout  Council, COSI/Toledo, and SciMaTEC of the University of Toledo, WGTE seeks to design,  develop, test, and evaluate a model program offering week-long, hands-on experiences using the  staff, facilities and educational expertise of public radio and public television to provide science  and technology education for middle school Girl Scouts and Girls Scout leaders.  Bringing  particular expertise in the technology area of video and audio communications, WGTE is  collaborating with the Girl Scouts to develop a new approach to involving girls in technology,  which can be replicated inexpensively, nationwide, through public broadcasting stations and local  Girl Scout Councils.    During the first year of the project, 50 Girls Scouts and 15 Girls Scout leaders are to work on-  site with WGTE mentors, young professional women working in public broadcasting, who are  to: share their skills while demonstrating real life applications of their science and math  knowledge; provide the Scouts with career information; and guide the Scouts in hands-on video  and audio production activities.  Girl Scout leaders are to learn about gender equity issues in  science and technology education, and are to be trained to become advocates for encouraging  young women in further science study and careers, in addition to building basic audio and video  production skills which they can teach to others.  In the second year of the project, following  evaluation of the first year TECH TREK experiences, and fine-tuning of the curriculum, WGTE  is to prod uce and distribute a video conference and an audio bridge, as well as a \"how to\"  manual for Girl Scout Councils and public broadcasting stations to support the replication of  TECH TREK.  Through publicity, the staff is to recruit at least 50 stations and Girls Scout  Councils to replicate the Toledo program in their home communities, providing hands-on  technology learning experiences to about 500 Girls Scout leaders and 1,250 Cadette Girl Scouts  in the first year of the national \"roll-out\".  Thus, the project is designed to involve a new player,  public broadcasting stations, in the national infrastructure which offers scientific and technical  learning opportunities for women and girls.  It builds a new avenue for active collaboration  between Girl Scouts of USA and public broadcasting to use their educational and technological  resources to address a societal problem.  ***",
