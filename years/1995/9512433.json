 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes acquisition of instrumentation for image analysis  and an inverted microscope to provide three research teams with the  technological capability to rapidly and accurately analyze various  organismal and tissue parameters. The instruments requested are the  Leica Quantimet Q-500MC Image Analysis system with an Optronics Video  Camera, and an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope.  The projects proposed involve both faculty research and research  training primarily of undergraduates. The research experience is widely  used as a teaching tool in our department. The research activities  planned include a study of programmed cell death and cell cycle control  in plants, study of muscle cell development and culture in fish, and a  analysis of feeding behavior and movement in anostracans (fairy  shrimp). Activities of these projects involve making large numbers of  measurements from light and electron microscope data, analyzing  labeling density, position and/or intensity in protein localization  work, and assessing characteristics of organisms' three-dimensional  morphology as it relates to movement. Currently some of the  measurements required may be made by hand, other analyses are  impossible without the computer capability. Acquisition of the image  analysis system with archiving capability and the inverted microscope  will enable us to rapidly and accurately obtain and analyze the data  these studies require.",
