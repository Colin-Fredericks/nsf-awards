 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Scott   Anderson of the University of Utah will study the reaction dynamics of   simple polyatomic ions using reactant vibrational mode selection and high   resolution ion beam techniques.  Systems which will be investigated   include the reactions of water ions with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and   water molecules, and the reaction of nitrous oxide ions with carbon   monoxide molecules.  These studies will include the development of pulsed   field ionization techniques to produce vibrational state selectivity in   the reactant ions.  This work will advance the understanding of the   vibrational mode dependence of reaction mechanisms, and the manner in   which reactant energy is partitioned into product states.  This work is   expected to provide benchmarks for further theoretical work on these   systems.  The amount and nature of vibrational energy in a reactant molecule can   cause dramatic changes in the relative amounts of different products of    chemical reactions.  Professor Anderson's work will determine how this   vibrational energy will affect the products of several ion molecule   reactions.  The results of this work will provide information on methods   of controlling chemical reactions to produce a single product to the   exclusion of other unwanted products.",
