 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528710  Hong      To eliminate both the health problems and the environmental contamination of using conventional cutting fluid in the machining industry, a recent joint University-Industry research has led to an economical and practical cryogenic machining technology.  This new process, which is dry, clean, and neat, cools the cutting tool with super cold nitrogen.   By adopting a new cooling concept, \"manipulating the cutting temperature in the micro sense,\" the consumption of liquid nitrogen is minimized to a level at which the nitrogen costs less than conventional cutting fluid.  Temperature is a factor in changing materials properties.  The material properties at micro locations in the chip formation process, such as the primary shear zone, the formed chip, the friction zone, the bulk workpiece, the tool face, and the tool body, will be adjusted by varying the temperature to be the most favorable for the cutting process.  This project includes a material study of target workpiece and tool materials to determine the ideal temperature distribution to yield the optimum material behavior for specific operations.  The nozzle spray pattern, covering area, and liquid nitrogen flow rate are design parameters to adjust the temperature distribution.  By controlling the cooling pattern, the temperature distribution can be manipulated to the most desirable range.  Thermodynamic and heat transfer finite element analyses will be conducted to predict the temperature distribution of the specific cutting process.  The amount of liquid nitrogen needed to achieve the cooling to that temperature will be theoretically and experimentally determined.  The flowrate then can be controlled to the minimum amount to still be able to do the job; an intelligent control system will be developed for it.  The expected result of this approach is the most efficient machining and most economical nitrogen dispensing.      Cutting fluid plays a key role in the machining process.  Historically, cutting fluids have been optimize d primarily for the cutting efficiency but at the sacrifice of environmental concerns.  This has led to the need for innovative research such as cryogenic machining.  If it can be proven that the cutting efficiency can be improved while maintaining the current cutting fluid cost per part, the impact on the machining industry could be broad-based resulting in a market pull for this environmentally conscious manufacturing technology.",
