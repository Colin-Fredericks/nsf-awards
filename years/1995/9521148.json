 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten thousand years ago the global climate was highly dynamic and the vegetation of  North America was undergoing the most rapid reorganization of the post-glacial period. Spruce forests  that once dominated much of interior North America were decreasing in extent as the climate rapidly  warmed. One such forest was recently exposed by a mining company in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  The Gribben forest was buried in-place by glacial sediment and remains intact, with completely  preserved plant material, litter, humus layers, and soil profiles. Wood from this site was recently  radiocarbon dated at approximately 10,000 years old. The site is part of an active mining operation  and will be destroyed in the summer of 1995. The objectives of this exploratory research are to (1)  sample the buried trees, litter and soil, (2) answer fundamental questions about paleo-forest  composition, structure, growth and dynamics, and (3) archive samples and distribute data to the  broader scientific community so that this unique opportunity to understand a 10,000 year old forest  and its environment is not  lost to science.   This  Small Grant for Exploratory Research  will  provide a unique opportunity to learn about the composition, structure, and dynamics of forest  vegetation immediately after the glaciers receded from this area. The data will allow a direct test of  assumptions of much of the conceptual framework underlying forest ecology and paleoecology.",
