 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411574  Wen  This theoretical research will deal with strongly correlated  electron systems, one of the most important current problems in  condensed matter physics.  Strongly correlated electron systems  include high temperature superconductors, fractional quantum Hall  systems and mesoscopic devices.  Research will be conducted on a  variety of topics including: (1) the noise spectrum of tunneling  and transport of correlated electron systems in mesoscopic devices.   Better understanding of noise spectrum will increase our knowledge  of the response of mesoscopic devices at high frequencies.  The  noise spectrum is also a powerful probe of correlation dynamics.  (2) the relation between the fractional quantum Hall effect and the  dirty boson problem will be studied. (3) studies will be conducted  on the new class of non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states.   (4) in strongly correlated metals slow spin fluctuations in high  temperature superconductors will be compared to slow density  fluctuations in the fractional quantum Hall effect.  In particular,  the interaction between electrons and slow fluctuations yields  Cherenkov radiation.  A theory of this Cherenkov radiation will be  developed for these strongly correlated metals.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on a variety of topics  dealing with strongly correlated electron systems.  These systems  are one of the most challenging problems in contemporary physics.   Topics include the high temperature superconductors and the  fractional quantum Hall effect.  ***",
