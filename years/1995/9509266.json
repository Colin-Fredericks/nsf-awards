 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509266  Ko       In nucleus-nucleus collisions at relativistic  velocities, a piece of matter with temperature and density  similar to that in the early universe after the Big Bang and  the interior of neutron stars can be created.  In this  proposal, we shall investigate the properties of this hot  dense matter using both effective Lagrangians and models  that are based on the quantum chrodynamics.  In particular,  hadron masses and couplings at finite densities and  temperatures will be studied since they are expected to be  significantly modified in a medium.  Including these medium  effects in the relativistic transport model allows a  realistic description of heavy ion collisions at energies  available from present accelerators.  The study of dilepton  production from these collisions will then provide direct  information on the properties of the hot dense matter due to  the relatively weak interactions of dileptons in matter.  The production of strange particles will also be  investigated as they offer another promising probe of the  hot dense matter as a result of strangeness conservation.  Our long range goal is to extend the relativistic transport  model to include the quark and gluon degrees of freedom so  that one can describe nuclear collisions at future  relativistic heavy ion colliders in which a quark-gluon  plasma is expected to be formed in the initial stage. the  proposed study makes it possible to identify the existence  of the quark-gluon plasma and to study its properties.  ***",
