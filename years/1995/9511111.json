 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511111  Mortensen    This project extends and applies an aggregate model of income and  employment determination developed under the previous NSF grant  in three areas:  (1) fixed investment in job creation, vacancy  chains, and innovation; (2) wage determination and human capital   investment; and (3) the value and role of unemployment insurance.  The solution to the aggregate model is based on a new solution  concept called a recursive competitive search equilibrium that  combines the notion of equilibrium in a matching model of the  labor market with the concept of recursive competitive search  equilibrium.  The research contradicts the widely help view that   only imperfect competition in labor and/or product markets can  explain involuntary unemployment, sticky real wages and observed   employment volatility.  This new framework permits more accurate   quantitative estimates of the effects of labor market policy as  well as greater realism.      How human capital investment is shared in an environment with  transaction friction and turnover has long been a topic of debate  and study.  The new framework will be used to study such  questions as: Do bargaining mechanisms and other wage formation  institutions provide the information individuals need to invest  in a decentralized setting?  If so, what are the losses  associated with these institutions?  Under what conditions is  there a role for government intervention in the form of subsidies  to training and education?    The significance and potential importance of this new dynamic  general equilibrium framework and methods for the study of labor   market policy are shown by the attention paid to the strikingly  large estimates obtained under the previous NSF grant of the  effects of the payroll tax and the Unemployment Insurance (UI)  system on the U.S. unemployment rate.  A major problem with the  estimates of the dead weight losses attributable to UI, one  shared with virtually all the formal literature on the subject,  is that it accoun ts for distortions attributable to  moral  hazard  but does not include the  insurance  value of the UI  benefit because the model used in the analysis is one in which  agents are risk neutral.  The third part of this project  addresses the theoretical and computational problems in  estimating the value of UI insurance.",
