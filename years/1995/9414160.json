The  objective is to develop scientific understanding of the new phase-  coherent electronic transport expected to occur in such N-S  structures, and to test, for the first time, recently developed  theories which explain quantum transport in such structures.  The  PI will carry innovative design, fabrication, and transport  measurements of three N-S structures:  microjunctions, composite  wires, and multiply connected structures.  Important issues such as  interplay between the two types of phase coherence in N and S, and  its effects on the quantum transport will be invested.  The  research will either lead to novel quantum transport mechanism or  will modify that in mono-component structures.    % % %    Mesoscopic structures are obtained when the size of metallic  samples is reduced to submicron range.  In such systems, the  particle wave duality of the electrons plays an important role in  the transport of electrical current, and a new less understood  electronic mechanism emerges.  This research will investigate the  electronic transport in mesoscopic structures composed of a normal  metal and a superconductor, which are two states with sharply  contrasted electronic structures.  The PI will investigate the new  quantum electronic transport and provide test for new theories.   The research includes innovative design and fabrication of  microstructures, composites wire, and multiply connected normal-  superconductor structures, and transport measurements.  Research in  this area will benefit the continuing process of device  miniaturization and integration.  ***",
