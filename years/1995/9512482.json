 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to make a major improvement  in the quality and capability of instrumentation available  on campus for research and training in protein chemistry and  physics. The five items requested build on a base of  existing equipment and faculty acquired and supported by the  University over the last several years. As programs in the  natural sciences have developed in Nevada, there has been an  increasing amount of research and teaching involving  proteins and peptides, including molecular recognition and  protein/peptide interactions. This has put a heavy demand on  existing equipment used for protein analysis and accentuated  the need for protein technologies not yet available in  the State of Nevada. The proposed instruments will enhance  our capabilities in this area in three aspects:  (1) the  analysis of protein structure and macromolecular and protein-  ligand interactions (protein sequencer, MALDI-TOF mass  spectrometer, life time fluorescence spectroscopy), (2) the  visualization and interpretation of experimental data,  modeling of biopolymer conformation and receptor-ligand  interactions, hypothesis building, and engineering of  proteins (high capacity graphics workstation), and (3) the  chemical synthesis of peptides (peptide synthesizer).    The equipment requested will serve students and faculty in  the University of Nevada's growing undergraduate, graduate,  and postdoctoral training programs. The University has a  large undergraduate Biochemistry program; each Biochemistry  major is required to complete a year-long laboratory-based  thesis project. There are multi-departmental graduate  programs in Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology,  Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, and  allied fields which share faculty and resources. The  physical and/or chemical principles behind the requested  equipment are already taught in didactic courses for  graduate and undergraduate students. Availability of such  equipment on campus is an enormous b enefit in the training  of the next generation of researchers and technicians.    The equipment will be shared with members of five  departments and three interdisciplinary   graduate programs. The requested equipment would have an  immediate impact on (A) 35 faculty in Biochemistry, Cell and  Molecular Biology and allied areas, (B) 20 postdoctoral  fellows, (C) 56 graduate students in Biochemistry and Cell  and Molecular Biology and (D) 113 undergraduate biochemistry  majors. The greatest initial use will come from the 30  members of the major users' laboratories;  previous  experience on this campus with existing equipment has shown  that the demand will grow exponentially. Equipment such as  the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and peptide synthesizer will  quickly acquire users from students of at least ten other  faculty members.    Full funding of this proposal would permit a major increase  in both the quality and the quantity of training offered to  undergraduates, pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees. It  would permit exposure to technologies (time-resolved  fluorescence, peptide synthesis) not presently available on  campus and greatly enhance the availability of other  technologies (molecular modeling, peptide sequencing)  already present but being conducted on overloaded or  obsolete equipment.",
