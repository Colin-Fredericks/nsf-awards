In  plants, differentiated tissues and organ systems are defined early  in plant development and the occurrence of these differentiated  structures reflects the initial establishment of embryonic polarity  and subsequent differentiation of specific cell types. The body of  knowledge concerning the mechanisms of cell differentiation in  early plant embryogenesis is scant, in part due to difficulties in  accessing embryonic tissue in higher plants. The molecular basis of  polarity establishment and cell differentiation is being studied in  the brown alga, Pelvetia. In Pelvetia, eggs are abundant and easily  obtained. Unfertilized eggs are phenotypically apolar, but express  increasing asymmetry during the first cell cycle. The first zygotic  division gives rise to two distinct cell types with different  developmental fates. Experiments are being conducted to test the  hypothesis that mRNAs are segregated to different regions of the  developing Pelvetia zygote and are then unequally partitioned at  the first cell division. Subsequently, proteins translated from the  localized mRNAs determine the fates of the embryonic cells in which  they reside. Spatially localized mRNAs are being characterized to  determine how proteins from these mRNAs specify cell fate and to  determine how they get targeted to and localized in distinct  regions of the cytoplasm.  ***",
