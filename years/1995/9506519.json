 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estep       The investigator develops and implements accurate  approximation methods for differential equations using a  posteriori error estimates and adaptive error control.  The main  target is systems of reaction-diffusion equations.  Such problems  are important in practical terms because they occur as  mathematical models in applied science and engineering, including  applications in genetics, material science, chemistry, and  biology, among others.  The challenge is to compute accurate  approximations of solutions that generically include multiple  scales in their space and time behavior and whose behavior depends  strongly on parameters prescribed as part of the model.  Moreover,  using computation as a scientific tool requires an estimate of the  accuracy of the approximation.  The approach to these problems is  based on developing a posteriori error estimates that bound the  error in terms of computable information obtained from the  approximation once a computation is completed.  The analysis takes  into account both the difficulty of solving the differential  equation over a small interval and the global accumulation of  errors.  In particular, the stability properties of the solution  being approximated are measured by auxilary computations performed  during the approximation.  The result is robust and reliable  computational error estimates.  In addition, the investigator  examines the dynamical properties of numerical schemes in the  context of obtaining schemes with improved accuracy for a  specified problem and obtaining more accurate error estimates for  such schemes.  The third component of the project is the  development and implementation into code of adaptive error control  algorithms based on the a posteriori error estimates.  The ultimate  goal of this project is the public release of a parallel code that  can solve systems of reaction-diffusion equations in two and three  dimensions reliably and efficiently.       Mathematical models in applied science, including genetic s,  material science, chemistry, and biology, are often expressed as  nonlinear reaction-diffusion differential equations that contain  source terms balanced against terms that diffuse energy.  The goal  of such modelling is to describe the physical situation in terms  of the solution of the differential equation.  However, the  nonlinear nature of most models makes it impossible to solve the  equations explicitly; consequently numerical approximation is an  important tool in science.  This approach has its own difficulties.  The balance between reaction and diffusion is usually delicate and  difficult to handle accurately.  Moreover, solutions of such  problems typically evolve on several scales, i.e. some interesting  behavior occurs in very localized regions in space and time while  other behavior evolves over long times or over larger regions in  space.  The use of a uniform numerical discretization for a real  application results in huge computations that tax even the largest  computers.  The investigator aims to produce numerical schemes that  adapt themselves to the localized behavior of the target solution  so as to make the computations both as accurate as desired and as  efficient as possible.  Another benefit is that the estimate of the  accuracy can then be reported, which increases the scientific  level of numerical analysis.  The mathematical approach is develop  estimates of the error that use information obtained from the  approximation, which can then be used to adapt the discretization,  that is make the computations self-governing.  The investigator  also is implementing this theory in a code for parallel computers  that can solve very general problems with minimum user input.  The  intent is to make the code publicly available, yielding a  scientific tool that benefits the engineering and scientific  infrastructure.",
