Hoyt    The extension of the traditional dye streak visualization technique by using a \"continous\" string composed of shear thickening and drag reducing constituents will be investigated.  The proposed visualization method has applications in various flows where previous methods have limitations, such as unsteady flows, multiphase flow, large flow domain visualizations, turbulent diffusion and mixing.  The method will be calibrated for typical flow situations.  Then, various coherent turbulent structures and flow macrostructures will be investigated, such as flow through multiple cylinders, flow around a single cylinder near critical Reynolds number, and flow structures in turbulent boundary layer.  The project will be completed in collaboration and with the help of  the University of Bristol, where suitable experimental facilities are available to the P. I.    A special niche of application of the new method is in the complex flows where the streaklines have to be visualized.  The proposed method  provides an alternative to much more sophisticated and expensive techniques, and has unique features which can be exploited in various situations.  ***",
