 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brooklyn College of the City University of New York is developing,  enhancing, and disseminating an intensive, yet supportive, science  preparation sequence for urban preservice elementary teachers. For  the past five years college faculty from the four science  departments - Physics, Chemistry, Geology, and Biology - have  collaborated with the science education faculty to design and pilot  a constructivist-oriented set of science and science education  courses.  It is the purpose of this proposed project to consolidate  the successes of this preliminary program, to build upon pedagogic  discoveries, and to strengthen and disseminate a possible major  contribution to the nation's infrastructure in science.    In the early part of the three year project, curriculum is highlighted:  (1) Quantitative thinking is being developed as a systemic strand through  science courses; this involves the use of lab-based science instruction  as a way of teaching mathematics, and using mathematics as a way of  allowing active learning to extend beyond the bounds of lab and human  scales.  This project addresses the science and science education  courses.  The PI's are cooperating with colleagues concurrently working  on revision of the mathematics sequence for elementary education majors.   (2) Since teaching in the constructivist mode involves a major shift for  most faculty, the PI's are working to enhance consistency in teaching  throughout the science courses.  (3)  The science faculty are developing  a revised model for set-up of laboratory work, to allow for flexibility  and spontaneity in student activities.    In the latter part of the grant period, the PI's will prepare a book  about their experiences in devising a constructivist curriculum,  including discussion of pedagogical, scientific, philosophical, and  political issues.  In addition to curricular illustrations, the book will  demonstrate how faculty with traditional backgrounds can be encouraged,  motivated, and taught to develop teaching style s appropriate to  inquiry-based learning.",
