The workshop will identify questions, develop and refine hypotheses, critically examine assumptions underlying existing work in the field, and consider alternative research methodologies.  It will also identify key players in and establish links to the policy community.  The workshop will yield publishable papers that will set out the research agenda developed.  %%%%  This is a proposal for a three-day interdisciplinary workshop of leading scholars to develop a systematic program of research dealing with nontreaty mechanisms, that is, nonbinding legal accords, for dealing with important problems of international environmental or global change.
