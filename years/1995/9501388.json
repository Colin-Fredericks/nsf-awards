 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported under the Optical Science and Engineering   initiative in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Peter   Rentzepis of the University of California at Irvine will use picosecond   laser based x-ray and electron sources to probe the structures of   transients in the liquid and solid phases.  Specific problems to be   addressed include the mechanism of lattice distortion in metals and   semiconductors and studies of energy transfer from hot electrons to the   lattice.  Time resolved electron diffraction of gas phase species will be   used to investigate photodissociation and isomerization processes.  These   studies will make it possible to identify structures of ultrafast   intermediates and metastable ground state species by directly observing   bond and angle changes.  These techniques will have application in areas   such as protein and enzyme kinetics, molecular electronic devices, and   the physics of thermal transport in crystal lattices.  X-ray and electron diffraction studies have provided a wealth of   information concerning molecular structure.  Professor Rentzepis will use   ultrafast x-ray and electron pulses to probe, in real time, the   structural changes caused by optical excitation.  Basic phenomena such as   melting, crystallization, heat transport, and the transient structures   involved in primary events in chemical and biological systems will be   studied by means of this new technique.",
