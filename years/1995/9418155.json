 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418155  Chilton  The long-term goal of this project is to permit manipulation of  genes for biosynthesis of DIMBOA and DIBOA, pesticidal metabolites  of maize, to enhance protection of maize and possibly other crops.   To undertake such manipulation, all genes in the pathway,  especially regulatory genes, will be identified and cloned.  Screening of M2 seed from ems-mutagenized pollen has already  identified two mutations in enzymes of the pathway and one  regulatory gene.  The regulatory gene is being tagged by transposon  mutagenesis in preparation  for cloning.  Such a regulatory gene  could be of direct use in maize breeding.  Screening of ems-  mutagenized maize will continue.  Mutants, inducers, repressors or  varying expression during development will enable isolation of  \"high DIMBOA\" and \"low DIMBOA\" mRNA to be used in cDNA cloning.   Genes encoding at least three steps involving cytochrome P-450  oxygenases will be cloned by a PCR-based strategy using a redundant  primer deduced from the conserved haem binding site of P450s.   Transposon tagging will also be used to facilitate isolation of  genes of the two pathway steps not involving cytochrome P450.    Cloning of pathway and regulatory genes will lead to knowledge  permitting alteration of expression of genes that affect the level,  timing and plant parts in which DIMBOA is produced.  This should  enable better protection of maize and reduction in use of synthetic  pesticides.  %%%  DIMBOA is a low molecular weight metabolite synthesized at the time  of germination of corn seed.  It protects the young seedling from  predation by most insects, bacteria and fungi.  The internal  concentration of this natural pesticide decreases in the seedling  after the second week so that DIMBOA is no longer capable of  deterring attack by predators and pathogens such as corn smut,  stalk rot, corn rootworm, European corn borer and corn earworm.  It  is during the period of declining DIMBOA synthesis in the plant  that application of external, Synth etic fungicides and insecticides  is required to give high grain yield.  This project will identify and isolate the genes controlling  biosynthesis of DIBMOA using mutants blocked in various steps of  the biosynthetic pathway as well as DIMBOA-deficient mutants and  DIMBOA-overproducing mutants.  Characterization of the genes  controlling DIMBOA synthesis may permit development of strategies  to alter the concentration of DIMBOA, the location of DIMBOA within  the plant, or the life-stage during which DIMBOA concentration is  high in order to better protect the corn crop with its own internal  defense, and to reduce the amount of synthetic chemicals sprayed in  the field.  ***",
