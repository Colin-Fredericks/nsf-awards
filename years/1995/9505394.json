The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will provide partial support for a postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Thomas A. Bonasera to work with  Professor Bengt Roland Langstrom of Uppsala University PET  Centre in Sweden.  The initial ten months of research will  be supported by a Fulbright grant.  This award will allow  Dr. Bonasera to do a full year of research.    The purpose of this research project is to study the  radiochemical synthesis of carbon-11 labeled steroidal  androgen receptor ligands as potential imaging agents for  positron emission tomographic (PET) assessment of the  androgen receptor protein in men with prostate cancer.  Several androgen receptor ligands (steroids with high  affinity for the androgen receptor protein) will be  synthesized in the carbon-11 labeled form.  Some of them  will be labeled at two different positions with carbon-11.  The main objective is to develop efficient reaction  conditions for the carbon-11 radiolabeling of these  steroids, to optimize the reaction yields in each step of  the synthesis, and to select one or more of the ligands for  further future study as a PET imaging agent. ***",
