To bridge  this critical gap, this study will incorporate non-traditional educational  methods where students in an applied research environment will collaborate with  weather-sensitive user groups to develop and test relationship models.  This  project represents a model, to be developed and tested locally, which has great  potential for application at regional and national levels.    The goal of the research component of this project is to develop a broader  understanding of what types of climate information can be utilized by various  weather-sensitive users in decision-making processes relating to environmental  and commercial situations.  The goal of the education component is to create a  unique educational experience in a class room-laboratory setting where  undergraduate students in meteorology/geography can develop relationship models  through a collaborative process with those employed in weather-sensitive agencies  and firms.    In the research activity, the P.I. will identify, through an intensive literature  search and by interviews with users of climate information, the needs of weather-  sensitive user sector groups for climate information.  The principal investigator  will work with the National Weather Service and the Midwestern Climate Center to  assess the adequacy of available climate data and information to meet the needs  of these user groups.  Based on the data obtained he will develop climate-effect  relationship mod els and disseminate them to weather-sensitive users and  climatologists.    The education plan will involve course research projects, where students under  the P.I.'s supervision will work hand-in-hand with users in government agencies  and in the private sector to develop and test the computer-based models that will  relate climate information to environmental and economic applications.  Students  will receive research experience and important job training, i.e., where the  students applies the educational experience developed in class room-laboratory  settings to address problems similar to those they may encounter after  graduation.    Developing continual information flow between climatologists and weather-  sensitive users will assist applied climatologists by identifying the types of  climate information that will be incorporated into decision models.  This linkage  will also help direct the research focus of climatologists as they develop their  careers.  Furthermore, it is critical that meteorology department expand their  curriculums to include such course(s) that will provide not only exciting  opportunities to understand the theoretical background associated with climate  but also to apply it in a real world situation.  These applications would be  facilitated by partners from outside the university in government agencies and  private sector positions.",
