 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508671    The  relationship between seasonal and regional patterns  of  precipitation  and the use of those water inputs  by  plants  has ramifications at several levels and time scales that are  of  both  basic  and  applied interest.   Identification  of  measurements  that  can provide quantitative  assessment  of  specific  water use patterns (that is, use of  precipitation  versus   groundwater)  by  plants   would   make   a   major  contribution  to  understanding  that  relationship.    This  research will test the hypothesis that stable isotope  ratio  analysis  of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes at natural  levels  in  wood  will provide that information, at both  short-term  and  long-term  scales.  Its goal is to develop,  test,  and  apply  quantitative  models of the  factors  that  influence  isotope  ratios of cellulose in tree rings.  The  tree  ring  information will allow reconstruction of seasonal and annual  patterns  of  water use and humidity conditions  during  the  growing season over the life of the tree.  The model will be  developed through laboratory experiments using four  species  of  trees common in the western United States.  It  will  be  tested  through  field observations at sites chosen  because  they  differ in water sources and humidity conditions.   The  model  will then be used to reconstruct the history of water  use   (precipitation   versus  ground  water),   atmospheric  humidity  (leaf  to  air gradients) and relative  water  use  efficiency  (through carbon isotope discrimination)  by  the  four  species  in  Utah from seedling establishment  through  maturity.   Once quantitative, mechanistic models  of  tree-  ring  isotope ratios are developed, they can be  applied  to  unraveling   historic  patterns  of  seasonal  precipitation  across the landscape, sensitivity of physiological processes  to  changes in moisture sources and humidity, and aspects of  water relations that contribute to the long-term changes  in  tree  community  structure.  This r esearch  will  allow  for  scaling  of  physiological  parameters  from  individual  to  landscape  levels  and will provide a  direct  link  between  physiology  and global-level studies of biosphere-atmosphere  interactions.",
