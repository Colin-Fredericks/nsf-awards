 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508799  Cramb    This award provides partial financial support for a U.S. - Japanese  Seminar on Clean Steels for the twenty first Century, which is  being held in April 1996 in Japan.  This seminar will allow a free  exchange of information, extensive discussions, and opportunities  to promote international collaborative research.  This is the  fourth joint seminar in a series.  The other seminars were held in  1976, 1983, and 1991.  The main theme of the seminar is future  production of defect-free steel via near net shape processing that  is environmentally benign.  This theme is a radical departure from  the past the featured smoke stacks and air pollution.  University  scientists and engineers will be strongly encouraged to interact  with industrial participants on topics such as new iron production  techniques, new casting process, recycling of dust and sludge, and  economic impacts of recycling and environmental issues.    This topic has its roots in fundamental research, and the  information needed to change the infrastructure of steel making via  environmental benign processes is often proprietary.  This seminar  will promote free exchange of fundamental information on generic  problems that are precompetitive in nature.  These topics are of  major interest in industry and academia on both countries.    The Program Manager recommends Carnegie Mellon University be  awarded $14,000 for 18 months.",
