 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  This ethnographic and historical study of science  curriculum, policy, and their relationship describes and analyzes  the science that schools actually teach, and how, in what  circumstances, and with what private and public consequences  diverse constituents in and around public schools struggle to  define it.  It takes as its specific case, \"integrated science,\" a  key component in state and national systemic reforms aimed at  redefining the traditional \"layer-cake curriculum.\"  The locus for  the research is two comprehensive high schools in one of southern  California's largest school districts, and the policy arena in the  state.  The study will provide a comprehensive model of school  science, its politics, and its place in the broader scientific  culture that defines modern American culture.  By providing readers  the concrete and conceptual resources to understand school science  in the research sites and to recognize comparable findings in other  studies and schools that they know, the project is designed to  foster public deliberation about high school science.",
