 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410967  Weggel  The Department of Civil & Architectural Engineering at  Drexel University will purchase a water-wave generation/data  acquisition system which will be dedicated to support  research in coastal engineering.  The equipment will be used  for basic coastal engineering research on waves, coastal  processes and coastal structures in Drexel's existing 2-D  wave flume.  Initially, the research will focus on studies  of cross-shore sand transport under beach-building waves and  on the onshore transport of nearshore bars such as might be  constructed as beach nourishment by bottom dump dredges.  This research is important for the economic design of beach  nourishment projects and for the evaluation of their  performance.    Subsequent studies will address the functional performance  of coastal structures including the sand-structure  interaction of perched beach structures (nearshore sills)  and seawalls.  Sand transport through rubble-mound  structures by wave agitation and the presence of a sand  level gradient across the structure will also be  investigated.    The wave generation system will include active wave  absorption to reduce the re-reflection of waves from the  generator paddle so that 2-D studies of beach profile  evolution in the presence of structures can be conducted.  ***",
