 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416551   Olson     The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake a project  to develop an instrument to analyze the optical properties (light  scattering and fluorescence) of individual microscopic particles in  situ and unattended, using established techniques of flow  cytometry.  The long-term goal is to develop an automated, moored  (eventually profiling) monitor for the optical characteristics of  phytoplankton and other microscopic particles in the euphotic zone  of the ocean.  The instrument will have resolution and sampling  rates comparable to a laboratory flow cytometer, but  will be  simple and small enough to be operated unattended for months at  sea, with on board processing/storage of data.  Developments  allowing this instrument to now be practicalinclude low-power-  consumption solid state lasers providing enough power to allow  fluorescence measurements of single phytoplankton cells, and  artificial neural network systems to cope with the large amounts of  data from multiparameter analyses of individual particles.  To  increase reliability, it is proposed to use a simple ducted flow to  replace the mechanically complex hydrodynamic sample stream  focusing of conventional flow cytometers. To use this simple flow  system will require the ability to recognize and reject signals  from particles passing through the edges of the excitation spot.   This can be achieved by use of excitation optics that produce a  unique signal shape for particles passing through the optimum  region.  Such an instrument will allow oceanographers to obtain  both the high resolution data necessary for understanding such  basic features of natural communities as diet patterns in phyto-  plankton cell growth and division and zooplankton grazing, and the  extended sampling necessary for resolving important but infrequent  events in the ocean.",
