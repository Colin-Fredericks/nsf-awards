 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, John   Moore and John Tossell of the University of Maryland will investigate the   processes involved in electron-molecule collisions.  Such processes   include: dissociative electron attachment, yielding a radical and a   negative ion; direct dissociation, resulting in two radicals; dipolar   dissociation, resulting in the simultaneous production of a positive and   a negative ion; and dissociative ionization, yielding an ion and a   radical.  The project involves both experimental and theoretical   characterization of such processes as they occur in the gas phase as well   as on surfaces.  Systems chosen for study include halocarbons,   halosilanes, halogenated alkenes, and halofluorocarbons.  These   precursors and their products are thought to be crucial in understanding   the chemistry involved in plasma reactors such as those used for plasma   etching and in the fabrication of semiconductor devices.  An electrical discharge in a gas creates an electron-rich environment   which induces chemical changes in normally unreactive gases.  This highly   charged mixture is known as a plasma, and the chemical reactions taking   place are termed plasma chemistry.  Such reactors have found widespread   use in the semiconductor industry for fabrication of both materials and   devices.  This research will provide detailed information on the nature   of the species involved in such reactions, as well as fundamental   knowledge of their reactions.",
