 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research being done if to devise a set  of  techniques and tools that will allow improvement, simplification,  and  clustering of polygonal datasets within a unified framework.  This is an  important first step towards the long-term objective  of formulating techniques  to enable interactive visualization of  complex virtual environments.    The  techniques being used to solve the above problems are al  based on the notion of  `rolling a sphere`, formalized by the  concept of a-hulls.  For improving the  existing polygonal  datasets that have cracks and small missing polygons the  intuitive idea is to roll a sphere that will fill-up these minor  holes.Such  flaws are common in present-day datasets and no  general techniques are  currently known that will handle them in a  unified manner.    Simplification of  polygonal objects will be achieved through  simplifying the genus of the  objects.  This provides a natural  extension to, and is orthogonal to, the  existing techniques for  creating topology-preserving multiresolution  hierarchies.  The  research being done will remove topological features that are  less than a user-specificable size.    Clustering of polygonal datasets is of  considerable use in  devising efficient methods for solving global illumination  and  visibility preprocessing for interactive walkthroughs of  synthetic  environments.  This research will accomplish clustering  of polygons in a  dataset by using sufficiently large rolling  spheres.    The goal of the  educational activities being done is to expand  the current  entertainment-oriented view of virtual reality by  presenting it as a useful  tool for serious tasks in engineering,  science, and medicine.  The activities  include attempts to reach  out to the high-school students, undergraduates, and  the  community at large through slide-and-video shows and hands-on  demonstrations of the scientific applications of virtual  environments.  The  activities also include the creation and  development of a  new graduate-level  course on virtual  environments.  The tools and techniques developed for the  research component of this project will be used to impart a hands-on education  to inculcate a feel for application-oriented  research and development work in  virtual environments.",
