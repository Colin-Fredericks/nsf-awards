Issues  in microbial diversity that require particular attention are  the following.  How should microbial diversity be measured?  How should taxonomic studies of poorly known phyla be  encouraged?  What activities are most important to assess?  How can microbiologists coordinate their research activities  with botanists and zoologists?  What new technologies can be  developed to enhance our study of microbial diversity?  The  meeting will bring together a highly select group of  microbial biology scientists, including at least five  botanists and zoologists also involved in biodiversity.  The  inclusion of botanists and  zoologists in these discussions  will help build necessary bridges between these two sets of  disciplines and microbiologists.  In addition, several  European scientists will also be included in the proceedings  who are participating in ongoing efforts in microbial  diversity funded by the International Union of Biological  Sciences and the European Economic Community. The objective  of the colloquium is to develop a white paper report with an  in-depth analyses of these important issues in biodiversity  studies and with recommendations for a future plan of  action.   The final report and recommendations of the  proceedings will be published and disseminated to the  microbiological community,  to industry, to policy makers  who have concerns about biodiversity, and to the appropriate  federal and international agencies.  ***",
