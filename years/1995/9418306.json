 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418306  Butler      This award will partially support travel and communications  expenses for Dr. Mark J. Butler of the Department of  Biological Sciences at Old Dominion University in Norfolk,  Virginia, to enable him to make a six month stay at the   New Zealand Oceanographic Institute in Wellington,  New Zealand to conduct cooperative research with   Dr. Alistair MacDiarmid.  The research will focus on  field and laboratory experimentation to test hypotheses  concerning recruitment and sustainable resource use of  spiny or rock lobsters in the coastal waters of New Zealand and  the Florida Keys.    The research will initiate investigations of the potential  factors limiting recruitment of the common New Zealand  spiny lobster and compare results with similar studies of the  Caribbean lobster. The study will also consider the effects of  male size on mating success and fertilization rates in  populations of spiny lobsters that differ in size due to heavy   exploitation.  This proposal is part of a joint request for  activity under the U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Science Program.  The reciprocal visit to the United States by Dr. MacDiarmid will  occur in early 1996 and is to be supported through the  New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and Technology.",
