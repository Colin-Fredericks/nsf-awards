The brain is one target tissue of steroids, where they regulate neuronal function.  Most of the steroids present in the brain originate from gonads and adrenals.  However, recent studies, including those of Dr. Papadopoulos, demonstrated that some brain structures have the ability to synthesize specific steroids which could directly and locally regulate brain function.  These studies are to:  1) investigate where and when steroid synthesis occurs in the brain, 2) find out which steroids are synthesized by different brain structures, and 3) examine how brain steroid synthesis is regulated.  For these studies rats of different ages, from fetus to adult will be used.  Once the most active steroid producing brain cell populations are localized, various factors known to control brain function will be examined to determine whether these factors could also regulate neuro-steroid synthesis.",
