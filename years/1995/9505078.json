Its focus is materials which  undergo martensitic and magnetic phase transitions, with particular  application to shape memory and giant magnetostrictive materials. The theories  and computational methods under development by the authors will be applied to  the design of new actuator materials and composites. The authors propose to  design a composite that exhibits a strong two way shape memory effect, design  small scale, large-force actuators with low hysteresis, and formulate a  strategy for finding a magneto-memory material, a material which would combine  the most useful aspects of a shape memory (large strain) and magnetostrictive  (actuated by a magnetic field) material. The quantitative description of these  phenomena rests in the framework of nonlinear analysis, in particular within  the context of non-convex potentials whose equilibria are highly oscillatory  across widely varying length scales. Innovative numerical methods and codes  will be developed to compute the dynamics of complex microstructure in  response to a variety of environmental changes.   Active materials, that is,  materials whose structure transforms dramatically when subjected to external  stimuli like heat or electromagnetic fields, have enormous potential for use  as actuators and sensors across the spectrum of technology, from aerospace to  communications to medicine. This project addresses basic research directed  toward the improvement and optimization of these materials and the discovery  of new ones. The interplay between their microstructure and macroscopic  properties is fundamental to their exploitation and the study of these  properties leads to the frontiers of nonlinear theory, nonlinear analysis, and  scientific computation. The interdisciplinary training of graduate students  and postdoctoral associates is an integral part of this project.",
