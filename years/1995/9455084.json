 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is designed to provide undergraduate computer science  faculty with material and techniques for introducing the social and  ethical impact of computing in their courses.  The primary focus is  on a set of tutorials presented by Dr. Judith Perrolle, a  nationally known expert in the field.  To provide the participants  with an effective method for introducing the material in the  classroom, each tutorial is followed by having the participants  design exercises in reinforcing the material in a cooperative  learning context.  The participants are oriented to the many  sources--books, periodicals, groups--available.  A separate video  component emphasizes the value of video in such courses.  The  workshop is scheduled for June 19-23, 1995, on the Bradford Campus  of the University of Pittsburgh.  A follow-up session, two days  long, where the participants meet to exchange experience and  materials on how they have introduced this material in their  courses, will be held in June, 1996.",
