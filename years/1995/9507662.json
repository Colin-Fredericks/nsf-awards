 "awd_abstract_narration": "van der Merwe    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Nikolaas van der  Merwe will analyze bone, muscle and hair tissue from pigs which  have been raised on 14 different controlled diets. These  materials will be obtained from animals raised at the USDA  Agricultural Research Service in Beltsville Maryland and Dr. van  der Merwe will analyze the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in  amino acids in both dietary items and pig tissue. The goal of the  research is to study biochemical routing from dietary components  to consumer tissues at the amino acid level. The diets are  designed to identify the dietary components used in the synthesis  of pig protein tissues, particularly where more than one protein  source (animal and/or plant) is available. Dietary items have  been chosen for their characteristic stable carbon isotope  characteristics, depending on whether the plant foods have a C3  or C4 photosynthesis or the animal proteins are derived from such  plants. The food items and pig tissues will be separated into  constituent amino acids and their isotope ratios measured to  model the relevant biochemical pathways.    The long-term goal of the study is to reconstruct past human  diets through the isotopic analysis of archaeological human  skeletons. This procedure has been in use for more than fifteen  years and has had a major impact on the understanding of past  human subsistence and processes. However contradictions between  isotope data and other evidence suggest that the relationship  between the dietary importance of a food and the isotopic signal  in consumer bone tissue is not linear. It appears for example  that protein dominates in the construction of consumer collagen,  while bone carbonate averages the carbon from the total diet. The  work on pigs will help to refine this biochemical model and allow  improved  application to archaeological materials.    This research is significant for a number of reasons. It will  help to refine a technique which is widely used in archaeo logical  research and which has potentially wide application in  nutritional and metabolic studies as well. The work will increase  our understanding of how past populations made use of their  environment.",
