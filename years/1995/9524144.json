 "awd_abstract_narration": "9524144  Stratospheric ozone loss, resulting primarily from chemicals  generated  by  human  activities, results  in  an  increased  amount  of solar ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the earth.  Ultraviolet-B  radiation is capable of  damaging  biological  systems,  including DNA. Only a modest amount  of  research,  however,  has been directed toward the potential  biological  consequences of stratospheric ozone depletion, and virtually  nothing   has   been  done  at  the  level  of   terrestrial  ecosystems.   This research is an ecosystem-level  study  of  the responses to elevated solar ultraviolet-B resulting near  Ushuaia,  Argentina.   The site is on the  southern  tip  of  South  America  across the Drake Passage from the  Antarctic  Peninsula.  This location experiences more pronounced  ozone  reduction   than  at  anywhere  else  in  the  world   where  terrestrial  ecosystems with appreciable plant cover  occur.  Three  phenomena  contribute to this: The  so-called  \"ozone  hole\"  can pass directly overhead, parcels of ozone-depleted  air  can  float northward from the ozone hole, and a general  erosion  of  the  ozone  layer is  most  prominent  at  high  latitudes  and  in the Southern Hemisphere.   At  the  study  site, extremely high fluxes of ultraviolet-B can occur  when  skies  are  clear and, when cloudy, there can be  very  high  ultraviolet-B relative to total solar radiation. Thus,  this  will  be  an extreme case study to determine ecosystem-level  effects  of  ozone reduction.  A three-year,  on-site  field  study  of a shrub-grass community will be conducted. Effects  of  elevated  ultraviolet-B will  assessed  for  both  acute  exposures,  such as when the ozone hole passes overhead  and  as  chronic,  growing-season and multi-season  exposures  to  elevated ultraviolet-B.  For responses to acute exposures to  high   ultraviolet-B  and  high  ultraviolet-B/(total  solar  radiation) ratios, damage to DNA and photosynthesis will  be  determined.  Acute exposures will be  studied both as natural  events  (tracking  the  precession  of  the  ozone  hole  by  downloading satellite-based images and anticipating overhead  passage) and by simulating such occurrences with special  UV  lamp  systems.   Most  of the effort  will  be  directed  to  effects of chronic exposures at the population level  (e.g.,  reproduction   and   expansion  or  contraction   of   plant  populations)  and at the ecosystem level.  Researchers  will  determine  changes  in  competitive balance  among  species,  timing  of  annual biological events, plant  consumption  by  insects,  and  decomposition  of  plant  litter.   If  solar  ultraviolet-B affects such ecosystem-level processes,  there  are  many  implications for the function  and  integrity  of  these  systems.  Preliminary evidence collected recently  in  Argentina  shows large effects of sunlight ultraviolet-B  on  DNA  damage, plant growth and insect herbivory.  Changes  in  litter decomposition may affect ecosystem carbon balance and  atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Knowledge of  the  direction and magnitude of such changes is essential  if  we  are  to  predict  the  biological consequences  of  changing  atmospheric   chemistry  and  develop  rational   management  strategies.",
