 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will: determine variables important to quality control of DNA sequencing such as error dependency on sequence content; design optimal testing protocols and sampling plans for assessing precision and accuracy of DNA sequencing laboratories; and develop methods for predicting insertion and deletion errors (frameshifts) in sequence data. The power of statistical tests will be studied using results for sequencing combinatorially designed, synthetic DNA fragments. This investigation will be based on theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and on data provided through our collaboration with the Yeast Genome Center at Stanford University.  The growing use of DNA sequence data in research,  databases, diagnostic and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation requires that the quality of data being used by objectively assessable. The proposed research addresses the following problems associated with sequence data:  the inability to associate consistent, quantitative error rate estimates with sequence data; the concomitant lack of quality control on the sequence data; and the inability to make informed decisions balancing cost per base of different methods (or laboratories) against the relative stringency of quality requirements imposed on different sequencing tasks.",
