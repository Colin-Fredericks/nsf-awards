 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415543  Childress          This research is directed at testing the hypothesis  that the remineralization of oceanic carbon by micronekton  and zooplankton is a significant fraction of the oceanic  carbon budget.  This will be carried out by applying the  data on metabolic patterns to a midwater animals biomass  dataset which has been collected in the California Current  in a 4100 m water column and  using the metabolic data to  estimate respiratory carbon flux due to this community and  its major components.  The research effort will focus on  improved biomass estimates for gelatinous animals, improved  estimations of metabolic rates at the low oxygen partial  pressures found in midwater oxygen minimum layers, and  collection of data from rarer and more fragile species.       The significance of this research is tied to the  importance of understanding the immense, global midwater  ecosystem.  An ecosystem which interacts extensively with  the surface communities, but about which we know relatively  little.  The midwater fauna (including both micronekton and  zooplankton) is a major factor in the flux of material  through the water column as a result of vertical migration,  predation on vertical migrnats, feeding on sedimenting  materials and production of  biomass and feces at depth.  The respiratory oxidation of organic compounds at depth by  this fauna is potentially a significant component of the  carbon flux in midwater.  To understand the importance of  this assemblage of organisms in the economy of the ocean and  in global carbon cycles, it is essential to obtain  information on the rates of biological processes carried out  by this fauna.",
