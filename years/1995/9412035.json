 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyung Kim of Carnegie Mellon University is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical   studies of charge shift processes in solution.  He will study   solute-solvent electronic structure variation with a fluctuating   nonequilibrium solvent environment and it's effect on charge shift   processes.  A novel quantum chemical method will incorporate the   solute-solvent electron correlation within a dielectric continuum solvent   description.  An improved solvent coordinate description, which properly   accounts for solvent response to variations in the solute geometry during   reaction, will also be developed.  The theory will be applied to the   first singlet electronic transition in formaldehyde, dissociative   electron attachment, ultrafast excited-state electron transfer and   state-dependent rotational dynamics in solution.  Excellent theories are now available for understanding gas phase chemical   reactions involving binary encounters between molecules.  However, most   chemical reactions of technological importance occur in condensed phases   consisting of reacting solutes dissolved in non-reacting solvents.  The   effect which the solvent has on chemical reactions, and theoretical   methods for dealing with this complex interaction are still very much in   their infancy.  Nevertheless, progress in this area of research can have   an important long range impact on our fundamental understanding of   chemical reactions of industrial significance.  Kim's research is helping   to provide a theoretical basis for the interpretation of solvent effects   on chemical reactions in condensed phase systems.",
