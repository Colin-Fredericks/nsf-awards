 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose the development of an Applied Learning Institute  which would be the focal point for advanced technical education and  applied academic research and development for the Rocky Mountain  front range.  Such an institute would function as a catalyst for  updating curricula, would test new instructional techniques, and  provide training for instructors in these methodologies while  interfacing with industry to keep abreast of workforce  requirements.  The Institute would combine the resources of Front  Range Community College, Colorado State University School of  Occupational and Educational Studies, and local secondary  institutions in the integration of academic, technical, and  workplace skills, the use of instructional technologies, and the  implementation of innovative instructional methods.  The initial  project will focus on the electronics technology program.   Multi-media instruction and laboratory experiences equivalent to  1200 contact hours of traditional instruction will be developed.   Innovative, competency-based instruction that utilizes a  combination of pedagogical (task-oriented) and andragogical  (student-oriented) methods will be designed into small modules.   These modules will be used to develop career pathways based upon  student career choices.  This will increase flexibility and enhance  customization and/or modification.  They also promote  transportability, as modules may be used off-campus or even at  secondary institutions.  Multi-media techniques support consistency  and flexibility of instruction and delivery.  Results, techniques,  and modules will be shared through publications and conference  presentations.",
