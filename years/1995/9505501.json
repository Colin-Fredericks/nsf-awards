 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials   Research, Schwartz and Bernasek will study the preparation and structural   elucidation of interfaces between oxided metal or metal oxide surfaces   and organometallic complex-derived overlayers.  This research combines   aspects of organometallic chemistry and surface science.  Methods will be   developed for activation of surfaces of conductors or insulators by   introduction of -OH groups.  The reaction of metal atoms or   organometallic complexes with these surface groups will be studied and   contrasted with solution analogs.  It will be possible to create various   types of mixed overlayers in specific and reproducible ways. These   interfacial layers will covalently bond between components of the   composite.  Investigations will be performed in parallel on bulk oxide or   nitrogen analog substrates under ambient and ultra-high vacuum using   single crystal supports.  The use of characterizable single crystal   materials will enable an investigation of the precise nature and extent   of covalent interaction between the overlayer and the surface of the   support.  %%%  Development of methodology for synthesis of surface-bound species, and   application of surface analytical techniques to analogous bulk and film   supports, will augment our understanding of materials synthesis and   interface structure at the microscopic level. Such information forms a   basis for understanding mesoscopic physical and chemical interfacial   properties of increasing importance as electronics and optoelectronics   components become smaller and more complex.",
