 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improvement in the quality of education in geophysical  exploration of the shallow subsurface is realized through the  acquisition of up-to-date remote-sensing geophysical  instrumentation.   This equipment is used initially in the  development of an environmental geophysical field site and  subsequently is integrated into the geologic field courses.    This new site provides an area where students can be taught  geophysical and hydrological techniques within a controlled  environment.   The geology department teaches inquiry-based  science courses with the main objective of problem solving.   The  new instrumentation enables the faculty to upgrade geophysical  instruction in the introductory and upper-division courses as  well as student research programs.   The new equipment includes   (1) a proton precession magnetometer with a gradiometer, (2) a  12-channel hammer seismic unit, (3) an electrical resistivity  unit, (4) a ground penetrating radar system with antennae, (5)  water wells for monitoring purposes, (6) a portable generator,  and (7) a computer system with plotter.   With this new  equipment, the department is able to instruct students in modern  remote-sensing techniques including computer-assisted data  interpretation and analysis.   Additionally, students can,  through courses and research, obtain the technological skills  needed to address current human impact on the environment.",
