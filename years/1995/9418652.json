The crater produced by this event is believed to be  between 165 km and 280 km in diameter.  As such, it is one of the  largest impact structures recognized on Earth and its study offers  important contributions to the understanding of large-body impact  and to disciplines ranging from research of carbonate platforms to  the evolution of the continental crust.         Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) has undertaken  a shallow drilling program to recover continuous core samples of  the basin fill deposits and underlying impact breccias.  More than   1000 m of core have been recovered from five wells located along  the flanks of the basin.  These samples will permit a more precise  estimate of the size and shape of the basin, and will constrain the  rate and nature of its infilling through the Cenozoic.  Samples of  the underlying breccias are critical for estimating the types and  proportions of rocks involved in this impact event and evaluating  its environmental effects.  These samples also provide an important  resource for additional investigations and will be available to the  international science community.         This project focuses on two scientific goals:  (1)  Derive the  basic Cenozoic stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental framework for  the Chicxulub basin based on these new core samples, augmenting the  existing information in Pemex cores and well logs.  This  information will provide important new insights into the shape of  the Chicxulub basin and the geological and paleontological  evolution of the southern Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan Platform.    (2)  Evaluate impact breccias from two core localities in terms of  lithological characteristics, depths, evidence of reworking, et c.   Each of these sites corresponds to a proposed basin rim location.   Consequently, how deep these breccias are located below the present  surface and what they are composed of will provide tests for  current basin models including size and shape of the final basin  and the original excavation crater.  These breccias will also aid  in constraining the proportions of target materials excavated and  heated in the Chicxulub impact event and help constrain the  magnitudes of potential killing mechanisms such as ocean  acidification, global cooling, or greenhouse warming due to  vaporization of sulfates or carbonates.  ***",
