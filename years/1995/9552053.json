The objectives are:  more expeditious use of laboratory time,  timely feed-back about the quality of data being gathered,  opportunities to engage in \"what if\" exploration of the laboratory  information, and broadening of student experience beyond the  familiar use of computers while retaining the familiar  approachability of the personal computer.         Methods already used in our laboratories in the instruction of  science majors are being extended to non-majors.  All beginning  chemistry students, majors and non-majors alike, have the benefit  of computer-assisted data gathering and manipulation, affecting  approximately half of their laboratory experiences in newly  constructed laboratory facilities designed explicitly for this  purpose.  Data collection is being done using the Labworks  interface, using \"scripts\" easily understood and constructed by the  experimenter.  Computer-generated report guidance reflects  students' own tasks of data manipulation and also announces  measures of the quality of the individual data set.",
