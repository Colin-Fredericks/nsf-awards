 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  workshop  addressed issues in building problem solving    environments (PSEs)  for partial differential equation (PDE) based  applications   and, more  concretely, initiating a development of a  set of common   community standards for  the components of scaleable  PDE libraries.  There is no   natural forum for  establishing such  standards and yet they are essential to   progress in building  PSEs  for PDE based applications. The size and complexity of   these  software  systems require that builders be able to use components    developed by other  groups.    The results of this workshop are of three types:   (1) A  proceedings which compiles the material presented at the    workshop, (2) a  workshop overview paper to be submitted to IEEE    Computational Science and  Engineering, and (3) A series of  smaller follow-on meetings   of a group of five  to ten people who  will specify, analyze, and propose   community standards for  components of scalable PDE libraries.  These standards, will    build on existing  standards from sub-areas such as linear algebra  (ScaLAPAK)   and parallel  computing (e.g., HPF, MPI).",
