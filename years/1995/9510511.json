The Center for Statistics in Science  and Technology (CSST) is anewly-formed research and training  center at U.C. Davis, whose purpose is to support and  facilitate interdisciplinary research and graduate training  involving statistics and related areas of mathematical  sciences together with physical, biological, and  earthsciences.  The initial faculty membership includes  statisticians, researchers in continuous and combinatorial  optimization methods, and researchers from other scientific  areas (Geology and Toxicology) in which there are existing  collaborations.  Other investigators will be included in the  Center as it develops, and as its interdisciplinary  activities increase.        The establishment of CSST was prompted by the  observation that, increasingly, successful attacks on  scientific problems involve cooperation between  investigators with different specializations.  A  particularly attractive type of collaboration is between  mathematical scientists, and researchers in areas of  application of mathematical methods.  A major activity of  the Center under this project will be to support graduate  students in statistics and related areas of the mathematical  sciences to work on interdisciplinary  projects with  geosciences, toxicology, and other scientific areas.  This  is important because the ability to work in such cross-  disciplinary partnerships is an attribute highly valued both  in university and industrial settings, and because the  skills needed to contribute to such teams do not develop of  themselves, but need to be consciously nurtured as a part of  graduate education.  Other activities  of CSST under this  project will be to conduct seminars and symposia,  and  provide a computational facility for cross-disciplinary  research projects using equipment previously acquired with  NSF and NIH support.",
