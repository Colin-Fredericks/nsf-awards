 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant has as a goal the investigation  of  algorithmic and graph theoretic properties of hierarchical  distributed  systems; i.e., systems with underlying tree  architectures.  A major part of  this study is based on a novel  and universal technique for finding optimal  hierarchical  communication systems, applicable to different computational  models.  This method is based on a general purpose algorithm  which efficiently  generates and examines all topologically  equivalent trees of a given order to  find a hierarchy which  minimizes a given criterion.  The algorithm is efficient  and  general in the sense that very few restrictions are placed on the  system  model and the performance criteria to be examined.  Several models are analyzed  using the above technique first, and  their further properties such as  complexities and optimalities  are studied.    The models of hierarchical  distributed systems are to be provided  by Dr. Dorota M. Huizinga, California  State University at  Fullerton. The PI has a mentoring arrangement with  Professor  Steve Hedetniemi, Clemson University.",
