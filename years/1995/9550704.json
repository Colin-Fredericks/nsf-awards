 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550704  Sampson    The Heartland's Alliance for Minority Participation  (AMP) program is a collaborative effort of eleven midwestern  universities and colleges whose purpose is to substantially  increase the quality and quantity of minority students receiving  baccalaureate degrees in science, engineering and mathematics  (SEM), and subsequently, to increase the number of minority  students pursuing graduate degrees.  There are two major  objectives of the Alliance:  to increase by 15 percent the number  of minorities SEM baccalaureate degree recipients in  participating institutions and to increase by 50 percent the  number of minorities at participating institutions who  earn doctorates in SEM disciplines in the next 10 years.    The Pre-college Outreach Program will emphasize the importance of  science and mathematics education in elementary and secondary  public schools and encourage high-ability minority students to  pursue SEM degrees.    The Post-secondary/Undergraduate transition Program will assist  SEM minority students in the transitions from high schools and  community colleges to four-year institutions.  This tier features  readiness seminars, tutorial assistance, support teams, summer  research opportunities and related enrichment activities,  designed to ensure the success of these students.    The Graduates Transition Program of study will be tailored to  individual needs, and include a dedicated mentor and financial  support during the post-baccalaureate year.  After successful  completion of the post-baccalaureate year, students will be  awarded fellowships to support their regular graduate study.  A  graduate fair will provide for additional minority recruitment to  the SEM programs of the participating research universities.",
