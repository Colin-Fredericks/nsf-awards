 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  This award supports two principal investigations that  utilize the recently completed Antarctic Marine Geological  and Geophysical synthesis and the associated digital  bathymetric, sediment thickness, and crustal structure data  files.  These, used along with published digital crustal age  data and spreading rate data for the circum-polar region  will allow development of paleographic reconstructions,  complete with paleobathymetry for a variety of geologic  times from the mid-Cretaceous to the present. The crustal  age and spreading rate data files are needed both to unload  the sediments and reposition the depths to account for the  effects of accrued crustal subsidence due to cooling and  isostasy.  An important benefit of determining the most  plausible paleobathymetry will be to arm circulation and  climate modellers with constraints necessary to refine their  models and to further evaluate the sensitivity of such  models to submarine morphological barriers and changing  basin sizes.  The second proposed application of the digital  age and spreading rate files is to test hypotheses that  selected oceanic crustal parameters of layer velocities and  thicknesses, as well as small-scale seafloor roughness, are  age and/or spreading rate dependent.  Establishing such  relationships is likely to lead to new discoveries about the  underlying casual processes effecting crustal evolution.  The Southern Ocean Marine Geological and Geophysical Atlas  and other digital data provide an excellent opportunity to  test such hypotheses for a significantly large fraction of  the World Ocean.",
