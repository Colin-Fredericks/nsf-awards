The conference is planned to include  regular sessions on all aspects of the field of  electronics including analog, digital, solid-  state, power, high-speed, automotive,  biomedical, military and consumer electronics.   Special sessions, invited talks and tutorials  on specific advanced topics will also be  included.    Scope:  This project supports the participation  of six U.S. scientists in an important regional  conference, sponsored by the local chapter of  the IEEE.  The conference is a forum for  researchers and designers to present and  discuss various aspects of this emerging field  which is of great importance to both the U.S.  and to Egypt.  The interaction during the  meeting is likely to enhance collaborative  research and the involvement of Egyptian  graduate students in U.S. research.  ***",
