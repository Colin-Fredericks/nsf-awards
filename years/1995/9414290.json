 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fraser/Abstract           This proposal requests research support for optical remote  sensing of twilight.  Like many other researchers, we are  interested in using twilight's optical structure to evaluate the  verisimilitude of atmospheric scattering models.  However, unlike  others, we propose to do our testing with a remote sensing system  that combines: a) multiple spectral channels with broad bandwidths,  and b) very high spatial and temporal resolutions.         This remote sensing system is human trichromatic color vision,  which has the obvious disadvantage that it is essentially  subjective.  However, trichromatic analogues of color vision, such  as color film and digital imaging systems, let us map their  objective and reproducible responses into those of a typical naked-  eye observer.   Other advantages gained by using photography and  digital imaging include the ability to easily analyze:  a) spectra  from large portions (or all) of the twilight at once, b) the  temporal evolution of twilight spectra at very high resolutions,  and c) the spatial details of twilight polarization.         Specifically, we plan to use digital image analysis of color  slides, occasionally corroborated by spectroradiometry, to explore  the photometric, polarimetric, and colorimetric structure of  twilight.  With a variety of data inversion techniques, we will  then assess how well various atmospheric scattering models account  for twilight as seen by the naked-eye observer (we include here  observers equipped with simple linear polarizers).         In the past, twilight's ephemeral nature has restricted  researchers to gathering only limited amounts of photometric and  polarimetric data, and then usually only as a means of constructing  atmospheric soundings.  Colorimetric studies of twilight are even  rarer.  As worthwhile as twilight-derived atmospheric soundings  are, here we propose a quite different goal:  measuring and  modeling twilight's largely unquantified visual structure.",
