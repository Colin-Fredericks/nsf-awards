This is in  contrast to teaching a traditional literacy course which emphasizes  software packages, vocabulary, and computers and society or to  teaching a standard introduction to programming. The new style  course is especially demanding on both students and instructor  because of the great complexity of the ideas to be transmitted in  a short time. This project continues ongoing work to provide a  major aid to teaching breadth in the first course; it will develop  the \"This-is-how-a-computer-works\" system which simulates levels of  processing in an idealized machine. It enables students to view and  manipulate the internals of the compiler, machine architecture at  the register level, the switching circuits that implement the  machine operations. The system is able to function in the  simulation mode for viewing computations, the training mode for  instructing a student on what is happening at each step, or the  testing mode which will query students at random points and score  the quality of their answers. The system is a general tool for  teaching at the early college level; it is useful for lecture  demonstrations, laboratory exercises, or individual study.",
