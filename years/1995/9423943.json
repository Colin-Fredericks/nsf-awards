The goal is to expose the students to the techniques, attitudes, and rewards of computer science research and to provide encouragement and direction in the pursuit of such a career.  Women and minority students will be strongly recruited.  Six participants will be selected each year, three from Hope College and three from other institutions.  Those students will work for ten weeks during the summer in close collaboration with a Hope faculty mentor.  Students will have the opportunity to use the Hope College Computer Science SUN SPARCstation network as well as the INMOS transputers.  Areas of research include parallel algorithms, system development environments, data communications, voice recognition, graphics algorithms, algorithm animation, and programming language comparisons.  The students will perform independent research, give oral presentations on their work, attend workshops on graduate school, prepare scientific papers, and present their work at seminars at their home institutions.  ***",
