 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412715  Hayden       This project involves the dissertation research of a  graduate student in cultural  anthropology from the University of Pittsburgh.  The student  will provide a cultural  analysis of the development of the Slovak ecology movement  during Slovakia's transition  from state socialism to national independence.  Using  participant observation, semi-  structured interviews, archival research and a survey of  individuals in several ecology  organizations, the student will trace the development of the  ideology as well as the social  and political nature of these organizations in Bratislava,  the capital of Slovakia, as well  as in several regional centers.       This project is important because it adds to the  nation's expertise about a critically  important part of the world, the former communist states of  Eastern Europe.  In addition  the information to be analyzed will illustrate an important  social change going on, as  people redefine what the \"Homeland\" means from purely a  nationalist definition to  reflect newly emerged environmentalist interests.  ***",
