 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on addressing the demand for high quality, innovative, educational software that dramatically increase the motivation to learn about mathematics, as well as the depth of mathematics learning, in children. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of the development of an educational software product that teaches children mathematics in practical contexts relevant to their lives. As such, the research in this Phase will be devoted to extracting core principles of design and concepts in the literature that best lend themselves to this endeavor, and to then developing an application framework and subsequent specific creative content ideas to meet the objective. It is expected that the effort will yield promising results and approaches for commercially-viable educational software products for the teaching of mathematics. Further, it is expected that the design techniques and process can potentially be leveraged for the design and development of educational software products for other domains as well.",
