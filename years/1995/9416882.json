The objective of their research is to study  neural signals in the brain of mormyrid electric fish.  They  will investigate adaptive synaptic plasticity and its role  in controlling sensory input into the brain.  This work  extends their previous in vivo studies to in vitro systems  which will allow them to investigate synaptic plasticity and  local brain circuitry.    The U.S. and French investigators are physiologists with  different and complementary research experience that are  essential to completion of this project.  Dr. Bell's  experience has been with in vivo systems whereas Dr. Grant  has had extensive experience with in vitro slice  preparations.    Their proposed project will advance our  understanding of sensory circuits and local brain circuitry.    ***",
