 "awd_abstract_narration": "World-class manufacturing systems of the future will satisfy diverse customer demands with extremely low lead times at minimal costs. Virtual manufacturing systems will be developed as surrogates for today's manufacturing organization to achieve this world-class distinction. This proposed research supports the movement toward this goal by investigating the feasibility of the `Factory-in-the-Computer`; a decision support/status reporting system which integrates status with predictive technologies. The Factory-in-the-Computer will be designed to inform different types of managers of current and past system status as well as projecting the effect of any decision he or she makes in a consistent and understandable manner. Thus, it will have significant commercial value to manufacturing companies. In this proposed research, Pritsker Corporation will characterize and classify the types of problems for which managers require status and predictive information. They will investigate how existing data review, interactive graphics, object oriented query, and other analysis technologies can be applied to these problem classes. This research (Phase I) will lead to a specification for capabilities of the Factory-in-the-Computer.",
