 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor P. Aluffi to work  in algebraic geometry.  He will work on problems deriving from  the study of hypersurface singularities. He hopes to find a new  formula for MacPherson's Chern class and to extend results on  duality of projective varieties. He hopes to apply some of these  results to the study of combinatorial questions on graphs.    The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
