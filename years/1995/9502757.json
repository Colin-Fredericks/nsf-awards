 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the role  of adhesive exopolymer films in biocorrosion processes at  metal/solution interfaces.  During the tenure of this three-year  continuing grant, Professor Georgiadis and her students at the  George Washington University will apply a suite of surface plasmon  assisted spectroscopies and complementary optical spectroscopic and  electrochemical techniques to the characterization of the  adsorption and surface reactions of model species relevant to the  initial stages of exopolymer mediated corrosion of metals,  particularly copper, under ecologically relevant conditions.  This  research is designed to address three broad goals: (1) to  understand the physics and chemistry of the metal/solution  interface in the initial stages of biocorrosion; (2) to describe  the mechanisms of the surface corrosion reactions; and (3) to  explore the role of surface energy, surface composition, and  surface roughness on exopolymer adsorption, exopolymer adhesion,  and metal corrosion rate.  Also during this grant period, Professor  Georgiadis will implement an interdisciplinary educational  development plan that includes relevant new and revised course  offerings, an increased role for research in undergraduate  education, and a focus on increased broad awareness of the central  importance of chemistry and chemical concepts.    An understanding of the molecular basis of biocorrosion of metals  is critical to technologically important areas such as materials,  manufacturing, and civil infrastructure.  In this CAREER research  project, surface plasmon assisted spectroscopies and complementary  experimental techniques will be used to gain molecular level  insights into this scientifically complex and economically  important area.  The education development aspects of this CAREER  project should enrich and broaden significantly the chemistry  educational experience of George Washington Un iversity  undergraduate and graduate students.",
