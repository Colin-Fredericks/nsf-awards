 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415715  Heberlein    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative  research in plasma-aided manufacturing between research  groups at the University of Minnesota and the University of  Limoges.  The U.S. investigators are Joachim Heberlein and  Emil Pfender and the French investigator is Pierre Fauchais.  The objective of their research is to perform diagnostic  experiments designed to improve the reliability and  controllability of the plasma spray process. The proposed  research addresses the major cause of the lack of  reproducibility, namely the uncontrolled dynamic behavior of  the arc in the plasma torch. An improved plasma torch could  have important applications in large-scale manufacturing and  a variety of industrial processes, among them cutting,  welding, plasma spraying, extractive metallurgy, melting-  refining, and chemical synthesis.    The U.S. and French laboratories have developed specific  diagnostic techniques for studying the plasma process. The  proposal takes advantage complementary expertise and ongoing  experimental efforts.  Different diagnostic techniques will  be used on plasma torches of different geometries.  Subsequent experiments on torches of similar design will  then be conducted.  The project will advance understanding  of the dynamic behavior of the plasma arc and will result in  improved design guidelines for plasma spray equipment.  ***",
