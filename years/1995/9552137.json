 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronics manufacturing will have a major impact on future  products.   Almost all automobiles, appliances, computers, and  telephones contain printed circuit boards, chips, or electronic  modules.   In the future, significantly more electronic  components and modules will be required.   Many of these  assemblies will be designed in the United States.   However, if  past trends continue, a large portion of these electronics  assemblies will be produced overseas.   There are many reasons  for this, one of which is that most undergraduate engineers never  learn about the processes required to produce electronic  assemblies.   They do not understand the processes and are  therefore less likely to fight to keep them local.   This project  is continuing to develop an existing Electronics Manufacturing  Laboratory by developing laboratory exercises and acquiring  equipment to allow engineers in all disciplines to study  electronics manufacturing processes.  All industrial engineering  students and a portion of the other engineering undergraduates  benefit from this project.   Two introductory experiments have  been introduced in IE 115/116, a required junior-level course in  the major.   A new senior level course with five laboratory  experiments has been developed and is open to all engineering  students.   Specifically, the equipment provides students with  the opportunity to perform experiments such as thick-film hybrid  production, printed circuit board production, printed circuit  board assembly using surface mount technology and through hole  technology, and inspection and testing.   Students familiar with  these processes are to enter the workforce and persuade their  employers that more electronics manufacturing should be performed  in the United States.",
