 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces students to optoelectronics, a key  technology for the future.   The new equipment is enhancing an  optoelectronics laboratory, allowing students to gain hands-on  experience with modern equipment in this interdisciplinary field.   Learning to integrate knowledge from a variety of fields is  essential for effective participation in the present and future  engineering community.   The equipment is being incorporated into  a junior-level Electronics class for Electrical Engineers, an  elective Electrical Engineering course, Optoelectronic Materials  and Devices, and Exploring Engineering for first-year engineering  and interested non-engineering-students.   The equipment  contributes a vital laboratory component to enhance student  learning.  Students perform experiments with optoelectronic  materials, devices, and systems.   Having students create their  own optical measurement setups using available components  provides them with valuable experience in developing tools to  solve problems.  Students explore the effects of different  materials and temperature on device performance.   The Exploring  Engineering students compare laser diodes and light-emitting  diodes (LEDs) in the visible and infrared regimes.   The  Electronics students perform a more detailed characterization of  these devices.   The students in the elective perform several  experiments including materials characterization and  characterization of optical sources (gas lasers, laser diodes,  and LEDs), detectors, and modulators.   A system-level experiment  culminates the laboratory experience.   Since fiber optic  communication is one of the most important applications of  optoelectronics, system laboratories involve fiber optics.    Coupling an optoelectronic device into an optical fiber  introduces the students to the complexity of integrating the  devices they have studied into actual systems.  State-of-the-art  data acquisition software, LabView, is being integrated into the  experiments.",
