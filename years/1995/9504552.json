The program's awards provide opportunities for  joint research, and the use of unique or complementary  facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.  Financial support for this award is from the U.S.-New  Zealand Program.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Geoffrey A. Barrall to go to Palmerston, North,  New Zealand to work with Dr. Paul Callaghan of Massey  University.    This research will focus on the development and use of  pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) techniques to study the translational dynamics of high  molecular weight polymers in flowing and non-flowing  systems.  The primary goal of these studies is to test the  predictions of present polymer dynamics theories using new  experimental information provided by NMR techniques.  This  research will have great applicability to engineering  processes used by the American plastics industries. ***",
