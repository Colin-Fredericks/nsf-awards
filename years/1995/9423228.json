Four distinct motions are investigated: (I) oscillatory broadside translations, (ii), oscillatory transverse translations, (iii) oscillatory in-plane rotations, (iv) oscillatory out-to-plane rotations.  This problem models a basic shape and four basic mechanical motions found in the design and manufacture of microelectromechanical components.  An exact solution for the fluid motion is outlined for the limit that convective acceleration of the fluid is neglected and the unsteady local acceleration term is retained, which is a self-consistent approximation provide the oscillatory amplitudes are small.  Forces and torques acting on the oscillating element will be calculated as function of the oscillation frequency, and the fluid's density and viscosity.  The viscous effects associated with fluid-solid friction have a significant influence on the mechanical response of components of microelectromechanical devices.  Consequently, the design of small micromachined mechanical elements, such as actuators, pumps and valves, remains more an art than engineering or science.  Because of their small dimensions (e.g. 10-100 um), viscous effects of a surrounding fluid (either air or a possible lubricant) are not negligible.  From the standpoint of design, although well developed fluid dynamical principles are applicable to steady flows, much less is known about unsteady viscous flows.",
