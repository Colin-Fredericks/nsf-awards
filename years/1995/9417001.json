The  first objective of this joint proposal is to identify those receptor  domains responsible for activating the receptor kinases to initiate  phosphorylation.  The second objective focuses on the role of  phosphorylation in protein coupling and cellular trafficking.  The  results are expected to reveal diverse effects of phosphorylation  including desensitization of signal transduction.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working in the area of neuron function.  Dr. Sadee and his graduate  students will have the opportunity to become familiar with research  techniques and practices at Tokyo University.  Therefore, this  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
