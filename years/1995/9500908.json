 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500908  Dunn  Optimal control problems are often naturally formulated as specially structured  mathematical programs in infinite-dimensional function spaces. In such cases, a  study of algorithms for the limiting infinite-dimensional programs can predict the  behavior of standard computational schemes that are actually implemented in  approximating finite-dimensional spaces, and can also suggest new algorithms that  have no counterparts in the standard methodology for finite-dimensional  mathematical programs. In particular, recent studies have shown that standard  nonlinear programming algorithms are best suited to optimal control problems with  Hamiltonians that are uniformly convex in the control input vector, while other  optimal control problems may require strong variation methods based on the  inherently infinite-dimensional necessary condition of Pontryagin. The proposed  investigation has the following immediate objectives: (i) to establish the  convergence properties of Newtonian projection methods in Chebychev norm  neighborhoods and root-mean-square neighborhoods of control functions that  satisfy recently developed local optimality sufficient conditions for nonconvex  nonquadratic constrained input regulator problems; (ii) to extend the analysis in (i)  to hybrid algorithms that employ Newtonian projection and Lagrangian  augmentation techniques for regulator problems with control variable and state  variable constraints; (iii) to establish the convergence properties of strong variation  methods in root-mean-square neighborhoods of control functions satisfying sharp  local optimality sufficient conditions in the root-mean-square norm for optimal  control problems with Hamiltonians that are not convex in the control input vector;  (iv) to corroborate the predictions of the infinite dimensional convergence analyses  in (i)--(iii) for approximate finite dimensional computations on fixed and nested  grids.     Optimal control problems arise in aircraft and spacecraft trajectory calcula tions,  nuclear and chemical reactor control, structural and aerodynamic design,  management of ecological systems, and many other applications. In the generic  optimal control problem, a large number of control variables (forces, voltages,  temperatures, etc.) are chosen at various points in time and space to bring some  physical system into a desired state, and to accomplish this at the lowest possible  cost (manuever duration, fuel or power consumption, etc.). Control and state  variable values are also typically constrained by hardware or safety considerations,  and state transitions are often governed by complicated systems of ordinary or  partial differential equations. The associated optimization task is therefore  demanding, and requires algorithms that effectively exploit control problem  structure in the computation of their successive approximations, and also exhibit  good global and local convergence characteristics for the problems in question. In  broad terms, the goal of the proposed investigation is to understand which  algorithm types are most effective for a given problem structure in the context of  optimal control.  ***",
