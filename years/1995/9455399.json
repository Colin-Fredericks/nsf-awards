This will enable each student to  gain exposure to environmental concerns and problem-solving methods  in their discipline.  Environmental units that can fit easily into  several existing required cmurses will be developed.  This will  form the basis for subsequent efforts focused on junior and  senior-level courses as a follow-on to the current project.   Throughout this effort, course materials that can be widely  disseminated to other U.S. engineering colleges and universities  will be developed.    The approach outlined in this proposal is favored over the  development of new or required environmental courses for several  reasons.  One is that modern engineering curricula already have a  surfeit of competing demands for new or specialized courses. Thus,  as a practical matter, it is difficult to introduce new  requirements into the curriculum at most institutions.  More  importantly, however, environmental issues should not be seen as  distinct from \"mainstream\" engineering issues.  By integrating  environmental considerations into basic engineering courses in each  discipline, all engineering students will come to see that  environmental factors are an inherent part of good engineering  practice.  Relatively small modifications in the curricula of  existing core courses can have a significant impact on the  environmental education of all engineers,  not just those who choose  to specialize in environmental engineering.",
