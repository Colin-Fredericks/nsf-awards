 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morehouse College, a historically  black institution, has a long tradition  in the development of African American men  for careers in science.  A majority of these men have been trained  in Merrill Hall, home to the chemistry department.  Constructed in 1952, the present  facility is devoid of the required physical  infrastructure required to support modern chemical research and research training activities.  Deficiencies include: inadequate ventilation and air conditioning, leaking pipes, inoperable fume hoods, poor lighting, and inadequate chemical storage facilities.  Laboratories are in violation of federal safety regulations and building codes.  Not only are conditions hazardous to students and faculty, but they are potentially damaging to research instruments.  This Academic Research Infrastructure award will provide funds to assist Morehouse College  in its endeavors to renovate the second and third floors of the Merrill Chemistry Building.  Laboratories will be reconfigured into functional areas where research in analytical, physical,  inorganic, and materials chemistry can be conducted.  In addition to upgrading  infrastructural systems, the renovation will involve the installation of new fume hoods, benches, and casework.  Morehouse's role in undergraduate science is particularly significant in light of the rapidly declining numbers of students, especially minorities, who enter scientific fields.  The shortage  of scientifically trained African Americans has serious implications for the future of a nation increasingly dependent on scientific  and technological advances.  A renovated Merrill Hall will strengthen the institution's role in developing young scientists  to meet this challenge.",
