 "awd_abstract_narration": "EEC-9525533  Jones    This award provides funding for a joint Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center in Coating Research at the Eastern  Michigan University, Michigan Molecular Institute, and the North  Dakota State University.    The Centers' two-fold mission is to be a leading academic  organization that develops relevant scientific knowledge for  understanding and expanding the technology of paints and coatings  for the benefit of its members and to enlarge the cadre of  scientists and technologists capable of working effectively with  coatings.    The thrust areas of the Center's research activities are defined by  critical problems facing the coating industry and coating users.   These areas include:  a.) reduction, ultimately, elimination of air  pollution; b.) cost-effective improvement of product quality; c.)  improved corrosion protection.     There are 17 company members currently involved in Center's  research activities.  These research activities will be coordinated  through the Eastern Michigan University under the guidance of the  Industry Advisory Board.    The Center will perform research in seven areas of science and  engineering that are directly relevant to these thrust areas, often  combining resources of the institutions to focus on a thrust area.   Projects will be implemented primarily by faculty, staff, and the  students of the three institutions.      Additional funding is provided in this award to support two women  undergraduate students who will work as research assistants during  the 1995-96 fall and winter semesters.  One student will work on a  project entitled \"Rheology of low and Solventless Water Reducible  Coatings.\"  The other student will work on the project \"Improved  Methods for VOC Analysis.\"",
