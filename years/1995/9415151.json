 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hornbach  NSF funding of $500,000 will be used to support the renovation, repair, and  reconfiguration of selected research and research training laboratories for the  Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics/Computer Science,  Physics and Psychology at Macalester College.  This newly-designed space will  provide efficient and updated space in support of faculty research, faculty-student  research collaborations and independent upper-level student research and research  training.  The renovated laboratories and research support space will be located in  Olin Hall of Science, part of the college s Olin-Rice science complex.  The NSF-  sponsored renovations will occur within Macalester s major renovation and  construction project to improve Olin and Rice Halls which were constructed in 1965  and 1971 respectively.  The effort is designed to support the increasingly laboratory-  rich, research-based, interdisciplinary approach to learning science.  The entire  project will bring the facility into compliance with current safety and access codes and  will reconfigure current space that is highly compartmentalized inhibiting  collaborative research and research training among the scientific disciplines.  Fifteen  faculty members and approximately 45 students will be direct beneficiaries of the NSF  project.  Macalester plans to make eight new appointments within the sciences by the  year 2000, complementing the twenty new research-active science faculty that have  been hired since 1984.  ***",
