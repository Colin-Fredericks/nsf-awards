 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the establishment of a strong research-based linkage between two centers of excellence in membrane technology in the U.S. and The Netherlands. These are the University-Industry Cooperative Research Center in Separations Using Thin Films of the University of Colorado, Boulder, directed by Professor William B. Krantz, and the Center for Membrane Science and Technology at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, directed by Professor Heiner Strathmann.  With seventy research staff, this Dutch organization is the largest and strongest membrane research center in the world.  It has interdisciplinary strengths in both the fundamental science and applied technology aspects of membranes.  The U.S. center is a relatively new one, and is stronger in the engineering side of membrane research.  It hopes to benefit from the Dutch expertise in membrane chemistry and thermodynamics as well as its experience in technology transfer to its industrial partners.      Staff and students of the two centers will collaborate in several areas of research, but generally these lie in the area of processes and models for the formation of new types of membranes for use in environmental applications.  Specific research topics will include a thermally induced phase-separation process, methods to minimize macrovoid defects in phase-inversion membranes, hybrid membranes, zeolite membranes, polymeric membranes and metallic membranes.    Ultimately the joint research to be performed should contribute new knowledge about the separation processes effected by membranes, and how to enhance the processes and develop new membrane materials for use in more hostile environments   Over its three year duration, this award will support nine research visits lasting from three weeks to three months to be made by three senior staff and six graduate students of the U.S. center.  Funds for the award are provided by the Western Europe Program of the Division of International Programs, and the Separation and Purification Processes Program of the Division of Chemical and Thermal Systems.",
