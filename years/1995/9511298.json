 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511298  Halfter  During early embryonic development axonal processes connect the  different parts of the nervous system.  One such axonal connection  is the visual pathway that functionally connects the eye with the  brain by optic axons.  The cells that generate the optic axons are  the ganglion cells of the retina.  A prerequisite for optic axons  to reach the brain is to navigate to the optic disc, a small  central segment of the retina that allows the axons to exit the  eye.  The mechanisms underlying the navigation of axons to their  target, such as the optic disc, are largely unknown.  This grant  proposal is aimed at studying molecules and other factors involved  in the navigation of axons during development.  Transplantation  experiments will be performed to learn more about the general  mechanisms of axonal guidance in the eye.  Biochemical studies are  aimed at identifying molecules that might be important in the  formation of axonal pathways.  One such molecule is a chondroitin  sulfate proteoglycan.  This proteoglycan is present at a time and  with a distribution that matches exactly the appearance and  distribution of optic axons suggesting that the component has a  function in the development of this axonal tract.  In the present  project, the molecular identity of the proteoglycan and its  function in the developing visual system will be studied.  The  results of this research will promote a deeper understanding of the  mechanisms that guide neural connections during development.",
