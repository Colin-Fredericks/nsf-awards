 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9503114 Santosa  Our approach is to pose the imaging problem  as an optimization problem with constraints and penalty terms.  The constraints would represent a priori information, while the  penalty terms are added to achieve certain quality in the image.  One of the main difficulties in this approach is development of  specialized optimization methods. The optimization methods must  be capable of (1) solving large problems, (2) dealing with  constraints, (3) dealing with nondifferentiability of the cost  function. To this end, we will explore the use of interior point  methods. While this imaging technique has several attractive  features such as low-cost and portability, it suffers from the  ability to resolve fine features in the image. We propose to  overcome this difficulty by incorporating known side information  as well as applying enhancement techniques in the reconstruction  process.   This research concerns the use of recent techniques in  image enhancement and computer vision in overcoming the blurring  effects of an imaging method known as electrical impedance  tomography. Electrical impedance tomography is a technique for  imaging the interior of a specimen using DC electrical  measurements collected on the boundary of the specimen. It has  found use in clinical applications, geophysical prospecting, and  nondestructive evaluations. It is anticipated that we will be  able to develop software, that when used with electrical  impedance tomographic devices, would deliver images with high  resolution.",
