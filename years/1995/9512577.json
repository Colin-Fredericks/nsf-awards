 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for 50% of the cost of creating the University of  Wisconsin-Madison Facility  for Biophysics Instrumentation. This campus facility would be part of a  $30 million expansion of the Department of Biochemistry. The facility  would house six major instruments for the study of the complexation,  conformation, and structure of biological and other macromolecules.  These instruments are a MicroCal isothermal titration calorimeter,  Calorimetry Sciences differential scanning calorimeter, Beckman  analytical ultracentrifuge, Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer,  Nicolet Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and Pharmacia surface  plasmon resonance detector. In addition, an Instrumentation Specialist  would be hired to provide technical assistance to students, staff, and  faculty on the installation, use, and maintenance of the requested  instruments.    The six principal users of the requested instrumentation are faculty  members who use biophysical methods to study biopolymers and their  interactions. These faculty reside in four divisions of the university-  -Biochemistry, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Pharmacy. They have  active collaborations, routinely share equipment and ideas, and  participate in common training and degree programs. Together, they  would manage the operations of the proposed core facility. The major  users of the requested instruments would be the approximately 100  students and staff being trained in the laboratories of the primary  users. In addition, the requested instruments would greatly enhance the  research and training efforts of ten secondary users. The laboratories  of all primary and secondary users are within two city blocks of the  proposed facility. Further, it is envisioned that the usage and hence  the impact of the facility would soon broaden well beyond the research  groups of the primary and secondary users.    The need for the requested instrumentation is extreme. Physical  approaches to the analysis of biological systems depend  heavily on  instrumentation. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison now  have the ability to produce biomolecules on a large scale, and to  perform limited physical analyses on these molecules. Yet, no  isothermal titration calorimeters, no differential scanning  calorimeters, no analytical ultracentrifuges, and no surface plasmon  resonance detectors exist on any campus of the University of Wisconsin.  The Madison campus has two antiquated circular dichroism spectrometers  and only three Fourier transform infrared spectrometers, each of which  is inaccessible to the primary and secondary users. This proposal is  intended to address this crippling lack of modern biophysical  instrumentation.",
