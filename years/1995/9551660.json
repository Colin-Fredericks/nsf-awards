 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 1994 study by the Engineering Deans Council and Corporate  Roundtable of the American Society for Engineering Education  concluded, \"Today, engineering colleges must not only provide  their graduates with intellectual development and superb  technical capabilities, but following industry's lead, those  colleges must educate their students to work as part of teams,  communicate well, and understand the economic, social,  environmental and international context of their professional  activities.\"  This college, in partnership with major engineering  universities, is in a position to accomplish this goal.   The  college is adding FORTRAN and Engineering Graphics to offer an  emphasis in pre-engineering.   This project implements the two  new courses and improves existing courses by providing computer  hardware and software.   With a pre-engineering program at the  college, students are able to transfer to three universities  without loss of credit.",
