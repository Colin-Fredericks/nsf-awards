 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a high-performance liquid chromatography  (HPLC) apparatus and a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system.    These bioanalytical separation instruments are being used in the  following undergraduate laboratories:  Biochemical and  Environmental Analysis, Instrumental Techniques, Biochemistry Lab  and Independent Study.  Initially students are exposed to these  instruments in the Biochemical and Environmental Analysis Lab,  where they carry out HPLC analysis of metabolically important  compounds in the urine or artificial sweeteners and additives in  beverages.   Students provide their own samples for the analysis.    A simple experiment on CE is being introduced to demonstrate the  power of protein separation using a coated capillary.   A protein  mixture consisting of lysozyme, ribonuclease A, cytochrome C, and  myoglobin may be readily separated using free-zone capillary  electrophoresis.   In Instrumental Techniques, the students learn  to optimize parameters and conditions to achieve high resolution  for separations on these instruments.   In Biochemistry Lab,  students are introduced to the field of experimental biochemistry  through a project study of a protein.   The availability of HPLC  and CE greatly affects the methods available for the preparation  of the protein and the analysis of the purity of the isolated  protein.   As time becomes available outside of the formal  courses, the instrument can also be used by students doing  various independent research projects which are required of  chemistry majors.",
