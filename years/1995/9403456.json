 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the Phase II SBIR award is to develop a Fringe Field Charge Distribution Probe (FF-CDP) that is capable of performing measurements with moderate to high spatial resolution and extremely good long-term stability.  Electric and electronic properties of insulators are difficult to measure by conventional methods which apply metal contacts to the insulator surfaces.  This new technique has shown great potential.  It allows one to measure, contact-free under minimum perturbation conditions, previously unmeasureable fundamental properties of materials, especially of materials with very low charge carrier concentrations.  The technique relies on the dielectric polarization in an electric field gradient.  By deconvoluting the various components of the dielectric polarization, bulk and surface contributions can be separated.  Thus, unique information is obtained about surface charges, their sign and density as well as their associated internal fields.  This method is sensitive to changes in the bulk polarization, due to structural changes, to phase transitions, and to defects that generate mobile charges.  By applying a static electric field gradient and measuring the response as function of time, processes with long relaxation times, of the order of seconds to hours, can be assessed.  Such processes are often due to charge carriers with low drift mobilities, which may play an important part in determining the long-term stability of insulators, ferroelectrics and other components of semiconductor devices.",
