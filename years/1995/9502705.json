 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502705  Hall  New optoelectronic structures will be fabricated using a  revolutionary new oxidation technology for aluminum-bearing alloy  semiconductors (the \"native\" oxide of aluminum-gallium-arsenide  (AlGaAs)).  The planar waveguide lenses, buried strip waveguides,  and integrated laser sources to be developed will be useful  \"building block\" components broadly applicable in the further  evolution of OEICs.  These components will be applied for the  realization of novel and higher-performance integrated master  oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) devices.\"    Two new optoelectronics/photonics courses will be developed at  Notre Dame by drawing on the PI's background of experiment research  in semiconductor lasers at the University of Illinois, and research  on high-power MOPA devices and new optical techniques for their  characterization as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Naval Research  Laboratory.  The aim of the new undergraduate Modern Photonics  laboratory course is to expose seniors to the broad span of  photonics technologies important in today's commercial sector,  while introducing them to current optoelectronics research advances  (to be incorporated as special projects) which promise to be the  leading technologies of the future.  The graduate Optoelectronics  Devices course will fill an important need in the curriculum at  Notre Dame and serve as a core course to prepare graduate students  to join in the new optoelectronics research efforts.  ***",
