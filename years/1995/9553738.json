 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic competitiveness, rapid technology advances and  changing workforce requirements call for new ATE teaching  strategies, curricular reform and better teamwork among educators,  business and industry and professional organizations.  Urban ATE  colleges face these and other challenges, serving largely  economically disadvantaged and predominantly minority students many  under-prepared for ATE college learning.  Yet, these same urban  institutions offer diversity, academic expertise and opportunities  for urban businesses seeking flexible, dynamic partnerships to meet  their workforce needs.  New ATE curriculum development and program  improvement resources and initiatives must be developed by urban  ATE colleges and their partners in a more cost-effective and  coordinated way.       The National Urban ATE Center is directed by a consortium of  City University of New York (CUNY) associate degree colleges,  eventually offering services to between 25-35 of the country's  largest urban ATE colleges.  Services include:  (1) establishment  of a Resource Clearinghouse creating an Internet hub,  teleconferencing and traditional research services; (2) exemplary  ATE curricula dissemination in engineering technology and  development of an ATE Curriculum Frameworks; (3) exemplary faculty  enhancement services in the use of technology in associate degree  engineering technology; and (4) student academic support services  to urban ATE colleges in mathematics and communications.  Ten major  urban ATE colleges throughout the United States will participate in  the first year, along with national professional organizations and  businesses, including CORD, American Chemical Society, Urban  League, NYNEX, Hughes Corporation and others.  CUNY expects  substantial resource gains among participating colleges and  development of effective strategies to improve student achievement  and to meet the workforce needs of business and industry.",
