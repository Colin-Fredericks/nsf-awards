 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512670  Currie    Head Start is one of the most popular and widely-known early  intervention programs in the country.  Policy makers and the  general public appear to believe that the benefits of Head Start   and well-known and well-documented.  However, a careful reading  of the literature shows that the evidence in support of lasting  effects of Head Start is limited.  Previous research by the  investigators indicates that Head Start has significant effects  on the test scores and schooling attainment of young white  children and these effects persist into adolescence.  But among  black children, there is no evidence that the immediate gains  associated with any lasting effect on human capital outcomes.   However, their research is based on a very small sample and few  of the differences are statistically significant.  This project  will provide further evidence about who gains from Head Start by   examining the form of the benefits and the persistence of the  benefits using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of  Young (NLSY) in combination with the National Longitudinal  Survey s Child-Mother files (NLSCM) and the Panel Study of  Dynamics (PSID).  The NLSY and NLSCM provide an extensive set of   information on an array of child human capital outcomes including  cognitive test scores and educational attainment.  Children in  those data are relatively young and so it is not possible to  fully examine the longer run effects of Head Start.  This gap  will be filled by exploiting a special module of the PSID that  was designed, in part, by the Principal Investigators of this  project.  The module contains a rich education history which will  be combined with over twenty five years of longitudinal data on  labor market outcomes of respondents and their parents.      More specifically, this project seeks to answer three questions  raised by previous research about Head Start.  First, can a case   be made for early intervention programs or are child outcomes  really largely predetermined by  maternal endowments as some have  claimed.  Second, are cognitive test scores a meaningful  yardstick for measuring the effects of early intervention  programs, and are racial and ethnic differences in average scores  meaningful when judged in terms of more concrete outcomes?   Answers to these questions will set the stage for the analysis of  the fundamental question: does Head Start participation affect  long-term outcomes such as high school completion, teenage  pregnancy, criminal activity, and the schooling attainment of the  former participants' own children?",
