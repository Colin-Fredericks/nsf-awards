It focuses on the systematic assessment of the causes and consequences for the legal and constitutional institutions of South Africa of intolerance in the political culture.  To do so it assesses political tolerance and intolerance as demonstrated in the beliefs of both masses and elites.  Survey research methods will allow the investigators to accomplish four related goals:  1) analyze the distribution of intolerance, considering its level, its breadth, and pluralism of distribution;  2) assess the etiology of intolerance, testing a number of hypotheses that have emerged from studies in Western literature; 2) examine the consequences of intolerance especially for interpersonal political interaction, and political participation; 4) test the pliability of intolerance by determining the extent to which citizens can be \"talked out of\" their intolerance or into giving \"sober second thought\" to repression of their political enemies.  The surveys will be conducted under contract with a reputable South African firm under the supervision of an onsite South African collaborator.  This research on South Africa should increase our knowledge about how democratic legal culture emerges out of the background of dictatorial government.  %%%  This project seeks to trace the progress of democratization and political change in the new South Africa.
