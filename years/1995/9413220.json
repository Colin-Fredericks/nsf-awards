This Research Training Group (RTG) is a central focus of the recently-established Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior at Indiana University.  The faculty, who come from the Departments of Biology, Psychology, Law, and Medical Sciences, bring six subdisciplinary perspectives to the RTG: sensory physiology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental psychobiology, animal learning, and behavioral neuroscience.  Graduate students who participate in the RTG are drawn from three graduate programs: biology, psychology and an interdisciplinary program in neuroscience.  The RTG provides students with academic year and summer assistantships, travel support or research support.    The courses, seminars and other educational activities of the RTG result from the integration across 5 areas of research: communication, sex and reproductive behavior, learning and motivation, ontogeny and evolution, and spatial organization of behavior.  As well as representing natural combinations of faculty research interests, these areas provide foci for the development of student research projects.  Several of the courses required of RTG trainees have been newly developed by RTG faculty; students must also participate in a year-long seminar on scientific integrity developed jointly by the RTG and the Poynter Center for Study of Ethics and American Institutions.  In addition to the core faculty, there are 10 adjunct faculty in five other departments whose have related research interests and whose students benefit from the courses and seminars and other educational activities of the RTG.  ***",
