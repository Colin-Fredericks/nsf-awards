 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509613  Rastetter  Multiple Resource Interactions and Ecosystem Function Terrestrial ecosystems perform many important functions including the cycling and sequestration of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water, and the production of biomass and soil organic matter.  These functions are tightly constrained by (1) the nutritional requirements of plants and soil microorganisms, (2) the ability of plants and microorganisms to adapt to changes in their environment, (3) the amounts of various nutrients in the ecosystem, and (4) the rate at which these nutrients are supplied to or lost from the ecosystem.  This study will synthesize the effects of these various constraints on ecosystem function through the development mf a theoretical model that includes the interactions between ecosystem element cycles, the acclimation of vegetation and soil microorganisms to changes in the availability of these elements, and the changes in species composition resulting from competition for the elements.  The results will improve the understanding of both ecosystem biogeochemistry and community processes, should result in closer linkage between ecosystem and community ecology, will help to predict and interpret the responses of ecosystems and plant communities to changes in the environment, and will help explain why different ecosystems respond differently to changes in the environment.  ??",
