 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops the theory and implementation of a  practical spatial geometric constraint solver that integrates    symbolic methods  from constructive geometry with numerical  methods from   homotopy continuation  theory.  Geometric constraint  solvers are a key component in   modern Mechanical  Computer-Aided  Design systems, and offer a critical   technology for increased  productivity, rapid response manufacturing, and agile    manufacturing.  Effective  solvers exist for planar constraints,  but spatial problems   of moderate size  exceed the capabilities of  many research solvers.  The   solver being developed  will cover the  broad class of problems specified by   distance, angle, and  incidence constraints among points, lines, and planes.  It   will  solve small  problems interactively and problems of moderate size  in a   few seconds.  Using a  constraint graph whose nodes represent  elements and whose   edges represent  constraints, a constraint  analysis will decompose the   constraint problem into a  series of  small construction problems that can be solved   efficiently using  preprocessing.  Elementary constructions will be carried out    algebraically,  more complex construction steps by homotopy  continuation.    The hybrid algorithm  combines the robustness and  completeness of symbolic methods   with the  uniformity and  efficiency of numerical methods.",
