 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports cooperation between Dr. Steven Manson, Physics Department at Georgia State University, Atlanta, and Dr. Zikri Altun, Physics Department at Marmara University in Istanbul, Turkey.  The research deals with two areas: first, the photoionization of open-shell atoms using many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) with particular emphasis on the very difficult transition metals and rare earth elements, by investigating the region around the so-called giant resonances in the photoionization cross sections of the 3rd transition metal atoms; and second, the photoionization with excitation of closed-shell atoms, where the experimental results of photoelectron spectroscopy measurements display many partial cross sections whose relationships are difficult to evaluate, and where the calculation of these cross sections will help understand this important correlation.       Scope:  This project will allow a cooperative activity that has started about two years ago to continue for an additional two years, and to produce maximum benefits from the collaboration.  The US scientist's group is well established, is experienced in the photoionization theory, and has extensive facilities for large-scale calculations.  The Turkish scientist has considerable knowledge of the MBPT codes, developed by his thesis advisor and mentor, and also has the facility for code development and testing at his department.  The two scientists have already accomplished considerable success in the first two years, presented several papers at scientific meetings, and have submitted at least one joint paper for publication.  They are likely to produce more papers during the period of this project extension.  The project clearly meets the objectives of the Division of International Programs in linking US scientists with foreign scientists where the talents and capabilities are complementary.",
