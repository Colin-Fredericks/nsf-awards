Meyer                         Due 9551564  University of Nebraska-Lincoln          FY1995 $44.190  Lincoln, NE  68583                      ILI - Instrumentation                                          Project:                                          Interdisciplinary    Title: A Multidisciplinary Environmental Undergraduate Laboratory    The Departments of Biological Systems Engineering, Civil  Engineering, and Agricultural Meteorology at the University of  Nebraska-Lincoln will equip a multidisciplinary Environmental  Undergraduate Laboratory (EUL).  The EUL will facilitate curricular  change to address new teaching emphases for these departments.  Our  goal is to establish a learning environment that allows students to  explore uses of state-of-the-art equipment to solve environmental  problems.  The five computer workstations and data acquisition  systems, along with sensors to monitor environmental variables,  including water quality, will encourage cooperative learning,  problem-solving among small teams of students, and provide  realistic experiences to prepare students for careers in research  and industry.    Laboratory sessions for four courses (two in BioSysE, one in AgMet,  and one offered jointly in CivilE and BioSysE) will undergo  significant revision.  These revisions will emphasize use of  laboratory exercises to build on mathematical descriptions of  physical and chemical relationships introduced in lecture sessions  and facilitate the understanding of thermodynamic and energy state  relationships for environmental systems.  The new exercises will  permit \"hands-on\" experimentation using modern equipment including  automated monitoring using data acquisition systems; sensor types,  applications, design, testing and calibration; computer methods for  data analysis; and error analyses for these systems.  The EUL will  also be used for exercises or demonstrations to enhance at least  thirteen other undergraduate courses from three other disciplines.    Laboratory manual s for the revised courses will be developed.   Interactive televised sessions, using equipment from the EUL, will  be presented via AG*SAT, a national agricultural television  network.",
