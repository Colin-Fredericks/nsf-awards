 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business innovation Research Phase I project is concerned with the development of molecular tools for direct haplotyping of an individual's genomic DNA without access to family or related individuals. For many questions in population genetics, it is necessary to consider the arrangement of multiple polymorphisms along either the maternally or paternally derived chromosome. Such arrangement constitutes haplotypes, i.e., haploid genotypes. Classically, haplotypes have been inferred from mammalian inheritance in families or from statistical simulations of genotyping data. The overall aim of this project is to develop molecular haplotyping reagents for several loci distributed throughout the human genome. Phase I research objectives include the following. First, development of a molecular haplotyping strategy based on allele-specific extension and exonuclease VII degradation of single-stranded DNA resulting in a hemyzygous double-stranded product. Second, application of the molecular haplotyping strategy to targets in the CD4 gene and HOX2 cluster. Third, molecular haplotyping at these targets of 100 human samples from African and non-African populations. The development of haplotyping reagent kits will accelerate the information gathering efforts of,the Human Genome Diversity (HGD) initiative. The kits will be designed to be analytically robust and operationally simple. In addition, the molecular haplotyping kits could be used to supplement current databases on selected loci thus enhancing their value for anthropologists and geneticists. The HGD provides the primary and immediate market for this project, but applications in forensic science are also practical.",
