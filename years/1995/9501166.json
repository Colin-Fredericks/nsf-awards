 "awd_abstract_narration": "U. Notre Dame  This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of   the research and teaching activities of Dr. Bradley Smith.  The theme of   the research is the design and synthesis of allosteric supramolecular   assemblies, i.e systems whose chemical activity is altered by   conformational changes remote to the site of the activity.  In each   system proposed, the allosteric mechanism will involve chair-chair   interconversion of cis-1,3-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acids. These   switchable moieties will be incorporated into cyclophanes, polar lipids,   and self assembling ion channels. The allosteric molecular switches will   be triggered by pH changes and/or metal cations. Depending on the design   of the supramolecular assembly, triggered-release of drugs, transport of   ions,  and signal transduction will be achieved. Dr. Smith's teaching   plan will involve the development of a laboratory manual for a new   Biological Organic Chemistry course for biology majors and the   development of a new course in Organic Structure Elucidation. A workbook   will be prepared for the latter based on modern spectroscopic methods and   directed towards senior undergraduates.  This study of allosteric supramolecular assemblies will lead to the   development of useful molecular devices such as triggered-release   liposomes for gene therapy, targeted carriers for drug delivery and   switchable ion channels with antibiotic potential. The involvement of   graduate and undergraduate students in the research will have a   significant educational value.",
