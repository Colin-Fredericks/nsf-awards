 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-26305  Grossman  As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Grossman and his co-principal investigator, Dr. John Wang, will complete the reduction and analysis of unique radio interferometer observational data sets, which were taken to determine the effects the event had on the Jovian troposphere and magnetosphere during and after the impact.  The data sets were obtained at the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope.    In particular, the investigators expect to get information on atmospheric structure and the abundances of the trace constituents ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water; the presence or lack of discernible features associated with the impacts; and the penetration depths of the individual fragments.  Furthermore, this research is expected to improve our understanding of the response of the Jovian magnetosphere to dust loading and shocking, and the time-scales for transport of injected material and relaxation of the various physical perturbations.  **",
