The vision of the ERC is to improve performance of  electronic products significantly while simultaneously reducing  size and cost.  The objectives of the ERC are:  (1) to carry-out  research, development and prototype manufacturing in low-cost,  high-performance, and portable electronic packages consistent with  industry needs, (2) to transfer this knowledge to industry, and (3)  to train future leaders by educating students, industrial  personnel, and faculty from Georgia Institute of Technology and  other institutions.  The essential components of the ERC are  research, partnerships with industry, education, and technology  transfer.  The research thrusts include:  (1) package design and  modeling, (2) low-cost micro-chip module (MCM) based on novel  materials, processing, and large area planarization, (3) MCMs with  integrated passive and active devices, (4) MCMs with integrated  optoelectronic components, (5) novel interconnect materials and  processing tools, (6) assembly, (7) testing including built-in self  test for mixed-signal designs and fault location.  (8) thermal  management, and (9) large-area prototype manufacturing.       The electronics industry is built on the following technology  elements:  semiconductor chips, electronic packages, power sources,  displays, and the systems that are formed through integration.  The  United States leads in the design of computers, telecommunication  system, and the use of electronics in most industrial and  commercial applications.  The United States trails in consumer  electronics, and is increasingly dependent on non-domestic sources  for electronic packages and production equipment.  Electronic  packaging is one of the most important strategic technologies in  electronics.  The ERC will have a major impact on education of  students in this important topic.  The Georgia Institute of   Technology is among the largest producers of electrical,  mechanical, and industrial engineering students in the United  States.  This ERC will expose undergraduate, graduate and post-  graduate students to this area of high national economic  importance.       This award initiates the ERC with a 5-year cooperative  agreement.  ***",
