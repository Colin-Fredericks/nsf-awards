In order for these laser systems to achieve the output powers, efficiency, beam quality, reliability, and the small size and weight required, they must be solid state fiber systems.  The most efficient source for pumping these laser systems is the diode laser where 50% efficiencies are now possible.  Further, in order to efficiently couple the pump light from laser diodes into the laser and to efficiently extract both the laser output power and any heat generated, a fiber laser system is demanded.  LaserGenics Corporation has grown fibers of titanium doped A1203, YA103, and MgA1204 by the laser heated pedestal-growth technique during our Phase I effort.  These materials are very attractive as tunable laser sources from the near IR to the near UV.  During the Phase II effort we will further optimize the growth of MgA1204 fibers, develop cladding materials and techniques for the three types of single crystal fibers we have grown, construct a tunable fiber laser breadboard system using these fibers and test this system with these fibers and report these results.  ***",
