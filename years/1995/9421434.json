 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports  research by Dr. Lisa McElwee-White of the Chemistry Department, University of Florida,  on the use of metal carbynes in organic synthesis.  New routes to seven- and eight-membered  metallacycles, cyclobutanones, fused vinylcyclopropanes, furans, oligomers, and other  products will be developed.  Radical cation and carbene intermediates are formed during  photolysis of molybdenum and tungsten carbynes.  After rearrangement and loss of the  carbyne ligand, generation of a variety of organic products is possible.  For example,  complexes with carbyne substituents which contain tethered olefins and dienes can trap the  intermediates by intramolecular ene reaction, cyclopropanation, metathesis or  4+2   cycloaddition.  Carbon-carbon bond formation by attack of the radical cations on unsaturated  species can also be exploited, as can intramolecular trapping to yield cyclized products.    Organometallic compounds in which the metal is bound to carbon by a triple bond are called  carbynes.  Although much is known about the reactions of these compounds, they have not  been used in organic synthesis.  In this research, a wide variety of cyclic organic compounds  will be prepared using this approach, which may offer a simple route to many complex  organic structures.",
