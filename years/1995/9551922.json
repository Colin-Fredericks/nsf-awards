These Bio LabStations have been  developed in the Computer Resource Center for courses taught to  biology majors.  With some modification of the experiments  carried out with them, they can be used for these courses, as  well.  These Bio LabStations replace several pieces of equipment:  physiographs, oscilloscopes, pH meters, and oxygen meters, and  their function far surpasses that of this conventional equipment.   Although data can be collected with the conventional equipment,  the Bio LabStations not only perform this function, but they also  permit analysis of data, elaborate upon and extend the data  collection process, simulate living systems and processes,  deliver instruction, and provide for review and some testing.   They have the further advantage of presenting to the students one  basic apparatus to be mastered, rather than several.  Not having  to adjust to entirely new equipment with each new experiment  should enable them to focus better on the point of each  experiment.",
