This years conference promises to continue  this high standard while covering the subjects of interest  to the Ocean Engineering community.  In addition, the  Conference will cover subjects of interest to the other  programs in the Division.  These include computer controlled  surgery, telemedicine, environmental monitoring and control,  and teleoperations.  It is important to have participants  from the United States.    Professor Thorpe has been active in the field of autonomous  undersea vehicles and is considered an outstanding  researcher.  He has participated in several activities  sponsored by the Ocean Engineering Program and can glean  relevant information as well as contribute to the  Conference.  His paper on the future of Mobile Robotics will  be an important part of the Conference  ***",
