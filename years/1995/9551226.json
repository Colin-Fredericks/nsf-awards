 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university has identified the need to provide real-life field  experiences using modern data gathering equipment for the Biology  and Environmental Physical Science classes.   This project adds a  global positioning system (GPS) component to the laboratory  sections of seven classes that have a field component.   The  classes team Plant Taxonomy/Agrostology students with Ecology  students for vegetation identification and mapping exercises.    Environmental Geology, Environmental Geochemistry, and  Hydrogeology students compile geologic and hydrologic data to map  potential land use and to determine sources and movements of  pollutants.   Students present their results at joint poster  sessions at the conclusion of the semester.   Selected students  present their results at regional meetings or at the Council on  Undergraduate Research meeting.     Field sites are being chosen  in conjunction with the U.S.   Forest Service; the South Dakota  Game, Fish, and Parks Department; and The Nature Conservancy.    Field data generated by the classes are being shared with these  and any other interested institutions.",
