Continuous Krein space operators have natural isometric and   unitary extensions, allowing a reduction of the study of general   operators to a more tractable case. New tools in the form of   index formulas give conditions for the existence of   factorizations. A new form of the Krein space commutant lifting   theorem is sought which has applications similar to the Hilbert   space case. A related prmblem is to develop a unified algebraic   and analytic theory of the Krein space Schur class of   operator-valued holomorphic functions. This part is in   collaboration with several European colleagues and features   colligations to study indefinite kernels and reproducing kernel   Krein spaces.   Examples from interpolation theory and univalent   functions will be considered. Factorization properties of   selfadjoint operators on Krein spaces will be applied to the   study of hyperinvariant subspaces. Other areas of application   include compact perturbations of selfadjoint operators and a   search for a Weyl-von Neumann theorem in Krein spaces. Numerical   techniques will be used in combination with recent decompositions   for finite matrices in an effort to obtain information on the   general form of numerical range for finite-dimensional spaces.       Interpolation problems and linear systems have long been   important in pure and applied mathematics, as well as in   technology.  It is only recently that mathematicians have been   looking into the possibility of generalizations to new settings   such as indefinite inner product spaces.  Preliminary results   indicate that this line of investigation could turn out to be as   fruitful as the classical theory has been.  The problems   naturally raise new questions about other areas of operator   theory on indefinite inner product spaces.  These have to do with   structural properties of operators such a s invariant subspaces   and numerical ranges.  Connections with related areas of   mathematics such as coefficient problems in classical complex   analysis will also be explored.    ***",
