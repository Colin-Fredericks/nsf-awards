Ollis                                     DUE 9550927  North Carolina State University                    FY1995 $ 200,000  Raleigh, NC  27695-7905                            ILI - Leadership in                                                      Laboratory Development:                                                      Engineering    Title: Freshman Laboratory for Product and Process Engineering      A Product and Process Engineering laboratory has been established  for freshmen engineering students. The purpose of the laboratory is  to bring students together in teams of three in order to explore  fully operative, familiar devices (e.g., videocamera, videocassette  recorder, photocopier, bar code scanner) by playing the successive  roles of user, assembler, and engineer analyst. The lab places  emphasis on a \"hands-on\" approach to each device and on working in  teams. Results from pilot offerings in summer '93(12 students) and  '94(18 students) indicate that this method creates an atmosphere in  which students teach each other effectively, and in which women and  minorities feel very comfortable and receive a positive and  inclusive introduction to engineering.    The objective of the project is the demonstration of a cost  efficient manpower design and scale-up of this novel freshmen  laboratory to handle a full cohort of up to 216 students per year  for two years. Three 24 student sections/semester are offered in  '95-'96 and five sections/semester in '96-'97.    The method of laboratory execution involves roles for students,  undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants, and the faculty  director. The students, working in teams of three, examine each of  six devices or processes. The senior undergraduates  provide lab  assistance and are selected so that they serve as role models for  women and minority freshmen. The graduate teaching assistant (one  per section) has general instruction and lab maintenance  responsibilities for each section, and  serves as back-up technica l  consultant to the seniors. The faculty leader  provides an initial  week of hands-on training of seniors and graduate assistants with  the lab devices prior to each semester, and leads the student  discussion sections on outside readings, and  maintains oversight  of the laboratory operations.    The project is significant because it provides an immediate  \"hands-on\" introduction to engineering to freshmen students in a  manner which includes teamwork, oral communication and presentation  skills, and is conducive to the recruitment and retention of  underrepresented groups.",
