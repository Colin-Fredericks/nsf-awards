 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marker-propagation networks (MPNs) represent a powerful  computational model especially suitable for artificial  intelligence and other  applications where information is often  uncertain and incompletely specified.  MPNs refer to networks of  active nodes and labeled links.  The power and  novelty of this  model derives from the fact that the processing instruments are  programmable data patterns of flexible length called markers.  Node processing  is activated by the arrival of markers.  Marker  propagations through the  network are not driven by destination  addresses, instead, they depend on local  conditions in the nodes,  network topology and the information programmed in  each marker.  This is a major difference between MPNs and other parallel  processing models, and it is the reason why MPNs are capable of  handling weakly  or incompletely specified applications.    Previous work in the area of  marker--propagation processing  assumed much simpler models.  The model studied  in this project  operates asynchronously, and is highly programmable.  Some of  the  critical issues related to the implementation of MPNs on existing  parallel  computers are possible programming paradigms, sources of  parallelism, load  balancing, design tradeoffs, and others.    The approach taken in this project  is a quantitative one, meaning  that the model is implemented on several  parallel computers,  performance is measured and the results compared.    The  MPN model offers scalability and has the potential of being a  preferred  architecture for future supercomputers dedicated to  knowledge processing  applications.",
