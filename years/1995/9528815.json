 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528815   Schlesinger   This research on mineral processing will assess the interaction of molten slags, mattes, and copper metal with potential replacement refractories for the \"mag-chrome\" materials currently used in nearly all primary and secondary copper production furnaces.  Spent mag-chrome refractories have been labeled as hazardous wastes and no metals industry is currently as dependent on them as the operators of copper smelter, converters, and fire-refining furnaces.  Two potential replacement systems have been identified:  \"mag-doloma\" refractories from the magnesia-calcia system, and \"mag-spinel\" or \"alumina-spinel\" compositions from the magnesia-alumina system.  Process mineralogy techniques will be used to examine the actual mechanisms of attack of replacement refractories by the molten phases employed in the production of copper metal, both from primary ores and scrap.  By establishing a working relationship with an Extractive Metallurgy Research Center in Australia, optimal use of the US University's strengths in process mineralogy and refractories research, and the Australian expertise in melt chemistry and high-temperature thermodynamics can be realized.    Iron, copper, and aluminum are major primary metals manufactured all over the world.  Refractories containing chromium are used heavily in both iron and copper production.  However, chromium poses a disposal problem for used refractories.  This international research effort has the potential to eliminate one more hazardous \"landfill\" problem.",
