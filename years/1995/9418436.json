 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid progress has been made in the past few years towards  understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms  controlling flower development.  These studies have  identified early-acting genes that specify the identity of  floral meristems, and later-acting genes that determine the  fate of floral organ primordia.  One family of genes that  has emerged as playing a major role in flower development  are the MADS-box genes, which encode putative transcription  factors.  Indeed, five different Arabidopsis MADS-box genes,  APETALA1, CAULIFLOWER, AGAMOUS, APETALA3, and PISTILLATA,  have been characterized in terms of their roles in  specifying both floral meristem and organ identity.  Furthermore, MADS-box genes have documented roles in  regulating gene expression in diverse organisms, including  humans, Drosophila, and yeast.  The focus of this proposal  is on the further characterization of three recently  published MADS-box genes (AGL4-6), on nine additional genes  that were recently isolated (AGL8-9 and AGL11-17), and on  the isolation and characterization of additional members of  this important gene family in Arabidopsis.  To identify new  MADS-box genes, PCR amplifications and low stringency  hybridizations will be used.  Full length cDNA and genomic  clones will be isolated and sequenced, and deduced protein  products will be compared to those already identified to  look at evolutionary relationships.  RFLP mapping will  determine if the cloned gene maps near a previously  identified mutation.  RNA blotting and in situ  hybridizations in wild type and mutant plants will define  the temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression, and  provide insights into the regulatory interactions between  these and other genetic loci.  Transgenic plants that  express sense and antisense RNAs will be generated by  Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, followed by targeted  EMS mutant screens to identify candidate mutations in cloned  loci.  Preliminary results from these experiments support  the hypothe sis that MADS-box genes play important and  diverse roles in plant development.  Characterization of  MADS-box genes will provide insights into the roles and  evolution of this important gene family in Arabidopsis, and  will contribute to our understanding of related genes in  distantly related plants and other organisms.",
