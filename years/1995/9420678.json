 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420678  Lizotte  Research on Ocean-Atmosphere Variability and Ecosystem Response  in the Ross Sea (ROAVERRS)    This project describes an interdisciplinary study of meteorologic  forcing phenomena, sea ice dynamics, ocean hydrography, primary  productivity, and benthic-pelagic coupling in the southwestern  Ross Sea, Antarctica.  The primary goal is to examine how changes  in aspects of the polar climate system, in this case wind and  temperature, influence marine productivity on a large Antarctic  continental shelf.  In the Ross Sea, winds off the continent and  mesocyclones influence the spatial and temporal distribution of  ice cover as well as upper ocean mixed-layer depth and thus  control primary production in sea ice and open water systems.   The structure, standing stock and productivity of bottom-dwelling  biological communities are also linked to meteorologic processes  through interseasonal and interannual variation in horizontal and  vertical fluxes of organic carbon produced in the upper ocean.   Linkages between atmospheric, oceanographic, and biological  systems will be investigate during a two and half year field  study of the southwestern Ross Sea ecosystem.  Direct  measurements include:  (1) regional wind and air temperature, (2)  ice cover, ice movement, and sea surface temperature, (3)  hydrographic characteristics of the upper ocean and primary  productivity in sea ice and upper water column, (4) vertical flux  of organic materials and ocean circulation, and (5) abundance,  distribution, and respiration rates of biological communities on  the sea floor.  Based on archived meteorologic data, these  scientists expect that atmospheric variability during the study  period will allow them to monitor changes in airflow patterns in  the southwestern Ross Sea and to determine their influence on  oceanographic and biological patterns.  This study will  contribute to our knowledge of atmospheric and oceanographic  forcing of polar marine ecosystems, and hence lead to a better  unders tanding of the polar marine ecosystem response to climate  variability.",
