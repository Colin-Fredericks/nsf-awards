This work is not only of basic scientific interest, but is also relevant to a broad range of technologies including detergency, microelectronics, nanoparticle synthesis, food, pharmaceutical and biotechnology.  Dynamic properties of micelles such as relaxation time measurements by pressure-jump, temperature-jump, stopped-flow, ultrasonic absorption, shock wave, etc.  have produced very valuable information about the relaxation processes in micellar solutions as well as for the life-time of micelles.  During the past twenty-five years, microemulsions have been shown to be relevant to enhanced oil recovery, and preparation of nanoparticles of magnetic materials, silver halides, electronic materials and superconductops.  Many reactions such as polymerization in microemulsions have also been shown to be very promising for the formation of submicron latex particles.  In the area of monomolecular films, many novel techniques have been designed to study such systems (such as STM, AFM, Brewster Angle Microscopy, absorption spectroscopy, etc.)    An International Symposium on this topic will be organized with funding from the University of Florida, National Science Foundation, industry and participants in the form of registration fees.  About thirty graduate students and post doctoral associates from universities in the United States will be invited to participate in this symposium.  There will be three plenary speakers, and twenty invited speakers as well as many oral and poster presentations on these three topics.    At the end of the symposium, a half-day workshop will be organized.  This will be attended by a panel of world class researchers chosen from among the invited speakers.  The workshop will be organized into three groups:  micelles, microemulsions, and monolayers.  Each group will summarize the quarter century progress made in that area, and list the new ho rizons as presented in the symposium.  These summaries will be compiled by the Principal Investigator (Dr. Shah) and will form the basis for the final report to be submitted to the National Science Foundation.  This report will also include a description of the scientific and technological relevance of various  topics discussed in the symposium.    The symposium will be held August 28-31,1995, at the University of Florida.  The first three days of the symposium will include the invited talks and general papers in all three areas.  The fourth half day will be devoted to the workshop.  ***",
