 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major recent thrust in research has  focused on ecosystem emission, deposition, and           uptake of greenhouse and trace gases. This research  is needed because predictions forecast that           a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) will have a  significant impact on ecosystem processes and           productivity, and because the natural emission or  deposition of gases is critical in regulating air           pollution. To achieve understanding of processes in  both areas, efforts are being made to           evaluate the effect of alteration od ecosystems in  the vicinity of industrial, urban, and agricultural           areas. As a result, many scientific and government  agencies have formed programs to support           research on the interaction between the soil,  biosphere, and atmosphere in relation to greenhouse           and trace gas production, consumption, or  deposition.                 Duke University proposes to develop a mobile  laboratory that will be used for both basic           and more applied research on the mechanisms of the  emission and uptake of gases between the           soil-biosphere and the atmosphere. The integrated  laboratory will include state-of the art trace           gas analyzers, water vapor and CO2 gas analyzers,  ultra-sonic anemometers, leaf-level           porometery, a geoprobe, time domain reflectometers,  xylem heat flux systems, and a wide range           of environmental monitoring devices such as net  radiometers, short and long-wave radiation           sensors. The data from this instrument array will  be collected by a central work station within           the mobile laboratory. Instruments will be housed  in a research vehicle containing two movable           towers and a soil probe which will permit a rapid  installation of the sensors at remote sites high           in tree canopies and deep in the soil regolith. The  great advantage of a mobile facility is that           it can support research at many experimental s ites  and can be used concurrently for several           projects, each of which requires periodic gas flux  measurements rather than continuous           monitoring.                 With its flexibility and enhanced  capabilities, this facility will allow researchers both           within the School of the Environment and throughout  the research community to address key           scientific questions that range across the  physical, biological, and chemical sciences in new           ways. It will enhance the investigation of such  fundamental questions as 1) how environmental           conditions (e.g., mean meteorological conditions,  energy, and moisture content) control leaf-           level gas diffusion, 2) how the air flow inside the  forest canopy interacts with the air flow above           the car,opy to disperse or deposit greenhouse and  trace gases, 3) how atmospheric pressure and           subsurface soil processes control gas and moisture  storage and flux in a variety of ecosystems.           Questions about the amount of biogenic or other  trace gases emitted or consumed by ecosystems           will be directly measured by the equipment  requested for this facility.                 We believe that the mobile laboratory will  have a profound impact not only on the           interdisciplinary research but on teaching at Duke  University's new School of the Environment.           Students interested in ecology, biogeochemistry,  ecotoxicology, water resources, air quality,           forestry, and wetlands will benefit from the  opportunities of using the new technology in           research projects and coursework, analyzing data  from a wide range of ecosystems, and           acquiring experience in multidisciplinary field  experiments. These students include           undergraduate environmental science majors, young  graduate-level environmental management           students, mid-career professionals in Duke's  continuing education program, and future Ph.D           researchers.  Finally, we expect that the laboratory  will attract further funding from DOE and           EPA and open new sources for funding from private  industry research interests, the Forest           Service, the Agriculture Research Service of the  United States Department of Agriculture           (USDA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).",
