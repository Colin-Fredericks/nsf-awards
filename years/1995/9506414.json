 "awd_abstract_narration": "Model-based object recognition is a popular and difficult subfield  of computer vision research. The problem of model-based recognition  of free-form objects is addressed in this project. This problem has  many practical ramifications and robust solutions will be  applicable in areas including modern manufacturing and autonomous  navigation. Prior work in model-based recognition will be used to  develop representations for 3D objects which are suitable for use  in recognition, prototype recognition strategies with an explicit  goal of efficiency, and disseminate their research results in the  standard forms, including electronic archives available over the  Internet. The project has the following major components: (1)  Development of an object representation strategy for free-form  objects suitable for both image synthesis and object recognition.  Point-based representations are considered along with surface  triangulations. (2) Development of a recognition and localization  technique based on the representation strategy chosen. An  industrial collaboration will allow the PI to obtain  variable-resolution triangulation-based models of free-form objects  from real range data obtained from real sensors. A small tabletop  three-axis mill will be used to fabricate prototypes of free-form  objects from CAD designs.",
