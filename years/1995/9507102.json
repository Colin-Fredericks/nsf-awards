A major aim is to determine the complete molecular  structure of the adenovirus virion. In previous work, the  high resolution X ray crystallographic structure of trimeric hexon  (polypeptide ll), the major coat protein, was used to interpret  images from electron microscopy (EM) and develop a model of the  capsid. A three dimensional image reconstruction using cryo EM then  revealed the virion at 35 A resolution. As the shape of the EM  hexon is in excellent agreement with that seen by X rays, images  from the two methods could be combined to produce difference  images. These defined the shapes and locations of the vertex  proteins, penton base (Ill), and fiber (IV), and three minor  \"cementing\" proteins (Illa, Vl, and IX). The current project  continues the attack on this challenging structural problem. High  resolution EM data will be collected to extend the resolution of  the reconstruction. Novel maximum entropy refinement methods will  be used to improve the reconstructed image and obtain more accurate  difference images. The hexon positions in the capsid will be  refined and their interactions analyzed to understand the chemical  forces important for hexon hexon recognition and stability of the  virion. The adenovirus study emphasizes that cementing proteins are  an important new class that has received little previous attention.  These proteins resolve the conflicting requirements for weak  interactions between the components of a large macromolecular  structure to ensure its accurate assembly, and for the strong  bonding necessary for its ultimate stability. Their use in viruses  suggests that novel \"anti structural\" drugs could act by  stabilizing a virus particle to prevent uncoating, or destabilizing  the particle to make it vulnerable to denaturing force s in the  environment. The combined approach will be extended to a second  viral system, bacteriophage PRD1, that has an unusual internal  membrane. PRD1 shows remarkable similarities with adenovirus in its  capsid packing and the shape of the major coat protein, P3. The  crystal structure of P3 will be determined and correlated with the  emerging EM structure of PRD1.  %%%  The overall goals are to explore the principles by which mammalian  viruses are constructed from their constituent proteins, and to  develop methods for imaging very large biological structures at  high resolution.
