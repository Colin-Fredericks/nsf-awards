 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop a variable flow sea water flume and high-speed  video imaging system for studies of feeding, dispersal and locomotion  in moving fluids. A sea water flume and video system in the Department  of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology will assist the research/education  programs of the Marine Ecology group (Bertness and Witman) and the  Vertebrate Morphology group (Goslow and Swartz). Water flow plays an  important role in mediating ecological interactions. The specifics of  this mediation are largely unknown, however, and their elucidation  remain a major research focus of Bertness,Witman, and their students. A  sea water flume with variable water flow rate and volume and a means  for documenting rapidly occurring biological response will enable  studies of the effects of internal waves, variable food supply and  temperature on populations of suspension-feeding invertebrate animals.  The system will also facilitate studies of the way(s) marine predators  respond to increasing water flow under controlled conditions.  Vertebrate animals are also affected by their physical environment  which is reflected in body shape and locomotor style. The mechanisms by  which morphology is shaped by physical parameters is the focus of the  research programs of Goslow, Swartz and their students. For example, a  group of seabirds, the 'wing-propelled' divers, use their wings to  'fly' underwater as well as in the air; an ability which necessitates  some evolutionary compromises for one if not both media. Among fishes  and marine mammals, considerable diversity of body form, fin shape,  bone structure and locomotor pattern exists which can only be  understood by careful manipulative studies. A flume with controlled  flow characteristics which is instrumented to monitor the water column  and the locomotor movements of the organisms under investigation will  provide a focus for training students in modern manipulative studies  designed to determine the evolution of complex forms.",
