 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500258  Shalaev  Theoretical research will be conducted on optical processes  in fractal aggregates and in self-affine thin films.  These  objects exhibit fascinating optical phenomena including huge  enhancements of Raman scattering and optical phase  conjugation signals.  Optical modes in fractal objects  appear to be strongly localized within ranges which are  significantly less than the wavelength.  The research will  study these localized modes and the near-field structures  associated with them.  The localization of the optical  excitations in fractals results in regions of high local  fields leading to an enhancement of a number of optical  processes.  Because the nonlinear optical efficiency is so  greatly enhanced in fractal aggregates of nano-particles and  on self-affine surfaces, there is significant interest in  developing them as a new class of optical and optoelectronic  materialq.  The research brings together two evolving  fields, the optics of nano-composites and near-field optical  microscopy.  These fields are inherently connected in the  case of fractals.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on the nonlinear  optical properties of aggregates of metallic particles and  on rough thin films which are characterized by fractal  dimensions - that is dimensions which are other than the  usual two-and three-dimension which we are accustomed to.  Besides looking at the fundamental behavior of these novel  materials, potential device applications will be explored.  ***",
