 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422440  Henderson    This project has two interrelated parts.  The first examines the  effect of air quality regulation on decisions of firms concerning  the location of their plants, the scheduling of production, and  the size of their plants.  The project tests the hypotheses that  implementation of air quality regulations has led firms to move  plants from more polluted locations to less polluted locations,  move plants from states with more intense implementation of  regulations to those with easier conditions, implicitly  reschedule economic activity over the course of the day to help  minimize extreme value air quality readings, and downsize plants  to avoid regulatory scrutiny.  The results of this study will  improve our understanding of the unintended and overall effects  of environmental regulatory activity.  Specifically, the  investigation will help show whether the Clean Air Act reduces  emissions or just moves them around.      The second part involves a more extensive examination of plant  productivity determinants and location decisions of firms.  The  focus of the work is first on establishing the existence of  dynamic externalities which help bind clusters of plants to the  same locations over the years and then on quantifying the  magnitude and length (lag structure) to dynamic externalities.   Dynamic externalities are a critical component to determining the  mobility and productivity of plants and to understanding the  organization of production across space and within corporations.  This project uses EPA and County Business Patterns data collected  under prior NSF projects and longitudinal individual firm and  plant data, available through the EPA and through the Center for  Economic Studies (CES) of the Census Bureau in the Research Data  Center at the Boston regional office.",
