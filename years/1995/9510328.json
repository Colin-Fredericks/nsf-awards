 "awd_abstract_narration": "A state of flux exists when organizations can be characterized by frequent changing of roles and titles, high rates of personnel turnover, task force organizing based on critical expertise, and a lack of bureaucratic hiearachy.  Under these conditions, ad hoc organizations may form in response to rapidly changing situations.      This award supports a Research Planning Grant to formalize a set of research questions and conduct a preliminary study into the processes underlying the establishment of ad hoc organizations within governments.   This RPG will assess the feasibility of collecting information on the fit between the operation of governmental organizations and the organizational theory of ad hoc groups.  If appropriate, a detailied research plan will follow. The specific focus of the planning grant is on the operations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and their responses to unanticipated events such as the Los Angeles/Northridge earthquake of November 8, 1993.",
