Documentation of porphyry-  epithermal transitions is difficult because most districts  lack exposure of the deep plutonic source region.  The  district was chosen because of excellent exposures of these  many ore-types and because in many localities they are  superimposed, allowing determination of relative age.  Absolute timing of igneous and hydrothermal events will be  documented by high precision Ar-Ar age dating in the context  of mapped cross-cutting relations.  Geochemical factors  affecting fluid evolution and the partitioning of Cu and Au  between different environments, will be assessed by detailed  field mapping and core logging, and by petrographic,  analytical, and fluid inclusion studies in conjunction with  data on phase equilibria.  Deposits known as \"Cordilleran  base-metal lodes\", are superimposed on, and genetically  linked to, porphyry copper deposits.  Less well known are  the analogous lode deposits, also porphyry-related, that  occur in carbonate wall rocks.  This deposit type, and its  link to proximal skarn and to distal quartz-pyrite-gold  replacement deposits will be studies in the Superior  district, Arizona by similar methods.  Results of this  research will contribute to the understanding of sources and  physiochemical evolution of crustal fluids linked to  subvolcanic environments.",
