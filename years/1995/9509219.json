Viral model systems have been very useful in elucidating the elements involved in transcriptional regulation. Human cytomegalovirus provides an excellent model for the study of transcriptional regulation. One viral protein, pp71, is a novel transcriptional activator; activating a viral promoter through multiple copies of an Ap 1 binding site as well as additional as yet unidentified sequences. This project will identify the additional sequences that contribute to promoter activation by pp71. During this planning activity, deletion and mutagenesis analyses will be performed to identify the second target elements involved in pp71 transactivation.  A full research proposal will be submitted using this preliminary work as a foundation for the investigation of the mechanism of transcription activation. %%% The appropriate expression of specialized proteins is required for differentiation and development. Signals that control the expression of special ized proteins can be identified and have been identified in large part by using viruses as model systems. One human herpes virus, human cytomegalovirus, provides a particularly useful model system for investigating the controls that determine protein expression. A novel viral regulatory protein, pp71, has been identified in human cytomegalovirus. pp71 along with other control elements and proteins influences the amount of viral protein production. Identification of the other control elements and proteins will further the understanding of regulatory processes in general and will allow examination of additional systems to see if these mechanisms are commonly utilized.  This planning activity will provide the foundation for a full proposal to study the mechanism of pp71 transcription activation. ***                                 @                                                                                                                                                       ....()()))()()                                                        S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       marcia steinberg                    marcia steinberg            @        @                          @                                   @        C                                                                                                   @     q                                     Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     e =       e                                                                               \"       \"   \"       \"       \"       \"       \"       L       L       L       L       L       d       n       L           C   x       |       |       |       |       |       |       |                                   #           h               Y   T       4                           \"       |                 |       |                       |       |               |       \"       \"       |                       x       |       |       |       |       \"       |       \"       |                               6       >       \"       \"       \"       \"       |               |   7   |                                                                                             9509219 Biegalke Alteration of the transcriptional activity of promoters is a major mechanism used to control the resulting amount of gene product produced.
