 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integration of innovative investigations into undergraduate  microbiology, zoology, and plant biology laboratories is occurring  through the acquisition of a computer-interfaced Lecia Stereocan 420  scanning electron microscope (SEM).   Innovative investigations enable  undergraduate students to (1) utilize the scientific method in  designing experiments, (2) master new technologies, (3) obtain  qualitative and quantitative data, (4) develop conclusions based on  data, (5) understand the principles of specimen collection and  preparation, (6) understand the principles of SEM operation, and (7)  develop expertise in SEM operation.   Undergraduate students can use  the instrument in Introductory Microbiology, Ornithology, Comparative  Vertebrate Anatomy, Plant Physiology, Plant Anatomy, Scanning Electron  Microscopy, and Independent Study as part of required laboratory  exercises.   SEM exercises are being integrated into existing  laboratory schedules designed to (1) teach concepts, sample  preparation, and analyses and (2) to interest students with information  and research opportunities that are revealed by utilization of the  instrument.   Students are given hands-on experience utilizing the SEM  to study micromorphological characteristics of bacterial isolates,  mallophagous mites of birds, effects of heavy metal containing  wastewater on root hair development and nodule formation in legumes,  quantitative assessment of sunken glandular trichomes in sweet basil  treated with or without natural pesticides, evaluation of organelle  purity obtained by density gradient centrifugation of soybean extracts,  and surface modification in avian epidermal pore structure.   Students  can acquire knowledge in data analysis, instrumental \"know-how,\" and  state-of-the-art training needed to enter the job market as confident  and productive scientists.",
