 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratories, where students work in small groups, are ideally  suited to enhancing students' analytical skills.   Therefore,  this project (1) improves the quality of data gathered by  students in physiology and animal behavior laboratories, (2)  increases computer competency, and (3) improves critical thinking  skills by placing students into small discussion groups to decide  experimental protocol for each laboratory exercise.   The  majority of students affected by this project are majors in  biology and applied science, an interdisciplinary program that  prepares students for graduate programs in allied health fields.    This project funds the purchase of eight notebook computers  together with inkjet printers and appropriate software so that  students can collect and analyze data on physiological phenomena  such as skin temperature, lung volumes, muscle contraction, heart  rate/pulse, and small animal metabolism.   In one senior-level  class, Animal Physiology, the computers and printers can be  checked out to the students for the semester to use in  individually designed research projects.   In animal behavior  laboratories, the portability of the notebook computers  facilitates data collection in the field.   Because notebook  computers are so easily transferred among laboratory rooms, it is  expected that up to 200 students in 35 laboratories in 7  different courses may benefit from the equipment.",
