 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summer undergraduate research opportunities in the  Department of Biological Sciences at Wellesley College, an  undergraduate college for women, will be offered for three  summers.  Participants will be selected from Biology,  Biological Chemistry or Psychobiology majors who have  serious purpose and definite interest in independent work,  have sufficient course preparation and have shown ability to  think imaginatively and independently.  Participants will be  selected by the project director and faculty committee after  evaluation of application forms designed to recruit the most  qualified student.  The student will participate in all  aspects of the investigation, from pursuing a literature  review to carrying out experimental procedures and  observations, continuing to analysis of data and  determination of conclusions.  The student will formally and  informally discuss the work with her advisor, and also will  prepare discussions with all participants, both student and  faculty, for weekly group seminars.  This will encourage  both experience with oral presentations and exposure to  suggestions and criticism of other researchers.  A poster  session will end the summer's work.  Throughout the summer,  seminars and workshops will be presented by women scientists  in graduate school and in research careers; field trips to  biotechnology and chemical companies will be taken.  An  ethics component will be shared with REU students from  Boston University, and joint seminars and field trips have  been planned with this regional institution and with the  University of Massachusetts Boston campus.",
