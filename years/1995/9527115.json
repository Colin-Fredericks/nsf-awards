Three sites will be used: (1) the  Hopland Field Station in northern California where field and laboratory studies on lizard malaria have  been underway for 17 years, (2) the Luquillo LTER site in Puerto Rico where preliminary data were  gathered, and (3) the eastern Caribbean island of Saba where other recent surveys have been conducted.  The broad goal of this project is to continue studies at all three sites for at least the next decade.  The research will examine the distribution, abundance, sex ratio, and interspecific interactions in  three species of malarial parasites in lizard hosts. One species of malaria infects the western fence  lizard in California. The ecology of this species is perhaps the best known of any non-human malaria.  Two other malaria species coexist in the Caribbean. Parasite abundance, sex ratio, and interspecific  associations all interact over ecological and evolutionary time. These long-term studies will provide  the necessary base-line data for understanding this host-p arasite system.   Three issues will be  addressed. First, the distribution and abundance of the parasites will be followed over time and  compared among sites. Classical and recent models of parasite prevalence will be explored with these  data. Second, recent theory on sex ratios of malarial gametocytes will be tested by taking advantage  of the different levels of prevalence at the tropical and temperate sites and as parasite prevalence  changes over time. Third, interspecific interaction, especially facilitation, will be explored for the  two coexisting species of malarial parasites at the two tropical sites. The relative and absolute  abundances of the two parasites could effect interactions between the lizards.   Malarial parasites  are a diverse, geographically widespread group. Their importance to the biology, including population  biology, of humans is well documented. Studies on lizard malaria now suggest that Plasmodium can be of  central importance to non-human hosts as well, including population and even community-level effects.  The Anolis lizards of Caribbean islands are extremely abundant and influence the entire biotic  environment because of their diet of insects. Thus, lizard malaria can stand as a model system to  study host-parasite ecology and its impacts on other aspects of the biota.",
