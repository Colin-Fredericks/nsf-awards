 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a three year program to investigate  the response of ice domes, such as Siple Dome in West Antarctica,  to changing boundary conditions, for example as arising from  fluctuations in thickness or position of bounding ice streams.  A  range of models will be used, from simple one-dimensional  analytical models to coupled dynamic-thermodynamic flow models,  to investigate the response of the ice dome to boundary forcing,  and the record that boundary forcing can leave in the ice core  record.  Using radar, temperature, and ice core data from the  currently funded field programs on Siple Dome, and ice flux and  thickness values from the map view model as boundary conditions,  a flow line across Siple Dome will be studied and possible ranges  of time scales, the likely origin of ice near the bed, and the  basal temperature conditions that exist now and existed in the  past will be determined.The response of internal stratigraphy  patterns to climate and dynamic forcing effects will be  investigated and observed internal layers from ice cores will be  used to infer the forcing history.",
