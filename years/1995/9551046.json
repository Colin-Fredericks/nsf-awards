Over the past decade, with the maturing of Geographic  Information Systems, Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing,  and significant advances in computer modeling, the Department, and  the discipline in general, has seen a dramatic shift in teaching  requirements from traditional geography courses to those which in-  corporate these technological elements.  Geography is currently in  the process of restructuring its offerings in these areas.  UNM has  recognized the importance of these critical areas and has  designated Geography as the primary focal point for the development  and teaching of these technologies.         To achieve this restructuring the department is currently in  the process of upgrading and developing its existing laboratory  facilities.  The support requested in this proposal will form the  core of teaching in the refocused Department of Geography.  The  equipment will be used to improve         a.  Geography Instruction:  The SDAL would become the focal  point for 14 existing or proposed courses.  A conservative estimate  is that over 280 students would have instruction in the SDAL  annually.  UNM's Minority Institution designation insures that  protected groups would be served.         b.  Interdisciplinary Instruction:  Currently GIT is also  utilized in Anthropology, Biology, Geology and Planning at UNM  campus.  The SDAL would serve as a centralized instruction location  as well as providing the resources for inte rdisciplinary teaching  in the physical sciences.",
