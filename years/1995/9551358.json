 "awd_abstract_narration": "Capitalizing on the students' interest in computers and modern  scientific equipment can lead to exciting experiments for the  introductory laboratory.   Microprocessor-based laboratories have  the potential to treat complex and interesting physics problems  at the lower levels through enhanced data taking and analysis and  through computer-aided instruction.   This project introduces  modern physics into the laboratory curriculum of the calculus-  based, the algebra-based, and the \"physics for poets\" levels.    Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics are being taught at these  introductory levels through the use of energy level diagrams and  other conceptual devices.   Spectroscopy and laser physics offer  a way to bring these concepts into the laboratory.   Such  laboratories as lifetime measurements, optogalvanic effect, and  fluorescence studies are being modified for use at these levels.    Monochrometers with computer interfaces and dye lasers serve as  the basis for this request since the microprocessor- based  laboratories are already integrated into the curriculum.   This  project has the potential to affect more than 300 students per  year directly.",
