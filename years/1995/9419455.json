 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419455  Reed       It has long been recognized that the exact timing, location   and severity of local weather events are determined by what is  termed by meteorologist as mesoscale processes.       The Principal Investigator's main objective is to carry out   numerical simulations of mesoscale weather systems in order to  identify key physical processes of three distinct mesoscale  phenomena.  These three phenomena are polar lows (small vortices   that form over polar seas and in intense cases present a hazard to  ship operations), mesoscale convective systems, and fronts.       In the polar low work, a wider range of synoptic situations   and geographic setting will be studied than heretofore with the aim  of understanding how different components of polar low formation  interact under different circumstances.  The research on mesoscale  convection will focus on how model resolution and model  representation of unresolved convection affect the development of  mesoscale convective systems, particularly in the early stages of  oceanic storms.  The frontal work will be concerned mainly with  diagnosing how fronts form in the type of oceanic cyclone that does  not form on a preexisting front , but that creates its own fronts  as it evolves.       Research will be primarily accomplished through numerical  modeling studies conducted in conjunction with scientists from the  National Center for Atmospheric Research.  ***",
