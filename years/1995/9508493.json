This  program of fellowships to individuals provides opportunities  for Fellows to gain additional scientific training beyond  the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative  research into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the  interactions between organisms and their environment at the  molecular, cellular, organismal, population, community,  and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by  the Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National  Science Foundation.  This program is designed to enable  selected scientists early in their careers to improve and  expand their research skills, to direct their research  efforts across traditional disciplinary lines, and to avail  themselves of unique research resources and facilitites,  including foreign locations.    The research and training plan supported by this fellowship  is entitled: Biogeography of soil ciliates: an empirical  approach.",
