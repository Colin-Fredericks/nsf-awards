 "awd_abstract_narration": "#ATM-9508621   Dixon     This project is a continuation of an REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program at NMIMT. It will involve eight faculty members in the fields of atmospheric chemistry and physics and provide eight students per year with an opportunity to participate in research over a period of eight weeks. The program will start with overview seminars and conclude with presentations by the students on their work. A special effort is made to recruit women and minority students from nearby small colleges and universities that have limited research resources. Opportunities for recreational activities will add to the attraction of the program. The following research topics will  be available to the participants:   Cloud physics: Students will be able to participate in field measurements using aircraft to study the formation of large drops and processes leading to precipitation;  Cloud chemistry: Students will participate in the collection of aerosol particles and the measurement of trace species in the samples as well as analysis and interpretation with regard to SO2 oxidation in clouds  Radiative processes: Students will use radiative transfer models to study the influence of clouds and greenhouse gases on climate, and analyze satellite data to determine the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases;  Atmospheric chemistry: Students will conduct laboratory studies on the effect of acid deposition on zooplankton, measure the direct emission of aldehydes and carboxylic acids from plants,  and perform laboratory studies on the effects of electrical discharge on the chemical composition of the local atmosphere;  Atmospheric radioactivity: Students will participate in outdoor measurements of natural Radon isotopes and analyze samples;  Atmospheric electricity: Students will study artificially formed fulgurites (tubes of earth fused by the heat of lightning currents); the effectiveness of different lightning rod designs, and participate in aircraft and balloon measurements of electric  field and precipitation particles in thunderclouds.",
