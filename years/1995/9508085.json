 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508085  Evans         Under this CAREER award, Dr. Evans will examine the relationship between tropical  convection and the large-scale circulation.  It has long been hypothesized that the transports of  heat, moisture and momentum from the tropics to the extratropics, accomplished by tropical  convection, maintain the general circulation.  Dr. Evans further suggests that the degree to  which the convection is organized is determined by what is required to maintain the general  circulation, with highly organized systems playing a large, and necessary, role in maintaining  the Earth's energy balance.  Using satellite-based observations, Dr. Evans will classify various  types of tropical convective systems ranging from short-lived, disorganized convection to highly  organized tropical cyclones and mesoscale convective complexes, and then assess their impact  on the general circulation by analyzing the momentum and energy fluxes.  The analyses will  employ the gridded fields produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting for  a recent field experiment in the tropical Pacific.         Dr. Evans' educational program will focus on the recruitment and retention of talented  women at the graduate and undergraduate level, primarily through her work with the Women  in Science and Engineering Institute at Penn State.  She also will develop a new course on  climate modeling which will include special emphasis on current controversial topics related to  climate systems study and modeling.  ***",
