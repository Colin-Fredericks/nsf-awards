Faculty from nine different departments in  Mathematics, the Sciences, Economics, Politics, and Business have  been working together to establish interdisciplinary initiatives  involving teaching and learning of quantitative skills.  In the  last two years, with support from the Bell South Foundation,  participating faculty have gathered and studied materials on  quantitative problem solving, have created instructional  guidelines, established a resource center, brought in experts as  consultants to address the faculty, established two computer based  classrooms, hired an instructional specialist to work with faculty,  and recruited the first group of students to work with faculty on  the project.  An important component of this project is a summer  seminar for faculty.  This seminar series is being extended  throughout the academic year.  This enables a larger number of  faculty to participate.  The goal is to extend participation to  faculty in all departments.",
