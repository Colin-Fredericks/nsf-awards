 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drennan    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Ms. Maria Cordero will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological excavation at the site of Cayambe, located in the  Quito Basin in highland Ecuador. Prior work at Cayambe indicates  the presence of large hemispherical and quadrilateral mounds  which cover a range of time from ca. A.D. 500 to 1,500. The  mounds - based on information obtained from other sites -   probably served as burial structures. The site almost certainly  represents a chiefdom level of social organization. The main goal  of Ms. Cordero's research is to reconstruct the sequence of  development of hierarchical society at Cayambe, to determine how  this chiefdom emerged and how far back it time its roots go. To  do this, she will determine the extent of the site during  different periods of time and attempt to detect differences in  the spatial patterning of activities in each. She is currently  conducting a systematic intensive surface of the site and  supplementing this with limited excavation. With NSF support she  will increase the number of test pits and the extent of  stratigraphic excavation. One of the hemispherical mounds and one  of the quadrilateral ones will be excavated to determine how they  were constructed and what role they served. Samples will be  collected for radiocarbon dating to obtain a more refined  chronology. Materials collected, especially pottery will be  subjected to detailed analysis.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies emerged  and were maintained. The Cayambe area is particularly interesting  because excellent ethnohistoric data is available and this  provides a solid end point from which to work backwards in time.  What this information indicates is that Cayambe served as a trade  center and a point of entry into the highlands for \"exotic\" goods  from the Amazonian lowlands to the East. Utilizing archaeological  materials, especially one type of ceramics, Ms. Cordero will  study the d evelopment of this trade and relate it to the rise of  the Cayambe chiefdom. This research is important for several  reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists.  It will increase understanding of the processes which led to the  development of complex society and it will assist in the training  of a promising young scientist.",
