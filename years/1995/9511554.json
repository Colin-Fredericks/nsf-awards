 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this program of research, a series of experiments tests a parallel  processing model of social perception and social explanation.  This  model differs sharply from the two-stage, serial processing , models  that currently dominate much social psychology.  One set of studies  seeks to demonstrate that when subjects are combining dispositional and  situational information, whether they underadjust for either  dispositional or situational factors under high cognitive load, and the  extent to which they do so, reflects the impact of attentional focus and  causal unit formation on the spread of activation in a conceptual  network.  Such results would contradict Gilbert's (1989) model of  dispositonal inference and would, at a minimum, force a major expansion  of Krull's (1993) model.  A second set of studies attempts to show that  just as individuals frequently make spontaneous situational inferences,  so do they frequently make spontaneous situaitonal inferences.  These  studies also seek to show that the latter influences do not require a  goal to make such inferences as Krull (1993) suggests, but rather are  under the control of the stimulus configuration.  Several factors are  investigated that may influence the likelihood of spontaneous  situational inferences: (1) individualist vs. collectivist beliefs; (2)  proximity of the situational causal context to the target behavior; and  (3) salience of the situational causal context.  A third set of studies  examines whether situational and dispositional information can be  quickly and spontaneously integrated, in parallel, to make a spontaneous  dispositional inference, thereby arguing against models that propose a  two step process for the integration of dispositional and situational  information.  A fourth set of studies will test the hypothesis that  factors, such as cognitive load and salience which should reduce the  spread of activation from explanations to behavior identifications, will  reduce the impact of explanatory hypotheses on the id entification of  ambiguous behaviors.  This program of research has the potential to  replace several special-purpose 'mini' theories of social explanation  with a general connectionist model that can handle a wide variety of  phenomena.   Figuring out the characteristics of others is central to successfully  negotiating everyday life.  But doing so is surprisingly complicated.   This program of research tests a model which seeks to explain how people  do this.  A central claim of this model is  that when people make  inferences about the causes of behavior, such as \"Sheila was furious\",  the available information is integrated simultaneously into a limited  capacity working memory  rather than being processed serially.  The  implication of this parallel processing of information  is that  the  causal explanation that a person favors (e.g., \"Sheila is short  tempered\" or \"\"Sheila was insulted\") will depend upon things that  influence information integration, such as the person's  focus of  attention, the strength of pre-existing causal links among potential  causes and effects, and how much demand is being placed on the person's  cognitive capacities by other ongoing tasks.  The results will have  important implications for our understanding of biases in social  perception.",
