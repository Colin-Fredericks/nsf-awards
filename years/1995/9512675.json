The context is Northern Ireland.  The project focuses on the globalization of policing strategies originating in the United States and now being adopted by the Northern Ireland police and by other police organizations worldwide.  It seeks to determine how and with what success the Northern Ireland police have sought the support of the Nationalist communities, who have most distrusted them, historically.  It uses data gathered from historical documents, police publications, and interviews with police officers and Nationalist community members.  It will be supplemented by intensive field work in a Nationalist community to illuminate how the history of conflict in Northern Ireland has affected police-community relations.  The study's findings should be relevant to understanding police-community pelations and to the establishment of more effective and accepted political authority in Northern Ireland.  %%%%  This project examines how examines how social diversity and community conflict affect the relationships between communities and the police in an especially difficult context where the police have undertaken reforms designed to gain acceptance for their authority from communities that have historically regarded them as illegitimate.
