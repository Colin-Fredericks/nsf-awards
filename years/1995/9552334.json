 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the university is incorporating in its  curriculum practical work based on capillary electrophoresis  (CE), thus enabling students to gain proficiency in this recently  developed technique.   CE is destined to become an indispensable  analytical separations method because of its unrivaled  efficiency.   The acquisition of this equipment significantly  upgrades the undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry laboratory  programs for B.S.  chemistry and biochemistry majors and B.A.   chemistry majors.   The experiments included in the analytical  chemistry course illustrate the complementary nature of CE to  HPLC by demonstrating its utility where liquid chromatography  fails.   The experiments included in the biochemistry laboratory  courses illustrate the utility of CE in the area of protein  analysis and protein-ligand binding.   An automated unit permits  students to develop awareness of the greatly increased workload  achievable with a state-of-the-art instrument.   It also compels  students to revise their notions concerning the planning and  design of experiments in order to exploit fully the productive  capacity of a computer-controlled instrument.   These curricular  changes enable the university to maintain its excellent record of  training undergraduates, particularly minorities and women, for  research careers in the chemical and biological sciences.",
