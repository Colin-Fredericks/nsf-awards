 "awd_abstract_narration": "As human populations continue to grow and expand, an  increasingly sophisticated scientific response is needed to identify  and protect natural resources. This need is seldom more evident than  in the south Florida region where the growing urban Miami area  encroaches on the adjoining Everglades wilderness. As ecological  scientists, we are challenged to accurately understand the natural  watershed-scale pattern of the Everglades flora, fauna and  biogeochemistry, and how this pattern arises from the interaction of  rainfall, soil, nutrients, fire, preceding history, and increasingly,  human impacts. One way to study these linkages is to use natural  stable isotope tracers that circulate through this large regional  ecosystem. Here we request funds for an advanced isotope ratio mass  spectrometer (IRMS) system to be used by ecosystems researchers at  Florida International University (FIU) to investigate landscape level  changes in the Miami-Everglades region.        Isotope technology has been increasingly adopted by modern  ecosystems research groups to follow the sources and fates of organic  matter as it is produced by plants, consumed by animals and microbes,  and remineralized back to inorganic constituents. The isotopes record  diverse kinds of ecosystem information that range from details of  photosynthesis to predator-prey interactions to emissions of trace  gases such as CO2 and N20. This information often provides important  checks for models based on more conventional estimates of ecosystem  standing stocks and fluxes. The proposed instrumentation supports  traditional measurements of C, N and S isotopes in plants, soils and  animals, as well as newer innovative applications involving isotopic  analyses of specific indicator compounds eluted from gas  chromatographs. Six case studies illustrate the breadth of research to  be supported with this instrumentation: 1. Shrimp recruitment; 2.  Population analyses of freshwater fish; 3. Ecology of carnivorous  Everglades bladderworts;  4. Carbon and nitrogen uptake in seagrasses;  5. Nutrient loading and N fixation in the Everglades; and 6. Organic  matter fluxes in the Orinoco River and Florida Bay.        The instrumentation will, along with an older PRISM mass  spectrometer, form a new Isotope Facility at FIU that will be headed  by Dr. Brian Fry. Dr. Fry has recently moved to FIU from MBLWoods Hole  where for 9 years he led a similar laboratory that published more than  70 papers based on stable isotope results. The FIU facility will be  used for research and research training by environmentally-oriented  faculty and students at FIU, with yearly workshops providing a broad  introduction to the use of stable isotopes as research tools. Because  FIU has a student body that is 61% Hispanic or African-American and  57% female, this facility will contribute to training minorities and  women, groups currently underrepresented in the sciences.",
