The new \"materials physics track\"  is a coherent response to regional market-place pressure for thin  film science and technology education recognized by an independent  and broad Industry Advisory Panel.  This newly-organized and  focused curriculum track will culminate with the proposed MPL  course, and offer a curriculum option at SWT which addresses a  national need for changes in undergraduate physics education aimed  towards improving baccalaureate marketability for private sector  opportunities in marketable materials science-related areas.  In  addition, this proposal will also have a direct impact on the  existing Modem Physics II course (part of both the \"traditional\"  and new \"materials physics\" tracks).  The laboratory components for  both the MPL and Modern Physics II courses will familiarize  students with \"hands-on\" critical analysis skills utilizing new  instruments (atomic force microscopy, four-point probe apparatus)  and course-upgraded existing instruments (scanning electron  microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, high vacuum  magnetron sputtering, x-ray analysis, and magnetometry) which are  commonly found in private sector thin film-related industries (i.e.  the semiconductor fabricatio n industry).  These skills will be  learned in a supervised mock research team environment focusing on  recently published research themes found in the professional  literature.  The proposed resources will be included in plans for  outreach programs involving minority physics majors, and high  school students (and their teachers).  Additional capital equipment  and undergraduate human resource enhancement tools (internships,  scholarships) will be sought in conjunction with SWT's Industry  Advisory Panel.",
