 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509821  Kohler    The microparasite-induced collapse of populations of a dominant insect competitor in cold water streams in Michigan has provided a unique natural experiment for examining the organization of entire stream communities.  In work completed to date, the kinds and magnitudes of indirect dynamic responses observed to the removal of a strong interactor, the caddisfly grazer Glossosoma nigrior, by the microsporidian Cougourdella sp., clearly indicate that herbivory, and competition between herbivores, play a major role in organizing these communities.  Strong effects have been observed at all major trophic levels.  The present research will continue and expand this study by testing a series of mechanistic hypotheses concerning the generality, and details of the role, of endogenous biotic processes in structuring trout stream food webs.  The major objectives are:  1) to utilize natural experiments generated by the Glossosoma-Cougourdella system as an ecological probe to examine a series of explicit mechanistic models of trout stream community dynamics, 2) to determine whether, in the long-term, the dynamical nature of the Glossosoma-Cougourdella interaction is cyclic or stable, and 3) to determine the extent to which observations of communities structured by strong biotic interactions in the Michigan sites can be generalized to cold water systems of other regions.    This research will allow a more general assessment of the importance of parasites, and of the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in affecting the composition and structure of stream communities.  In addition, little information is available for any system concerning the stability, and the mechanisms promoting the long-term stability, of a given community configuration.  This research will provide valuable information regarding both issues.",
