 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indiana University of Pennsylvania is the recipient of NSF funds for the renovation of research and research training space in Carl S. Weyandt Hall, constructed in 1965.  The building is the home of the science departments, including Biology.  No significant work has been done in the building since its erection.  The section of the building that houses biology presents serious conditions that impede the conduction of research activities. Some of the rooms are not configured appropriately, preventing their use at optimal efficiency.  Support facilities are inadequate, and the majority of laboratories lack sufficient fume hoods, gas, water, electric and telecommunication utilities for modern, instrument-intensive work.  In addition to inadequate utilities, very little permanent casework is available for current and future projects, and laboratories are not in compliance with ADA  regulations. With the curricular changes occurring rapidly in science, the facility is not in operative condition to support the research mission of the department.   The renovation will enhance the department's tradition of student-faculty research that is especially strong in ecology and environmental biology.  Rooms dedicated to investigative studies for 11 faculty members are slated for renovation. The modifications will include:  installation of new casework, benches, and two fume hoods; redesign floor plans to optimize efficiency without loss of flexibility; upgrade of water, gas, and electrical utilities; and the installation of a cold room and three environmental chambers.  The impact of this project will be positive and immediate.  Improved spaces will allow research groups to conduct their work more efficiently, by accommodating more students, and allowing them to embark on projects that otherwise would be impossible due to the limitations that exist in the present building.  A more exciting atmosphere will be produced which will contribute to the department's ability to recruit students and remain competitive in attracting a diverse and broadly represented faculty and student base.",
