The thrust  of the work is concerned with how one uses harmonic analysis in  the treatment of linear and nonlinear systems.  The equations  arise from several sources.  One is that involving the study of  rotating stars.  Work will be done in establishing a bifurcation  diagram for the equilibrium solutions of the free energy  functional of white dwarfs.  In addition, efforts will be made to  understand the free boundary of the critical points of this  energy function.  Other work involves the rotational symmetry of  partial differential equations which represent 2-dimensional  fluid flow on a sphere and the analysis of where symmetry can be  expected to break.  Additional lines of investigation involve  inverse problems from magnetohydrodynamics and local solvability  problems for linear equations in the real analytic case.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
