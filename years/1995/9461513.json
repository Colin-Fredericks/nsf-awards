 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lumina Decision Systems, Inc. will develop software which obtains expert judgment on uncertain quantities in the form of probability. Bayesian probability techniques are increasingly used for a wide variety of decision-making and risk-analysis. Currently, specially trained analysts are required to obtain expert probability judgments to avoid cognitive biases. The time now required of the analyst and expert is burdensome, often rendering the approach impractical. A reliable and easily used automated tool for the elicitation of uncertainty could substantially reduce these costs, and render the approach far more widely usable, as a natural adjunct to decision and risk management software tools. The software will allow assessors to use qualitative phrases, such as unlikely or very frequent, and map them into numerical probabilities. They will develop and evaluate methods to calibrate each user's language to obtain reliable and stable mappings. A second focus will be to develop geometric, animated density assessor for the direct assessment of continuous probability densities. This method will use a flexible family of distributions, allowing rapid graphical specification of unimodal, bimodal, bounded, and unbounded distributions. They will compare the time, effort, and reliability of continuous and discrete probabilities obtained using standard methods with the results from our prototype assessment tool. They will develop calibration methods for mappings between verbal phrases and numerical probabilities, and evaluate their reliability and stability.",
