 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Gilbert Nathanson of the Chemistry Department of the   University of Wisconsin in Madison will continue his researches on the   interactions between gases and liquids, these ranging from repulsive   collisions to trapping and solvation.  Three sets of experiments will be   conducted:  1. paraffin, olefin, and aromatic liquids will be bombarded   by hydrocarbon gases in order to learn how changes in the structure and   bonding of liquid phase molecules govern surface corrugation and   gas-liquid energy transfer;  2. inert gas atoms will bombard the surfaces   of liquid metals indium and gallium and the In/Ga eutectic alloy to   examine the roles played by surface and sub-surface atoms in absorbing   the impact energy;  3. gaseous water, ammonia, short chain alcohols, and   hydrogen chloride will bombard a sulfuric acid surface to map out the   scattering from, and solvation in, sulfuric acid as function of impact   angle and collision energy.  Mass spectroscopy and time-of-flight   velocity analysis will be used to monitor the identity, translational   energy, and direction of scattered products.  There is little experimental work being done probing the liquid   interfaces at the molecular length scales.  This research has a high   probability of exposing new phenomena and discovering new aspects of   gas-surface interaction mechanisms.  The techniques employed in this   research were developed by the principal investigator.  The results of   this research will have bearing on other areas of physical chemistry such   as nucleation, vaporization,  chemical reactions at surfaces, polymer   physics, and atmospheric chemistry involving aerosol particles.",
