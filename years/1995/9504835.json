 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504835  Haas    This is an award to support research the objective of which is to  determine the efficacy of and optimal conditions for the use of a  process known as electroporation as a direct inactivating agent  or as a promoter of inactivation for microbial contaminants of  water.  The electroporation process as applied to inactivation of  microorganisms suspended in a fluid involves subjecting the  suspension to brief high-density voltage pulses produced by the  decaying discharges from a resistance-capacitance electrical  circuit.  The investigator plans on conducting this research on a  laboratory scale using cysts of Giardia muris and oocysts of  Cryptosporidium parvum.  The investigator plans on studying the  effects of electroporation alone and as a potential promoter of  inactivation in the presence of other disinfectants such as  ozone, monochloramine and free chlorine.    Results of this research are expected to identify conditions  under which electroporation can be used alone as a process for  disinfection of water that has been contaminated by organisms  exemplified by those to be studied in this project.  Positive  results in that respect would provide the basis for the potential  use of this process in environmental engineering practice with  special emphasis on disinfection of drinking water.  In addition,  results are expected to provide insights into the structure and  physiological properties of cysts and oocysts of potential use in  basic microbiological or medical research.",
