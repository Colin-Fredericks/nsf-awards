 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421180  Hall JC    Complex biological sounds are particularly important in  communication for many animals, as well as speech for  humans.  Such sounds contain information in both spectral  (sound wavelength, or pitch) and temporal (patterning)  domains.  These properties are encoded in responses of  neurons in the auditory nerve carrying signals from the ear  to the brain.  The coded signals are further transformed in  two important relay centers in the brainstem and in the  midbrain, as excitatory and inhibitory processes converge in  particular ways on particular neurons.  Some of the neurons  in these centers are highly selective in their responses to  particular spectral and temporal features of vocalizations  by animals of the same species.  Selectivity is created by  combinations of excitation and inhibition from neuronal  inputs to these cells.  This project uses frogs, with their  highly specialized calls, as a model system for exploring  the mechanisms of stimulus selectivity in auditory networks.  A combination of electrophysiology and pharmacology is used  in a novel approach to clarify how not just one, but two  different inhibitory compounds, called GABA and glycine,  shape these responses and sharpen the stimulus selectivity  of the system in the different stages.  Results will add to  our knowledge of how time and frequency filters are  constructed and interact in the auditory system, and enhance  our general understanding of the biological and  computational mechanisms that underlie complex sound  recognition.  The impact will extend beyond sensory  neurobiology to studies of communication behavior, to  engineering of artificial speech, and to recognition systems  for communications.",
