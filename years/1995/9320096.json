 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foraging behavior is a critical aspect of animal survival.  Its interactions with the environment are complex and multi-dimensional.  Computer simulation holds the promise of helping laboratory biologists and field ecologists gain insights into behavioral mechanisms as well as theoretical models of foraging.  The use of simulation in research on foraging behavior is in its infancy; there is great potential for its use in representation and interpretation of actual and simulated experiments.    Phase I research resulted in a proof-of-concept foraging-behavior simulation model for personal computers.  The goal of Phase II is to investigate simulation techniques for a range of behaviors, models, and theories that represent the scope of research on foraging behavior.  The approach is to evaluate simulation techniques for such foraging concepts as learning, motivation, utility, herbivory, predation, risk-preference/aversion, and fitness.  The work will include development of a user-friendly interface that includes on-line help for setting up biologically valid simulations.  This project will require original research on the question of how to reconcile diverse approaches to foraging behavior.",
