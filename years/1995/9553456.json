 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553456  Vermaas  With exciting advances in plant  molecular biology, many graduate  students in the molecular plant  sciences have focused their  research efforts on narrow issues  that are currently in vogue;  examples include detailed  characterization of regulation of  gene expression or identification  of new genes. Consequently,  graduate students who are  interested in molecular biology of  plant systems often do not receive  sufficient training in important  aspects of biochemistry,  bioenergetics, cell biology, and  physiology. However, integrated  knowledge in these areas will be  essential for further progress in  the basic plant sciences. This  proposal seeks to reverse the trend  of narrowing the research focus of  graduate students; an effort is  described in which 15 PhD students  will be trained to creatively and  synthetically integrate various  disciplines bearing on the  molecular plant sciences and  addressing critical questions in  the field. Several of these  students will be minorities. The  common denominator of research  areas described in this proposal is  energy transduction in plants. A  major emphasis is on photosynthesis  and its regulation, as this is an  area of particular  interdisciplinary strength at  Arizona State University. Our goal  is to provide training that will  optimally prepare graduates for  truly imaginative and integrative  research in the molecular plant  sciences.",
