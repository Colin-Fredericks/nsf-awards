 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510505  Long       This award is directed towards the infrastructure needs  of the geometric topology group in the areas of graduate  student support and in the hiring of postdoctoral students  in the field. The group has a wide range of interests within  and contiguous to the area of geometric topology. The  following indicates the current directions of the  researchers: Cooper, Long and Scharlemann focus on 3-  manifolds. One of Cooper's projects is to utilize the  relationship between finite foliations and geometrically  finite surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Another is to  continue developing the properties of the A-polynomial for  knots which arise from representation theory. A third  involves the theory of buildings applied to representations  of the braid group.  Long's specific projects concern the  study of finite foliations and the resulting dynamical  systems as well as the application of these ideas to  hyperbolic 3-manifolds. He also is working on problems in  algebraic geometry and the use of the degree conjecture to  prove Property P, and the finite dimensional linear  representations of the braid groups.  Scharlemann's main  interest is the stabilization problem for Heegaard  splittings.  Success would have important implications for  the general classification problem for 3-manifolds.  There  are connections to knot theory as well, via the notion of  \"tunnel number\" for a knot.One of the most basic  observations about the world around us, apparent almost from  our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional.  So it is of  interest to understand objects with precisely this property:  anyone living in one would see his or her world as 3-  dimensional.  Such objects are called \"3-manifolds\", and the  project aims to increase our understanding of them.   3-  manifolds support interesting phenomena.  One of these  phenomena is \"knotting\", in which a simple object like a  garden-hose (or a string of DNA) can be maneuvered so that  its positioning in space is quite complex.  More generally ,  objects like chemical molecules, usually though of  abstractly as \"graphs\" (much like tinker toy models), can be  put in a 3-manifold in extraordinarily complex ways if one  thinks of the \"sticks\" as made of rubber which can be  knotted and interweaved.  Tools which are being developed to  understand 3-manifolds help us understand knotting and,  conversely, understanding knotting (a second principal aim  of the project) helps us understand 3-manifolds.  For  example, the \"Heegaard splittings\" mentioned above refer to  a technique in which all the complexity of a general 3-  manifold is absorbed into a thick graph.  Then information  about the graph gives information about the 3-manifolds.  A  more disciplined type of knotting, called braiding, occurs,  for example, in the trajectories of fluid or plasma flow in  a Tokomak-type torus.  Since this knotting is more  disciplined, more tools are available for understanding and  classifying such knotting.  Hence the intereqt in braid  theory and its connections to dynamical systems.",
