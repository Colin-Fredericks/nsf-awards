 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  The research examines how artistic and literary excellence are defined and how the subsequent criteria are applied.  The research settings are two art museums and two university literature departments, selected to contrast cultural organizations where multiculturalism is the focus from those with more traditional orientations.  Theoretical concerns relate to the formation of cognitive systems and their relation to social action.  Data come from careful observations and from 90 interviews with museum curators and literature professors.  %%%   This research will contribute to the sociological understanding of cultural systems by examining the relation between aesthetic standards and standards used in other social situations.   In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
