 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD 9552991    The Public Policy Institute of Radcliffe College and the Commission  on Professional in Science and Technology propose to organize a  working conference, followed by dissemination of early printing of  the proceedings to key contacts in scientific associations and  other organizations.  The conference goal is to look at the future  of science careers through the lens of gender equity.  Given the  fact that we are in the midst of a major transition in our national  economy, it is clear that the nature of scientific workplaces will  be undergoing dramatic changes over the next decades.  During this  shift, those interested in ensuring equal partnership for women in  the sciences will need to be armed with information, analysis, and  understanding of the era to come.      The conference's targeted population will be those in the  scientific and women's communities who have been most concerned  with gender equity in the sciences, including representatives from  education, industry and government.  Additional participants are to  be selected from the economics and business communities who can  share with the targeted group their analyses of economic and  demographic trends and questions regarding the new scientific  workplace.  The conference will consist of one public lecture and  four sessions.  At each of the latter, two presenters will  summarize key idea from their papers, and raise principal questions  to be addressed during participant discussions.  ***",
