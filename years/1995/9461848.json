 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for improvements n the readout electronics for cryogenic radiation and particle detectors which are being developed for diverse applications in astrophysics, particle detection, medical imaging, and materials science.  Many of these devices use a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) for reading out the signal from the detector.  The extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs to small changes in current, voltage or magnetic flux are essential for reaching the detection and resolution limits of the new detectors.  Although currently available SQUID systems have characteristics which make them ideal for use with these new detectors, existing SQUID systems are often ineffectual or of limited usefulness in exploiting the full potential of these detectors.  Limitations of bandwidth and slew rate make high count rate detection and pulse shape determination difficult or impossible.  The sensitivity of the sensors to radiation and thermal fluctuations make them difficult to use in accelerator or space applications.  Recent work on high-speed SQUID electronics and improved sensors has shown that performance can be greatly improved not only in frequency response but also in slew rate, stability, reliability and noise level.  This will be a significant advance for cryogenic radiation and particle detector readout; as well as improve operation in the earth orbit environment, significantly advancing space-based metrology.  The improvements will also aid in enabling SQUID technology to emerge out of the laboratory for other industrial, military, and field use applications.",
