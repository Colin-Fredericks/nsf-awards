 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major thrust of this project is integrating computers into  the laboratory components of six courses in biology: invertebrate  zoology, ecology, animal physiology, animal behavior, independent  study, and senior research.   While the authors have previously  incorporated computer-based laboratory exercises into these  courses, the students have been severely limited in their ability  to participate actively in these laboratories because of a lack  of equipment.   This project rectifies this problem by providing  access to groups of two students to a computer with supporting  software and interfacing devices.   Through laboratory exercises  in these courses, students are introduced to computers as  biological tools that can be used to collect and analyze data.    This introduction demonstrates the usefulness of computers to  them, and more importantly, allows the students more time during  laboratory sessions to think about the results, to design new  experiments, and to perform these additional experiments.   The  students also use the computers and software programs to conduct  on-line literature searches, to learn to use the Internet and  Mosaic, and to prepare oral presentations of their results using  a computer display projector.   These computers, along with new  physiological equipment, can also be used by upper-level students  for their senior research projects.   A computer linked to an  overhead display unit is being made available for use in the  lecture component of these courses, in which the system can  function as an electronic blackboard.   This project shows  faculty members how computers can facilitate learning and  encourages them incorporate these types of learning experience  into two larger courses offered by the department, general  biology and human anatomy and physiology.",
