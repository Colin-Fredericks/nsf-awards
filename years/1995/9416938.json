 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Hudson - 9416938    Oscillations have been known in chemical systems for some time, phenomena such as bifurcations among states, chaos, and complex spatial patterns can arise in such systems.  In well-mixed open reacting systems (for example a continuous stirred tank reactor) the concentrations of reacting species can undergo periodic and chaotic oscillations.  Catalytic surface reactions such as the oxidation of carbon monoxide (one of the reactions taking place in the catalytic muffler of an automobile), can also oscillate and produce spatial patterns on the catalytic surface.  Electrochemical reactions, such as electrodissolution of metals, or corrosion, can exhibit temporal as well as spatial variations in reaction rate.    The PI's work is focused on quantifying the above experimentally observed behavior and on developing quantitative phenomenological models.  The reactions that will be studied are of both industrial and economic importance and should lead to an improved fundamental understanding of such reaction processes.  Electrochemical reactions have several features which make them ideal for fundamental studies of reaction dynamics.  They are relatively stationary, i.e., have less drift over the time scale of the dynamics and they exhibit many types of interesting dynamic behavior such as complex periodic oscillations, low order chaos, spatiotemporal patterns, etc.  Also, there are easily controlled parameters (the potential or current as well as the mass transfer coefficient near a rotating disk) so that transitions among states can be investigated.    The PI will study the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of chemically reacting systems.  In the temporal studies, time series emanating from the electrochemical dissolution of metals will be investigated.  The studies are to be both deterministic and stochastic.  In the former, chaotic behavior and transitions, or bifurcations, between states will be emphasized, applying methods from nonlinear dynamics to the experimental  data in order to identify and characterize the underlying dynamics of the system and to develop phenomenological mathematical models.  A new research program in electrochemical noise associated with localized corrosion will be initiated, consisting of both experimental and modeling studies.  Spatiotemporal dynamics will be studied by using a video camera to record spatial nonuniformities.  The work is aimed at developing models which should help answer questions such as how do films grow and recede on dissolving metals, how much interaction is there among pits on the surface of corroding metals, and under what conditions is synchronization among reacting sites local or global in nature.  ***",
