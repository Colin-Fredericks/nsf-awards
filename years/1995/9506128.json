 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506128  Stoner      Most vertebrates regulate not only the contents of their blood plasma but also its volume.  Plasma is filtered into the kidney tubules of many animals. The regulation of plasma volume is effected by controlling the net  reabsorption of filtered water and the most prevalent cation in the filtrate, sodium.  When animals are placed on a sodium restricted diet hormonal mechanisms act to enhance the reabsorption of filtered sodium, reducing its rate of loss.  Several known control mechanisms for sodium reabsorption effect the distal nephron. One important step in sodium reabsorption is sodium movement from the lumen of the renal tubule into the cell, via ion channels. Many investigators believe that regulated changes in the rate of sodium transport are achieved by controlling the sodium channel activity.  Dr. Stoner has developed a technique whereby it is possible to turn inside-out fragments of the amphibian kidney tubule. This approach exposes the urinary surface for study. The utility of everted segments of renal tubule fragments lies in the ability to control, independently, the contents of the saline solutions bathing the urinary and blood surfaces of the epithelial cells while studying the aativity of the channels involved in sodium reabsorption. Control of the ionic and hormonal contents of these compartments will allow him for the first time to study the expression and regulation ion channels in native tissue.  One unique feature of the species used, Ambystoma tigrinum, is that it can be purchased in both a land- and aquatic-phase. One type of sodium channel is observed in the apical membrane of everted collecting tubules dissected from land-phase Ambystoma, while two other types of sodium channels appear in the aquatic-phase collecting tubule. This is the first time the latter types of sodium channels have been identified in any native collecting tubule. The physiological significance of the presence of different channel types during different stages of metamorphosis is  unknown.  Dr. Stoner hopes to identify the different physiological mechanisms used to activate and inactivate each type of sodium channel. The results are certain to clarify the differences in control of the sodium reabsorption in terreqtrial and aquatic animals, and likely to spark new interest in the developmental aspects of channel expression in the kidney.  ***",
