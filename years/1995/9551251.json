 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geology department is completely revamping laboratories in  introductory geology and coordinating laboratories in groundwater  geology and environmental geophysics to provide a series of  integrated, inquiry-oriented, field-based experiences addressing  interrelated, local geological problems and stressing the need  for multidisciplinary approaches.   These laboratories focus on  the geology and environmental problems of the local area, which  depends on a confined aquifer for its water supply.    Contamination of this water by agricultural pesticides and  industrial waste has occurred to varying degrees.   Purchase of  modern equipment with improved data acquisition and digital  data-transfer capabilities makes it possible to undertake  meaningful problems during course laboratories, even at the  introductory level.   Introductory geology laboratories include a  refraction seismic survey to define aquifer thickness, a  resistivity survey to continue monitoring a leachate plume, a  magnetic gradiometer survey of old industrial sites to search for  potential contamination sources, measurement of water levels in  observation wells to map the potentiometric surface, and  determination of aquifer transmissivity and storativity to assess  groundwater movement rates.   Combined laboratories in  groundwater geology and environmental geophysics complement this  effort, thereby building on the introductory experience.    Additional activities include seismic reflection profiling to map  sediment stratigraphy and advanced groundwater analysis to assess  possible plume migration paths.   GPS information together with  all field data from all courses can be added to an extensive GIS  database for production and evaluation of derivative maps that  students evaluate.",
