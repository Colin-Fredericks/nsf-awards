The structural  polymers of protein and chitin that make up the bulk of the   cuticle, and their chemical interactions with quinone tanning  agents are largely responsible for the final properties of the  exoskeleton.  Sclerotization is thought to involve the formation of  covalent cross-links between protein nucleophilic side chain groups  and the ring or side-chain carbons of N-acetyldopamine and N-Beta-  alanyldopamine.  Purified cuticular proteins from the pupal cuticle  of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, involved in sclerotization  reactions and their post-translational modification by quinonoid  metabolites will be characterized as to molecular weights, amino  acid compositions and sequences, carbohydrate components and  catechol-amino acid adducts.  In vitro tanning reactions will be  studied between N-acyldopamine quinonoid derivatives and model  compounds that have nucleophilic functional groups representative  of amino acid residues in cuticular proteins.  The adducts formed  will be chemically characterized by electrochemistry, HPLC, NMR and  mass spectrometry.  Solid-state NMR studies utilizing 13C-, 15N-, 17O  labeled protein and catecholamine precursors of cuticle, which will  provide information on the nature of the covalent bonds  formed in situ between the structural components during  sclerotization.  %%%  Insect cuticle sclerotization is a vital process that occurs  periodically during insect development to harden and stabilize the  newly secreted cuticular exoskeleton.  The exoskeleton serves many  functions including protection, locomotion , respiration and  communication, and therefore must have very diverse mechanical and  chemical properties to provide for each function.  The structural  polymers of protein and chitin that make up the bulk of the  cuticle, and their che mical interactions with quinone tanning  agents derived from catecholamines are largely responsible for the  final properties of the exoskeleton.  Purified cuticular proteins  from the pupal cuticle of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta,  involved in sclerotization reactions will be characterized and  their modification by quinonoid metabolites determined.  The  products formed will be identified as to the types of chemical  bonding involved in sclerotization.  Solid-state NMR studies will  provide a non-destructive method for investigating the molecular  assembly of the exoskeleton.  Understanding how the multifunctional  insect exoskeleton is sclerotized at each stage of development  is  of major importance to insect biology and may facilitate the  development is of new approaches to selective insect pest control.   ***",
