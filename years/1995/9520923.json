By predicting microstructures and growth  laws, these studies will provide the opportunity of making  quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment.  The  type of modeling will also bridge the gap between  experiments and theoretical results obtained using kinetic  Ising models and their continuum version, the time-dependent  Ginzburg-Landau model.    The microscopic models of alloys have two features which  make the study of growth kinetics relevant and interesting.  The models include a description of the coupling between  elastic strains and chemical order and they include typical  metallic interactions such as Osize-effectO terms and long-  range interactions arising from Fermi surface effects.  Two  types of models will be considered in the current work.  One  is a particular version of the embedded atom approach which  provides a very good description of non-transition metal  alloys, and the other is a model based on the direct pair-  correlation function of alloys which can be calculated from  the coherent potential approximation to disordered alloys.  The latter approach is known to provide an excellent  description of transition metal alloys and particularly of  any fermi-surface realted effects.    The study of kinetics can be divided into three separate  parts: (1) direct Monte Carlo simulations of embedded atom  Hamiltonians including chemical and displacement effects,  (2) simulations of Langevin equations based on Ginzburg-  Landau functionals constructed from microscopic models,and  (3) studies of a generalized Ising model which provides the  simplest model of ordering accompanied by a structural  transition.  The generalized Ising model has a wider range  of applicability than alloys and will provide a description  of kinetics in any system where there is a coupling between  a structural distortion and some orderi ng field.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of  metallic alloys.  In particular, studies will be made on how  the components of a binary alloy mix together to form  various phases and structures.  Understanding how these  phases evolve will contribute to predicting the properties  of these alloys and how various processing paths affect  these properties.  ***",
