 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated set of basic analytical and research tools is  necessary to improve laboratory education in the Environmental  Science Department.   This project introduces students to  techniques used in modern environmental analyses and provides  them with experience in multidisciplinary environmental  problem-solving -- essential elements of environmental science  education.    This project focuses on equipment needed for  standard environmental measurements on water and sediment as well  as ancillary equipment that enable students to have full use of a  recently acquired atomic absorption spectrometer.   Specifically,  this new equipment enables the department to (1) offer a new,  midlevel laboratory course on environmental methods and analysis,  called \"Environmental Measurements\"; (2) establish facilities for  student research leading to the senior thesis and other projects;  and (3) enhance the laboratory accompanying the \"Introduction to  Environmental Science\" course that the department currently  offers.   Laboratory study focuses on local environments  including the Hudson River, the North River Sewage Treatment  Plant, and Black Rock Forest.",
