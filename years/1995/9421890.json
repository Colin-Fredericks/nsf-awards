 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421890  Nardi  During neural development and regeneration, the processes of  neurons often must navigate long distances to reach their targets.   During this growth phase, the neuron encounters many cues that  guide its navigation, including cell adhesion molecules, other  neurons, and glial cells.  This research seeks to define the role  that glial cells play in guiding growing neural processes to their  appropriate target.  To do this, a novel model system will be used.   In the insect wing, neural processes must navigate from the base of  the wing to the tip.  Along the way, the neural processes encounter  glial cells at precisely defined positions, positions at which  these processes often turn.  In this research, glial cells will be  transplanted to different positions to directly determine if the  presence or absence of glial cells influences the probability that  the neural processes will make the appropriate guidance choice.  If  this proves to be the case, further experiments will seek to define  the molecular basis of the guidance cues provided by glial cells.   This will provide fundamental information concerning the role that  glia play in nervous system development and regeneration.",
