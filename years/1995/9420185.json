 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hille  9420185  A study of the biophysical properties of two oxidoreductases, xanthine oxidase and  trimethylamine dehydrogenase, builds on past success in the PI's laboratory.  The goal of this  work is to fully characterize the kinetics of electron transfer within the two subject proteins and  ascertain its role in catalysis.  Xanthine oxidase from cow's milk catalyzes the oxidative  hydroxylation of xanthine to form uric acid, a reaction that takes place at the molybdenum center  of the enzyme.  For a variety of reasons, the enzyme has become the prototypical molybdenum  center of the enzyme.  For a variety of reasons, the enzyme has become the prototypical  molybdenum hydroxylation of substrate.  Studies of electron transfer among the four redox-active  centers of this enzyme will be pursued along two different lines: (1) pulse radiolysis studies in  D2O and as a function of temperature will be performed with the aim of extending past work by  the PI; and (2) use will be made of a ruthenium center that has been covalently attached near the  molybdenum center of xanthine oxidase to very rapidly introduce reducing equivalents into the  enzyme by flash photolysis.  The advantage of this protocol is that the initiation of electron  transfer is an intramolecular process, making possible studies at cryogenic temperatures.  Other  work will focus on several related aspects of trimethylamine dehydrogenase, an enzyme from the  methylotrophic bacterium W3A1 that catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine to  dimethylamine and formaldehyde.  The enzyme possesses a covalently linked flavin  mononucleotide cofactor and a 4Fe/4S (ferredoxin-type) center, and thus represents a useful  system with which to extend past work on xanthine oxidase.  The work includes: (1) studies of  the rates of electron transfer between the two redox-active centers using pulse radiolysis; (2)  characterization of the reaction of reduced trimethylamine dehydrogenase with its physiological  oxidant, electron-transfe rring flavoprotein; and (3) development of a photolabile slow substrate  for trimethylamine dehydrogenase that will be suitable for a Laue experiment in which the  progress of the reaction at the active site is followed by timeresolved crystallography.  %%%  The experiments are designed to address two goals.  The first has to do with how  protonation/deprotonation events modulate electron transfer into and out of organic cofactors that  are redoxactive (e.g., flavins and quinones), using xanthine oxidase and trimethylamine  dehydrogenase as the experimental systems.  The second involves a study of how the two  cofactors of the enzyme trimethylamine dehydrogenase interact with one another, and the role  of this interaction in catalytic turnover.  This work involves a combination of kinetic and  crystallographic approaches aimed at gaining a more complete understanding of how this enzyme  functions mechanistically.  ***",
