In  this project an intelligent system  will be developed for monitoring  the state of structures that  utilizes advanced sensing,  microprocessing, wireless  transmission, and damage diagnostic  methods.  The monitoring system  will evaluate the global damage  level as well as the specific  location, type, and degree of local  damage to structural elements and  connections.  The system will be  designed to periodically test and  assess the condition of a structure  under normal operating conditions;  and will evaluate its state  following extreme loads such as  those caused by hurricanes,  earthquakes, or blasts.  Application of the monitoring  system with wireless communications  capabilities to both existing and  newly built structures will be  investigated.    The research effort will focus  primarily on the design and  development of the distributed  sensor  units, site master  processor, and the efficient  wireless communication system ofthe  damage monitoring system.  Combinations of sensors will be  utilized to enable assessment of  the overall damage state of the  structure and to identify specific  locations and types of  deterioration.  Advanced  computational algorithms will be  developed to enable efficient and  reliable estimation of the state of  the structure.  ***",
