 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graph drawing addresses the problem of constructing geometric  representations of graphs and networks.  It is an emerging area  of research  that has received increasing attention both in the  theory and systems  community.  From the theoretical viewpoint,  graph drawing combines flavors of  topological graph theory and  computational geometry, and offers many  algorithmic challenges.  From the practical viewpoint, the automatic generation  of  drawings of graphs has important applications in key computer  technologies  such as software engineering, computer-aided-design,  database systems, and  visual interfaces.    The research project addresses both theoretical and  applied  issues in graph drawing.  Specific problems studied include:  (1) Trade-offs between various properties of drawings, such as area,  aspect-ratio, and angular resolution; (2) Upward planarity testing for  directed graphs; (3) Dynamic planarity testing and incremental layout  maintenance; (4) Three-dimensional drawing; (5) Declarative  approaches to graph drawing and related constraint-satisfaction  issues; (6) A graph visualization system and its applications.",
