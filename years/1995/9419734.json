 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ralph Wheeler, University of Oklahoma,  is funded by the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to study the gas phase and solution phase   properties of aromatic amino acid radicals.    Wheeler will use ab initio   quantum calculations and molecular dynamics to further understand the   energetics, pathways, and rates of radical migration in proteins and   peptides.  Comparisons will be made between gas phase and solvated   tyrosine and tryptophan radicals and cations.  Density functional theory   will be used to calculate the gas phase vibrational frequencies and spin   densities of these species for comparison with organic phenoxyl, phenoxyl   cation, indoyl and indoyl cation radical side chains.  One of the   objectives here is to identify vibrational and ESR spectroscopic features   which can be used to distinguish different orientations of the aromatic   amino acid radicals.  Molecular dynamics will then be used to compute   free energies of hydration using free energy perturbation theory together   with charges and force constants obtained from the gas phase density   functional calculations.  The formation and migration of highly reactive radicals is implicated in   carcinogenesis and aging.  The recent discovery and characterization of   aromatic amino acid radicals in proteins implies that amino acid radicals   are much more prevalent and important than previously suspected.  The   long term goals of Wheeler's computational research include understanding   the molecular components and their interactions responsible for the   energetics, pathways, and rates of radical migration in proteins and   peptides.",
