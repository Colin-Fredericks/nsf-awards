 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422886    Empirical studies of consumer demand, labor supply and household  production are commonly based on the premise that families behave  as though they are single individuals.  However, a growing number  of studies have concluded that families should be modeled as the  outcome of the interaction between household members with diverse  preferences and resources.  This project derives and tests the  implications of the assumption made by virtually all models of  the household that intra-family allocation is efficient.  The  project contains three components, concerned respectively with  the economic organization of families, the market environment  within which African households live, and the possible existence  of community mechanisms which internalize local environmental and  learning externalities in sub-Saharan Africa.    Within many African households, agricultural production is  carried out simultaneously on many plots controlled by different  members of the household.  This is an ideal environment for  examining the internal organization of families, because  efficiency implies that variable factors should be allocated  efficiently across these plots.  Preliminary results base don  Burkina Faso data indicate that plots controlled by women are  farmed much less intensively than similar plots within the  household planted with the same crop in the same year, but  controlled by men.  These results, if confirmed, contradict the  efficiency of resource allocation of the household.  This project  extends this methodology to a variety of other African contexts  and examines the causes of the violation of efficiency.   Theoretical research is required to establish the classes of  models of the household consistent with the pattern of empirical  violations of efficiency.    This project also studies the existence of community mechanisms  which provide incentives for individuals to engage in  agricultural experimentation and internalize local environmental  externalities.  The current project  is for short-term preliminary  fieldwork in Ghana that will permit the design of the survey that  will be used for extensive survey-based field research in Ghana.",
