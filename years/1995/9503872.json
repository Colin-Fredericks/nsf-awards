 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to facilitate the use of models of  biological  systems by developing a facility  for locating and  retrieving published models via the Internet.    Models are used widely to study complex biological systems. They  are used to represent hypotheses, (circulation in physiology),  test theories (effect of enzyme concentration on reaction rate),  make predictions  (pharmacological response to a drug),  design  outcomes (calculate intake for optimal growth), and analyze data  (calculate rate of substrate movement into cells).  Models  coalesce a large amount of information and form valuable tools in  research and education, but their utility resides in being able  to use and manipulate them interactively. Currently there is no  centralized way to do this. This proposal describes the  establishment of such a facility, called a library. Potential  users of the library are researchers, educators, and students who  would use the models to analyze data, evaluate theories, and  design experiments.    Models  from  the  fields  of  metabolism,  pharmacokinetics,  endocrinology, immunology, physiology, toxicology, and  biochemistry will  be  entered  and  will  include  linear  and  non-linear, compartmental  models.  The  models  will  be  collated,  indexed, catalogued, and described mathematically in  formats compatible with several (based on cost and demand)  widely-used modeling software packages. Users will be able to  access the library via the Internet and, using menus,  search and  locate models, view graphical and mathematical  descriptions  of  the  models,   perform  limited simulations in the library, or  download models to use with their own modeling software.    The library will be developed by an interdisciplinary team from  Georgetown University and the University of Pennsylvania with  expertise in the fields of informational science, library  science, biology,  modeling,  computer  science,  and  networking.  A panel representing  users  in  universities,  indust ry,  pharmaceutical companies  and Government agencies will  advise on the library structure, contents and dissemination. More  than 300 models will be entered into the library over a 3 year  period.    In view of the resources committed to developing models of  biological systems, access to tested, working versions of  published models is necessary to allow them to be used for their  intended purpose, i.e., to explore and test systems through  simulation. This task will be accomplished by scientists in the  biological and informational science fields through the  development of a library of mathematical models.",
