 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a software development effort that,  in close liaison with major scientific communities, will  expand the use and increase the effectiveness of a major  scientific preprint archiving system, and focus on the  design, implementation, and incorporation of new, innovative  tools for electronic communication of research results.  Moreover new archives will be made available to other  communities.    During the past two years a powerful new tool has been  developed for exchange and processing of scientific  information.  The Theoretical Division at Los Alamos  National Laboratory has developed and implemented an  \"e-Print Archive\" system for the distribution, archiving,  and searching of scientific preprints.  Thus far, e-Print  Archives have been set up for twelve scientific disciplines,  and are rapidly becoming the primary means of information  exchange in the communities they serve.  The system has been  operated as a community service in a \"cottage industry\" mode  by the particle theory group at Los Alamos.  The Principal  Investigator on this proposal, Paul Ginsparg, has had  essentially full responsibility for software/hardware  maintenance as well as user support.  Given its importance  to the research communities it serves, the e-Print system  project now needs long-term stability.  Consequently, this  award will allow it to be transferred to a team of computer  personnel that will guarantee its reliability and  development, and in particular to be put on a firm technical  support basis.",
