 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416837  Vincent    This award will support the participation of ten American  scientists, mathematicians and engineers at a workshop on  the control of nonlinear dynamical systems entitled  \"Control and Chaos\" to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii in  June 1995.  The American organizer is Dr. Thomas Vincent of  the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the  University of Arizona.  The Australian organizers are  Prof. A. I. Mees and Prof. K. L. Teo of the Department  of Mathematics from the University of Western Australia.    The objective of the workshop is to bring together experts in  dynamical systems theory and control theory to focus on the  problem of controlling nonlinear and potentially chaotic  systems using limited control effort.  The work has application  potential including such diverse fields as economic policy,  medicine, ecosystem management and manufacturing.  Assessment   considerations will play an important part of the workshop.  There currently exists controversy over claims that approaches  inspired by work on chaos provide unique ways to control systems  with complex behavior.  The workshop will also investigate   applications of control theory and consider new tools for   controlling complex problems of a practical interest.  The  Australian participants are being funded through the  Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology.  Researchers from Japan and Great Britain will also be   participating in the wopkshop.",
