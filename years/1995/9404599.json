 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and co-workers study the theory, implementation,  and applications of spectral methods on unbounded domains.  The  term spectral method as used here includes not only the  traditional applications involving differential equations, but  also the computation of integral transforms and special  functions.  The central theme is the optimization of the accuracy  of such expansion methods by judicious parameter selection.  This is accomplished either through theoretical asymptotic  analysis, or via numerical algorithms where the analytical  approach falls short.  Target applications include scattering  problems, the computation of integral transforms, and nonlinear  waves.    The first part of the project involves, among other things, the  computer solution of certain fundamental problems arising in  quantum mechanics.  The second part is devoted to the computation  of integral transforms.   These formulas arise ubiquitously in  science, in areas such as viscoplasticity, geophysics, and shock  waves in diatomic chains.  In industrial applications these  transforms can seldom be worked out by hand and efficient  computer codes are required for their computation.  Through the use of mathematical analysis the investigator aims to  optimize the efficiency of such codes.  The third part of the  project involves the computer simulation of waves arising in  areas such as laser optics and water.  The challenge here is to  ensure that the computer output is a true reflection of the  actual physics of the problem.  The project is expected to have an impact not only in numerical  mathematics, but also in various branches of technology and  engineering such as high-performance computing, materials  science, and optical science and engineering.",
