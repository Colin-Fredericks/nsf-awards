These models will examine the influence of transient and seasonal forcing of an idealized bank ecosystem, with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms which lead to trophic uncoupling.  Trophic uncoupling results from spatial or temporal dislocation of populations within a community, and can lead to rapid growth or depletion of affected populations.  Physical modelling will focus on the response of an idealized bank and bank-shelf system to wind forcing and to seasonal buoyancy forcing.  The biological modelling will have three major objectives:  (1) to understand the long term effects of \"wash out\" events and advective losses on trophic interactions and recruitment; (2) to study the mechanisms by which the dynamics at tidal fronts influence trophic coupling and production; and )3) to explore novel techniques of reducing complexity of biological models while maintainin g biological system necessary for robustness.  The ultimate goal of this work is to investigate the couplings between the biological and physical systems, in particular the effect of advective losses on recruitment of cod and haddock and the influence of tidal fronts on primary and secondary production.  These results can then be tested by, and used to guide the upcoming field observations and further analysis of historical data. ***                                  ;                                             Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       P:\\BO\\ABS\\GAWARKIE.ASC              prtaylor                            prtaylor                    @     w  e                          @                                   @        e                                                                                                  @      G                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      3                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e =       e                                                                               j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       K   C                                                                                                                   -           T       :   K                       j                                                                         K               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           .                                                                                                 9529402 Gawarkiewicz The project involves the development of a series of coupled biological-physical models to examine the effects of wind forcing and seasonal stratification on the recruitment of zooplankton and fish to Georges Bank.
