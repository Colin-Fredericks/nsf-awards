 "awd_abstract_narration": "The epitaxial growth of organic thin films which may have utility in electronic devices and  chemical sensor systems is the focus of the research in this project supported by the Analytical  and Surface Chemistry program.  The work emphasizes the mechanistic understanding of  epitaxial growth and molecular organization, and will use both vacuum and solution deposition  procedures to form these films.  Thin films of large dye molecules deposited on metal,  semiconductor, and insulator surfaces will be explored.  The relationship between molecular  packing, multilayer ordering, and the electronic and optical properties of these materials will be  determined. Small molecule chemisorption on these dye molecule films will be investigated, and  the development of designed \"molecular recognition sites\" on these films will be initiated.  This  strategy may be useful in the fabrication of versatile molecule specific chemical sensors.    The controlled growth of organic molecular thin films may have important application in the  development of molecular electronic devices and highly specific chemical sensors.  The work  of this research project is directed to developing an understanding of the conditions which  control the growth of organic thin films.  A range of experimental methods will be brought to  bear in these studies, with the goal of the controlled design of thin film assemblies with  molecular recognition sites directly incorporated.",
