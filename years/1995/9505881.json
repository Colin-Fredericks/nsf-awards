 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505881  Urbashi Mitra      In order for future wireless communications networks to accommodate  a variety of potentially disparate sources (voice, data and video  signals), multi-rate communication schemes must be developed.   Possible sources such as voice, video, and data communications have  inherently different quality of service (QoS) requirements.  A  constant bit-rate paradigm as exists in the current wireless  network will not serve such multi-rated services of the future.   The principal aim of this research is to begin the analysis and  development of communication receivers for multi-user  spread-spectrum communications with different information  rates.  Several multi-rate multi-user access schemes will be  considered for Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum Code-Division  Multiple-Access communications.  Three activities are planned for  the preliminary study.  First, existing single bit rate receivers  will be investigated to determine whether they are easily  extensible to multi-rate communications.  Second, multi-user  receivers will be created to explicitly exploit the redundancy in  the mixture of narrowband and wideband user signals.  Third, a cost  function will be developed to compare the various receivers  created.  Due to the nature of the signals being considered, the  probability of bit detection error does not fully capture the  performance of a given receiver.  The ultimate goal of the proposed  preliminary research is to position the applicant to perform  research on the design and analysis of true variable bit rate  communications (e.g. video transmissions); communications where the  bit rate is changing for each individual user.  In multi-rate  communications each user transmits at a constant rate which may  differ from user to user.  It is believed that such receivers must  be adaptive in nature to properly support the variable rated  traffic.",
