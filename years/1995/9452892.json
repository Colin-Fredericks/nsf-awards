 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452892  Boudjouk  Funds are requested to continue the effort in North Dakota to build a permanent infrastructure in science, engineering  and mathematics (SEM) that provides 1) incentives and means for researchers to compete effectively for merit-based  grants and contracts, 2) programs for students in grades 10 - 16, and, 3) programs for  North Dakota businesses to  link with SEM talent at North Dakota University System colleges.    Key features of the Strategic Improvement Plan are: 1) Strengthening of existing and emerging research clusters with  potential to achieve national and international prominence.  Two clusters (Supramolecular Protein Complexes, Main  Group Chemistry), will continue to receive support, although at diminishing levels during the grant period.  Following   rigorous screening and evaluation, new clusters will be developed.    2) A multi-component program composed of: undergraduate research and mentoring programs; a program targeting  potential women scientists and another to facilitate the transition from high school science activities to undergraduate  research programs; pilot technology transfer programs linking students and faculty with local industries; and a  program to remove barriers to success in obtaining Human Resource Development and Systemic Reform grants.  Programs with North Dakota's Tribal Community Colleges: summer workshops for students, and academic year  workshops for faculty at our five Tribal Community Colleges.",
