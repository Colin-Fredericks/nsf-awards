Two new hypotheses are  to  be tested to partially explain this fall-off.  One is referred to  as the chain-end hypothesis, where production of excess cellulose  chain  ends  by pretreatment leads to a more rapid hydrolysis  of  these ends by cellobiohydrolase (CBH) than formation of new  ends  by  endogluconase.  The other hypothesis is called the  tethering  hypothesis,  where  once adsorbed, CBH has a  limited  number  of  cellulose  ends  available to it, and becomes inactive  until  it  desorbs and readsorbs at a fresh site.  ***",
