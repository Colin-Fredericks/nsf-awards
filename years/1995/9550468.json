 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Institute of Technology will conduct a three-year  project demonstrating techniques to increase participation of  deaf students in science education and career development.  The  primary premise of the project is that deaf students will  progress more rapidly in science education when they have full  access to the content and language of science and to information  concerning the past accomplishments of deaf people in scientific  professions.  The primary goal of the project is to improve  access to science for deaf students by fusing best teaching  practices used with deaf students from both science and English  language teaching.  The project will consist of the design and  delivery of regional workshops, the creation of a national  network of science teachers, and the evaluation and investigation  of change in teaching and learning science.  The regional  workshops will provide science teachers of deaf students in  mainstream and residential schools with a set of instructional  strategies and materials that integrate visual and interactive  presentations of science principles with explicit and interactive  uses of scientific English.  The specific goals are:  (1) to  develop and deliver a coherent set of instructional strategies  that may be used to teach the content and language of science to  deaf students; (2) to increase deaf students' access to  information about the accomplishments of deaf women and men in  scientific professions; and (3) to disseminate an effective  intervention model for enhancing science learning by deaf  students.  Regional workshops consisting of a two-day series of  seven sessions will be designed and implemented.  The attitude  and communication barriers deaf science students and deaf  scientists face will be described and the science teacher's roles  in breaking down these barriers will be presented.  Science  teachers will learn to deal effectively with the language  dimensions of science teaching when both deaf and hearing  students are in the cl assroom.  Finally, the training will focus  on critical thinking skills and the importance of visual and  hands-on experiences in the teaching of science principles.   Participants of each regional workshop will be expected to  identify target science principles (which appear difficult for  deaf students to learn) and best practices (which appear  successful with deaf students in science classrooms).  The target  principles will become the focus of prototype mini-lessons as  participants begin applying the strategies learned in the  regional workshop.  Evaluation of the effectiveness of the mini-  lessons (and strategies) will begin after each workshop.   Information will be disseminated through publications, conference  presentations, and a newsletter for the regional workshop  participants and other interested science teachers.",
