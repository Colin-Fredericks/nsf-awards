 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tidewater Summer Science Camp is a four-week summer enhancement  project in mathematics and science at Norfolk State University for  minority 7th and 8th grade students in the Tidewater, Virginia  area.  The major objective of the project are to involve students  in interesting investigations and projects involving real-world  science problems, to increase their knowledge, skill, and  confidence in mathematics and science, and to increase the  likelihood that they will pursue mathematics/science careers.   Students are provided hands-on, scaled-down versions of science  problems in a laboratory setting; they use graphing calculators and  computers to aid in the mathematical analysis of science problems;  they go on field trips to obtain first-hand exposure to science  practitioners; and they are involved in intensive career  exploration and curriculum counseling.  A follow-up component of  the project includes Saturday sessions throughout the academic  year.  The program's ultimate goal of significantly increasing the  number of the participants selecting mathematics/science careers is  monitored by maintaining a data base of the participants' progress  through high school and beyond.  ***",
