 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508782  Papantonopoulos    This proposal supports a six month postdoctoral  fellowship for Dr. Sotiris Papantonopoulos of the  Department of Engineering Management of the George  Washington University. Project funding will enable Dr.  Papantonopoulos to undertake a collaborative research  effort with Dr. Takao Enkawa of the Tokyo Institute of  Technology.  The investigators intend to study the  methodology of cross-functional design teams, including  how design teams collaborate to generate design  conjectures, resolve trade-offs, and reach decisions.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Papantonopoulos will have the  opportunity to become familiar with researchers and research  techniques at the Tokyo Institute of Technology while  contributing to the overall research effort. The six month  visit by Papantonopoulos will enable him to establish a  personal and professional link with a leading engineer in  Japan.  The PI's studies of concurrent engineering design in  Japan should be of benefit to the U.S. engineering community  upon his return. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
