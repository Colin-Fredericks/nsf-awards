 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419197  Gaber    For a variety of historical and social reasons, African Americans are severely under represented at the PhD level in science and mathematics.  It is imperative that the scientific community take a leadership role in providing training opportunities and incentives for these young Americans to choose careers as active scientists.  Cooperatively with National Science Foundation, the Naval Research Laboratory has developed a summer research internship program for promising undergraduate students science, engineering, and mathematics.  The program specifically targets students who aspire to careers in scientific research.  This cooperative program provides an unique summer research internship experience for outstanding minority undergraduates.  During the first three years of the program twenty five outstanding undergraduates have been identified and recruited at three of the Nation's leading historically black colleges and universities:  Clark-Atlanta University, Spelman College, and Morehouse College.  These students have worked with distinction as summer research interns at NRL's Center for Bio/Molecular Science and Engineering.  Based upon the program's initial success, it is proposed to enlarge its scope to:        . Expand the number summer research internships by one third            . Extend the internship program to students from additional HBCUs            . Provide research opportunities at the Georgia Institute of Technology            . Establish research programs between NRL and participating HCBUs.  ***",
