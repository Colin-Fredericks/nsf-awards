 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than half of the students concentrating in mathematics at  the college are in one of three teacher-preparation programs.    It is critical that the Mathematics Department curriculum prepare  these students for the classrooms they will enter, in terms of  both mathematics content and pedagogy.   There are many areas of  mathematics that are taught more effectively through  technology-assisted approaches.   Statistics especially is an  area in which computers, coupled with teaching strategies that  allow students to construct their own knowledge through hands-on,  exploratory activities, can greatly enhance student learning.    This project funds a 20-station computer laboratory that provides  at least eight faculty members with a means to use newly  developed laboratory experiences in introductory statistics  courses.   An estimated 400-450 undergraduate students can  benefit each year.   First and foremost, the new laboratory  provides a technology-rich environment in which faculty can teach  using a pedagogy that both enhances the learning of all students  and models instructional methods important to those students  preparing to be teachers.   It also provides an alternative  approach--individualized and interactive--which helps reduce  withdrawal and failure rates in the introductory statistics  course for the many full-time students majoring in social  sciences, home economics, or food and nutrition.   In addition,  it can be of benefit to other part-time students pursuing  undergraduate degree programs in the Continuing Education  Division, as well as to majors taking the mathematical statistics  sequence.   Finally, it can improve the preparation of all these  students for workplace applications.",
