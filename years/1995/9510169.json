 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. T. Don Tilley, Chemistry Department, University of California  -   Berkeley, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the study of metal   complexes with ligated reactive silicon intermediates. In order to   manipulate the nature of the metal-silicon double bond, a series on new   silylene complexes will be prepared with a variety of sigma and pi   donating groups attached to silicon. The stability and chemical   reactivity of these compounds will be examined to establish the chemical   properties and mechanisms of reactions that occur at the silicon-carbon   multiple bond. Special emphasis will be paid to -silyl and -silylene   migrations and to the development of catalytic properties of the   complexes.  Metal coordination will be utilized to stabilize pi-systems   containing heavy group 14 elements.   An entire field of chemistry - organometallic chemistry - is concerned   with the behavior of compounds with metal-carbon bonds. This is an area    of tremendous importance to catalysis and chemical synthesis, as   practiced both in laboratory and industrial settings. Silicon lies just   below carbon in the periodic chart. Thus, there are both similarities and   differences in the chemistries of the two elements and the nature of the   metal-silicon interaction is of intrinsic importance. In this project a   variety of compounds containing metal-silicon multiple bonds will be   prepared and their chemistry systematized. This will provide the   background for the development of catalysts, reagents, chemical   transformations, and new materials using metal-silicon compounds.",
