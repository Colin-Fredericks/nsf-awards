 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504541  Masih  Theoretical evidence as well as  practical accidents have pointed  out that under certain loading  conditions the lift-slab  structures are at the threshold  static and dynamic instability.  The instability of the structure  is created by stacking the heavy  mass of several slabs at high  levels,  while the structure cannot be  braced laterally, since the  bracing will inhibit the lifting  process. During construction stage  or under lateral loads, such an  instability situation becomes  highly undesirable.    This project undertakes an  investigation to the limitations  within which the structure remains  statically and dynamically stable.  The project would also include a  study of the ways and means of the  safety precautions used and  necessary recommendations to  improve them.    Theoretical studies to improve the  design of lift-slab structure,  performance against earthquake  forces, and to recommend ways to  strengthen the existing lift-slab  structures to withstand possible  future earthquakes will be  conducted.  Such improvement  should help to avoid tragedies  like those which happened in  Armenia during  the 1988 earthquake.    Computer analysis will be made to  study limitations as:  the  stacking schemes of the parked  slabs, the safe relationship of  those schemes with the geometry of  the structure, the limits of safe  dynamic load and its frequency to  maintain safe lifting process, and  the safe temporary connection of  the parked slab to the columns.  ***",
