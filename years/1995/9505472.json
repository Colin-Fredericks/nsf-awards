 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project applies parallel algorithm design theory   problems  arising from scientific problems governed by   partial differential  equations.  Most of the effort is restricted to solving    algorithmic problems including mesh generation and    partitioning.  This project  develops algorithms and code for  the solution of scientific   problems that  are highly unstructured  and whose solution may be rapidly   changing with time.  Thus, the  emphasis is on parallel mesh generation algorithms   that will  run on parallel machines in conjunction with the system   solvers.  The project also  continues to improve the parallel efficiency of linear    system solvers and will  extend the work on combinatorial  approaches to the   construction of good  preconditioners for linear  system solvers.  These are used   to speedup the  convergence rate  of iterative methods.    A central approach   taken by this  project for the design of new  algorithms for problems such   as mesh generation  and  preconditioner construction is to use the fact that the    graphs for these problems have small separators that  can be   quickly found.  Under prior projects partially supported  by NSF, algorithms   were discovered and  developed to partition,  for instance, finite element meshes   into roughly two  equal size  pieces by removing a small number of elements.    This work is  referred to as the geometric approach to separators.  The    geometric approach  quickly produces provably good partitions for  finite element   meshes.  This  project intends to show how the role  of mesh generation   methods and separator  technology can be  reversed.  In particular, good mesh   generation methods are  being developed which use the separator technology.  This   technology  will also be  used in the construction of good iterative methods  for   solving these underlying  systems.    Further improvements are being made in the   geometric separator algorithms via experimental and analytic   methods.  Relationships  between the geometric method and   other known algorithms and  methods, such as spectral,  are being investigated.",
