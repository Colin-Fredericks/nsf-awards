 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ideal biological microscmpe should have enough resolution to image  biological macromolecules on a nanometer scale, should image in  physiological, watery conditions, and should have sufficient temporal  resolution to follow crucial dynamic processes on the scale of  macromolecules, macromolecular assemblies and cells. An important  unsolved problem in biology that highlights the potential usefulness of  such an instrument is the micromechanical function of the ubiquitous  motor proteins. Motor proteins are the driving force behind processes  such as muscle contraction, cell locomotion, ciliar and flagellar  beating, mitosis, meiosis, intracellular transport, DNA replication and  transcription and protein synthesis.      The goal of the proposed feasibility study is to develop a microscope  with molecular resolution, based on scanning a nanofabricated silicon  tip over a protein sample using a single beam laser optical trap  (optical tweezers). The trapping laser will double as  displacement/force sensor, recording the interaction force between tip  and sample. The displacement signal will be fed into a feed-back loop  keeping the tip at a constant distance from the sample, thus imaging  its contours.      As proof-of-concept, cytoskeletal protein polymers will be imaged to  demonstrate spatial resolution. The motor proteins kinesin and ncd will  be imaged on microtubules, with the goal of resolving the movement of  the individual heads of the motors and their tracking on the  microtubule surface. Single headed truncated motors will be imaged in  comparison, with the goal of understanding the cooperativity of the two  heads of native kinesin and ncd, and to test if a single head can  produce movement at all.      The project will be an interdisciplinary collaboration between i) a  nanofabrication laboratory, providing expertise to develop a process to  manufacture exactly defined silicon tips with nm features and a  controlled surface chemistry, ii) a physics/biophysics laboratory  providing  expertise in instrument building, microscopy and laser  technology, and iii) a molecular biology laboratory providing the  expertise in protein biochemistry and developing procedures to produce  well characterized cytoskeletal and motor proteins and modified  proteins using an E.coli expression system.      If successful, the proposed instrument would constitute a major  advance in microstructure determination, uniquely matched to the  requirements of biological research. It would make it possible to  dynamically image the fundamental functional units of biology,  proteins, DNA, RNA, \"at work\". The instrument would have a broad range  of applications, especially in the life sciences, and a multitude of  fundamental questions appear solvable, by \"looking and seeing how  things work\".",
