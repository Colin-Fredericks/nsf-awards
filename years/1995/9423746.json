Jones    Abstract    The principal investigators will continuing their work in a number   of related areas of analysis: harmonic analysis, nonlinear Fourier   analysis, and partial differential equations, with applications   to complex analysis, physical problems, and numerical work.  Beals   and collaborators will make more use their methods from Hamiltonian   mechanics to investigate fundamental solutions for subelliptic   laplacians.  Beals will also continue joint work on the quantized   three-wave interaction and on geophysical inverse problems.    Coifman and Meyer will continue to investigate nonlinear Fourier   analysis and applications to homogenization and nonlinear   dependence.  Coifman will also continue to develop adapted wave   form analysis to obtain geometric and numerical understanding of   oscillatory operators.  Jones will continue his work on the fine   properties of harmonic measure and level lines of Green's function,   as well as work on singular integrals and d-bar problems related to   corona problems and analytic capacity. Jones also plans further   investigations in quasiconformal mappings and problems relating   Sobolev spaces and geometry of sets.    Analysis is the area of mathematics that has grown directly from   the invention of calculus and differential equations.  It provides   a framework for attacking problems that range from the purely   mathematical and geometrical to the most concrete scientific and   technical questions.  In turn, these problems have provided the   motivation for the continued refinement of the subject and, not   incidentally, its continued utility.  Thus there is no precise   dividing line between pure theory and potential or actual   application.  For example, in little more than a decade   sophisticated techniques of pure harmonic analysis have emerged   in practice as wavelet analysis and have enormously extended the   possibilities for analysis and storage of digital data.  The   sub jects to be investigated in this proposal reflect the full   range of analysis as well as the actual and potential interplay   between \"pure\" and \"applied.\"  Some have a history of a century   or more and come from classical analysis and geometry, others   have a history of decades and are motivated by physics and   geophysics, others have arisen in the last decade and are   connected with signal processing and the concrete use of   computers in science and technology.",
