 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois Air Conditioning and Refrigeration NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (ACRC) was established in 1989. The objective of the Center is to provide the technology base for a new generation of energy-efficient, quiet and reliable equipment that can use ozone-safe refrigerants. Presently the research is conducted by 40 graduate students, 14 faculty, 12 visiting scholars and 15 undergraduate students. The ACRC research program is vertically integrated, from the system level down to the underlying fundamental processes. The research projects fall into four major groups: Systems, Components, Processes and Properties. Over the past five years of the existence of the ACRC the number of industry sponsors has grown to eighteen.  Cumulative income and expenditures have totaled $5 million for the core research program. Major contributions in addition to the NSF funding and major sponsors have included generous support from the State of Illinois Governor s Science Advisory Committee and the University of Illinois  Richard W. Kritzer endowment.  A total of 49 M.S. and 3 Ph.D. theses have been supported by ACRC funds. Additional, scores of undergraduate research assistants have gained valuable experience on industry-sponsored research projects .",
