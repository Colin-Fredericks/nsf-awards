 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to study the emplacement and  solidification of sills in the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica  and to compare their histories to similar sheet-like magma bodies  on Easter Island and Reunion Island.  If the three-dimensional  history of emplacement and solidification of sheet-like magmatic  bodies could be learned through direct observation, a great  advance could be made in understanding the evolution of Earth.  Sheet-like bodies of magma may well be responsible for delivering  and shaping both the oceanic and continental crusts.  Beneath  ocean ridges, for example, relatively narrow (~1 - 4 kilometers),  thin (100 - 300 meters) ribbons or sills of magma deliver,  through a delicate balance between emplacement and solidification  processes, the basic structure of the oceanic crust, which forms  some 60% of Earth's surface.  And basically similar  solidification processes in sheets of underplating basaltic magma  and high-level invading granitic magma go a long way to  delivering and shaping the continental crust through  remobilization and sorting of earlier magmas.  Learning the  dynamic history of sheet-like magmas has, however, proven  exceedingly elusive for two simple reasons: lack of vast  continuous rock exposures and lack of extensive, clear internal  markers to reveal the temporal and spatial history of  solidification.  Internal layerings are plentiful in the large,  well known layered intrusions, but there is little sign of the  nature and style of magma filling (e.g., was filling periodic or  steady? at discrete points or along fissures? slow or fast?  etc.).  The many large diabase sills throughout the world broadly  show how filling occurred, but rarely do they show any internal  indicators or markers detailing the filling and solidification  processes themselves.  And when a marker, as in the form of  trails of large, distinct, previously formed crystals, does occur  it rarely can be traced out in three dimensions due to poor  natural exposures.    T he Basement Sill of Antarctica changes all this.  It is thick  (300 meters), vast (greater than 5,000 cubic kilometers),  superbly exposed, and above all carries a distinct internal  marker in the form of a tongue of large (1 - 6 millimeters)  orthopyroxene crystals. Moreover, this orthopyroxene tongue  varies systematically in thickness, crystal size, and position  within the sill reflecting both the filling locations and the  rate of filling itself.  The documentation of this body and its  three dimensional dynamics may well prove to be the \"Rosetta  Stone\" of sheet-like magmatic systems.  It is of fundamental  importance and is central to this project.  The detailed  processes that give rise beneath ocean ridges to the structure of  the oceanic crust also may well be gained from this study.  And  the seeds of initiation of continental crust, through  Solidification Front  Instability and the production of silicic  lenses, is also clear in the Basement Sill.  As a comparative  study, a search for evidence in the lavas of Easter Island may  well also establish the importance of this process in volcanic  systems.",
