 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Component:  Closing the loop in AE systems.      The project addresses augmented environment (AE) and virtual  environment (VE)  tracking system inadequacies through a new  `unified-system` approach to AE  system design. Even with the  best head-mounted displays (HMDs) and graphic  systems  available, the shortcomings of tracking systems hinder or  preclude the  usefulness of many AE/VE applications. Such applications,  including on-line surgical  visualization, assembly or  maintenance assistance, and interactive training  simulations, require robust solutions to the following  problems.         1)  Achieving millimeter (position) and 0.1 degree  (orientation) accuracy.      2)  Readily achieving precise calibration of tracking  systems to the real world.  3)  Eliminating (or minimizing) latency in tracking (and  graphics) systems to  prevent gross misalignment during head  motion.    This project aims to develop  new technology and improved  methods for making video-based AE systems usable  and  productive for commercial and scientific applications.  The  long term  research goal is the accurate alignment of real  and virtual objects in an  augmented environment under all  conditions of user activity including rapid  head motion.  Achieving such performance required the integration of new  image  and tracking function components into an AE system.  A  2D alignment error  metric forms a basis for the compensation  of a variety of 3D tracking and  calibration errors.  Corrections are computed and applied at every frame creating a  closed loop system which compensated for both static and  dynamic  (latency-induced) misalignment.  The project will  produce increased  understanding of closed loop AR systems by      1)  implementing a software  simulator to facilitate rapid  exploration of closed loop AE system design  options for  feature detection error measurement, and error compensation,  2)  designing a new AE system architecture with  components which have simple,  well-defined interfaces to  other  co mpenents in the system, and     3)  developing a prototype of a complete closed-loop AE  system and quantifying its  performance characteristics.      Education Component:  Richer understanding through  experience.    Teaching responsibilities include at least one course during  each Fall and Spring semester.  A two-course Computer  Graphics sequence  for graduate students is under  development.  These courses build on the  introductory  undergraduate course and emphasize project creation.  Hands  on  system-building learning opportunities, at the  appropriate levels for students,  are a major focus of the  educational activities.  In addition to syllabus  design and  class teaching, directed-research and advising promotes  student-faculty interactions.  A CD-ROM with computer  graphics simulations of  graphics concepts will be developed  for both introductory and advanced levels.",
