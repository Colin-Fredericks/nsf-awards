 "awd_abstract_narration": "The small flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of  the mustard family, has become the model system for plant  biology.  Its unique features allow it to be applied to a  wide variety of research problems, including plant  physiology, the molecular genetic study of organ  development, and plant-pathogen interactions.  The  importance of Arabidopsis to plant biology is increasing  with the international development of germplasm and DNA  stock resource centers, genetic and physical maps and their  techniques, plus expressed sequence tag and genomic  sequencing projects.  Furthermore, because flowering plants  evolved recently, characterizing a gene in Arabidopsis often  simplifies the isolation of a corresponding gene in another  flowering plant.  The primary mission of this project is to  provide a  specialized electronic database that can be used  by the  scientific community to collect, cross-reference,  organize, distribute and maintain the scientific data and  their  results.  The immediate goals are to create an  initial  prototype database with input from the user  community, and  to maintain the existing public Arabidopsis  database, AAtDB, in the interim.  It is expected that the  prototype developed  under this award will become a basis  for the next generation  Arabidopsis database that will meet  the needs of the researchers for the foreseeable future.",
