Temperature changes alter muscle  function  and  hence  escape  speed  and  vulnerability   to  predators.   This  project  will  examine  the  effects   of  temperature,  temperature changes and  predation  on  escape  behavior  of  fish.   Acclimation to  long-term  temperature  changes will be examined in several species of cyprinid fish  by  high speed video filming of escape behavior and analysis  of  muscle contractile properties and the enzymatic bases of  those  properties.   The same techniques  will  be  used  to  examine   the   effect   of  historical  (multigenerational)  exposure   to   differing  levels  of  predation   on   fish  populations  to  determine  whether  exposure  to  predation  causes divergence in locomotor performance capacities.   The  research will provide a basis for predicting likely  effects  of  water  temperature on stock performance in  nature,  the  ability  of those stocks to adjust performance over   longer  term   temperature  exposure,  and  potential   evolutionary  changes  in fish stocks introduced into new areas  with  new  predatory  regimes.  This information is important  to  both  fisheries management and to understanding how populations of  cold-blooded  vertebrates may adjust to  climate  change  or  range extension.",
