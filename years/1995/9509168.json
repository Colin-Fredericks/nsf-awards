 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509168  Sellner    This project addresses the hypothesis that the developmental  expression of the heart subtype of fatty acid-binding protein (H-  FABP) is related to the simultaneous development of  neurotransmitter systems in the brain, namely GABA. The hypothesis  is based on 1) similar localization of the proteins by  immunohistochemistry, 2) the documented timing of differentiation  of particular pathways/regions in the brain at a time when H-FABP  is also present, 3) data showing effects of free fatty acids on  both the GABA transporter and the GABA-a receptor, and 4) in vitro  studies showing an enhanced uptake of GABA by synaptosomes when  exogenous H-FABP is added. The hypothesis will be addressed by  developing a cell culture system from neonatal mouse cerebellum,  using established protocols. The cultures will be examined for  their expression of H-FABP using antiserum prepared against  synthetic peptides and using synthetic oligonucleotide probes. The  presence of the GABA transporter will be verified by measuring 3H-  GABA uptake by the cultures. Next, the efdects of exogenously added  fatty acids on the levels of H-FABP and on rates of GABA uptake  will be studied. Finally, antisense oligonucleotides will be added  to the cultures to inhibit the expression of H-FABP, and effects on  GABA uptake will be determined. The activities described in this  proposal are designed to obtain sufficient pilot data to warrant  submission of a major grant proposal.  ***",
