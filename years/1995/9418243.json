 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418243  Gronert    This award will support the travel expenses for Dr. Scott Gronert  and a student research associate to enable them to spend a month  conducting cooperative research with Professor Leo Radom and his  research group at the Research School of Chemistry, the  Australian National University, in Canberra.  The collaborative  work will focus on the use of the density functional theory as  applied to various reaction systems and in particular reaction  pathways for proton transfer and radical addition reactions in  the gas phase.  In recent years, density functional theory (DFT)  has emerged as a very promising methodology that has been  extensively tested for very small molecular systems, but not for  larger molecular systems or for the proposed proton transfer and  radical reactions.  The combined resources of the American and  Australian groups are required to complete the project.  The  opportunity to work with the Radom group will allow for a  valuable exchange of ideas and methodologies.  During the visit  by the Americans to Canberra, data will be exchanged,  computational approaches will be tested extensively, and  decisions will be made as to the best DFT methods for completing  the studies.  The collaboration will provide an excellent  educational experience for the student research associate and  will expose the American investigators to valuable new techniques  in theoretical chemistry.",
