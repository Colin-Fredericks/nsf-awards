This work will provide new  theoretical information on ultrafast dynamics in degenerate  Fermi systems; hot electron effects in metals; quasi-  particle dynamics in semiconductors; and, spin dependent  scattering in polarized and magnetic semiconductors.    The goal is to bring the theoretical understanding of the  carrier dynamics in these systems up to the same level as  the understanding in bulk and quantum confined  semiconductors.  This involves realistic band stucture and  scattering rates together with detailed transport  calculations.    In addition, for bulk semiconductors, the dynamical band gap  renormalization associated with the many-body Coulomb  interaction in nonequilibrium systems will be studied.  Results obtained by other investigators for quasi-  equilibrium conditions will be extended to include effects  associated with a wave-vector-dependent Coulomb hole term; a  photoexcited two-component plasma with one species  (electrons) substantially lighter than the other (holes);  and, the effect of time-dependent, nonequilibrium  distribution functions on the band gap renormalization.  This gives us an opportunity to explore observable, time-  dependent, nonequilibrium many-body effects.  %%%  Tunable femtosecond lasers now make possible the detailed  study of electronic processes in solid state systems.  While  much initial work has focused on bulk semiconductors nad  quantum confined semiconductors, a variety of new systems  will be studied in this research.  In particular, systems to  be studied include metals, superconductors and polarized  semiconductors.    While the technology of ultrafast laser studies of solid  state systems has advanced rapidly over the past few years,  the associated theoretical studies have lagged.  This grant  will provide valu able theoretical insight on the complex  behavior of these systems when perturbed by laser  irradiation.  ***",
