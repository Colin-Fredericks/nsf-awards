 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418058  Nelson    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project between  Dr. Keith Nelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  Dr. Toshirou Tagi of Hokkaido University.  The collaborators will  investigate lattice vibrations in crystals near phase transitions, acoustic  waves in glass-forming liquids and polymers, and acoustic waves in  polymers and other thin films.  The study of phase transitions and  liquid-glass transitions is intended to advance our fundamental  understanding of structural rearrangements in condensed matter.  The  study of thin films can provide important information about adhesion  of films to substrates, and also has immediate applications to  noninvasive characterization of films in microelectronics and other  industries.    The U.S. group, led by Dr. Nelson, has developed picosecond and  femtosecond time-domain light scattering methods for study of  acoustic and optic phonons in condensed matter.  Of particular  interest for the Japanese group, led by Dr. Yagi, is the use of  femtosecond time-resolved methods for the study of phase transitions  in an important class of crystals whose nonlinear optical properties are  widely exploited in practical devices.  The mutual benefits of the  collaboration will be two-way technology transfer for the significant  enhancement of both groups  experimental capabilities, intellectual  exchange concerning the related topics of interest to both groups, and  collaborative experimental results on structural phase transitions in  two important classes of materials.  ***",
