 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553333  Metcalf  We propose to increase the number  of optical sciences students in  Stony Brook's highly ranked PhD  program. The six specialization  areas are quantum optics, photonics  and materials, non-linear optics, X-  ray optics, atomic chaology, and  laser cooling. The program features  rotation throughout these groups to  familiarize students with the  field, our diverse and highly  educational seminars, close  laboratory interaction with  undergraduates and high school  students, association with post-  docs and instrumentation students,  and other special opportunities. We  maintain active connection with  optical scientists at Brookhaven,  Grumman Corp., Adelphi University,  various campus departments, and  other government, industrial, and  academic institutions. We have long  experience with recruitment and  retention of women and minority  students in our programs. Two  optical science faculty are native  speakers of Spanish, and may serve  as role models for Hispanics. Two  others are among only three  department winners of a campus-wide  teaching excellence award. Our own  graduate students have won a  disproportionate share of  departmental excellence awards.  Optical science offers so many  challenges, and has such an  important future in American  technology, that the department  recently expanded its faculty by  four. Coupled with the plethora of  new problems, there is ample  capability to accommodate a five  student increase.",
