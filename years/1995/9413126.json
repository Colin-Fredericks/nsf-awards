The El Verde Field Station is a long-established research  facility in the only Neotropical rain forest under the  jurisdiction of the United States.  The field station is  located in the Caribbean National Forest, which is an  Experimental Forest, a Biosphere Reserve, a participating  component of the University of Puerto Rico Minority Research  Center of Excellence, and a site of the Luquillo Long-Term  Ecological Research Program.  The field station and  adjoining research area have been the focus of projects by  scientists from over 50 institutions in the United States  and other countries.  Current research projects are funded  by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration, and the USDA Forest Service.    Research and living facilities at the El Verde Field Station  date to the 1930's and their current size is restrictive to  the ongoing research activities.  This project will assist  in the action of a Master Plan for the field station which  will guide future efforts to expand and modernize the  facilities.",
