This project is mostly  theoretical, but has potential  applications in  statistics, economics and computer science,  as  well as in other areas of pure mathematics such as measure,  integration and function theory.    This research project  involves several topics in mathematics related to  the theory of  probability.  These topics include: the theoretical aspects  of  controlling or stopping a random process such as pollution-level   fluctuations or inflation rates; the theory and application of  fair-division problems in which an object  such as a parcel of  land or other assets must be divided and distributed  among  several parties;  the study of estimating the distribution of an  unknown population based on  random samples and observations; and  general theories about long-range  behavior of random processes  such as population growth or global  temperature fluctuations.   This pro ject is primarily theoretical,  with direct applications  to statistics and other areas of mathematics, and potential  applications to other areas of science  such as economics,  operations research, and computer technology.",
