 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sevilleta Field Station serves a large number of  research scientists and students who study the extensive and  ecologically diverse region of central New Mexico.  The  region incorporates transition zones among numerous biomes,  including Great Plains Grassland, Chihuahuan Desert,  Colorado Plateau Shrub-Steppe, Interior Chaparral, Mogollon  Pi on-Juniper Woodland, and Montane Forests.  Current  scientific research in the region focuses on biotic  responses to climate change at various spatial and temporal  time scales (seasonal, annual, and long-term), biodiversity  issues, and ecosystem restoration following natural and  anthropogenic disturbance.  Funding for research activities  on the Sevilleta has exceeded $15.6 million, and continues  to increase.  From 1990 to 1995, there were 357 scientists  and students working on 109 research projects in the region  served by the Sevilleta Field Station.  The Sevilleta  Station provided logistical support to a large proportion of  these projects.    This project addresses improvements in three areas of  station operations requiring enhancements to meet growing  demands by field research scientists.  Computation - the  addition of graphical/GIS and ARC/INFO workstations and  computer server, with terminals for station residences;  Information - installation of a Differential GPS Community  Base Station for field GPS work, the addition of a  computerized Ariel Library Reference Station for literature  searches/inter-library loan computer transmissions, and the  acquisition of station library reference materials;  Transportation - the addition several vehicles for use in  field studies covering large areas of central New Mexico.  With these enhancements, the station's capabilities will  finally match the logistical demands for field support by  the Sevilleta's scientific community.",
