They scramble to the sea and swim  through the surf, then quickly establish a course towards  the open ocean,  Maintaining their direction after swimming  beyond sight of land..  Little is known about how hatchling  sea turtles maintain their course through a vast ocean that  contains no obvious landmarks.  Near the beach, wave  direction provides a reliable cue, Which the hatchlings seem  to use initially.  But farther from land, where waves no  longer reliably indicate direction, the hatchlings appear to  depend on the magnetic field of the earth.  Recent  experiments have demonstrated that sea turtles have a well-  developed magnetic compass that allows them to maintain a  specific heading, even in total darkness.       For long-distance migrants such as sea turtles, the  geomagnetic field not only provides a possible cue for  compass orientation, but a potential source for worldwide  positional information.  Several parameters of the earth s  magnetic field vary predictably with latitude and it appears  that hatchling sea turtles can sense these parameters.  The  research that Dr. Lohmann will carry out is designed to  investigate:  (1) how hatchlings may use these geomagnetic  parameters in global position finding; (2) how young sea  turtles may acquire a directional preference and how the  preference influences orientation; and (3) the mechanism  hatchlings use to detect wave direction and how this  information interacts with the information from the magnetic  compass.       All species of sea turtles are now either threatened or  endangered. Thus this research will provide information  useful to conservation workers trying to save these animals  from extinction.  In addition it will provide valuable  information about how animals (including turtles, fis h and  whales) navigate using information from the magnetic field  of the earth.    .",
