 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554570  Manousiouthakis    Irrevocable change is occurring in  the way we conceive, develop and  design chemical technologies,  whether for petrochemicals  production, bioprocessing, or  electronic materials synthesis. The  scientific and economic arguments  for development of clean  technologies with minimal  environmental impact have become  truly compelling if we are to enjoy  further improvement in our quality  of life for the foreseeable future.  Those engaged in clean chemical  process development confront  revolutionary challenges in  chemical synthesis, separations,  and process design for pollution  prevention and the minimization of  waste. A new breed of chemical  engineer must be educated and  trained in the area of  Environmentally Conscious  Manufacturing to meet these  challenges. Funds are requested for  the support of five Graduate  Research Trainees pursuing PhD  studies in Chemical Engineering in  the area of Environmentally  Conscious Manufacturing. Two  additional trainees will be  supported by UCLA matching funds.  The Traineeships will be for five  years and will be administered  through the Chemical Engineering  Department. An integrated program  of cross-disciplinary research,  classroom learning, industrial  internships, and teaching  experience has been designed to  train PhD students in  environmentally conscious  manufacturing and pollution  prevention research. Given that the  ultimate implementation of  pollution prevention concepts will  require the participation of  scientists and engineers trained in  fields other than chemical  engineering, each of the Trainees  will be jointly mentored by two  faculty members; one from chemical  engineering, and one from another  discipline. This interdisciplinary  approach in research and training  will provide the optimal means to  contribute effectively to the  engineering science and technology  base for environmentally conscious  manufacturing, which is currently  in its infancy. A rigorous  curriculum, a multimonth  visit to a  host research institution,  seminars, workshops and teaching  assignments, and their daily  interactions with their mentors and  each other, will prepare these  students to teach and do research  in this field. Furthermore, their  contributions to the development of  software, monographs, and case  studies will help educated a new  generation of engineers that are  environmentally aware and have the  knowledge base needed to prevent  the generation of pollution.",
