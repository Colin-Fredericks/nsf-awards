 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509211  Basolo    One model for the evolution of female mating preferences, the  preexisting bias model, suggests that a bias favoring a trait can  arise prior to the trait itself. This model has been suggested to  influence the evolution of a female preference favoring a sword and  sword evolution in the genus of fish, Xiphophorus. Swords are  multi-colored extensions of a specific set of caudal rays at the  base of the caudal fin found in a number of species of Xiphophorus.  Previous work suggests that swordlessness is the ancestral state,  as all outgroups to this genus lack a structure homologous to the  sword. In the three species of Xiphophorus that have been tested,  one species that possesses a sword and two other species lacking  swords, females have been shown to prefer conspecific males with  swords. In addition, in the sister genus, Priapella, females have  also been shown to have a preference favoring a sword. Using  parsimony, it appears that while swords arose within the genus  Xiphophorus, a preference favoring the sword arose prior to the  divergence of Priapella and Xiphophorus. These results then suggest  that the preference arose prior to appearance of the sword and can  be explained by the preexisting bias model for the evolution of  female preferences for male traits. This proposal is to compare the  strength of a female preference favoring a sword across species.  While two of the species share the preference, one exhibits the  ancestral condition for the trait, i.e. lack of a sword, and the  other exhibits the derived condition, i.e. presence of a sword.  Presence of the preference has not previously been tested in the  third species to be examined and it lacks a sword.  ***",
