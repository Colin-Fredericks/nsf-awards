 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support travel of ten Americans to a U.S.-France workshop on engineering sciences in Orleans, France, October 15-19, 1995, organized by David Channell of the University of Texas at Dallas and Iskendar Gokalp of the Center of Engineering Sciences, the French National Center for Scientific Research.  The workshop will address the relationship between science and technology in the modern industrialized world and the role of engineering sciences as an intermediary in the transfer of knowledge and discoveries to technology. Using prepared papers as the basis of discussion, the participants will compare and analyze the cognitive and organizational structure of engineering sciences in France and in the United States since 1970.   The workshop includes a mix of researchers and engineers from universities and industry, scholars of the philosophy and history of science and engineering from the U.S. and France.  Each participant contributes his or her own perspective to these issues. Their interaction will advance understanding of the relationships between science and technology and the strategies used by researchers and engineers in scientific and technological problem-solving.",
