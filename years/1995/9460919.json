 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel switch technology which  will secure instantaneous electrical connection based on the novel mechanism of the electrical  discharge initiation - laser breakdown in Besselian (B) laser beam. Laser breakdown in the B-beam will  result in a novel type of optical discharge - Continuous Extensive Laser Spark (CELS) which is ideally  suitable for shorting electrodes due to absence of breaks in the plasma channel, high electrical  conductivity of the channel, and generation of the channel with hyperlight speed. The most efficient  transformation of the Gaussian (G) beam into the B-beam can be achieved by focusing light beam into an  axial line with a conical lens (axicon). According to preliminary estimates, the triggering will  require modest energy of the laser pulse (  100 mJ) which can be provided with a compact and inexpensive laser.  The new switching technology will open new opportunities for all pulsed systems:  operation with high precision and reliability in the extremely broad voltage range (from zero to self-breakdown level), current range (kiloamperes to megamperes) and long gaps (1 - 100 cm), low jitter and fast switching (nanoseconds or better) will allow for highly precise synchronization of multiple switches as well as for multichannel switching in one device. In Phase I, feasibility of the technology will be established through the development and testing of a single-channel coaxial switch.  The alternative switch configurations will be analyzed from the points of view of cost and efficiency of operation.  Phase II will demonstrate practical realization of the full potential of the switch technology several different  purpose switch prototypes will be developed.",
