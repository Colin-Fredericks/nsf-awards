 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate  internet-based hypermedia tutorials for undergraduate chemistry  courses. The specific objectives are (1) to develop hypermedia  resources that increase the effectiveness and efficiency of  student learning and retention, (2) to evaluate and refine  hypermedia designs for maximum student use and efficacy, and (3)  to evaluate the accessibility of hypermedia educational materials  via the internet for students and educators inside and outside  the university. The main advantage of hypermedia educational  materials is the ability to link a topic to related and/or  remedial material. Having immediate, in-context remedial help  will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a student's  study time, and will also reinforce the understanding of basic  concepts. The links themselves illustrate the interrelatedness of  different topics and the importance of basic principles. Funding  of this project will allow expansion of our current hypermedia  tutorial for instrumental analysis to sophomore-level analytical  chemistry and freshman-level general chemistry classes. The  chemistry tutorials are viewed with NCSA Mosaic, which is an  internet-based hypermedia browser. It is a multimedia viewing  tool with versions for Unix, Windows, and Macintosh operating  systems. Since this project is accessible world-wide via the  internet, it will provide an educational resource for  undergraduate chemistry students; K12, vocational, and  college-level educators; and for the public at large. The  hypermedia design and internet access concepts that are learned  by evaluating and refining this project will facilitate the  creation and distribution of effective hypermedia resources for  science education in chemistry and other disciplines.",
