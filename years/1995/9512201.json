 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512201  Kanamori    This grant provides partial support (48%) for the costs of  acquisition and installation of state-of-the-art digital  seismographic stations in southern California.  Each station  consists of a broadband Streickeisen (STS-2) seismometer, a force  balanced accelerometer, and a 6 channel 24 bit Quanterra Inc.  data logger.  Five new stations are planned.  This  instrumentation can measure seismic waves from small and large  earthquakes as well as from teleseisms and regional earthquakes  accurately and completely.  The new proposed instrumentation  complements the existing network of broadband seismographic  stations, called TERRAscope.  Currently, TERRAscope consists of  17 stations.  The new instrumentation will significantly increase  the spatial resolution of TERRAscope by reducing current station  spacing of 150 km by tens of kilometers within the central part  of the network.  Currently, most existing earthquake data for  Southern California are of limited dynamic range or are measured  over very narrow frequency bands and thus their usefulness for  general research is limited.  Furthermore, pre-TERRAscope  instrumentation was not calibrated with sufficient accuracy to  provide quantitative amplitude data.  The location of these  instruments in southern California provides the additional  benefit of being able to record large California earthquakes on  scale and study their source physics in unprecedented detail.  The type of research and research training to be conducted will  be fundamental seismological studies of earth structure and  earthquake physics, as well as training of Ph.D. candidates and  postdoctoral fellows in observational and theoretical seismology.  Examples of the projects that will be carried out using the new  data are: 1) determination of the structure of the core mantle  boundary; 2) imaging of the Pacific-North America plate boundary  in southern California; 3) studies of earthquake source physics  of both teleseisms around the world and regional  earthquakes in  the Western US, 4) new theoretical and computational methods for  modeling the seismic data will be developed.  This project will  benefit from existing and other proposed projects at Caltech  related to the earthquake monitoring effort. The Pacific Bell  foundation (CalREN) is providing digital data transmission at no  cost.  Other projects are providing software support and data  processing facilities. The Data Center of the Southern California  Earthquake Center located at Caltech and the IRIS DMS will  distribute the data to the seismological research community via  INTERNET.    ***",
