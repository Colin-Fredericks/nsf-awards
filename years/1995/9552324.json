 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a teaching laboratory for undergraduate  instruction in digital signal processing (DSP).   The laboratory  gives students practical, hands-on training in DSP concepts and  techniques using modem hardware and software design tools that  complement the more theoretical approach of a lecture course in  DSP.   The laboratory uses PC-type workstations with add-on DSP  processing boards and a complement software to provide both  non-real-time and real-time DSP environments for algorithm  development and testing.   The new laboratory course consists of  a dozen laboratory exercises, about one per week during the  semester, each emphasizing a particular topic in DSP (for  example, convolution, sampling, filter design, and Fourier  transformation).   In the laboratory, students program  non-real-time simulations of common DSP procedures using MATLAB   and compare the results of these simulations with theoretical  predictions.   They then implement these same DSP procedures in  real time using a hardware/software system that allows them to  graphically program a DSP coprocessor card.   Students have the  opportunity to visualize and hear the results of applying  real-time DSP procedures to real-world signals such as speech and  music.   The proposed laboratory augments and enhances offerings  in the School of Engineering and the Department of Computer  Science in digital signal processing, control and robotics,  computer music, and multimedia.",
