Cells rapidly alter their ability to respond to a  given peptide.  This study examines processes that alter the  ability of a cell to respond to one peptide hormone, gastrin  releasing peptide.  This peptide is interesting since tumor cells  secrete this hormone, and grow in response to it.  Thus,  information gained my help develop new cancer therapies.  The  principal investigator has shown that binding of gastrin releasing  peptide to its receptor causes both the hormone and its receptor to  move into the cell, or internalize.  The receptor gradually returns  to the cell surface, a process called recycling.  Now, the  principal investigator is studying these processes in cells that  grow in response to gastrin releasing peptide.  The intracellular  location of the receptor is being determined by microscopy, using  fluorescent peptides and antibodies.  How internalization and  recycling occur is being studied using drugs that block cellular  processes, such as protein synthesis.  The role of internalization  in changing the ability of a cell to respond to gastrin releasing  peptide is being studied by using (1) agents that block this  process, and (2) cells that have mutant receptors that cannot  internalize, and testing the ability to bind and signal with  gastrin releasing peptide.  Finally, the ability of drugs that  block these processes to alter the growth response to gastrin  releasing peptide is being determined.",
