 "awd_abstract_narration": "The laboratory provided by this grant allows and encourages the  distribution of parallel processing throughout a Computer Science  curriculum where it is already established.   Parallel processing  is being used as a tool as well as an object of study.   In  addition, it is being used to support term projects and independent  student research.   Through this project, seven additional courses  can include parallel processing.   The laboratory provided by this  grant includes a SIMD parallel processor that is ideally suited for  many of the assignments and projects in areas such as image  processing, speech and language processing, and neural networks.    In addition, a MIMD processor is being used in some Artificial  Intelligence courses, such as Natural Language Processing and  Machine Learning, and in Graphics courses.   Students from  disciplines such as physics and mathematics have access to the  parallel processing lab for research.   This project can  demonstrate the feasibility of using parallel processing on a large  scale in the undergraduate computer science curriculum.",
