 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507857  Moses  The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a cell-surface  protein that acts to carry signals from outside the cell into its  interior.  One of the molecules that binds to the EGFR, on the  outside of the cell, is Transforming Growth Factor-alpha  (TGF-alpha).  Such signals are then used to regulate cell division  and growth, and are necessary for normal development.  For these  reasons the EGFR, and the other steps in its pathway are the  objects of intense study, and much is known about the molecular  events that follow activation of the EGFR.  Unfortunately, little  is known of how the signals that act on the EGFR are regulated  (such as TGF-alpha): the genes that control TGF-alpha are unknown.   This is due, in large part, to the great expense and time needed to  do genetic experiments in vertebrate animals.  This research will  use the economy and power of invertebrate genetics to overcome  these difficulties to search for the genes that control TGF-alpha.   Invertebrate homologs of TGF-alpha and the EGFR function in the  development of the compound eye.  Some mutations in the  invertebrate EGFR affect the number and spacing of developing eye  facets.  Mutations in an invertebrate homolog of TGF-alpha (called  spitz) also affect compound eye development.  Recent data suggest  that spitz function is required in the founding cell of the  developing facet, and in the absence of spitz function, the  founding cell cannot induce the differentiation of its neighbors,  and facet development is aborted.  The immediate objectives for  this research project are to study early spitz mutant eye defects  by histological examination, make antibodies to spitz protein to  study its expression in the developing eye, make heat-sensitive  mutations of invertebrate EGFR, to study its activity over time  and, finally, to search for other genes that regulate the spitz  signal.  The results of these studies will provide fundamental  information concerning the mechanisms by which extracellular   signalling molecules regulate the growth and development of the  nervous system.",
