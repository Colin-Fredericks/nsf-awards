 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Andrew Granville and  covers a broad range of areas of mathematics, primarily in number  theory, with applications to computer science.  The research  builds on Granville's understanding of the distribution of  primes.  The award also supports his continued work in both  graduate and undergraduate education as well as his exposition.           This Presidential Faculty Fellow award to Andrew Granville  is for excellent research and teaching in number theory.  Number  theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the  oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,  it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for  computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
