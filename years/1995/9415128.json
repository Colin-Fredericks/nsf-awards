 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for the renovation of chemistry research and research training space in Curie Hall, on the campus of Radford University.  This project complements concurrent renovations occurring in Reed Hall.  Both science buildings are interconnected, forming the science center at Radford.  With the renovation to Reed Hall, Curie Hall  can be renovated and used for its original purpose, laboratory research space for faculty and undergraduates. Research, performed by seven investigators, encompasses a breadth of chemistry, including the development and analysis of advanced materials, transition metal chemistry, organic  and environmental chemistry.  Presently  laboratory  space is limited and this project will result in dedicated space for research activities upon completion. The  renovations will  include the addition of four fume hoods, laboratory bench space, storage facilities, and upgraded HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems to seven rooms. The department has a long-standing commitment to undergraduate research, and this renovation will allow additional students the opportunity to participate in research projects, improve the quality of faculty research, provide a safe working environment for research and research training, and support curriculum changes that encourage more student and faculty interactions.***  |        H H     + (\u00e1\u2580\u00e1G \u00c0 F G ( n     H H     + (     d            '                      \u2554     @                          -- a\u00dd\u00aa  \u2580                 ;  \u00e1\u00aa      \u00aa\u00e1                          = \u00d3aO\u00c0 h\u00a2\u00b5  +'\u00aa`0   \u2510           \u00a0       '       s               -       3       ?",
