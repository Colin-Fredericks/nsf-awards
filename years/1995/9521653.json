 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521653  Naomi  In July 1994, a national workshop addressing Research on Advanced  Composites in Construction (RACC) was held in Washington, DC  under NSF sponsorship.  This workshop was a planned activity  aimed at integrating specific research tasks dealing with  characterization, manufacturing, testing procedures, standards,  and analysis/design criteria relative to the use of advanced  composites materials in construction.  It is important that this  type of activity be expanded to the international level to make  government funding agencies aware of the needs and progress in  this area of research and development, to seek new forms of  international collaboration, to address international  standardization and coding issues, and to allow researchers to  review national priorities in light of international  achievements.    A conference/workshop on International Research on Advanced  Composites in Construction will be held in Bologna, Italy, during  the Spring of 1996 addressing the following five areas:  non-  prestressed reinforcement for concrete; prestressed reinforcement  for concrete and cables; structural shapes; structural FRP  systems; and repair systems.  Technical experts from Europe,  Japan, and the Americas will be invited to this activity.  The  U.S.> delegation will consists of ten researchers Central and  South America will be represented by five researchers.  Managers  of national and international funding agencies will also be  invited.    Conference/workshop presentations and recommendation on the  program will be collected in a document for distribution to  universities, professional societies, industry, and government.  ***",
