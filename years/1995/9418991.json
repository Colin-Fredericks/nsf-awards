 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418991  MacLaughlin    Electronic structure, magnetism, and superconductivity in  highly correlated electron materials will be investigated  using nuclear magnetic resonance and muon spin rotation  techniques.  The research uses the sensitivity of these two  techniques to microscopic (atomic) charge and spin  correlations as tools to probe local effects of strong  electron correlation.  The techniques will be used to study  four different systems:  1) spin susceptibility, charge and  spin dynamics in lanthanum based planar cuprates and  nickelates which exhibit quantum and anti ferromagnetism, 2)  spin-liquid behavior and effects of defects (chain breaks,  hole doping) in Haldane chain compounds, 3) non-Fermi-liquid  properties of Kondo alloys and heavy-fermion compounds, and  4) dynamics of low-lying superconducting excitations in  uranium based heavy-fermion superconductors.  %%%  Understanding effects of correlations between electrons on  magnetism and conduction in solids remains an important  unsolved problem in condensed matter physics.  This research  uses magnetic resonance techniques as a probe of correlated-  electron behavior at the atomic level.  In magnetic  resonance, the weak but measurable magnetism of probe\"  magnetic moments, (e.g. nuclei) is used to \"spy\" on the  local magnetic environment of the probes, which do not  seriously perturb their surroundings.  The research seeks  better understanding of the behavior of 1) oxide magnets  closely related to high-temperature superconductors, and 2)  the so-called heavy-electron metals, in which electrons  behave as if they were hundreds or even thousands of times  more massive than the free electrons.  The work will involve  university, government laboratory, industrial and  international collaboration.  ***",
