Through the analysis of traits with known function, and explorations of the theoretical and experimental relationship between structure, function, and fitness,  we can begin to understand why required functions differ and why structures also differ among species.     A particularly good model system is the genetics of vision and of color patterns, which are essential to visually oriented species.  The appearance, perception and usefulness of an animal's color pattern depend upon interactions of the spectral composition of the light environment, the reflectance spectra of each pattern element, and the cone pigments in the viewers' eye.  Any changes in the visual environment or visual parameters should affect perception and hence fitness in a predictable way.     Dr. Endler proposes to examine the effects of sensory biases by means of an extensive artificial selection experiment that will select for altered vision, and examine the possible effects of this in Poecilia reticulata.  He will also run a semi-natural experiment in which visual conditions and predation will be varied independently.    These questions are interesting and important from the viewpoint of selection, and also have important implications for the origin and maintenance of species.  Efforts to conserve and protect endangered species usually concentrate on ecological factors such as minimum viable population size, genetic factors such as effective population size, and unknown factors encompassed in efforts toward general habitat protection.  However, if we do not understand how a species maintains itself we cannot hope to protect it indefinitely.  The proposed work specifically inquires into species recognition,  and will quantify (1) changing visual perception by direct artificial selection on visual parameters, and (2) changing the visual environment.  Because the research tests general principles with an ideal model system,  the results should be of wide general application.",
