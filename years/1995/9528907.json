 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528907  Merrill    The goal of this research is an understanding of the role of  meteorological influences on the oxidizing capacity of the  atmosphere.  In collaboration with a team of atmospheric chemists  and modelers we will study the chemical behavior of the North  Atlantic Ocean atmosphere using surface-based measurements,  ozonedonse, aircraft and remote sensing techniques.  Our work  entails analysis to quantify the continuous and dynamic influence  of transport and removal processes on ozone and a number of  chemical tracers.  Pulses of high surface ozone on Bermuda are  often associated with the passage of cold fronts.  During the  spring of 1995 we will observe the meteorological and chemical  properties across fronts from aircraft and ozonesondes and assess  the relative contributions of different sources.  In conjunction  with the field intensives proposed for AEROCE phase III, we will  provide extensive operational meteorological support.  In addition,  we will be responsible for integration of the resulting  meteorological and chemical observations and will collaborate with  other AEROCE PI's in their interpretation.  A series of high-  altitude aircraft flights are proposed for spring of 1996 and we  will provide meteorological information to differentiate the  relative importance of natural and anthropogenic sources.  We will  use potential vorticity analyses to assess the importance of  transport from the stratosphere and upper troposphere into the  middle and lower troposphere.  We will prepare isentropic  trajectory analysis and combine these with the chemical  observations using cluster analysis to filter the data and identify  data collected under similar large scale motion.  These will allow  us to prepare chemical climatologies not only for 03, but for CO  and other tracers.  With several years of ozone data, we will  determine the extent to which large-scale atmospheric motion  controls the interannual variability over the NAO.  Finally, we  will develop detailed case s tudies for selected periods of  meteorological interest, as well as during the groundbased and  airborne intensives.  For these times we will make use of remotely-  sensed rainfall and other meteorological data.  Results from these  investigations will help to resolve questions regarding the  meteorological processes controlling ozone cycling over the NAO.",
