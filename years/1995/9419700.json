 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB-9418700  Abstract    How plant viruses move from the initially inoculated cell to  neighboring cells and eventually systemically to cause  disease is not understood.   Red clover necrotic mosaic  virus (RCNMV) has been developed as a model system to study  plant virus movement.  To understand the mechanisms of both  cell-to-cell and long distance movement, a series of  genetic, biochemical and cell biology experiments are  designed to address the following questions:  How does the  movement protein (MP) facilitate viral spread from cell to  cell?  Where within the cell does the MP appear to act?  Can  fuctional domains be distinguished in the MP?  What are the  roles of the MP and capsid protein (CP) in long distance  movement of the virus? I s virion formation requried for  long distance movement? Do the movement and capsid protiens  interact with one another to achieve long distance movement?  What if any, host factors interact with the MP and/or CP to  cause a systemic infection?  The approaches to answer these  questions are outlined in the following three objectives: 1)  Generate and characterize alanine scanning mutants of the  RCNMV CP. 2) Analyze wild-type and mutant RCNMV MP behavior  in transgenic plants. 3) Identify host factors that  facilitate viral cell-to-cell and/or long distance movement  and characterize the interactions between MP, CP, and host  factors.       A series of CP alanine scanning mutants will be  constructed and analyzed for CP expression, virion  formation, and their ability to facilitate long distance  movement.  Transgenic plants will be generated expressing  the wild-type and mutant MPs.  These will be used to  determine the subcellular localization of MPs as well as for  complementation experiments.  Wild-type and mutant CPs and  MPs over-produced in E.coli will be microinjected into  various plant cell types and assayed for the ability to  modify plasmodesmata and transport macromoleucles from one  cell type to another.  The hypothesized interactions betw een  MP and CP will be assessed genetically, biochemically, in  gel shift assays, by the yeast two hybrid system, and/or by  mutational analysis.  cDNA expression libraries from RCNMV  systemic host plants will be screened for a host factor(s)  that specifically interacts with the MP using the yeast two  hybrid system, lgt11 colony hybridization, or affinity  chromatography.       Results from the proposed expeirments will afford a  better understanding of the mechanisms by which plant  viruses move and ultimately cause disease.  They will also  serve as a basis for studying how plant viruses usurp normal  host functions to achieve infection and how plants  communicate from cell to cell.  The identification of host  factors involved in viral movement will provide insights  into protein-protein interactions, host specificity, and the  structure and function of plasmodesmata.  %%%  This proposal seeks to understand how plant RNA viruses move  from cell to cell.   There are several players in the  process, a protein called movement protein (MP) , the  protein which comprises the coat of the virus to make up the  capsid (CP), and the exquisitely organized channels between  plant cells which traverse the cell wall of adjacent cells,  the plasmodesmata.  Previous work in the Lommel  lab has  shown that changes in the amino acid sequence (through site-  directed mutagenesis) of the movement protein incapacitate  viral spread from cell to cell.  It has also been shown that  CP mutations change the ability of the virus to move over  long distances, e.g., from leaf to leaf.  There is a  postulated interaction of CP with MP and the nature of that  interaction will now be explored through controlled  mutagenesis of CP, followed by analyzing  cell to cell  movement and by determining the nature of the interaction of  CP with mutant and wild type MP.  The nature of the  interaction of these proteins with host proteins will also  be determined, since it is hypothesized that some host  protein is involved in lo ng distance transport. The nature  of cell-to-cell transport in plants is one of the main  questions confronting plant cell biologists currently and  typifies the field in that incremental increases in our  basic knowledge will lead to potentially large pay-offs in  both fundamental (plasmodesmatal action) and applied (plant  disease resistance) areas.  ***",
