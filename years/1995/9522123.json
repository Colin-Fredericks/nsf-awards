With input by representatives from outside the    mathematical sciences community, it will examine what steps mathematics should    take to build upon existing connections with such areas as materials science,    the    biological sciences, and medical science, and determine what actions the    community should take in response to the changed environment to change the way    mathematical research is pursued in the United States.  A summary report of    the    forum that details specific action guidelines will be generated and rapidly    transmitted to the mathematical sciences research community to stimulate    unified    and coordinated action in beneficial directions that respond to the new    imperatives facing the community and the nation.  This document will be    primarily    directed toward the mathematical sciences community, and will particularly    target    the sizeable part of the research community that does not yet fully appreciate    how pervasive and far-reaching are the changes underway.  It will also provide    information on resources, and spotlight what actions are needed and how to    commence them.  The last 6 months of the 15 month project will be devoted to    dissemination efforts, including presentations at professional meetings,    having    articles describing the actions published in flagship news journals for the    profession, and making the summary report available electronically on the    Internet.",
