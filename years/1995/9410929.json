 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  94-10929  Studies of the NOD kinesin-like protein found in Drosophila  melanogaster and its role in mediating achiasmate disjunction will  be continued. These studies are designed to test a model in which  the NOD kinesin-like protein is distributed along the length of the  chromosome arms and acts to push chromosomes away from the poles.  We also propose to continue our molecular and genetic studies of  the Axs gene and its role in allowing the proper separation of  achiasmate homologs. In the absence of normal Axs gene product,  achiasmate homologs fail to separate and cause the developing  spindle to buckle, fray or even break. Thus, a detailed  understanding of the Axs gene product will provide significant  insight into the manner by which achiasmate homologs are associated  prior to their separation. Finally, a screen designed to identify  mutations specifically defective in heterologous segregation will  be carried out. The subsequent molecular analysis of genes defined  by these mutations represents a long term goal of this proposal.  %%%  How chromosomes identify their partners and thereby allow the  orderly process of transmission of the correct number and types of  chromosomes to progeny is a central question in heredity. Work from  this laboratory has contributed much to our understanding of some  of the involved mechanisms. Genetic approaches have been used to  demonstrate that, in Drosophila females at least, there are two  separate systems of achiasmate segregation. The elucidation of the  physical bases of these processes at the molecular level is the  goal of this work.  ***",
