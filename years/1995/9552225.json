In addition, many of  the statistics classes are being taught in this Classroom.   Consequently this Computer Classroom is currently being utilized  almost entirely for classroom teaching.  Lack of open access to  this Computer Classroom by students makes the use of the computer  technology and useful mathematical software primarily for  demonstration purposes only in calculus and statistics courses, and  also discourages faculty teaching other mathematics courses from  incorporating innovative computer based instruction and projects.   This project is extending calculus and other mathematical reform  efforts at Towson by helping prepare an open computer laboratory  for students use for projects and assignments outside of  mathematics classes.  This is allowing students to use mathematical  computer software programs outside of their class meeting time.   This open laboratory is also being used by students taking other  courses such as Numerical Analysis, Linear Algebra, Differential  Equations, Mathematical Models and Concepts of Mathematics for  Elementary Teachers to complete computer assignments and projects  as well to use commercial and faculty authored interactive text  material to enhance their comprehension of the material.  In  summary, this proposal will ensure that the computer technology and  use of mathematical software becomes an integral part of the  curriculum.",
