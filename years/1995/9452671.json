The project provides students with classroom  lectures and discussions, field trips, hands-on laboratory and  research experiences in the specific engineering areas of material  science, environmental, and computer-assisted engineering. The  students are guided by experienced university faculty to develop  research methods and problem-solving skills. Projects developed  during their research experience are shared with classmates during  the academic year. Continued student involvement in engineering  related activities with the university takes place through video  tele-conferencing and participation in university sponsored  designed competitions.",
