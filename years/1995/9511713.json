 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project is designed to advance the  comparative study of MixeZoquean (MZ) and Zapotecan (Zn)  languages. No MZ language has more than a rudimentary syntactic  description, and for most even morphological description is  incomplete. We are targeting Ayapa, Oluta, Oaxaca Zoque,  Soteapan, and Texistepec for work in these areas, building on the  foundation provided last season. The project will also build a  lexical and textual foundation for those MZ languages that were  not investigated in previous seasons: Highland Mixe, Lowland  Mixe, and (conditions permitting) Chiapas Zoque. There are fairly  large vocabulary collections for these languages, but some  phonological features are unclear or underspecified, morpheme  classification is not adequate, and text collections are lacking.       Zn languages are mostly not fully documented, and the same  needs exist as for MZ. Three Zapotec languages (Isthmus,  Guelavi*a, and Oaxaca environs) and one Chatino language  (Zenzontepec)are targeted for initial documentation of the type  done in 1993 and 1994.        The proposed work is significant in several areas. Both MZ  and Zn languages have structural properties of interest to  current linguistic theory, although they are structurally highly  dissimilar. Notably, MZ has ergativity and OV morphosyntax,and Zn  has tones and an often opaque system of prefixes and proclitics  on verbs. The project has the potential to make a major  contribution to early Mesoamerican cultural and linguistic  history: MZ languages were spoken by Olmecs,and were influential  at the Olmec era and subsequently in affecting many other  languages in the area. It contributes to the ongoing decipherment  of epi-Olmec writing; the interpretation of its texts depends  heavily upon MZ comparative studies, which were crucial in the  original decipherment. Zn comparative studies, though lagging  behind MZ studies, are already advancing the decipherment of  Oaxacan writing. Finally, it includes a major language salvag e  operation, helping to preserve an important part of the  linguistic heritage of the Americas.",
