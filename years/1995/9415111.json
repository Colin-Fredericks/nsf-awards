 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spelman College is one of the premier institutions charged with educating African American  women.  The College is the leading educator of African American women scientists in the nation. Integral to the institution's science program is a strong emphasis in research and research training.  Faculty members are currently undertaking research  in such areas as analytical chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, spectroscopy, environmental biology, neurobiology cell and molecular biology, and atomic physics, all having far reaching implications for society.  Each faculty member supervises an average of four undergraduate research assistants.  Opportunities to collaborate with faculty on directed research projects are further complemented by a wide range of sponsored research training programs that provide early exposure and hands-on training to over 150 undergraduate students. However, the ability of Spelman to maintain this momentum is impeded by obsolete and inadequate research facilities in Tapley Hall, the 70 year old science building.  The building cannot support the current level of faculty and student investigations or provide a safe environment to conduct such activities.   To insure the continued vigor of the science at Spelman, the College will construct a new science complex that will include a facility dedicated to research, research training and teaching laboratories in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.  NSF funds will be used to replace  current space dedicated to research and research training, and laboratory support facilities including instrumentation and cold rooms.  A renovated Tapely Hall will serve as a classroom and instructional laboratory facility, for five science disciples including research and research training space for mathematics and computer science. This replacement project will be instrumental in supporting the efforts of this historically Black institution as it continues to address the challenge of African American women participation in the  science.  It will also enhance the research program required for early exposure and advanced training to the next generation of women scientists who will contribute to the nation's research and development  potential.",
