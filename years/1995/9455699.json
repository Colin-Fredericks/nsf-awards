 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455699  Carlos   Cultural anthropology is grounded in field research. Most  undergraduates never get the opportunity to explore the  relationship between ethnographic theory and field methods by  applying research methods in a field environment. This project  addresses these limitations by developing an undergraduate course  that combines classroom-based instruction and computer-based field  research simulators used in a computer laboratory. The simulators  complement lectures, readings, and a course handbook that guides  students through the lesson objectives. These materials are  integrated into a year-long course on scientific field data  collection methods and analysis and their relationship to  ethnographic theory.  We propose to further develop interactive  cmmputer simulators (a prototype has been developed) to recreate  key aspects of the field research experience in an actual peasant  communities. These simulators allow undergraduates to actually \"do\"  fieldwork, use theory as a framework for field research, analyze  their own data, and manage limited resources in an interactive  research environment. Development of curricular materials and  simulators includes peer review and extensive consultation with  technical experts available on campus to the Pl. The materials are  scheduled for extensive off-campus evaluation.  The impact of this proposal is twofold: (1) scientific research  methods, analysis, and theory can be taught hand-in-hand with  actual field research assignments, and (2) students learn broadly  applicable and transferable social scientific research skills,  including the management and organization of computerized  ethnographic data.",
