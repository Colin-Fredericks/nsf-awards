The University of Washington's Chemistry Department proposes adding to its  significant outreach programs a Science Service Learning-Community (SSL-C) class which links  undergraduate students to community projects.  Students who take the service learning section  of the basic three quarters chemistry series have the opportunity for a concurrent commitment  to a community service project.  Students are able to select one of three forms of community  service:  1) link directly with an ongoing community group; 2) assist teachers and students to  implement on-going community service projects such as growing food for community food  banks; 3) serve in an elementary classroom assisting teachers to develop hands-on curricula  which help students understand the relationship between science and their community.   Numerous community groups and non-profit organizations take advantage of limited funding  resources, such as Neighborhood Community Action Grants, to undertake projects to benefit  their communities.  Many of these projects are science based, such as water monitoring, stream  revegetation, and salmon habitat efforts.  Typically these projects do not involve university  students, but they can be a perfect training ground for students to become involved in specific  activities which need scientific input to achieve measurable changes in communities.  Developing  such relationships help achieve neighborhood goals; link students with mentors who live their  commitment to community service; and graphically illustrate to students the value of adding  scientific information to projects that directly impact communities.  This approach is particularly  important for young women because they are provided with opportunities to enhance their self-  esteem and perception; develop a b etter understanding of the scientific process through  applications of specific scientific concepts; develop a more positive image of scientists.  It also  enhances interest in and commitment to science majors by focusing on how science can help  people/the community.    The goals of this project are to instill in university science students the importance of  scientifically-based community service through projects which are designed and driven by  community volunteers, to encourage elementary students to generate and sustain community  service projects which have academic outcomes, and to generate elementary science curricula  which draw students into scientific inquiry through hands-on science related to community needs  and concerns.  This program can provide a model for intergenerational community service  learning with measurable academic outcomes.  The project is being jointly funded with FIPSE  (U.S. Department of Education).  ***",
