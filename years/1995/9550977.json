 "awd_abstract_narration": "New standards for the K 12 curriculum which have been  developed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics call  for the integration of technology into the teaching and learning  of mathematics and for the increased use of active explorations  in mathematics.  Mathematics education majors need to gain  experience in these areas during their preservice mathematics  courses, so that they can then bring this knowledge with them  into the public schools.       The objective of this project is to integrate computer  visualization of geometric ideas into a geometry course.  Seven  lab activities are being developed, with components on Euclidean  and Non-Euclidean geometries, transformations and projective  geometry, tilings, polyhedra, and geometric constructions.  The  primary software used to carry out the lab projects is GeomView,  a geometry exploration system developed at the Geometry Center in  Minneapolis, MN.  Additional software will include Mathematica  and Geometer's Sketchpad.         The project will provide mathematics education majors models  and tools which they will integrate into their own teaching, thus  strengthening the climate for teaching and learning in the public  schools.  Evaluation of the effectiveness of the project will be  through surveys of teachers once they are in the public schools.",
