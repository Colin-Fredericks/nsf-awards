This is the fourth in a series of Explomet conferences which were initiated in 1980 and held in succeeding 5-year periods.  The previous three Explomet conferences culminated in the publication of three hard-bound volumes, which total more than 3000 pages.  The support provides registration support for 16 students to attend the conference.  Explomet '95 will also publish a proceedings to encourage a world-wide dialogue focusing on applications of shock-wave and high-strain-rate phenomena in materials.   %%% Explomet '95 is particularly unique because it explores aspects of military-oriented research which can have impact  on commercial and industrial applications and offers prospects for materials process developments which might be affected by the recent passage of NAFTA in North America.  ***",
