The goal of the research is the  development of the technology for a new type of particle detector  useful for several important experiments in neutrino physics and  astrophysics.  This superfluid helium-based detector would have  the ability to measure the energy and location of a particle  event as well as, possibly track direction.  Such a detector  would be unique in being able to detect 20 keV particles in a 10  ton mass of liquid helium.  Superfluid helium is well suited as a  target material for detecting low-energy particles in a very  large mass.  It is extremely pure, it is inexpensive, and it can  be easily handled in bulk.  Specialized equipment already constructed to investigate the use  of helium as particle detector will be employed in the proposed  research.  Only minor modifications to an existing cryogenic  system and modest additions to the electronics are required.  Work on improving cryogenic bolometers is to be performed in  conjunction with groups in Munich and Heidelberg who are  interested in the same technical problems but have different  research goals.  The group at Brown carrying out these experiments is an unique  collaboration among particle, condensed matter, and low  temperature experimentalists.  The proposed experimental program,  if successful, will provide the technology to make possible  frontier experiments in neutrino and astrophysics.  ***",
