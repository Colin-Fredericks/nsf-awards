 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a three-year continuing CAREER  award.  This project is developing computer algorithms that find  object boundaries in CCD camera images using cues other than  changes in average grey-scale intensity: color, texture, and  stereo. Intensity edge finding is complicated by slopes and  boundaries within regions, caused by shading. These effects are  much smaller for non-intensity features, particularly color. In the  presence of texture, non-intensity features may offer comparable  spatial resolution. Techniques are being developed for computing  each feature with low noise and at high-spatial resolution. Better  opponent color values can be produced by modifying the framegrabber  interface. Several broadly-tuned energy operators are being  evaluated for use as texture features. Preattentive stereo  information can be computed using a narrow-range matcher or by  meauring the degree of fusion with texture energy operators. The  comparative reliability of different cues is being assessed.  Finally, boundaries can be extracted using a new robust estimation  technique and used as input to existing shape analysis and  attentive texture identification algorithms.",
