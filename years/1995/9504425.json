(1) The investigator studies the theoretical properties of various   data-resample model selection methods in linear and nonlinear regression,   generalized linear models, time series and multivariate analysis.  New and advanced methods will be developed in problems where the  existing methods lead to unsatisfactory results. (2) Data-resample  methods that can be applied to complex survey data with imputed   missing values will be developed. This includes modification and   adaptation of the existing data-resample methods which are not suitable   for complex survey data. (3) The investigator's study of the  theoretical properties of the data-resample methods include investigations   of the asymptotic (large sample) properties and the fixed (small)   sample performances of the data-resample methods. The relative   performances of different methods will be assessed. The results   will be given in a form which can be easily adopted as a guide for   practical applications. (4) The data-resample methods usually require   repeated computations of some given statistics. In model selection and   sample survey problems the size of the data set is usually large so   that the computation required by some data-resample methods may be cumbersome.  The investigator studies some efficient methods for computations.    Statistical analysis is usually based on a data set that is a sample  from a population which is a collection of values of some variable of  interest. Since the sample is only a part of the population, conclusions   drawn based on the sample are subject to certain statistical errors.  A method for assessing statistical errors, called the data-resample method,  takes many sub-samples from the sample by treating the sample as  the population, and makes inference by applying th e analogous relationships   between the sample and the population  to  the sub-samples and the  sample. This method has caught on very rapidly in recent years because   (1) the existence of inexpensive and fast computing facilities ensures   that this computer-intensive method can be implemented; (2) this   method sometimes provides more accurate and/or stable solutions than the   traditional methods that are commonly used; (3) the theoretical derivations   required in applying the traditional methods are very difficult when the  problem under consideration is complex. Although there are many developments   in using this method over the last two decades, the recency of this   technique has left many questions unanswered which are relevant to practical   application. The aims of this research are in the area of development,   evaluation, and application of many types of data-resample methods in   various complex statistical problems.",
