 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal we request funding for a Perkin-Elmer / Applied  Biosystems Automated Sequencer model 373A-01 . This machine will be  used primarily by a group of four labs and will be also open to other  users in the Department of Plant Biology and the Department of  Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. Prior experience with a  loaned machine demonstrates that we will make efficient use of it.  Space, support staff, and collective resources are available for  permanent housing and maintenance of the machine. There is currently no  core sequencing facility on the Berkeley campus. This machine would  double the number of permanent machines on campus and would be the only  one available to members of either department .        Access to borrowed automated sequencer has accelerated the rate at  which we conduct our current NSF sponsored work and has also  facilitated innovations of new approaches or expansions of prior  expectations in the fields of microbial ecology, population genetics,  plant development, and plant disease resistance. It is clear that  automated sequencing will soon be the method of choice for labs such as  ours in which sequence acquisition is a rate limiting step, and as such  it is also the method that graduate students and postdoctoral  associates should learn.",
