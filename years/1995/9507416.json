 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507416    Changes in temperature have significant effects on the rates  of biochemical reactions.  We know how short term changes in  temperature affect the growth rate, respiration  and  growth  efficiency of microbes, but we know relatively little  about  how  these factors change during evolutionary adaptation  to  change  in  temperature.  This research  will  contrast  the  effects of temperature on energetics and growth of ancestral  strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli with changes  that  occur   during  evolutionary  adaptation  of  the  bacteria.  Multiple lines of bacteria derived from a common stock  will  be  cultured  in  new thermal environments, including  high,  low,  and variable temperature. For each line, growth  rate,  respiration rate, and the efficiency with which the bacteria  convert  food into new bacterial tissue will be  determined.  The  research will determine how adaptation to a  particular  thermal  regime alters the ability of the bacteria  to  grow  and  compete in other thermal environments.  Replication  of  selection  experiments with multiple lines of bacteria  will  reveal  the range of variation in genetic responses  to  new  thermal  environments.   This  research  will  increase  our  ability  to  predict the long term response of  bacteria  to  environmental variation, which is important because microbes  are  important  energy consumers and nutrient  recyclers  in  natural  ecosystems.  It will identify  traits  that  confer  adaptive   advantages   at   different   temperatures,   and  demonstrate    the   impact   of   those   adaptations    on  bioenergetics.  The identification of traits  that  increase  growth  efficiency  at  different temperatures  will  be  of  potential value in commercial culture operations.",
