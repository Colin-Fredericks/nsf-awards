 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422071  Crowl     This award is to purchase ATM networked multiprocessor workstation equipment which will be dedicated to support research in computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular: the abstraction techniques for parallel programming; the task-parallel programming environment; and the data-parallel programming environment.     In the first project, the proposed equipment will enable the researchers to design, implement and evaluate abstractions that can simultaneously exploit fast shared-memory communication and tolerate slow message-based communication.  Furthermore, the proposed equipment will also enable researchers to do controlled experiments to determine application tolerance to communication latencies.     In the second project, the proposed equipment will enable researchers to investigate and develop a parallel programming environment for shared-memory multiprocessors clustered over a high speed ATM network.  They will also develop schemes for partitioning and mapping of tasks and data for scheduling as well as load balancing.  In addition, they will also be able to study the performance of scientific application programs.     In the third project, the researchers will be able to synthesize a new C* compiler that generates code for a high-speed network of multiprocessor workstations.  They will evaluate language extensions and, in particular, will incorporate explicit data decomposition directives, more general control flow , and parallel I/O into the language.",
