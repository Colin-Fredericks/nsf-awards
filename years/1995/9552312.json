 "awd_abstract_narration": "The single largest obstacle to the development of client/server  networks and applications is the lack of qualified personnel.    This project constructs a client/server laboratory for the use of  computer science and information science students.   The project  has two major objectives.   The first objective is to ensure that  each student has a firm grasp of the fundamentals of client/server  technology and associated software development.   The second  objective is to give each student a substantial amount of hands-on  experience working with a client/server network.      Courses in  four interrelated subject areas--networking, databases, software  engineering, and client/server applications--are being redesigned.    Each course provides additional coverage of client/server  concepts, along with laboratory exercises and experiments to  reinforce these concepts.   Networking courses emphasize design,  construction, and testing of client/server networks.   Database,  software engineering, and client/server applications courses stress  the software side of heterogeneous client/server development and  its associated tools.   The project is enriching the education of  many undergraduate students with client/server experience and  instruction.   These students can then provide technological  leadership to industry.",
