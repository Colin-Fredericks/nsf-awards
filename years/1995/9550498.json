 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550498  Wright    This three year project is Phase II of an Event-Based Science (EBS)  model with the outcome of nine curricular modules organized around  events in the life sciences and physical sciences for middle school  students.  Beginning with a \"hook\" in the form of viewing a video  based on real life events, the students are led to the development  of authentic tasks in the context of those events; the tasks create  the need to know more about the science involved.  The tasks lead  to products such as written and oral recommendations, scientific  conferences, poster sessions, models, pamphlets, newspapers and  television shows.  Based on group learning dynamics, the students  apply their newly acquired science knowledge to be evaluated on the  quality of their work.  Accompanying EBS books supply information  for the students to complete teh tasks, but they are led to explore  other resources.  Science concepts are revealed by hands-on  activities.  This project follows the successful development of  nine units of Event-Based Science focused on the earth sciences.   The collaboration between the Montgomery County Public Schools, the  Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., CNN, USA Today, Carolina Biological  Supply Co. and agencies of the U.S. government is continued in the  preparation of these modules.",
