 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. John Terrell and his colleagues will conduct archaeological research in the coastal Aitape region of Papua New Guinea. During a 1993-4 survey, surface collections were made at selected locations along 265 km. of coastline in a region where no prior archaeological work had been conducted. The team will now return to these sites to: establish the age for pottery making in the region; test and refine a proposed ceramic sequence; and document how often pottery, stone and other materials from outside localities occur in the region. To accomplish these goals stratigraphic excavations will be conducted at several locations. Datable materials will be collected to establish a reliable radiocarbon chronology. Finally, chemical and petrographic analysis will be conducted on obsidian and ceramics to determine points of origin.  The Aitape region has long been of interest to anthropologists because of an apparent paradox. Linguistically the region is extremely diverse and large numbers of different cultural groups who speak different languages live closely side by side. However ethnographic evidence indicates that there is extensive trade among them and that they are quite similar in terms of traditional material culture. Anthropologists wish to understand how diversity in several basic cultural realms is maintained in the face of forces which lead towards unity in other areas. The goal of Dr. Terrell's archaeological research is to trace the emergence of interaction over time and to gain insight into the present pattern through the understanding of how it developed. The area is archaeologically unknown and the date of its first occupation has not been established.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the prehistory of the Pacific and increase our understanding of how cultural diversity develops and is maintained.",
