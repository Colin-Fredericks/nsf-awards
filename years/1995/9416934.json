 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416934  Mills    This award supports the participation of 11 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-  Japan seminar on Molecular Aspects of Pathogenicity, to be held at  the Mie Kohseinenkin Vacation Center at Ise-city, Japan from  September 24-29, 1995.  The co-organizers are Dr. Dallice Mills of  Oregon State University and Professor Hitoshi Kunoh of Mie  University. The main theme of this seminar is the role of signal  transduction pathways in cell/cell communication and the  establishment of compatible and incompatible interactions between  hosts and their pathogens.  The proposed general topics to be  discussed include: new concepts regarding genic interactions between  plants and pathogens, the induction and regulation of signal  transduction pathways in pathogen morphogenesis and etiology, the  molecular characterization of pathogen elicitors and plant resistance  genes, the molecular and physiological basis of plant/microbe  recognition, the role of toxins in disease and host-pathogen specificity,  and the genetic engineering of host plant resistance to pathogens.    This meeting is the seventh in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field held over a period of almost 30 years.  Participants in the  seminars change through the years to reflect an appropriate pairing  between U.S. and Japanese scientists and the progress of the research.   The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of expertise and  geographical representation in the general area of plant host/pathogen  interactions, and were selected on the basis of being the most active  researchers in the U.S.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives  of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international collaboration.  ***",
