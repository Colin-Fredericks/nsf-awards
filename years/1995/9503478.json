 "awd_abstract_narration": "Othmer       The investigator and his colleagues conduct a special year in  mathematical biology in the Department of Mathematics at the  University of Utah.  Cooperating departments include the  Departments of Biology, Bioengineering and Human Genetics and the  Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training  Institute.  The primary objective of the special year is to train  graduate students and post-docs in the art and science of modeling  applied to biological problems.  Each quarter focuses on a specific  area of biology in which mathematics has had a significant impact  and in which there are significant new opportunities: Ecology and  Evolution (Fall 1995), Physiology and Cell Biology (Winter 1996),  and Cardiovascular Physiology and Biological Fluid Dynamics  (Spring 1996).  The educational program includes (i) a full year  course entitled `Mathematical Modeling in Biology' given by  visiting principal lecturers, who present a case study of applying  mathematical modeling to a biological problem in their area of  expertise, (ii) a weekly seminar series given by principal  lecturers, other visitors, and scientists from the University of  Utah, (iii) a quarterly minisymposium in an active research area  within the purview of that quarter, and (iv) a student/post-doc  seminar aimed at informal presentation of ideas, new results, and  open problems.  The notes from the course will be published.       The goal of the Special Year in Mathematical Biology at the  University of Utah is to train young scientists in mathematical  modeling of biological problems.  Graduate students and post-docs  are immersed in an interdisciplinary educational and collaborative  environment that brings them together with leading mathematicians  and scientists.  Although mathematics has long provided important  insights into biological processes, developments in biology and  mathematics have made the link more important.  Basic biological  research has increasing relevance to national priorities such as   health care and environmental protection, and powerful new  experimental techniques have made it possible to observe  previously inaccessible mechanisms in physiology, genetics, and  ecology.  Expanded access to powerful computers has enabled  researchers to simulate complex and realistic models of ecological  and physiological systems, establishing modeling and computation  as a new mode of experimentation in the life sciences.  Unfortunately, the training of most biologists and mathematicians  fails to prepare them for this type of research.  The Special Year  in Mathematical Biology prepares young researchers at the pre- and  junior post-doctoral level for these new demands.  The speakers and  researchers invited to this Special Year have established records  of successfully collaborating with both mathematicians and life  scientists.  The program focuses on three active areas of research  in the life sciences: ecology and evolution, physiology and cell  biology, and cardiovascular physiology and biological fluid  dynamics.  These areas have been fertile ground for successful  collaboration and modeling in the past.  The Special Year  introduces young researchers to these successes, involves them in  current research, and illustrates the conceptual connections  between the different fields.  These students, and those benefiting  from the book developed from the Special Year, will be the  catalysts for further development of this vital connection.",
