 "awd_abstract_narration": "WAGNER  9423516  This project will examine the relationships among species for one of North America's largest native groups of moths, the genus Papaipema (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Papaipema is unique among large genera of North American moths in containing both widespread agricultural pest species and highly specialized species (the majority) that feed on only one or a few plants, occur in a very restricted geographical area, or both.  Although the morphology, taxonomy, and life history of Papaipema species are well-understood relative to other large moth genera, no one has yet attempted to reconstruct the phylogeny or address relationships among the species in this genus.  This project will utilize molecular DNA sequence data to construct a cladogram or phylogenetic pattern of relationships.  Once the relationships among the various species have been resolved as much as possible, the cladogram will be used to test hypotheses concerning the generalist/pest/outbreak life style and its converse, extreme specialization on particular host plants.  Specifically, the following questions will be asked:  Did specialization precede the more generalized \"pest\" habit or vice versa?  To what degree can the nature of plant use in this group be explained by similarities in chemical compounds occurring in the plants versus the relationships among the plants themselves or the habitats in which they occur?  %%%  This project will contribute to our basic knowledge of biodiversity in this group of North American moths.  It will also contribute important information about how insects form host plant associations and how pest species originate.  This knowledge holds promise for developing strategies for controlling agricultural, forest and nursery crop pests.  ***",
