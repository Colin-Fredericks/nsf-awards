 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506254  Grossman  Photon flux densities that are in excess of what a plant can  use for photochemistry result in the activation of processes  that help protect the photosynthetic apparatus against  photodamage; specifically, plants can dissipate much of the  excess excitation energy as heat.  This nonradiative energy  dissipation, which is measured as nonphotochemical quenching  (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence, is probably the result of  several processes.  One of these processes, the generation  of zeaxanthin (which may directly quench excited chlorophyll  molecules) via the xanthophyll cycle, occurs in the light-  harvesting antenna complexes.  Other energy dissipating  processes, such as charge recombination between P680+ and QA-  and a cyclic electron flow around photosystem II (PSII), are  associated with the reaction centers.    The objective of this grant is to elucidate the mechanisms  underlying these processes and their relative importance for  photoprotection, using Chlamydomonas as a model organism.  Mutants have been generated by insertional mutagensis, which  will allow for the relatively facile isolation of the genes  of interest.  Physiological characterizations of the mutant  strains grown in high or low light have revealed several  novel classes of mutants, including those that appear to be  defective in 1) the xanthophyll cycle, 2) other mechanisms  of energy dissipation, 3) the regulation of NPQ, and 4)  scavenging of oxygen radicals.    It is proposed to continue physiological, biochemical and  genetic analyses of the mutant strains that have already  been isolated.  These studies will help us evaluate the  importance of known photoprotective processes, discover  specific mechanisms that govern these processes and perhaps  even unveil novel mechanisms that contribute to  photoprotection.",
