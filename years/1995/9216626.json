 "awd_abstract_narration": "9216626  MULLER-KARGER      This is a study of the relation of near surface biogeochemical  processes to the downward flux of particulate materials along a  continental margin where down-slope lateral losses into the ocean's  interior are minimal. Specifically, low-cost ocean margin time  series station in the Cariaco Basin, a depression located on the  continental margin of the southern Caribbean Sea, will be  inflemeated.  Monthly hydrographic casts and bi-weekly sediment  flux at 4 depths using automated moore traps will the conducted  high resolution satellite data will be collected using an antenna  located in Caracas, Benezuela. This program is identified is as  CARIACO (CArbon Retention In A Colored Ocean).  The goals of the  CARIACO program are to:  a) quantify oceanographic processes that  affect the vertical flux of nutrients, carbon uptake, and carbon  deposition, including the interaction between wind speed, sea level  (as an indicator of geostrophic current strength), river discharge,  sea surface temperature, and irradiance above an anoxic basin; to  define variability in biogeochemcial fluxes in an area affected by  seasonal upwelling and river discharge; c) quantify the relative  importance of primary production versus terrigenous inputs of  particulate and dissolved materials in the downward flux and  sediments storage; d) determine the seasonal taxonomic composition  of plankton in the water column, with emphasis on vertical  variations of phytoplankton and foraminifera species; e) develop a  two-dimensional numerical model the allows examination of the  annual cycle of population responses, vertical biogenic fluxes, and  degradation of detritus at depth; and f) examine the relationship  between water-column oceanographic processes and sediment fluxes in  order to understand the origin of sediment varves and their  relationship to past climate change.",
