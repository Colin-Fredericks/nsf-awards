The objective is to investigate properties of  pseudorandom sequences generated by various types of nonlinear feedback  shift registers.  these sequences are widely used in cryptography, spread  spectrum communications systems, and other communications related  applications, and are closely related to error correcting codes.  The first  theme of the work involves the investigation of sequences generated by an  exciting new class of feedback shift registers, Feedback and Carry Shift  registers (FCSRs), which are based on algebra over the 2-adic numbers.  These registers, recently invented by the principle investigator and his  colleague Dr. Mark Goresky, are fast, simple mechanisms that can be used to  generate a large class of pseudorandom sequences.  They have been used to  crack a certain stream cipher system, and the sequences they generate are  closely related to arithmetic codes.  FCSRs tie together research that has  been carried ut in a variety of previously unconnected areas.  They have a  rich algebraic structure that parallels the algebraic structure of the  widely studied m-sequences.  There are many questions to be answered about  these sequences, including questions of their cryptographic properties,  their correlation properties, and their relation to arithmetic codes.  Of   special interest if the potential for generalization to sequences over  arbitrary finite fields, and the application of mechanisms for  nonlinearization akin to those applied to linear feedback shift registers.  The second theme is the search for large families of pseudorandom sequences  for use in practical secure CDMA communications systems.  It appears likely  that CDMA and spread spectrum will become the standard for many high volume  applications.  A new framework for developing sequences with low pairwise  cross correlations and large linear span, developed by the principal  investigator, reduces the problem to one of finding families of functions  over finite fields with certain properties.    *****************************************************************************  Aubrey M.
