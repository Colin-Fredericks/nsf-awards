Recent studies have suggested that large dissolved  polymers, particularly polysaccharides, may be rapidly cycled  within the upper ocean. There are currently few methods, however,  to directly measure the hydrolysis of organic macromolecules in  marine environments. The objective of this pilot project is to test  and apply a new method to measure hydrolysis rates of  polysaccharides in marine  environments.  The method is based on  synthesis of fluorescent-labeled polysaccharides (FLA-  polysaccharides) which can be added to seawater or sediments.  Enzymatic hydrolysis of FLA-polysaccharides yields labeled  fragments of lower molecular weight. The molecular weight changes  of FLA-polysaccharide are determined using gel permeation  chromatography. The end result is a profile showing changes in FLA-  polysaccharides molecular weight vs. time.",
