 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9511262  Van den Pol, Anthony      The hypothalamus is a primary regulatory center in the brain,  controlling everything from the endocrine milieu to body  temperature, circadian rhythms, and food and water intake.   Emerging results suggest that glutamate, a fast-acting excitatory  chemical messenger, plays an important role in neuroendocrine  regulation by acting within the hypothalamus.   A member of the  peptide class of messenger molecules called neuropeptide Y (NPY)  acts more slowly than glutamate.  NPY appears to be involved in  numerous hypothalamic functions including food intake,  reproduction, and circadian rhythms.  A great deal is known about  the effects of NPY, but little is known about the mechanisms used  by NPY to generate these effects.  Dr. Van den Pol proposes to use  several different experimental systems to determine the mechanisms  by which NPY modulates glutamate function in the hypothalamus.  He  will investigate the electrophysiological effects of glutamate and  the modulatory actions of NPY on hypothalamic neurons.  Dr. Van den  Pol will use anatomical procedures to identify the projections of  NPY and glutamate containing neurons within the hypothalamus  revealing unique anatomical features of these cells.  The  modulation of a fast amino acid transmitter by a peptide, while  examined in the hypothalamus, has broad ramifications throughout  neuroscience.  The proposed studies will increase our understanding  of the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of NPY action and  ultimately, will aid our understanding and treatment of a wide  range of neurological disorders.",
