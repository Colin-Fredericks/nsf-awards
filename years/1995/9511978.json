The workshop  will bring together a number of leading  astronomers from the US, the UK and India  having expertise in component areas present in  galaxies which affect galactic nuclei and the  possible production of Active Galactic  Nuclei(AGN).  The workshop will bring together  researchers in traditionally disconnected areas  of research who are interested in exploring the  symbiotic relationships contributing to the  structure and dynamics of AGN.  The aim of the  workshop is to explore why 'activity' occurs  uniquely in the nuclei of the galaxies and to  interpret the many varied observations of AGN.   The workshop is being organized by Susan Lamb  (University of Illinois), Judith Perry  (Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge), and Jayant  Narlikar (Director of IUCAA, Pune, India).  Scope:  The workshop, by providing a forum on  the various elements of the AGN puzzle, is  intended to further cooperative research on the  galactic context of nuclear activity and to  include leading Indian researchers in  trinational collaborations. Considering the  inter-disciplinary expertise of the  participants, the workshop will have high  educational value for participants as well as  for the young Indian students of Astronomy.   Proceedings of the workshop including review  articles and contributed papers will be  published.  ***",
