 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511890  Levitt  Crime is an important social and economic issue in the United States.  The cost of crime to victims is estimated at approximately $200 billion per year.  In addition to that figure, government outlays on the criminal justice system totaled $74 billion in 1990 and private expenditures on protection are the same order of magnitude.  Given the scope of the crime problem, the empirical economics literature addressing the issue is surprisingly small.  This project focuses on finding creative apppoaches to identifying the effects of policy changes in the presence of simultaneity between crime and the policy variables of interest.  More specifically, it considers 1) the effect of police on crime; 2) the impact of prison populations on criminal activity; and 3) relationship between arrest rates and crime.    For example, previous empirical studies have typically uncovered little evidence that additional police officers reduce crime.  One problem with those studies is a failure to adequately deal with the simultaneity between policy and crime: while police may or may not reduce crime, there is little doubt that expenditures on police forces are an increasing function of the crime rate.  This study uses the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial elections as an instrument to break the simultaneity between policy and crime.  Increases in the size of police forces disproportionately occur in election years, but there is little reason to expect that elections affect crime except through changes in the police force.",
