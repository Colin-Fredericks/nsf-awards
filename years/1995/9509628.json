 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International conferences on Fluid Properties and Phase Equilibria for chemical Process Design are held every three years, presently alternating between North America and Europe.  The first six conferences have produced highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government workers in this vital area for chemical process design and simulation.  The meetings have also become the most important gatherings for workers from all over the world; the Sixth Conference held in 1992 in Cortina d Ampezzo, Italy attracted 194 participants form 28 countries.  Each conference has produced important collections of papers in Proceedings volumes.  The Six conference provided almost 900 pages of reviews and new research when published in the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.  The Seventh Conference is scheduled for June 18-23 1995 in Snowmass/Aspen Colorado, USA with much of the same successful format as for the previous Conferences but including some significant enhancements.  The proposal requests funds for travel, meals and lodging for 25 needy US a cademic researchers to reach the conference site.  Those supported would include 12 invited presenters of papers with the rest being young research workers who would not be able to attend without such support.  No request is made for Meeting activity expenses, for organizing committee needs, or for non US",
