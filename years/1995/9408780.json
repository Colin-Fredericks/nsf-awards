 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9408780  Dunn    This research is concerned with the development of optical  diagnostic techniques for solution-based processing of inorganic  materials. The overall objective of the research program is to  develop and create optical probes and spectroscopic methods for  solution-based processing of inorganic solids. The dip coating of  inorganic films from sol-gel precursors will be emphasized to  carefully evaluate the optical probe methods in terms of their  effectiveness and sensitivity. In addition, the studies will be  extended to include a variety of compositions, another  solution-based film deposition method (spin coating) and a  different film configuration (multilayers). The outcome of the  research will be the science and spectroscopy of optical probes  for solution-based processing of materials. The proposed  techniques offer the opportunity to use optical signals to  characterize processing parameters in real-time. The techniques  are compatible with computer-controlled, \"intelligent  manufacturing\" for materials processing.  %%%%  The research program has two complementary goals. The first goal  is to develop optical probes and spectroscopic methods to  characterize the most important ppocessing parameters which will  include film viscosity, drying, stress generation and uniformity.  The second objective is to utilize the probes to characterize the  related chemical and structural changes which occur during film  evolution. The different probes will be sensitive to such  features as film orientation effects, solvent composition  changes, capillary pressure and network collapse. The outcome of  the research will be the science and spectroscopy of optical  probes for solution-based processing of materials. The techniques  discussed in this proposal offer the opportunity to use optical  signals to characterize processing parameters in real-time. The  techniques are compatible with computer-controlled, \"intelligent  manufacturing\" for materials processing.",
