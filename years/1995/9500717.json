 "awd_abstract_narration": "PARAGRAPH 1      In the context of Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics, the evolution of   physical systems is modelled at a microscopic level by Interacting Particle   Systems. Such processes  involve a large number of components (particles) with   either  deterministic or stochastic dynamics, governed by local laws of   interaction. It appears that  large groups of particles, which in principle   evolve  in an unorderly manner, tend to organize themselves in a coherent   pattern at some larger space or time scale. In particular, these rescaled,   possibly stochastic,  microscopic models are expected to give rise to   deterministic Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations  describing the evolution  of   macroscopic  quantities.     One of the problems  addressed here, is the rigorous derivation of nonlinear   partial differential equations  from interacting particle systems . Proceeding   a step further,  one would hope that for   finer scales of the particle systems,  the local random fluctuations are preserved in the macroscopic equation, while   microscopic details still remain hidden. In this framework, we propose  to study  (i) Interacting Particle Systems with long range interactions and weakly   propagating interfaces, and (ii) Stochastic discrete velocity models and fluid   dynamics systems of equations. We are particularly interested in understanding   the convergence of particle systems to weak solutions of the macroscopic   equations, past the formation of shocks  for the fluids equations and past all   possible geometric singularities of the  propagating interfaces. The proposed   techniques are drawn from Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, as well as,   Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes. A crucial part in the analysis of   the interacting particle systems, lies in the interplay of the different   space-time rescaling regimes present, each one with its own limiting   deterministic partial differential equation.                                PARAGRAPH 2      This research project is concerned with the mathematical analysis of microscopic  and macroscopic models of non-equilibrium phenomena arising in material science,  biology and fluid mechanics. The first part of the proposal is concerned with   the derivation of transport properties for materials undergoing phase   transitions (for example alloys changing crystallographic structure). Similar   techniques will hopefully prove useful in the prediction of nonequilibrium   behavior in biological processes. The mathematical tools employed here, are   expected to provide  new detailed quantitative information about our physical   systems, going one step beyond phenomenology. In the second part of the project,  we study the convergence of discrete random models, to gas and fluid dynamics   equations. In addition to the issues proposed in the first part, here we hope   that such discrete models may yield robust algorithms for the numerical   computation of gas dynamics flow, particularly in the presence of  shock waves.",
