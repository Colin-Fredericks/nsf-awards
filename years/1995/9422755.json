 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422755  Stratmann    This project introduces a new approach in studying whether  campaign contributions are used to influence legislative  decisions.  If Political Action Committees (PACs) contribute to  legislators in exchange for a vote favoring their interest,  legislators, who are expected to vote against constituency  interests, have incentives to both accept contributions and to  cheat on the vote-for-money agreement.  Contracts between PACs  and legislators are not legally enforceable - no third party  penalizes reneging or cheating.  One expects that in the absence  of a third party enforcer of vote-for-money contracts, market  arrangements are sought, providing a cheap method to guarantee  contract performance.  This project is an empirical examination  of those market arrangements.  This project focusses on time  patterns of contributions and whether these patterns are  consistent with the hypothesis of a quid pro quo between  legislators and PACs: it is shown that legislators who have  incentives to cheat on an agreement with a PAC, specifying a  vote-for-money exchange, are expected to receive contributions  after performance of the agreed to task.    The project is a study of the timing of contributions by PACs  representing a number of industries.  Detailed, previously  unemployed data, specifying the date on which contributions were  received by legislators, will be used in this project.  Patterns  of contributions over the entire election cycle will be examined  and related to Congressional votes, primaries, and general  elections.  The distribution of contributions in months prior and  after Congressional votes will be analyzed.  Legislators who have  incentives to renege on a vote-for-money contract are expected to  receive contributions after the vote- if they voted in a PAC's  interest.  Differences in contribution patterns for votes that  could be well anticipated and votes that could not be as well  anticipated, will be examined.  Further, leads and lags of  election yea r contributions will be studied; for example, whether  contributions in 1986 (an election year) reflected votes in 1985  or influenced votes in 1987.",
