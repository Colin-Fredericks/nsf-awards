While this is an efficient method for introducing large numbers of  students to science in the brief time allotted to laboratory study  each week, it omits important aspects of scientific research,  including preliminary analysis of a problem, design of methods for  probing the problem, group interaction and discipline, and  discovery by the student.  It is planned to restructure the  mechanics laboratory, the first in a three-course laboratory  sequence for beginning students.  The current nine traditional  experiments will be replaced by three, each focusing on one of the  three fundamental approaches to mechanics: force and motion,  energy, and momentum.  Each experiment will continue over a period  of three weeks, during which students will target their own  conceptions of the topic through an initial computer-assisted  assessment, will then decide how best to test their conceptions  using portable data collection hardware outside of the idealized  classroom setting, will perform their tests using subjects and  environments familiar from everyday experience, and report back to  the laboratory to analyze results and repeat the assessment of  their conceptions, comparing initial conceptions with final  conclusions.  Such student-initiated comparisons, coupled with  evaluations of corresponding performance in lecture courses, will  provide a basis for examining the effectiveness of the approach.   While students will work in groups of three, interaction  among  groups will be facilitated using data from one group to challenge  the others to provide interpretations.  This new remote-interactive  approach to the beginning laboratory is designed to produce  meaningful thought by the student rather than learning by rote, and  is expected to increase student understanding of basic physics as  well as produce in the student a better appreciation both of  physics in particular and the scientific approach in general.",
