The  central topic is the analysis of lexical  pronouns and anaphors in several South Asian  languages.  The principal objective of the  workshop is to reactivate the South Asian  linguistics enterprise by generating a cross-  fertilization of theory and data among leading  scholars in the field.  Other important results  associated with the workshop include the   publication of a fundamental reference work on  the comparative grammars of South Asia  languages, Lexical Anaphors and Pronouns in  South Asian Languages: A Principled Typology,  and the initiation of new research  collaborations, particularly among \"new  generation\" scientists from all three  countries.    Scope:  The workshop has the potential to  reactivate the linkages between linguistic  communities in South Asia and the US.  Both the  Ford and Rockefeller Foundations had been  successful in developing a significant level of  collaboration among scholars of linguistics  through summer institutes, workshops, and  exchanges of scientists.  It is expected that  the workshop will have considerable impact on  laying the foundation for new collaboration  among the participants and focus on the next  areas in which long term collaborative research  can be extended.  The proceedings of the  workshop will be published.    ***",
