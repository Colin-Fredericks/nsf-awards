 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kominz  9506572   The projected research will establish a sequence stratigraphic backstripping procedure.  Sequence stratigraphic and genetic stratigraphic data coupled with well logs and crustal thicknesses will be the input for a two-dimensional, flexural, backstripping effects of sediment loading.  Separation of the eustatic and tectonic components of accommodation space will then be possible, based on the unique temporal and spatial properties of each.  Thermally driven subsidence has an exponential form with depth, that will be a function crustal and mantle stretching.  In-plane stress has a well-defined form with respect to margin distance, but no predictable form in time.  Eustacy also has no predictable form in time.  Eustacy, however, is constant in space.  The model will be designed to be applied to a thermally subsiding region.   The model will be tested on an extensive data set from the Cenozoic of the northern North Sea Basin.  Five traverses, including strike and dip sections, will be interpreted in detail, using both systems tract sequence stratigraphic and genetic sequence stratigraphic concepts.  Recent biostratigraphic data, well logs and deep seismic data will also be included in the data base.    Application of sequence stratigraphic backstripping will produce a range of possible stretching factors, eustatic curves and stress histories for the northern North Sea Basin.  Cross sections showing the decompacted sediment thicknesses as well as underlying bathymetry will add insight to interpretations of sediment sources and basement controls on deposition.",
