 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Dale Webster, Department of Biology, Illinois Institute of Technology and Professor Tsutomu Unemoto, Laboratory of Membrane Biochemistry, Chiba University.  Project funding will enable Dr. Webster to spend ten months in Japan, resident at Chiba University, in order to study the sodium pump of aerobic bacteria and to investigate this pumps involvement in oxidative metabolism. The growing field of the biotechnological use of microorganisms necessitates the accumulation of knowledge concerning their metabolism in general and in particular, of their respiratory chain and its connection to ion transport across cell membranes.  This project brings together research scientists from two countries working in the area of cell physiology. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques, equipment, and facilities at Chiba University while contributing to the overall research effort. Additionally, the extended visit by Webster will help him to establish a personal and professional link with a leading research er in Japan. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.",
