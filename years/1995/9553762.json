 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiber optics technology has an ever increasing number of  applications, not only in industry, manufacturing and research, but  also in the home and office.  Over 80% of the optical fiber in use  in the United States is employed in telecommunications  applications.  It is anticipated the industry will grow at an  accelerating rate as the demands of the \"information super-highway\"  expand into businesses and homes.       The New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE) proposes to  administer and coordinate a series of regional two-day workshops,  one-week summer workshops, two-day technical assistance sessions  and a final one-week summer workshop, beginning in the fall of 1995  and completing in the spring of 1998, designed to increase the  number of high school teachers and two-year college faculty who  will include fiber optics and related topics in their  science/technology programs.  Special attention will be paid to  include traditionally under-served populations such as women and  minorities.  The project will link with the Regional Student  Network and faculty mentors that are part of NEBHE's Equity and  Pluralism project.  The project will include faculty enhancement,  curriculum development and laboratory improvement.  There will also  be strong participation form industry, including a co-PI, members  on an advisory committee, presenters in the workshops, development  of laboratories, site visits and possible future internships for  students.",
