This process and the  differentiation of embryonic cells make ordered development of  embryos possible.  An effective system to study pattern formation  in development is segmentation in Drosophila, controlled by a  hierarchically organized set of genes encoding transcription  factors.  Molecular events underlying the formation of segments can  be considered as a progressive refinement of positional  information, reflected in the expression patterns of these genes.   Maternal mRNAs for segmentation genes first activate downstream  genes in a series of broad, overlapping domains along the anterior-  posterior axis; these in turn activate the \"pair-rule genes\"  expressed in 7 regularly spaced stripes, which then activate  subordinate genes in 14 stripes.  This leads to the formation of 14  repetitive metameres, or segments.  One pair-rule gene critical to  this cascade is even-skipped (eve).  The initial broad stripes of  eve expression, that span 4-6 nuclei, become narrow and sharply  defined, 1-2 cells in width, as time progresses.  This refinement  of the pattern apparently enables eve to play a series of roles in  regulating other genes with increasing precision.  These  investigators will explore the mechanisms and function of this  refinement.  They have already identified a cis-regulatory region  call the \"late element\" in the eve locus that controls the  expression of refined stripes; this element seems to be activated  by products of other pair-rule genes.  The investigators will  identify pair-rule gene products that interact with the late  element directly.  First, they will locate and analyze cis-  regulatory sites within the late element critical for interactions,  employing a novel transgenic strategy they have developed.  Second,  they will perform detailed biochemical studies of protein-DNA  interactions at these sites.   These studies will allow the  investigators better understand how eve and other pair-rule genes  combine their regulatory effects, contributing to understanding the  molecular mechanisms of embryonic development.    ***",
