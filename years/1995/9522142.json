The U.S. last reviewed the status of the Japanese industry in 1990.  The Japanese industry was then seen as more progressive than that  in the U.S. and likely to become even more so in several ways.      A team of experts from industry, academia, and research  laboratories will review innovative construction projects and  construction-related R&D activities at government and company  research institutes; construction materials and new capabilities  facilitated by new materials; construction field operation &  automated equipment; building mechanical, control and safety  systems; types & design of structural systems; computing and  information sharing in design and construction technologies related  to environmental protection and energy conservation.  Within these  areas, the report will focus on the innovation process.",
