 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500311 Fokas  The PI is investigating mathematical aspects  arising in the study of  integrable equations, as well as their  implications for the associated  physical problems modeled by  such equations. Emphasis will be  placed on the following two  problems: (a) The solution of initial- boundary value problems on  the half-infinite life for decaying initial  and boundary data;  (b) Investigation of certain new integrable  generalizations of  the well known integrable equations and their  novel mathematical  solutions, which include peakons and  compactons.  In recent  years important advances in the study of certain nonlinear   equations have occurred. In particular it has been found that  large  classes of physically important equations support coherent   structures. Such coherent structures include the so called  solitons,  dromions, peakons, and compactons. Most of these  studies have  concentrated on initial value problems. However,  many physical  situations, including problems arising in  ionosphere and in optical  switches, are modeled by  initial-boundary value problems. The  proposed investigation of  these problems will have important  physical implications such as  the understanding of the interaction of  a light beam with an  interface separating two media with different  dielectrics.",
