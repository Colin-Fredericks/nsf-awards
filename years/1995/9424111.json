 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424211  Leonard  This is an award to support research on  the potential use of remote fiber  spectroscopy in a system to detect the  presence and nature of organic  contaminants in water.  This research is  based on prior work that led to  development of a novel optrode that  utilized a fluorescent indicator to  detect and monitor pure polar organic  substances in water solution.  The  research to be conducted involves a  technique in which light of an  appropriate wave length is launched  through an optical fiber to a remote  sample.  The return signal from the  sample is changed by the sample's  chemical properties to reveal either the  exact nature of the chemical or the  chemical group to which it belongs.    Detection of the presence and  concentrations of organic substances  that leak into aquifers is an important  step in remediation of soils and  aquifers contaminated by hazardous  substances.  Results of this research  are expected to be an important link in  overall remote sensing research partly  because  it will focus on practical  aspects such as ruggedness, optrode  lifetime and low concentration studies.  Future instrumentation based on this  consist has the potential of greatly  reducing safety hazards, person hours  and produce real-time chemical data on  environmental quality of contaminated  environmental resources.  ***",
