SGER:  A Domain-Model Approach to Reconstruction of 3D Environments  for Virtual Reality    This award is in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode.   Reconstruction of 3D environments from sensed data is a computer  vision problem with important application to the area of virtual  reality and other visual information systems. The relatively new  research area of virtual reality requires 3D models of entire  environments,  and  presents several significant new challenges for  computer vision, including the ability to deal with multiple moving  objects in the scene, integration of information about color and  textures, and the need for close attention to domain constraints,  to improve the reconstruction of a 3-D model of the environment.   The new approach in this research is to use  domain knowledge to  simplify and improve the 3D environment-acquisition process. This  approach is knowledge-driven and attempts to understand  the  physical structure of the environment and of the individual objects  in the environment.  This award supports preliminary research to  explore the feasibility of development of physical domain models  that define the physical constraints of a particular domain. Such  models might include information about possible 3D surface classes,  possible materials, surface relationships, common 3D primitive  solids, functional relationships among the 3D primitives, and fixed  or constrained lighting.",
