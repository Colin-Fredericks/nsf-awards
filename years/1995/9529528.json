Research on material handling can directly effect manufacturing costs and impact productivity.    This planning grant is studying the potential for getting sufficient industrial support to start a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling Products and Process Engineering at Oregon State University and the University of Cincinnati.    The potential research agenda envisioned for the proposed Center will address:  Conformed Clamp Development, Lift Truck Dynamics, Design Process Assessment and Development, Lateral Clamp Development, Selection of a New Material Handling System for Service and Repair Operations, Planning and Design of Sortation Conveyor System for Warehousing and Distribution, Integrating Ergonomics Issues in Material Handling Equipment Design and Selection, and Designing Vision Guided Vehicles.    The researchers are recognized experts in these areas and can manage the activities of this planning award.",
