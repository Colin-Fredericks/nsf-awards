 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-E.C. cooperative research on the analysis and implementation  of concurrent constraint programming.  The project involves cooperation between Gopal Gupta of New  Mexico State University and Moreno Falaschi of the University of Padua, Italy; Giorgio Levi of the  University of Pisa, Italy; Manuel Hermenegildo of the Polytechnic of Madrid, Spain; and Paul Soper and  Andrew King of Southampton University in the United Kingdom.  Their research will analyze and  implement logic programming systems and current constraint programming systems on multiprocessor  hardware.  The U.S. investigator brings to the collaboration experience in developing parallel logic  programming systems and designing implementations for concurrent constraint systems, specifically  those based on the Andorra Principle.  The European participants will contribute to the design of a  common intermediate language for implementation of concurrent constraint programming and parallel  logic programming, to the implementation of tools for parallel logic languages based on formal  analysis techniques, and to refining existing frameworks for the static analyses of concurrent  constraint logic programs.  The research results will not only advance the state-of-the-art in logic,  programming, parallel symbolic computing, and data-flow analysis, but also produce systems that can be  used.",
