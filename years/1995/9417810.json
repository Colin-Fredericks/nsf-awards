 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417810  Phillips    The end of the last glaciation was accomplished by a series of  major and abrupt climatic events.  It is clear that changes in the  atmospheric transport of water vapor played a key role in the  deglacial process.  Although these events apparently resulted in a  global secession of glacial conditions, the details of the sequence  of events is poorly known outside the North Atlantic region.  In  this project we propose to apply new geochronological and  paleohydrological methods to the interpretation of glacial and  lacustrine data in a single, closed drainage basin: the paleo-Owens  River system in the western Great Basin.  We will apply mass  spectrometric U/Th and cosmosgenic 36Cl dating to refining the  existing chronology for lacustrine deposits and shorelines in the  terminal basins.  This chronology will be compared with one derived  from cosmosgenic 36Cl and carbon-14 for glacial deposits and  surfaces in the eastern Sierra Nevada, at the headwaters of the  Owens River.  These new and refined chronologies will allow the  sequence of events for the glacial and lacustrine systems to be  compared with each other. The combined sequence  will then be  quantitatively interpreted in terms of climatic driving forces,  using a transient numerical energy and mass balance model.   Finally, the reconstructed climatic history can be compared with  recent ice core and marine sediment records of global conditions to  assess how the global events were reflected by changes in  temperature and water vapor transport in a continental   setting.",
