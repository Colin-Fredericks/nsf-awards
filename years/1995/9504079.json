 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sonar is an attractive sensing modality for robotics because it is  relatively simple to implement and process, has low cost and energy  consumption, can be used in conjunction with camera vision, and for  some applications it is the only practical sensing modality. This  research investigates a form of adaptive sonar sensing, in which  the sensor changes its physical configuration during the sensing  process in reaction to the observed echoes.  This approach,  analogous to some approaches to active computer vision,  is  motivated by biological systems that turn their ears toward the  direction of the sound source and move to observe an object from  different directions. As part of this research, signal processing  algorithms are investigated to develop a sensing system that can  identify objects by their acoustic signatures. The current model of  echo production is extended to predict the echoes observed by the  sonar system. The sonar allows the robot to navigate around an  unstructured environment precisely and to construct accurate sonar  maps by using environmental objects as naturally-occurring beacons.   This approach should support more autonomous and flexible operation  of both mobile robots and robot arms, thus improving their  functionality in manufacturing applications.",
