The  experiments  are  carried out at temperature substantially  below  1K.  Several  areas research are represented. One  addresses  the  magnetic  properties of superfluid 3He. The  experiments  are  of  interest  because  they  will provide important  test  of  extant  theories,   and  address  fundamental  issues  related   to   low  temperature  magnetic  measurement methods.  The  second  is  the  magnetism  of thin films of 3He. The thin film magnetism  differs  in  interesting ways from bulk magnetic properties  of  3He.  The  third  area is the transport properties of thin metal  films  and  the  development  of  instrumentation  based  on  superconducting  quantum  interference devices (SQUIDS). This  includes  important  research  in  a  new  area  of mesoscopic  physics.  The  various  research  projects  are of a fundamental  nature,  but  may  have  technical  relevance  in  the context of advanced  materials  and  devices   operating  at  cryogenic  temperatures.  For   example,  ultrasensitive  SQUID  devices have  been  employed  in  clinical  studies  of the weak magnetic fields originating from brain  wave  activity.  %%%  This project is a study of materials at ultralow temperatures and  the   development   of  ultralow  temperature   techniques.
