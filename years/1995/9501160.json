The first area of  study  is  the superconductor-insulator (S-I) transition in granular aluminum  films  by  the application of a parallel magnetic field to  drive  the  transition. This technique, which avoids complications associated with  flux flow resistance, has proven to be very useful in determining  the  relative  roles of disorder, Josephson coupling, and Coulomb  blockade  in the generic characteristics of granular film S-I transitions. These  studies  are  ultimately aimed at developing a superconducting  field-  effect  transistor in a granular system. In addition, studies  of  the  effects  of  disorder  and  electron-electron  interactions   in   the  transport  properties  of electrons sprayed onto  solid  hydrogen  are  being  made. This is a model system from which one can obtain valuable  insights into the transport properties of more conventional disordered  semiconducting systems.  %%%  Experiments  are  proposed to study the electrical properties  of  two  very different disordered two-dimensional types of material. The first  area of study concerns the  mechanisms involved in the destruction  of  superconductivity in very thin aluminum films. This work will  attempt  to  determine  the relative roles of disorder, superconductivity,  and  single   electron   charging  effects  in   the   generic   electrical  characteristics  of granular aluminum films at low  temperatures.  The  ultimate   goal   of   these  studies  is  the   development   of    a  superconducting field-effect transistor using granular  materials.  In  addition,  studies  of  the effects of disorder and  electron-electron  interactions in the electric transport properties of electrons sprayed  onto  solid hydrogen are being made. This material serves as  a  model  from  which  one  can  obtain  valuable insights  into  the  transport  properties  of  more  conventional semic onducting materials,  such  as  those used in the microelectronics industry.  ***",
