 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418419  Covert        This project is part of the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-1),  which will be conducted in the remote Southern Pacific in 1995 using aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based  measurements of a wide variety of chemical species, physical  and meteorological parameters with the central  goal of investigating the formation, evolution, and optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. A significant  component of these objectives is the measurement of aerosol number and size distribution and cloud  condensation nuclei. This project will be a workshop held in advance of ACE-1 to intercompare the particle  counters, particle sizing devices, and cloud condensation nuclei counters which will be used on the various  ACE-1 platforms.  The goal of the workshop is to  determine and minimize the variance in the concentration  and size measurements between the different instruments such that differences measured in the field can be  interpreted with confidence as real and due to differences in aerosol physics and chemistry rather than variability  between instruments.         An aerosol generation facility will be constructed to produce monodisperse and polydisperse aerosols of  stable known size, concentration and chemical composition. This controlled aerosol is intended to simulate the  atmosphere that will be encountered during ACE-1. The participants in ACE-1 aerosol physics measurements  will be able to sample these aerosols in parallel and compare their results. The causes of differences will be  sought and minimized in the course of the intercomparison.",
