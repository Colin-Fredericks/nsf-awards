 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554586  Root    The Nation has a pressing need for  chemical engineers who are  conscious of environmental  prerogatives and are able to  discover innovative new processes  that will satisfy chemical demands  and meet environmental and economic  criteria. We are requesting  Graduate Research Traineeships in  Catalysis for Environmentally  Conscious Manufacturing. The  trainees will gain expertise in  developing new catalytic  technologies that can b used for  production of desired chemical  products or intermediates with  little or no generation of  undesired waste or byproducts. The  Department of Chemical Engineering  has substantial expertise in  catalyst design, process design,  and analysis. The focus on  environmental consequences of  upstream processing decisions will  train students to optimize the  entire chemical process through use  of appropriate catalytic  technologies, and permit  development of alternative chemical  synthesis pathways that are  environmentally benign. The  chemical industry is one of the  largest contributors to  international trade, and chemical  engineers trained in environmental  consequences will be critical in  maintaining competitiveness. Our  training program will produce  engineers who will receive not only  the excellent academic training for  which Wisconsin chemical engineers  are know, but also a research and  educational experience that will  develop awareness of and ingrained  concern for the environmental  implications of their professional  activities.",
