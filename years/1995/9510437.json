The meeting is scheduled to bring Turkish, US, Japanese, and European scientists and engineers to share research results and identify areas for future research, and for joint work in the area of mechatronics.   Topics to be covered will include: development of mechatronic machines; production automation; intelligent manufacturing systems, robotics and motion control, and education and training in mechatronics.  The plans call for special sessions and tutorials to be led by Japanese experts.  The Turkish organizer is Dr.Okyay Kaynak, UNESCO Chair on echatronics at Bogazici University in Istanbul.  It is expected that a proceedings of the plenary lectures and presented papers will be published and made available before the meeting.    Scope:  This meeting is the first in its type, and is sponsored by, among others, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, the IEEE Robotics & Automation Society, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan, the Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Robotics Society of Japan, and the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan.   The participation of US scientists is important to the success of this meeting.  It is expected that they will benefit from the interaction with the strong Japanese delegation as well as the European participation.  The Turkish organizer hopes to have this meeting held bi-annually, rotating the host country between Europe, the USA, and Japan.  The increasing emphasis in Turkey on this scientific topic, as evidenced by the establishment of the UNESCO chair at Bogacici University, will benefit from having the meeting held at that university.  ***",
