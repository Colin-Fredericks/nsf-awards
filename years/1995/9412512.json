 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kenny B. Lipkowitz at Indiana University-Purdue University in   Indianapolis is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies related to the binding   of optical isomers to polymers with a particular chiral orientation.The   different binding of the isomers to the polymers is described as   enantioselective binding of analytes to chiral stationary phases, CSP's,   of the polymers. The systems which will be studied are relevant to   chromatography. In addition to the theoretical work, the project will   also carry out complementary experimental studies. In particular, atomic   force microscopy, AFM, measurements will be made on the chiral surfaces   of polymer crystals; the AFM tips will be fabricated using materials   close to those involved in actual chromatographic processes. A principle   objective of the work in this project is to obtain understandings of the   elementary chemical interactions of the analytes with the chiral   polymers. The theoretical treatments to be made will be based on Monte   Carlo, MC, and Molecular Dynamics, MD, methods. Several force fields will   be used to insure that the MC and MD simulations are reliable and are not   artifacts. The results of the calculations will be compared with   experimental separability factors found with chromatographic   measurements.  Chromatography is a standard chemical technique for the analysis of the   composition of mixtures; it is also used to separate mixtures into their   individual components. The use of chiral polymers for enantioselective   separations of such mixtures is an important current topic in organic   chemistry. This project addresses the theoretical underpinnings of the   mechanisms responsible for enantioselective binding. The project has the   potential of providing the foundations needed in order to develop more   efficient chromatographic analyses.",
