 "awd_abstract_narration": "With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the MIT Economics Department Computer Cluster will upgrade its computing facility. As a result of an explosion in the role of computation in economic research, the Department has reached the limits of existing hardware. To alleviate this situation, it will undertake a three part program to upgrade its current instrumentation. This includes: the purchase of a substantially upgraded departmental workstation and fileserver; the upgrading of PC facilities and increased connectivity of PCs in graduate student offices; purchase of an IBM RS/6000 workstation, a dedicated file server, and 10 gigabytes of additional disc space.   Three groups of faculty members and their affiliated graduate students will be the primary beneficiaries of this upgrade. Many of these researchers are working on data-intensive empirical micro- and macro-economics questions; others employ simulation methods to solve problems in economic theory while a third group is engaged in developing new econometric tools. The expanded facilities will also benefit numbers of both graduate and undergraduate students and serve to further teaching as well as research.",
