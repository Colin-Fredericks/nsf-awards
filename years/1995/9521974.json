 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jochim    Under the direction of Dr. Michael Jochim, Mr. Douglass Kennett  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct  archaeological research in a 17 kilometer square area of Santa  Rosa Island located in the Santa Barbara Channel region of  California. Work to date indicates a long settlement history  which covers a period of almost 10,000 years. Mr. Kennett will  survey this region and sample all environmental zones from the  coast to the piedmont areas. Once sites have been identified, a  selected sample will be excavated. Analysis of faunal and  artifact assemblages will provide data regarding site function  within the island's larger settlement system and also provide  insight into subsistence and technological change through time.  Stable oxygen and carbon isotopic analysis of marine shell from  midden deposits will be used to reconstruct changes in the marine  environment and the season of shellfish harvesting. These data  will be used in combination with other archaeological indicators  of seasonality and mobility to reconstruct patterns of human  settlement and their change over time.    Because they are so clearly circumscribed, and because of their  culture history, the Channel Islands provide an excellent  controlled situation to study the emergence of complex society.  Over their prehistory, one can trace changes from small  egalitarian social groups to larger more sedentary aggregations  characterized by specialized craft manufacture and emerging  hierarchical organization. This same pattern has been observed in  many parts of the world and archaeologists wish to understand the  underlying processes responsible. Mr. Kennett has proposed a  number of alternative models and wishes to collect data to test  them. He postulates that climatic change may be involved and one  strength of this project rests on the fact that chemical analysis  of faunal data will permit detailed environmental reconstruction.    This research is important for several reasons. It will sh ed new  light on the development of complex sedentary societies. It will  provide insight into the prehistory of the United States and  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
