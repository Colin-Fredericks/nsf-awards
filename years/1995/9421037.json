 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421037  Trenary      The metal borides are intriguing materials that are  extremely hard, chemically inert, and have very high melting  points. Many of these solids have unique properties making  them useful in various applications. For example, lanthanum  boride and cerium boride are widely used as electrmn  emitting cathodes in a variety of electron optical devices  and are far superior to tungsten and other refractory metals  for this purpose. High-quality single crystals of yttrium  boride are being developed for use as monochromators of 1-2  keV synchrotron radiation. Because of the importance of  surface structure and surface properties in thermionic  emission, the rare-earth hexaborides have been the subject  of many fundamental surface science studies. Yet many of the  most important properties have not been investigated. One of  the most important questions in the use of hexaborides as  cathodes concerns their interaction with the background  gases present in all vacuum chambers. In this work,  reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy will be used to  characterize the adsorption and decomposition of simple  background gases on the lanthanum boride and cerium boride  surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy also will be used  for structural studies of the number of technologically  important metal boride surfaces.  %%%    Little is known about the surface chemistry of boron-rich  solids.  These solids constitute a wide and varied class of  materials.  They are of high interest to the electronics  industry as cathodes for electron beam lithography, and  electron emitting cathode in a variety of electron devices.  Furthermore, transition metal diborides as thin films in  metal surfaces are important application areas requiring  ultra-hard coatings.    ***",
