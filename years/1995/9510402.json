 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of  materials chemistry and in the subfield of nanostructures.  During  the tenure of this eighteen-month standard grant, Professor Liu and  her students at Wayne State University will conduct preliminary  experiments designed to establish the feasibility of a research  program in the fabrication and characterization of nanoscale  materials.  Their strategic approach involves the preparation of a  variety of nanoparticle structures and patterns including dots,  line, and two-dimensional islands with various shapes, followed by  the characterization of these structures using force microscopy,  particularly scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force  microscopy (AFM).  Nanostructure synthesis will be based on both  traditional self-assembly and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques to  prepare templates as well as the direct electrosynthesis of  nanostructures using the probe tips of the force microscopes.   The ability to prepare nanometer-sized materials and to control the  size and structures of these particles is of immense fundamental  and technological importance.  This Research Planning Grant project  will lead to a research program in the fabrication and  characterization of nanoscale materials with `size tunable`  properties of importance to quantum physics and chemistry, new sub-  micron electronic devices, and novel optoelectronic materials.",
