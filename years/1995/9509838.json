 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509838  Olvera de la Cruz    This project studies phase segregation in ternary polymer  blends.  Ternary mixtures can decompose into two or three  phases.  The investigator is studying the kinetics of the  separation process when the mixture is unstable against the  formation of two phases and stable, metastable, and/or  unstable to the formation of a third phase.  The work  extends preliminary work on symmetric ternary blends in two  dimensions into non-symmetric blends in three dimensions.  She will also investigate equilibrium interfacial profiles  between two phases in ternary systems.  %%%  Much of the current theoretical effort in understanding  polymer mixtures involves the process in which molecules  that were first completely mixed form structures in which  like polymers stay close together.  This happens, for  example, in reaction to a drop in temperature.  The precise  scales and shapes of the sometimes wormlike structure of  these separate phases, called the microstructure, is  responsible for many of the properties of these materials.  Practitioners seek the understanding of how to get the  particular microstructure that they believe will give the  desired properties.  This research fits into this field by  being the first to go beyond previous studies on binary  (twocomponent) blends to three-component (ternary) blends.  Practical systems are almost always composed of more than  two components, so this work is particularly relevant to  real materials.  ***",
