 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of analytical and surface chemistry  and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  During the tenure of  this three-year continuing grant, Professor Brodbelt and her  students at the University of Texas at Austin will carry out a  systematic comparative examination of ion complexes formed by  collisionally induced dissociation (CID) and cationization by  chemical ionization (CI) with their analogues formed directly by  electrospray ionization (ESI).  These studies are designed to  identify the chemical processes that impact ion formation and to  provide insights into the molecular interactions that give rise  to the significant differences in ion fragmentation patterns  observed between ESI and softer ionization processes such as CID  and CI.  Additionally, the relative cation-substrate binding  strengths will be correlated with substrate structural  characteristics, including the presence of specific functional  groups and steric features.  In addition to providing new  fundamental insights into ion formation processes, this research  is expected to lead to improvements in the analytical utility of  ESI-based mass spectrometry.    Electrospray ionization is the most rapidly growing ionization  technique in analytical mass spectrometry.  It is a robust  ionization technique and the requisite equipment is simple and  relatively inexpensive.  However, ion fragmentation patterns  obtained with ESI, a \"harsh\" ionization method, differ  significantly from those observed with \"softer\" ionization  methods such as CID and CI.  This research is aimed at  understanding the chemical processes attendant to the ion  formation event and thereby extend the scope and sensitivity of  ESI-based mass spectrometry as an analytical tool.",
