In  particular, the investigation focuses on (i) Beta process models for the  cumulative hazard function and some attendant Markov chain models, (ii) hazard  rate models using the Extended Gamma process, (iii) Cox's proportional hazards  regression model with priors on hazard rates and cumulative hazards, (iv) the  problem of variable selection in Cox regression, and (v) unimodal distribution  models. In all cases, emphasis is placed on priors for which implementable  computational algorithms can be developed.        With the recent developments in hardware and software, high-speed computer  simulation technology has made it feasible to surmount the computational   problems in Bayesian statistical methods which have been advocated on   foundational grounds by many leading theoreticians for decades. The research  in this project concentrates on furthering such methods in the area of survival  analysis. Originating with applications to product reliability in industry and  to patient survival after intervention in medicine, statistical analyses of   survival data have proved valuable in evaluating new materials, new  manufacturing methods and new medical procedures. The investigator studies and  implements refined techniques for the analysis of data arising in such fields  of application.",
