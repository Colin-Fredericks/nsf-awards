 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative  research in cell biology between Howard J. Worman of  Columbia University and Jean-Claude Courvalin of the  Institut Jacques Monod, University of Paris VI.  The  objective of their research is to study the mechanism of  nuclear envelope or membrane reassembly that takes place at  the end of cell division. They will focus on two nuclear-  specific membrane proteins that have been identified in  nuclear envelope reassembly.  The  U.S. investigator brings  to this collaboration expertise in molecular biology.  The  engineering of the cDNA clones for the expression of the  protein will be performed in his laboratory.  This is  complemented by the French investigator's expertise in cell  biology. Most of the biochemical and morphological  experiments on the nuclear envelope reassembly will be  carried out in his laboratory.  This joint effort will  advance fundamental understanding of the cell nucleus and  the role of these proteins in nuclear envelope reassembly.",
