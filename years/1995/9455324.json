 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455324  Karplus  This proposal is to introduce interactive tutorials using 3-  dimensional computer graphics to visualize macromolecular structure  and function into introductory biochemistry. Specific goals of this  proposal include the development of 14 computer graphics tutorials  to be used in the introductory auto tutorial biochemistry course,  the publishing of these tutorials, and the holding of workshops for  training teaching faculty at other universities to use these  tutorials. One difficulty associated with developing such an  interactive curriculum for introductory biochemistry is the large  class size. For this reason, this auto tutorial biochemistry course  provides an excellent forum for curriculum development, because it  has already successfully adopted a highly personal and interactive  format. This computer graphics based curriculum should have a large  impact on undergraduate education, because tremendous numbers of  undergraduates take introductory Biochemistry courses each year,  and very few (if any) such courses currently have interactive,  three-dimensional, graphics content. This curriculum should be  effective both for attracting more students to continue in  biological sciences and for preparing the scientific and biomedical  community of tomorrow so that they may assimilate and effectively  apply structural information about proteins and other biological  molecules.",
