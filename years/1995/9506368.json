The \"career\" research involves the study of the dynamical effect of  the North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on the  extratropical atmosphere during both winter and summer seasons.   The atmospheric responses to persistent midlatitude SST anomalies  has been controversial in the past.  The difficulties stem partly  from the fact that the natural variability of the midlatitude  atmosphere is very large, thus there is a small signal to noise  ratio.  This problem is also clouded by the fact that general  circulation model (GCM) experiments with fixed extratropical SST  anomalies do not always produce a consistent response.  This  project will concentrate on the North Pacific SST anomalies and  their possible impact on the Pacific and North American climate.   One novel aspect of the research is that it will make use of a  series of modeling tools, including a linear steady state model, a  dry GCM and a full GCM.  The PI will also, for the first time, look  int the effect the North Pacific SST anomalies for the summer  season.  The results of this research are expected to improve the  seasonal forecasting for the Pacific and North American region.  In  particular, the results from the summer season will help the long  range prediction of the mid-west drought and flood potentials.    The education plan consists of innovative undergraduate teaching  and developing a graduate course that is currently not available in  the PI's department.  One novel aspect in the undergraduate  teaching plan will be to introduce students from various  disciplines to the current weather information through the computer  network at the University of Illinois and to  help students  interpret the data.  The main objective of the new graduate course  is to introduce the graduate students to the most up-to date  research topics in an area that is rapidly evolving, namely the  coupled ocean-atmosphere processes.  The topics include the coupled  air-sea interaction in the tropical Pacific, i.e, the El  Nino/Southern Oscillation phenomenon, the air-sea coupling in the  midlatitude, and the air-sea coupling for the tropical 30-60 day  oscillations.",
