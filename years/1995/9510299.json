 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510299 Guo  This research project will explore the synthesis and processing of selected solid solution compositions in the ferroelectric tungsten bronze materials family that contain morphotropic phase boundary regions.  Single crystals in fiber form of small dimensions (< mm in diameter) will be grown using the laser heated pedestal growth technique.  Material characterizations will be carried out that include measurements of structural, chemical, thermal, ferroelectric (dielectric and pyroelectric), and electrooptic properties. The primary goal is to assess the characteristics of such phase boundaries and to gain fundamental understanding of property-structure-composition relations. Various morphotropic phase boundary systems are potentially available in this materials family, and provide possibilities for new materials with enhanced and switchable properties. The project expects to provide guidelines for the selection, synthesis, and modification of the morphotropic phase boundaries of ferroelectric tungsten bronze materials with desired and controllable properties for ferroelectric and electrooptic device applications. %%%  Systematic studies will be conducted to obtain an overall grasp of the characteristics of morphotropic phase boundary systems in oxide ferroelectric tungsten bronzes, and a fundamental understanding of the interrelation among physical and chemical properties, the macro- and micro-structure, and the chemical composition.  An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials and processing research, and to improve diversity in science through the support of women.  This research will contribute to improving the general performance of advanced optical devices used in information storage and processing.  ***",
