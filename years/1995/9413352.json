The project's main objective is to demonstrate the technical performance of the  air-sparged hydrocyclone (ASH) flotation technology for the recovery and separation of  suspended fine particles and dispersed oil droplets from industrial waste water streams  along the U.S.-Mexico border region.  The research will involve surveying and sampling  various industrial waste water streams that contribute to the contamination of the border  region, characterization of the samples, comparative flotation tests, and pilot station  studies for ASH optimization.    The discharge of untreated industrial waste water into transboundary waters has contributed  to ecological and esthetic degradation, economic losses, and threats to human health along  the U.S.-Mexico border for many years.  Untreated industrial waste water can seriously  degrade the ability of conventional treatment facilities to treat sewage effectively.  The  ASH flotation technology, developed by the University of Utah during the past decade,  combines the advantages from both conventional hydrocyclone and froth flotation  technologies into a single piece of equipment.  If successful, the project will provide the  opportunity to significantly reduce pollution from industrial waste water streams in the  U.S.-Mexico border area, and provide, therefore, significant environmental and health  benefits to both countries.  ***",
