 "awd_abstract_narration": "In countries of Central and Eastern Europe, privatization of  state owned enterprises is the central element of transition to a  market economy.  The objective of this research is to investigate  the relationship between speed of privatization and changes in  output, with particular emphasis on the role of unemployment and  fiscal policy.  The issue can be stated as: how should government  choose the downsizing of the state sector and the path of  taxation to achieve a desirable resource allocation in the  transition economy.    The theoretical part of the research consists of developing a  consistent macroeconomic framework for a transition economy with  a job matching process in order to analyze the effects and  welfare implications of alternative privatization and taxation  schemes.  The model is a general equilibrium model, i.e. it  captures the interaction of all variables in the model.  By  incorporating the job matching process, the model takes into  account the regional and skill mismatch between unemployed  workers and available vacancies that currently exists across  countries of Eastern Europe and, thus, provides a suitable  framework for studying the optimal speed of privatization.  The  empirical part involves  collecting data on output, employment,  unemployment, fiscal expenditures, and taxes for each country and  then estimating the general equilibrium model.  ***",
