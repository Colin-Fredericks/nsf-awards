 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423426  Osterkamp  This award supports a study of discontinuous permafrost in  northern Alaska.  Permafrost exists in arctic and subarctic  regions where changes in climate are most likely to be largest  and to occur first. Warm discontinuous permafrost will be the  first to thaw in the event of any climatic warming. Climatic data  indicate that Alaska is currently warming at a rate of about  2.4 C per century.  Data has been obtained which shows that the  discontinuous permafrost south of the Yukon river in Alaska has  recently warmed by as much as 1.5 C and that some of it is  already thawing. The objective of this research is to develop a  better understanding of the response of discontinuous permafrost  to changes in climate and human activities.  The significance of  permafrost in the context of climatic change studies is that  permafrost can detect and record climatic changes in its thermal  regime. In thawing, it can act as an agent of environmental  changes that influences ecological and human communities and it  can amplify climatic change by feedback effects associated with  the release of carbon stored in the permafrost.    This research includes analyses and interpretations of an  extensive long-term (18 years) data set obtained at more than a  dozen sites representing a wide range of environmental conditions  that span the discontinuous permafrost zone along a north-south  transect of Alaska, measurements of current conditions, and  assessing changes that have occurred and those that are still  occurring. Six sites will be instrumented to measure temperatures  in the air, active layer, and permafrost, moisture contents  (including unfrozen water), thermal parameters, snow cover and  active layer characteristics, and heave. Less detailed  measurements will be made at eight other sites. This research  will also include an investigation of temporal and spatial trends  in the data, the flow of heat and moisture (including several  existing hypotheses), and the application of an analyti cal model  and of two existing numerical models for predicting the thermal  regime and talik development in warm and thawing permafrost. A  sensitivity analysis will be carried out on the effects of  changes in climatic variables and active layer characteristics on  the thermal regime of the discontinuous permafrost.",
