 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve theoretical research on various  aspects of quantum field theory and its relationship to  gravitational theory and cosmology.  The research will  especially focus upon issues relating to quantum  fluctuations, either in gravitational systems or in other  contexts (such as boundary effects) which are analogous to  gravity.  One line of investigation will study the vacuum  fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in flat spacetime.  New physical effects which may be testable by experiment  will be sought.  A closely related line of investigation  will study the effects of fluctuations of the gravitational  field itself.    When quantum matter fields act as the source of the  gravitational field, there will often be large fluctuations  in the energy density and pressure of the source which will  translate into large fluctuations in the gravitational  field.  The effects of these fluctuations will be  investigated.  There are also fluctuations due to the  quantum nature of the gravitational field itself.  These  will be studied in the context of a model where a background  bath of gravitons causes the lightcone to be slightly  smeared out.  This smearing may produce effects upon other  quantum fields which will lead to insights about the quantum  nature of gravity and possibly even observable effects.  In  the latter case, one would also gain important information  about the origin and evolution of the universe through the  background of relic gravitons.",
