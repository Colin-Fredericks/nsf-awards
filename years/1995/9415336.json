Recent studies suggest that the  observed ozone changes in the stratosphere and troposphere can  substantially perturb the radiative forcing with important climate  implications.  However, large uncertainties exist, mainly related  to radiative transfer schemes and vertical distributions of ozone  and temperature.  In addition, ozone is a secondary constituent  formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving several  precursors (NOx, hydrocarbons and CO).  The concentrations of these  precursors depend on the oxidation process in the atmosphere, which  varies strongly with time and space (and thus the climate state)  and depends, in addition to the precursors, on the hydrogen  radicals like OH and HO2.  There fore, it is necessary to have a  self-consistent chemistry-radiative-dynamical model to stimulate  the observed ozone changes and account for the feedbacks in  computing the radiative forcing.    Concerns have also been raised in recent years about the climatic  efffect due to increasing tropospheric sulfate aerosols of  anthropogenic origin.  The aerosols are expected to cool the  surface by directly backscattering the solar radiation and directly  enhancing the cloud albedo due to increased aerosol cloud  condensation nuclei.  However, large uncertainties exist in the  calculated radiative forcing, in particular the enhancement of the  cloud albedo, and its climatic effect.    This project will continue modeling and observational studies of  \"global climate and atmospheric trace constituents\" with focus on  atmospheric ozone and sulfate aerosols.  The PI will use an  improved radiation model to address several issues related to the  radiative forcing calculations associated with observed ozone  changes.  His ma in effort is to use the NCAR/GENESIS (General  ENvironmental and Ecological Simulation of Interactive Systems)  global model to study the direct climatic effects due to observed  ozone changes and increased sulfate aerosols.  For the indirect  climatic effects, two exploratory tasks are initiated: the  development of a coupled climate-chemistry model through continued  collaboration with Prof. Ivar Isaksen at the University Oslo; and  the study of increased cloud albedo associated with enhanced number  density of sulfate aerosols and its parameterization for use in  GENESIS through collaboration with Dr. Joyce Penner at the Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory.    This research is important because it addresses questions of  primary importance to global change research.",
