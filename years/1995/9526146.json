 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526146  Overbye         The ability to transfer power on a transmission system is  dependent upon a number of factors, with arguably the most  constraining being the requirement to maintain system integrity  following the occurrence of any of a plausible set of  contingencies.  That is, if a particular contingency should  occur, there must be a viable plan to return the system to a  secure operating point.  Having such a plan permits basecase  operation at higher levels of power transfer since should the  contingency occur, one knows how to restore the system to a  secure operating point; not having these plans requires more  constrained operation.       For an unsolvable contingent case, if effective control  action is not taken quickly enough following the contingency that  pushed the system into the unsolvable state, the system will  experience a dynamic voltage collapse.  Research in this area  will investigate the dynamic consequences of unsolvability, with  the aim of developing computationally tractable methods for  determining an optimal set of controls to restore such a case to  secure operation.  ***",
