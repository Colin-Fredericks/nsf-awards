 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400224  Cochran       Dr. Cochran will study invariants which characterize links  and graphs in n-dimensional space, particularly in 3-dimensional  space.  More broadly, he will study the classification of  3-dimensional manifolds with large fundamental group, modulo  homology cobordism, and the related problems of topological  surgery on 4-dimensional manifolds and the classification of  4-dimensional manifolds.       Dr. Cochran will study properties of shape associated to  configurations of circles and to graphs in three-dimensional  space (knot theory).  These studies of properties of shape are  important in many ways.  For example, one primary strategy for  the development of new anti-viral drugs is as follows.  First,  understand the topology or shape of the virus.  Second, find a  protein with a \"complementary\" topology or shape which can thus  be used to \"plug up\" the active sites on the virus.   Unfortunately, the vast numbers of possible proteins assume  largely unknown and complex, twisted and knotted shapes in  3-dimensional space.  Therefore studies of properties of shape  are needed to assist this endeavour.  Dr. Cochran will be in  contact with scientists from the Keck Institute for Computational  Biology at Rice University.  ***",
