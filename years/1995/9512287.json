 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9512287    A state-of-the-art integrated up-grade package consisting of:  1) a 5 channel electron detector system, 2) a high-speed, digital data acquisition and control system, and 3) a powerful SUN workstation for data processing, and a variable flux, variable ion energy ion gun and controller for a Kratos XSAM-800 SEM, XPS, Auger system will be acquired.    The package will be supplied by Kratos Analytical Ramsey, NJ and the ion gun by RBD Enterprises, Eden Prairie, MN.  The system will be the anchor instrument of the University's Surface Science Facility jointly operated by the College of Science and Engineering and will be available to all academic researchers requiring analytical surface chemistry.    The proposed system upgrade will immediately impact  research performed by 10 faculty users. The requirements include all or some of the following capabilities to be offered by the proposed new systems; 1) high energy resolution, 2) high spatial resolution, 3) high chemical sensitivity fast jet precise depth profiling an 4) rapid and  reliable analysis.  Whether it be the chemical characterization of; 1) catalysts, 2) interface reactions between biological and non-biological materials, 3) artificial quantum solids, 4) lubricated rubbing interfaces, 5) semiconductor multilayered heterostructures, 6) reaction synthesized ceramics materials, 7) fracture surfaces, or 8) ohmic contacts on wide handgap semiconductors, the users agree that the proposed equipment acquisition is essential for the continuance of the research and teaching effort in Surface Science at the University of Notre Dame.    The number of trained users will quickly grow due to the expanded set of capabilities that would result from the upgrade.  It is expected that the presence of this versatile, user- friendly, quality system will continue to spawn new research projects and new users.  ***",
