Fanney                                   DUE 9550934  Virginia Wesleyan College                          FY1995 $ 28,083  Norfolk, VA  23502                                 ILI - Instrumentation                                                      Project:                                                      Mathematics    Title: Computer-Assisted Interactive Calculus at Virginia           Wesleyan College           The Virginia Wesleyan College Department of Mathematics and  Computer Science is presently incorporating some of the many  innovative ideas stemming from the calculus reform movement into  its own curriculum, and is shifting from more traditional teaching  methods to those involving more experimentation and discovery in  the classroom.  The Department, which consists of six full-time  teaching faculty and several adjuncts, serves a sizable fraction of  the general student body through small sections of its introductory  courses, as well as a modest but talented group of majors in  mathematics and computer science.  In recent years the department  has kept abreast of reform efforts advocating experiences that make  mathematics more relevant and interesting to the students, and has  begun to adopt these ideas in its classrooms, in part through the  use of graphing calculators and computer software.  It is now  preparing to take another step by offering, at the precalculus and  calculus level, laboratory courses styled after those in the  natural sciences.  The department is asking for aid in funding the  creation of a laboratory classroom to be used for hands-on,  computer-enhanced instruction of mathematics, physics, and computer  science courses.  This room would be equipped with a network of 13  Pentium microcomputer workstations, a central file server, a color  projector, and MAPLE and MATHCAD, the principle software  instructional tools.  The room would initially serve as the meeting  place for all calculus sections and selected precalculus sections.   The facility wou ld also be available to instructors of other math  and scienae courses and would ultimately be used in teaching most  upper-level mathematics courses as well.         VWC also has tutoring and mentoring outreach programs with  area K-12 schools that could benefit from the availability of such  a computer classroom.  The college's enrichment programs for these  at-risk students would be significantly enhanced in such a  technologically-advanced teaching environment.  Members of the  math/cs department have also expressed interest in future summer  math workshops that introduce contemporary teaching technologies to  area public school teachers.",
