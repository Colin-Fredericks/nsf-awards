 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523959  Nemat-Nasser  Major earthquakes can cause lateral and vertical motion of the  surface soil layers, which may result in large permanent dis  placements. A consequence is damaged underground pipelines and  surface facilities such as roads, bridges, and buildings. In  coastal regions, saturated soils may liquefy during an  earthquake, resulting in damage to man-made facilities.    The necessary scientific tools for assisting soil engineers and  geophysicists concerned with liquefaction and the resulting soil  failure are physically-based computational models with predictive  capability. The aim of this research program is to develop such  tools. The goal is to create science-based computational tools  with predictive capability in order to address the liquefaction  and soil failure phenomena.    The following tasks are addressed:    1. Examine by direct observation the history of the deformation  of  lines and layers of lead-doped granules embedded in a soil  sample, and relate this to the overall response. A special cell  with X-ray attachment provides a tool to study the kinematics of  deformation inside the sample. It provides the capability to  obtain insight into the deformation of a saturated particulate  medium during its liquefaction. It also permits the study of the  inception and growth of shearbands. Preliminary observations  suggest that even in a liquefied sample, shearbands can be  induced, as the deformation becomes large, during each cycle. The  development of such shearbands is examined as they develop, and  how they change as the deformation cycle is reversed.  Both  drained and undrained samples are investigated.    2. Directly observe and quantify the microstructure in shearband  zones. The special cell is used to create controlled shearbanding  in both drained and undrained saturated samples. The sample is  then impregnated with polyester resin, and solidified. In this  manner, the microstructure of the shearbands within the sample  can be captured. The sand mass is so lidified in situ, once a  desired state is reached. Thin sections are cut from this  solidified sample for microscopic analysis. During shear  localization, the particles in the region which eventually forms  the localized band may undergo large rotations, whereas particles  adjacent to the eventual shearing zone may still retain their  orientation and relative position that existed prior to the  localization. By studying the microstructure of a zone adjacent  to the localized region and comparing the deformation with that  within the zone, a complete picture of the transition from a  homogeneous to a highly localized heterogeneous deformation state  can be documented, Pictures are taken of the shear zones and  their neighborhoods for complete statistical and deterministic  analysis. These results are used to guide the theoretical  modeling of the deformation prior to shearband inception, during  shearband formation, and within the shearband, once it has fully  developed.  ***",
