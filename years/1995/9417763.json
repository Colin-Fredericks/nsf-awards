Internal isotope  interfaces in superlattices of 70Ge 74Ge with approximately  200 nanometer thick individual layers will be investigated  by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy.  Materials with more  complicated diffusion processes will be studied in the  second phase.  Group II-VI direct bandgap zinc based  compounds and gallium nitride, blue light emitters, will be  doped with mono-isotope dopants.  They will be investigated  using local vibrational mode spectroscopy.  The  simplification in impurity spectra caused by isotope control  promises a new level of understanding of the local impurity  structure.  The results may lead to improved modeling of  devices with ever decreasing dimensions and increasing  complexity.  %%%  The end of the cold war has opened up the possibility of  obtaining large quantities of isotopically highly enriched  semiconductor materials from Russia and the Ukraine.  These  isotopically pure materials will be used to study atomic  diffusion in a completely new way.  Multilayers of different  isotopes of the same elements (e.g. germanium 70 and 74)  will be formed by thin film crystal growth.  Interdiffusion  at the interface will be investigated using Secondary Ion  Mass Spectroscopy.  After studying chemically pure isotope  structures, doped systems and mutlilayers of some new  semiconductors used in optoelectronics applications will be  studied.  The vibrational; spectra of a range of low mass  impurities in isotopically pure semiconductors will also be  investigated.  The results will lead to improved modeling of  electronic devices with every decreasing dimensions and  increasing complexity.  ***",
