 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an integrated approach to design of VLSI circuits,  with an emphasis on developing tests for thermal and electrical  stress, and power management.  The first goal is to use stress  testing as a low-cost alternative to burn-in.  Methods to  synthesize tests for electrical and thermal stress based on  accurate measure of signal activity are being explored.  In low  power design, the following are being pursued: 1. develop Monte  Carlo based approaches estimation of signal and glitching activity  in sequential and DSP circuits; 2. find architectural and  system-level power minimization techniques; 3. investigate current  switching techniques for power management; and 4. design layout  algorithms for circuits with low power consumption.  Sample  sequential and digital signal processing circuits are being  synthesized.",
