 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to  study theoretical and practical issues in  the  evaluation of general globel predicates and functions of  distributed software.  As an application of the techniques  of the research, the project will focus on  distributed  monitoring systems for fault tolerance. An example of  detecting a  global predicate arises in implementing the most  basic command of a monitoring  system: `stop the program when  the predicate is true`. To stop the program it  is necessary  to detect the predicate q, which is not a trivial task if q  requires access to the global state.    There are three components to the  project: theory,  algorithms and implementation. There are two questions that  will be investigated in terms of theory. First, the class of  global predicates  that are efficient to detect will be  classified. This will also entail studying  the limits of  efficient detection of global predicates. Second, a  predicate  logic which is suitable for efficient detection of  global predicates will be  developed.  After developing the  logic, efficient decentralized algorithms for  detecting  occurrence of logic formulas will be designed. This work  will be  based on the use of a centralized checker process  developed by the PI.  Finally, the decentralized algorithm  will be used to design an experimental  distributed  monitoring system.",
