 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500544   Henderson   This grant provides funding to the Department of Mechanical  and Aerospace Engineering at the Arizona State University for the  purchase of graphics supercomputer equipment that will be dedicated to  the support of research in simulation of steps in Integrated  Product and Process Development (IPPD).  This graphics equipment  will replace currently  outdated research workstations that are too  slow for current research projects.  Specifically, the new  workstation will allow complex parts to be displayed and manipulated  in real time while using texture mapping and lighting models.  In  addition, the workstation will allow stereo three-dimensional  viewing at a 120 Hz refresh rate, which is required by current  stereo viewing equipment.  This equipment will enable real-time  display for concurrent engineering, simulation, and data visualization.  Computational speed is important because a metric  used in today's product development is time, in the form of reduced  time to market, instant design feedback, networked display for  electronic commerce, and real-time simulation animation.     Several important aspects of engineering design are supported  by this equipment.  These include a number of research projects  that are likely to advance the state-of-the-art of engineering  design.  Research in engineering design is important to the  maintenance of a competitive position in the design and production  of nearly all products.",
