 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at George Washington University in the purchase of an Inductively  Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).  This equipment will be used in the following  areas of research:  (1) investigation of novel high-temperature helium plasmas and new  nebulization systems used in analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis; (2) investigation  of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry for the detection of bio-  organic trace materials; (3) determination of the current quality and quantity of ground  water in the District of Columbia, and to develop plans to contain discharges of pollutants  from point and non-point sources; (4) measurement of the concentrations  and isotopic  ratios of metals in biological samples; (5) detection of metal pollutants in samples from the  aquaculture development areas in order to find the path of metals to humans through the  food fish; isotopic ratios in near-surface samples; and (6) development of validated  methodologies for analysis of forensic samples.    Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a high temperature technique which  uses the discharge generated by inducing a magnet field in a flowing conducting gas to determine  the elemental composition of a material.  The technique has remarkable selective and sensitivities  that allows analytical chemical determination of ground water pollutants landfill leachates, trace  metals, forensic material and biological material.",
