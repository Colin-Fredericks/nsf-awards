 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ithaca College is offering a five-day workshop in June 1995 to  provide 30 participants with both an overview of the calculus  reform movement and a tutorial on the use of classroom activities  and projects in the teaching of calculus.  The workshop is focusing  both on the calculus project and activity materials developed at  Ithaca College, and on approaches and materials developed at other  institutions.  The goal is to bring the ideas developed at Ithaca  College and elsewhere to a broader based set of teachers of  calculus. Instructors from two year colleges, and selected  pre-college calculus teachers, as well as teachers at four year  colleges and universities are being involved.  In this workshop  participants are being given the opportunity to work with new  materials, and to collaborate with others about ways to fit new  approaches into their own curricula.  This is helping to encourage  wider use of new ideas about the teaching of calculus.  The  workshop is technology independent, allowing a wide range of  participants to become involved in the new pedagogical approaches.   However, the workshop includes an introduction to ways that  technology can be used to enhance the teaching and learning of  calculus concepts, including the use of graphing calculators and a  variety of computer software.",
