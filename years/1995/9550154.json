 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of new generation of massively parallel computers has  caused previously efficient numerical algorithms to be reexamined.   Massively parallel computers are comprised of many hundreds,  sometimes thousands of processors.  For a numerical algorithm to  fully exploit the power of such machines it must be able to be  'decomposed' into largely independent pieces which can be  distributed across the available computer processors.  The waveform  relaxation method is such a method for solving systems of ordinary  differential equations and time-dependent partial differential  equations.  In addition to its advantages in parallel processing,  it also allows different integration step sizes to be used for  different subsystems, resulting in substantial savings in  computation for some applications.  The theoretical and  experimental studies suggest that the waveform relaxation method  has a great potential for developing reliable, scalable efficient  parallel algorithms for solving a wide range of differential  equations.  The objective of this research is to further  investigate the nature of the waveform relaxation method, and  develop fast scalable parallel algorithms for solving certain type  of ordinary differential equations and time-dependent partial  differential equations.  The long term goal of this research is to  make the developed algorithms applicable to real-world  computational problems, such as the real time integration of  torpedo or missile trajectories, modeling of earthquake effects on  buildings, and simulation of fluid-structure interaction.  This  work will involve the algorithm design, theoretical analysis with  a possible focus on the search of optimal convergence rate, and  numerical testing on sequential and parallel computers.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a course at the graduate  level on  numerical linear algebra, numerical partial differential  equation, or on parallel numerical computation; and leading an  interdisciplinary research seminar seri es on scientific computation  and applications to which both local and national researchers will  be invited to participate.",
