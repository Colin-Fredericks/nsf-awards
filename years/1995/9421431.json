 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: 94-21431  Principal Investigator:  Lustig, Robert H.      The brain consists of billions of neurons which must interconnect  to form specific cell groups and fiber tracts.  The gonadal  hormones, estrogen and androgens, have profound effects on specific  cell groups in the brain.  It is believed that the gonadal steroid  environment during brain development dictates the organization of  the brain and results in sex differences in brain organization.   Participating in these sex differences may be the influence of the  androgens and estrogens on the development of neural contacts  through the nerve cell axons and dendrites.  However, studies of  these connections in the intact developing brain are difficult at  best.  Therefore, Dr. Lustig has elegantly proposed to address the  question of gonadal steroid modulation of axon and dendrite  development using in vitro cell lines endogenously expressing  receptors for the steroid hormones, or genetically altered to  express androgen or estrogen receptors.  The proposed studies will  investigate the effects of androgens and estrogens on axon  outgrowth and arborization, on dendritic spine and gap junction  formation in vitro, and assess the molecular events involved in  cellular morphology and connectivity.  These studies will provide  new information on the manner by which estrogen and androgen elicit  the cell biological events necessary for appropriate interneuronal  connectivity during development.  Such studies may serve as a basis  for beginning to define the etiology and ontogeny of brain sexual  dimorphisms, and the role of sex hormones in the development of  cognition and behavior.",
