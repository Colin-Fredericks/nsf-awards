 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522078  Tamir  The proposed work is a fundamental investigation into the  electromagnetics phenomenology of planar thin-film configurations  which serve as building blocks in a wide variety of optoelectronic  devices.  Both analytical and computational tools will be used, but  modal methods combined with network and leaky-wave concepts will be  emphasized because of their proven effectiveness in solving  microwave problems that are similar to those in the area of planar  optics.  Interface and junction discontinuities exhibited by thin-  film geometries will be explored in order to accurately assess  effects that occur when components form complex composite  structures.  This approach will clarify a host of unresolved  questions involving the operation of thin-film devices.  In  addition, it will serve to develop the systematic and accurate  design criteria that are needed to implement existing and future  optoelectronic components.  The proposed research program is thus  expected to advance the analytical state-of-the-art in planar  optics to a level that is comparable to, or higher than, that  already available in the microwave area.  ***",
