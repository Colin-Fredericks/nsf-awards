 "awd_abstract_narration": "Companies frequently team their employees over widespread regions  when undertaking large and detailed projects.   At present, these  enterprises use leased analog and digital communication lines and  will no doubt switch to computer networks as the \"Information  Superhighway\" becomes a reality.   From a pedagogical point of  view, this modern approach to teaming requires that educators  develop in their graduates the skills required for this new  reality.   These skills include, among others, identifying  expertise and interest within a larger distributed group,  segmenting tasks in a meaningful fashion, integrating designs  across a high-speed network, verifying performance against  specifications, and compiling and writing a comprehensive final  report.   Without these skills, our students face a competitive  disadvantage when confronted with cheaper, more classically  trained engineering talent now prevalent in the global  marketplace.   To confront this challenge to engineering  education, this project has designed and implemented team  learning and team teaching using the Internet.   The principal  investigators are well-acquainted teaching and research faculty  who specialize in digital signal processing.   The project  features signal processing courses with a heavy emphasis on  distributed experimentation.   The equipment used to support  these new courses is located at each university involved in the  project and will form a large connected multimedia laboratory.    These individual laboratories support audio and video  transmission necessary for facilitating real-time student  interaction over the Internet.   Relevant experiments and  learning aides are being developed and will be disseminated  electronically through standard Internet services and through the  development of a multimedia textbook authored by the  investigators.",
