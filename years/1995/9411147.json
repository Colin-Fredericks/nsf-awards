The  cooperative research program will continue focusing on three  main areas: wind load, wind engineering meteorology and wind  flow around buildings.  The combination of full scale field  and wind-tunnel physical modeling will be merged in studies  conducted in the three main areas and each will be  integrated into the other two.  On Wind loads, studies will  continue in topics such as data acquisition and analysis,  pressures on permeable surfaces, the influence of  architectural and mechanical features, the spatial and  temporal structural of wind loads, and on wind loading  reliability analysis of low-raise buildings.  In the area of  wind engineering meteorology, instrumentation refinements  and improved analysis of wind flow records especially of  NEXRAD data, and the simulation of wind storms in the  boundary layer wind tunnel are some of the topics to be  studied.  In the area of wind flow around buildings, the  identification of the separation region near the surface of  structures, the effect of the Reynolds number, the use of  laser-sheet visualization to examine the time-dependent  nature of the wind flow, the effect of building shape, roof  line and other features, shelter and topographic effects,  and numerical modeling are some of the topics to be studied.  The results from the work done in these three main areas  will be integrated throughout the duration of the program.  Based on the results from this program the safety of  populations at risk will improve and the private sector,  such as the construction and insurance industries, will  benefit because the vulnerability of new and retrofitted  buildings and structures will decrease; the Federal, State  and local administrators will continue to benefit because o f  the development of new and improved mitigation measures; and  the research community also will gain knowledge from the  data, instrumentation and methods developed during the  program.  ***",
