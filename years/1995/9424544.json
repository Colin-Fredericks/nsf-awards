 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424544  Groves  This project will investigate genetic factors associated with the   potential of a species to adapt and survive while inhabiting an  unpredictable environment that may be altered by climatic change  or human activity.  The project will address the following  questions: (1) is there detectable genetic diversity between  populations affected by known bottlenecks and barriers to  dispersal? (2) is genetic diversity sufficient to establish  relationships between populations and explain historic patterns of  dispersal across their range? (3) can genetic variability be used  to establish relationships of individuals within populations and  to assess the differential roles of the sexes in pioneering new  ranges or recolonizing old ones? (4) what are the predicted  patterns of gene flow between populations that have fluctuated as   a result of climatic change or human intervention and may be  isolated by geographic barriers? Using the muskox as a model, the   answers to these questions should increase understanding of the  population dynamics of a species that is sometimes constrained  from dispersal by climate, human activity and geographic barriers   and has apparently adapted to survive genetic bottlenecks caused  by these constraints and population fluctuations.  As disturbances  to the environment are likely to become more significant with  predicted global climate change and increasing human presence on  the earth, the ability to predict species' responses to change is  becoming more important if efforts are to be made to ensure their  survival.  The known history of fluctuations of indigenous  populations as well as documented increases of introduced  populations make the muskox an appropriate subject for an  investigation of the influence of genetic, climatic, geographic,  and human factors on the population dynamics of a widely  distributed arctic mammal.  Ecological and evolutionary principles  described in this study should be applicable to other arctic  species.  Analysis of  mitochondrial DNA has been unsatisfactory in  detecting enough genetic diversity to establish relationships  within and between muskox populations (Groves, in prep).  Three  regions of nuclear DNA will be analyzed for their potential to  address the project goals.  These areas include:  hypervariable  microsatellites, exonintron regions and Y chromosome linked  regions. Results from the planning grant research using archived  muskox tissue samples will be used to plan a larger study of  muskox population dynamics, biogeography and evolution throughout  their range.  The number and type of samples required from  different populations will be established so that the most  economical and efficient approach to collecting samples can be  arranged.",
