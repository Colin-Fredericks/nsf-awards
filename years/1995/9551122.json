 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students need experiences that extend the classroom into the  environment so that they can see how their scientific training  can benefit their community.   Further, schools need to enhance  programs that attract women and minorities to science majors.    Finally, coastal communities need the information that marine  science programs can provide about important environmental  issues.   With this equipment, the academy is establishing \"A  Center for Marine and Freshwater Analysis\" to provide a necessary  educational component to a new major entitled Marine Safety and  Environmental Protection.   The center consists of a portable  laboratory containing analytical instrumentation.   Faculty and  students manage the center and use equipment both in the  laboratory and at sea to test marine and fresh waters for  substances of environmental concern.   The Center (1) provides  students with hands-on experience in testing waters; (2) enhances  the academy's newest and most successful major in attracting  underrepresented students toward careers in science; (3) forms  important linkages between the academy and local environmental  agencies such as The Coalition for Buzzards Bay.",
