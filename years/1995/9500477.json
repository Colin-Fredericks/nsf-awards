 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowman   9500477    The PIs plan to purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer for use within the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Colorado.  This instrument will be used to study the molecular processes involved in UV-initiated polymerizations and in UV photocatalysis.  The FTIR spectrometer has the high resolution (0.3 cm-1) and high speed (20 scans per second) required to study these processes, which are fast even at room temperature.  In addition to the spectrometer and associated computer, a fiber-optic UV light source, filters, and multiple internal reflectance accessory will be purchased while a controlled-atmosphere cell for catalytic studies will be constructed.  This spectrometer will be equipped with two sample/detection compartments so that it can effectively be used by two investigators.    Polymerization reactions for the production of highly cross-linked polymers will be initiated by the UV light, and a novel technique for studying reaction diffusion termination mechanisms will be employed.  This technique involves monitoring small changes in the double bond conversion after the UV light has been turned off.  In this manner the importance of reaction diffusion will be established, and the reaction diffusion constant will be measured.  The changes in surface concentrations of reactants and intermediates and identification of adsorbed intermediates will be measured with the FTIR spectrometer during photocatalytic oxidation of organics on titania catalysts.  These transient measurements will help identify reaction steps and measure their rates when combined with mass spectrometric detection of reaction products.  Temperature-programmed desorption and reaction will also be used to identify adsorbate concentrations.  The addition of an FTIR spectrometer will enhance funded research that is currently in progress in these areas.    It is anticipated that the spectrometer will also be valuable in other polymerization and catalysis research.  At presen t, there is no IR spectrometer in the College of Engineering.  Both PIs have experience at other universities with FTIR spectrometers.  The University of Colorado will aost share 40% of the purchase price of this equipment, and the equipment will be maintained by research grants of the two PIs.",
