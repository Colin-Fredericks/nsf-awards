 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop reasonable complexity,  source independent coding algorithms. Source independent algorithms  are crucial to the design of robust systems for applications such  as image coding and mobile communications. In applications of this  type, the statistics of the source and channel in operation are  typically unknown a priori, and the performance of the strategy  employed is sensitive to those unknown  statistics.    The approach taken is the two-stage approach developed in the  source coding literature. Given a space of possible sources and a  particular coding strategy (e.g., VQ, DCT-based transform codes,  etc.), for each source in the space there exists an optimal code.  Designing a single code is equivalent to quantizing the space of  possible codes to 0 bits; the entire space of optimal codes is  approximated by a single code that does well on average across the  data. The two-stage coding literature demonstrates that in general  we should quantize the space of possible codes more finely. Some of  the rate should be spent on describing which code, in a family of  codes, should be used on the source in operation. Specific projects  being completed in this research include the development of a  universal DCT code compatible with existing JPEG and MPEG image and  video coding standards, a universal KLT code, a universal wavelet  packet code, and a universal channel code.    The main objectives of the education plan are to develop and  maintain an exciting atmosphere of active learning for  undergraduate and graduate students. This objective is being  accomplished through innovative programs geared at helping students  to participate fully in their own education and by developing an  atmosphere that encourages the maximum possible exchange between  students, faculty, and members of local industry.",
