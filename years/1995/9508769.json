These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Senior Research Fellowships provide the opportunity for faculty members to broaden their   research perspectives through participation in industrial research activities.   This research involves a sabbatical collaboration between the principal investigator,   the applied mathematics group of AT&T Bell Labs at Murray Hill, and the soliton   transmission group at AT&T Bell Labs at Holmdel. The goal of this interaction is to   investigate mathematical issues related to implementation of commercially viable, large   scale data transmission systems based on the optical soliton concept. This includes, but is   not limited to, optimal design of \"frequency-guiding\" filters currently used to eliminate   noise and \"jitter\" in soliton signals. The proposed research is likely to make  substantial   use of  recent developments in numerical analysis and nonlinear wave theory. The focus of   the research is a topic which relates to designated national priorities, namely the High   Performance Computing and Communications initiative.",
