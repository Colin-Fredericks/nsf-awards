 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503305  Schmitt      The aim of the work is to understand the dynamics and  regulation of structured, open populations, which typify  most marine reef fishes and invertebrates.  While there is  broad agreement among ecologists that attributes of  populations are shared by  more than an single process  (e.g., availability of propagules, competition within and  between life stages, competition with other species,  predation), there remains considerable disagreement  regarding their relative importance.  There also is some  confusion about what roles various processes have in  producing dynamics; few empirical workers have distinguished  between processes that regulate populations (i.e., bound  fluctuations) as opposed to those that cause variation  around the mean abundance.  An enormous amount is known  about the caused of fluctuations in abundance of reef  organisms, but very little is known about what regulates  their populations.  This work will contribute in several key  ways to understanding the general issue of dynamics and  regulation.  It is one of the first comprehensive,  pluralistic evaluations of reef fishes that will distinguish  effects of processes on regulation and on variation.  Second, it will use for the first time operational  definitions and analytical  protocols for quantitative  assessments of the relative importance of various processes.  As such, the research could yield standard approaches and  procedures to address relative importance.  Third, the  application of infrared video technology enables the  exploration of little studied but crucial processes of  settlement and early mortality.",
