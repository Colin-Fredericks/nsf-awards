 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some apes (especially gibbons), and perhaps some ancestors to humans, used special forms of arm-swinging to move among the tree branches.  Brachiation is the term given to the most specialized form of such suspensory behavior.  In attempting to understand the mechanics of brachiation, it has been modeled as the movement of a passive pendulum.  However, this likely does not accurately represent the actual mechanisms by which gibbons, for example, move through the complex and obstacle-ridden world of tree branches.  There be active propulsive forces to modulate speed and direction.    This research project will identify the muscular mechanisms the gibbon can use to maneuver and propel itself, and what strategies other than pendular motion exist for minimizing energy expenditure in brachiation.  To date, research in this area has been limited by the lack of a method for directly measuring the kinetic reaction forces produced by an animal subject during locomotion.  In this study, a newly developed 6-component force/torque transducer will be attached to a handhold used by brachiating animals.  Combined with simultaneous video analysis,iti will be used for a comprehensive study of the mechanics of brachiation.",
