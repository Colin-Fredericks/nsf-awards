 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523349  Kundu  Ultrasonic techniques have been  found to be very effective in  detecting small defects in  comparatively small samples.  However, in big civil  infrastructure type specimens such  as bridges, columns, poles and  pipelines use of ultrasonic  techniques has been limited  because of high absorption and  scattering of body waves  (longitudinal and shear waves  which are  used in ultrasonic  experiments) in such big objects.  In this project unconventional  Lamb waves at very low frequencies  (30 kHz - 200 kHz) will be used to  detect internal defects in civil  infrastructures. Initial  investigations have shown that for  detecting weak bonds and partially  damaged internal interfaces, Lamb  waves are much  more efficient than body waves.  However, Lamb wave sensors have  not been developed yet to its full  potential because of the lack of  expertise in this field in sensor  industries.  In this research the  theory necessary to develop  efficient Lamb wave or guided wave  sensors will be developed first.  Then the new sensor will be  fabricated with the help of  transducer manufacturing  industries.  These sensors will be  tested at the Wright-Patterson  Material Laboratory and will be  used to detect internal damages in  concrete and metal slabs and  pipeline type civil  infrastructures.    Two companion projects are  supported to carry out the above  described research:  University of  Arizona which will develop the  basic lamb wave theory and conduct  initial sensor design and testing,  and University of Dayton/Wright  Patterson Laboratory which will  test the fabricated sensors and  evaluate the results.  ***",
