 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of computational biology;  specifically, problems which deal with how to construct  evolutionary trees, or  phylogeny, (i.e., models of the  evolutionary history of various species).  There are three  standard criteria on which tree construction algorithms are  based:  distance methods, maximum likelihood, and parsimony.  The first two  methods are used by the biologists and are dealt  with in the statistical  literature.  The traditional algorithms  literature for tree construction is  focused on the parsimony  methods; notably the Perfect Phylogeny Problem.  Although this  problem has significant combinatorial appeal, there is a gap  between the results for this algorithmic theory and the theory  for distance  based tree construction methods.   The project focuses on problems in the  distance based phylogeny,  including: (1) Methods for computing  distances from strings; (2) Methods for comparing different trees for  consensus; (3) Methods for fitting distance data to metric models.    The  second part of the project involves developing empirical  methods for testing  the statistical robustness of heuristic  methods currently in use.    The  Educational Component of this CAREER Grant includes: (a) Development and  implementation of a post doctoral training program in computational molecular  biology at  DIMACS; (b) Modification of the graduate seminar in  biocomputing; (c) Development and modification of the Rutgers University  undergraduate program in biomathematics which focuses on  combinatorics and  molecular biology.",
