 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422250  Coyle     This award is to establish a testbed for `oth experimentation with and modeling and analysis of traffic on high-speed, heterogeneous, local area networks.  The equipment purchased for the testbed includes three ATM switches, one of which provides access to other types of networks, and a high-performance workstation with extensive video capability.     The following equipment will be connected to the testbed: 17 high-performance workstations located in various laboratories and research groups; two servers of, and the Ethernet backbone for the Engineering Computer Network (ECN), which supports over 12,000 users; and, at least two T1 lines  provided by GTE for access to local hospitals and high schools.  The testbed will have access to the Internet through the ECN.  These connections will allow network traffic from many different applications to be brought into the testbed for study.     The research this testbed will support includes: Modeling and analysis of network traffic statistics and network control algorithms; Communication network design and analysis; Discrete event system  simulations driven by empirical data; Video and image compression algorithms for ATM networks; Distributed simulation and visualization for  manufacturing and the teleoperation of robots.  ***",
