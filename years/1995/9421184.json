 "awd_abstract_narration": "Davies  9421184    The studies in this proposal focus on the relation between  the structures and loss properties of a series of perovskite  dielectrics.  While these tantalate-based oxides have the  lowest losses of all the microwave ceramics, optimization of  their properties requires careful control of their  chemistry, processing, and degree of structural order.  Preliminary investigations made on one of these systems have  indicated that the dielectric losses associated with  internal domain boundaries can be reduced by introducing  selected chemical substituents.  The proposal describes a  series of experimental studies designed to understand and  explain this effect, and outlines new approaches for  improving the loss properties of other petrovskite  dielectrics.  Many aspects of this work are being conducted  in close collaboration with scientists from industry, and  several aspects of this study are expected to have a direct  impact on the processing and production commercial ceramic  resonator systems.  %%%  The goals of this work are to understand what aspects of the  structures of the existing microwave dielectric materials  are critical in realizing an optimized electronic  performance, and to use these crystal chemical insights to  enhance the performance of other oxide systems.  ***",
