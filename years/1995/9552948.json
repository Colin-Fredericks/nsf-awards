Grant activities would include, in  conjunction with NSF, the selection of approximately 400 student  participants in HRD and other NSF-funded research projects to  attend the conference in Washington and present findings from their  research activities.  The university would host the student  orientation, prepare abstracts of student presentations, and design  and schedule activities to encourage student interactions with role  models and other students, leading to the formation of a support  group to reinforce student selection of science, mathematics,  engineering and technology (SMET) majors and careers.  Grant  activities also would include scheduling student travel and hotel  accommodations, and arranging transportation to the conference for  local area precollege and college students and teachers.",
