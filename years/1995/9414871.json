 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414871  Robertson  Research laboratories within the South Wing of the seventy -year old Life Sciences  building at the University of Idaho will be renovated with the support of NSF funds.   The renovation will develop four modern labmratories to meet the modern needs of  scientists in the Departments of Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry  (MMBB) and Biological Sciences.  The project will address major existing problems  with temperature control, dust and mold contamination, ventilation system noise,  antiquated laboratory furnishings, major deficiencies in electrical and plumbing  services, negative air pressure, and inefficient design of laboratory space.  The  laboratories, constructed in 1924, have not been renovated for 26 years and several  contain the original laboratory furnishings.      Molecular techniques will be emphasized in the laboratory for plant systematics and  also for vertebrate biology -- both within the department of biological sciences.  A  third laboratory in Biological Sciences is dedicated to cell physiology.  The structural  characterization of proteins will be studied in the renovated Microbiology, Molecular  Biology and Biochemistry space.The University of Idaho programs have grown  considerably over the last decade.  MMBB has twelve faculty; ten of whom faculty  have been hired since 1986.   Productivity in the department has increased  significantly and led to development of a new undergraduate major in Molecular   Biology and Biochemistry.  Fifty graduate students are enrolled in departmental  programs and nineteen undergraduates worked on research projects during the 1994  academic year.  A similar impact will be felt in Biological Sciences which has  nineteen faculty, 27 graduate students and five postdoctorals.  Twenty undergraduates  were involved in research studies during 1994.  The programs emphasize recruitment  and retention of students representing both genders, all ethnic groups, and the  physically challenged.",
