 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute  (WPI) is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of the Salisbury Laboratories. Home to the Department  of Biology and Biotechnology, the labs are over 100 years old and were last renovated in 1974.  Research spaces throughout the building share common deficiencies that consist of:  warped, rusted and broken benches and cabinetry, poor heating and cooling utilities, the absence or limited electric,  gas, and plumbing services, and deteriorated flooring.  In spite of the deplorable conditions, the department has grown significantly in undergraduate and graduate majors who are actively involved in the research enterprise.  It is mandatory that seniors complete a Major Qualifying Project, a research or design project at a level appropriate for graduate study preparation.  In conjunction to this institutionally driven research imperative, the department encourages outstanding undergraduates to continue their work in a combined bachelor and master's degree program.  ARI funds will be used to support renovations including: reconfiguration of inefficient space, replacement of HVAC, electrical, plumbing and gas systems, installation of new casework and benches, provision for deionized water, and the replacement of a greenhouse.  The renovations will primarily impact research in the areas of molecular and neurobiology of invertebrates, and the biochemistry and kinetics of heavy metal uptake by fungi.  Other research that will be impacted includes: the physiology and biochemistry of secondary metabolites of cultured plants, the development and modeling of  the growth of transformed root systems in bioreactors, the physiology of immobilized bacteria, and the molecular biology of memory and invertebrate genetics.  This project will not only enhance the faculty research programs, but will provide the state-of-the-art facilities needed in order to prepare students for research careers.",
