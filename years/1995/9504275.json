 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504275  Warren    The goal of this project is the design and implementation of a robust and efficient integrated optimizing compiler for the XSB system.  XSB is a system that integrates logic programming, deductive databases and nonmonotonic reasoning.  The combination of the three paradigms introduces challenges to the design of an optimizing compiler for the system.  Firstly, the combination give rise to a number of unique optimization problems that are not germane to any one of the paradigms alone.  Secondly, an efficient compilation system must integrate a suite of optimizations so as to extensively share ideas, formulations and implementation efforts.  Some of the interesting optimization problems relevant to XSB will be identified and some preliminary ideas for their solution will be sketched.  A promising and powerful idea to integrate these optimizations through the use of constraints will be outlined.  The potential impact of the techniques that will be developed in this project to the optimization of functional and (constraint) logic programs will be shown.  These techniques will form the foundations for an integrated optimizing compilation system that spans multiple languages and paradigms.  ***",
