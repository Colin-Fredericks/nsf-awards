 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452769  Haines-Stiles    \"Passport to Knowledge\" takes students from all across America on \"electronic field trips\" via television and computer networks.  Students join research scientists as they conduct their activities in environments typically inaccessible to the younger population.  This is made possible through the use of television, VCRs, computers, CD-ROMs, modems, satellites and telephone lines. Using these media students will become involved in places such as the Antarctic, the Amazon Rainforest and the Hubble Space Telescope.  Some students  will be able to interact with scientists live, others via Internet.  All will be able to monitor and correspond with the scientists as they make entries in their Field Journals.  The broadcasts will be distributed over public television stations and other satellite educational networks so they will be accessible to schools at no cost.  Thus, Passport to Knowledge will deliver contemporary science through face to face encounters with distant and exotic places and phenomena and the privileged women and men exploring them, using a powerful combination of television, print and on-line computer technologies to inform, inspire, motivate and educate.  ***",
