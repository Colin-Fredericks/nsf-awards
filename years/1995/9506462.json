 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lillegraven  9506462  This interdisciplinary study is focused in south-central Wyoming, along the boundary of the Hanna Basin and adjacent uplifts to the north.  The area is in the heart of the Rocky Mountain foreland, a region characterized by broad, asymmetric basement arches that over-rode adjacent subsiding basins along thrust and/or reverse faults (so-called \"Laramide-style\" deformation).  The Hanna Basin, although areally small, exposes an enormously thick, fossil-rich sequence of Upper Cretaceous to lower Eocene strata.  Parts of the sedimentary sequence were affected by the same structural events seen more obviously in adjacent mountain blocks.  Data from both areas suggest a polyphase deformational history, although its timing and regional extent are uncertain.  Goals of the research transgress boundaries among traditional disciplines of paleobiology, biostratigraphy, physical stratigraphy, and structural geology.  Paleogeography is a unifying theme, including: 1) interpretation of physical evolution of the Rocky Mountain landscape during the Laramide orogeny; and 2) documentation of massive changes in diversity among its ancient vertebrate inhabitants through time.  The research depends upon integration of new paleontological and geological data, linked between the basin and its marginal uplifts.  The unusually thick and richly fossiliferous Ferris Formation, for example, provides unique opportunity for adding new, highly relevant taxonomic distributional data to debates on: 1) catastrophic versus gradualistic dinosaurian extinction; and 2) the nature of North American mammalian faunal \"recovery\" following terrestrial extinctions near the end of the Cretaceous time.  These same fossils, in conjunction with abundant mammalian remains from the younger Hanna Formation (Paleocene-early Eocene), not only provide evidence for detailed zonation of stratigraphic horizons within the Hanna Basin, but also allow temporal calibration of recognizable, important geologic events.  Stratigraphic linka ge of unique paleontological occurrences with lithologically distinctive assemblages of syntectonic conglomerates, for example, shows significant differences in the timing of uplift, and erosional histories, between western and eastern extremes of the Hanna Basin's border of northern mountains.  The study area affords unusual opportunity to document effects of Laramide structural style throughout the geologic column, ranging from Precambrian igneous and metamorphic cores of the Shirley and Seminoe Mountains upwardly through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic montane cover into syntectonic basinal strata deposited during the latest Cretaceous and early Paleogene.  The structural research is to develop a detailed chronology based upon: 1) continuation of geologic/structural mapping in key areas; 2) analysis of deformational overprinting, from mesoscopic to macroscopic scales; 3) study of major and minor faults, applying kinematic analysis; 4) preparation of additional interpretive cross-sections from surface and subsurface (from well and seismic reflection sources) data; and 5) retrodeformational analysis of adjacent montane and basinal structures.  These kinds of detailed investigations, which are simultaneously based upon, and dependent upon, new paleontological/geological data derived from field observations, provide superb opportunities to: 1) expand basic knowledge of paleogeographic development of an area of converging tectonic patterns; 2) analyze important tectonic relationships among crustal shortening, orientation and sequential evolution of structural features, and synorogenic sedimentation; and 3) test diverse geometric and kinematic tectonic models applied to the basement-involved, contractional regime characterizing the eastern Rocky Mountains.",
