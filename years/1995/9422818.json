 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a theoretical framework for  understanding the scope of innovations in retailing with  particular attention to competition and the incentives to  innovate and explore new service-oriented business  practices.  The research includes empirical analysis that  emphasizes competition between established retailers and the  new retail outlets such as warehouse stores.  The research  comprises both theoretical and empirical analysis of  competitive strategies.  The theory relies on a game  theoretic formulation, with endogenous consumer decisions  predicated on information provided by firms.  Where  information is lacking, consumers have expectations that are  fulfilled in equilibrium, i.e., are rational.  The model  also permits forward buying by consumers.  The empirical  work consists of studying both firms' strategies and  consumer behavior.  The firms' strategies include their  positioning, pricing, product assortment, service level and  advertising.  Consumer behavior is with respect to their  shopping behavior:  choice of store, choice of product, and  inventorying.  Thus, the empirical analysis is tied to the  theoretical work.  The data will also match stores and  consumers within the same geographic market.    The research should prove useful to both researchers and  managers.  Researches should find the game theoretic  foundation for the analysis of retailing useful to build on  as they tackle other aspects of retailing, and multi-product  firms in general.  The empirical analysis will provide  insights into how retail innovations affect entrenched  firms. Such insights are critical to understanding market  transitions, managerial effectiveness, and productivity.  Managers should find the results useful in formulating their  strategies, and obtaining insights which will prove useful  as they enter new markets, for example, internationally.",
