 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409040  Tauchen    It is quite common across many research areas in empirical  economics for there to be an accumulated body of knowledge  regarding the statistical characteristics of the relevant data.   This knowledge is acquired from the years of experience of many  investigators using statistical models to describe the data.  The  models are termed statistical because, with rare exceptions, the  parameters have no direct behavioral interpretation.  A structure  model, such as an equilibrium asset pricing model or an  equilibrium business cycle model, stands in sharp contract to a  statistical model.  A structural model typically provides a  complete description of the underlying dynamics, and many  parameters have behavioral interpretations.  Estimating a modern  stochastic structural model presents formidable computational and  statistical challenges.  A reasonable principle for structural  estimation is to bring to bear on the problem the accumulated  stock of knowledge regarding the reduced form statistical models  that have been found by others to work well.  The proposed  project undertakes extensions and refinements of new estimators  for dynamic models based on this principle.  The proposed work is  in two parts: a methodological section and an empirical section.   The methodological work entails development of reliable methods  for statistical inference, comparative work with other  estimators, and visualization work to learn more about the  dynamics embedded in the model and the characteristics of the  objective function of estimation.  The empirical work applies the  new estimators to address issues in asset pricing, financial  volatility, and empirical auction research.  The main research  tools are nonlinear estimation, Monte Carlo simulation, and the  AVS visualization package.  The results of the project will be of  interest to empirical economists and statisticians, and in  particular to researchers doing simulation work or to researchers  becoming interested in interactive v isualization of structural  models.",
