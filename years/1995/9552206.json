 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program utilizes microcomputers to measure and record time-  resolved acoustical signals and to model standing and propagating  acoustic waves in real physical systems.   New laboratory  experiments and simulations are being developed for two acoustics  courses open to non-science-majors, entitled Musical Acoustics  and Physics of Electronic Sound.   The new equipment includes six  microcomputers with sound cards, a networked laser printer, and  six computer-interfaced, digitally synthesized function  generators.   In laboratory experiments, steady-state and  transient sound signals are recorded and analyzed with  microcomputers.   Software is being developed to calculate and  display wave oscillations in simulations of real physical  significance, such as standing waves inside wind instruments and  mechanical vibrations of strings and membranes.   Sophisticated  function generators are interfaced to microcomputers to  facilitate frequency-dependence measurements, such as tests of  loudspeakers and amplifier response.   The program extends a  highly successful introductory acoustics laboratory that  incorporated fast Fourier transform spectrum analyzers to  frequency analyze musical sounds.   Students can benefit from the  ability to study with equal precision and accuracy important  acoustical phenomena from the complementary perspectives of time  and frequency.",
