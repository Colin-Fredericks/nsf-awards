 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three-day conference on  computational number theory to be held in honor of Professor  A.O.L. Atkin.  The conference, which will take place on September  14-16, 1995, at the University of Illinois at Chicago, will focus  on two fundamental aspects of computation in number theory.  The  first of these concerns development of computational techniques  to conduct experimentation and support conjectures in the pure  theory of numbers, especially in areas related to modular forms;  the second deals with applications of techniques from the pure  theory to algorithmic problems such as those arising in  factoring, primality testing, and counting points on algebraic  varieties.    This research is in the field of number theory.  This subject  area has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as the divisibility of one whole number  by another.  It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for mainly aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century it has become an  indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data  transmission and processing, and the design of communication  systems.",
