The  multidisciplinary projects include research in combinatorics and  combinatorical algebra, computer algebra, parallel algorithms in  computer algebra, harmonic analysis and graph theory, control theory,  automated theorem proving, and other areas of mathematics.       The grant will fund computer laboratory and computer equipment for  general use by faculty. students and visiting researchers at the  mathematics department at the University of California. San Diego. The  primary purposes of the laboratory will be for research and for  graduate student training.       The grant will contain funds for the acquisition and installation  of computer equipment. It contains no salary funding for investigators  or staff. It includes directly matching funds of $50,000 from the  University of California, San Diego and additional substantial support  from UCSD in the form of networking and cabling. In addition, the  University of California, San Diego has just committed an additional  $31,000 per year in permanent funds to the mathematics department  budget to be used for hiring computer support personnel (this is  contingent on the details of the forthcoming California state budget).    ~ f",
