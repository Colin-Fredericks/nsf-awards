 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experiment uses the powerful new technique of polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) to demonstrate the variable nature of human DNA.   Although the DNA from one person to another is more alike than  different, certain areas of our genome exhibit a great deal of  diversity.  Such variable sequences are termed polymorphic (meaning  many forms) and provide the basis for paternity and forensic  testing of DNA.  Many DNA polymorhisms are found within the  estimated 90% of the genome that does not code for protein.  A  special class of these polymorphisms is called an Alu insertion.   Alu elements are short DNA sequences that have amplified to about  500,00 copies, distributed throughout primate genomes.  A few of  these Alu insertions have occurred within the last million years  and are not fixed in the human genome.    Students obtain samples of their own DNA using a simple mouthwash  procedure (bloodless and noninvasive).  PCR is used to amplify  across an intron of the tissue plasminogen activator gene that may  contain an Alu insertion.  If the Alu sequence is present, then a  400-bp PCR product will result, while a 100-bp product is produced  when the Alu sequence is absent.  Following amplification, student  samples are loaded into an agarose gel, electrophoresed, stained,  and photographed.  Each student will see one or two bands in their  gel lane, indicating whether they are homozygous for the Alu  insertion, homozygous for the absence of the insertion, or  heterozygous for the insertion.",
