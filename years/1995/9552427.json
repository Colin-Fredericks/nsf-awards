 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linear Systems and Circuits These laboratory exercises are  designed to introduce students to the fundamental properties of  electro-optic devices, as well as the properties of classical  optics.   The topics covered in the lectures and accompanying  experiments include semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, thin  lenses, diffraction gratings, beam splitters, polarization, and  the basics of ray-tracing.   The motivation behind the exercises  is the optical section of the CD player.   The final experiment  includes design and construction of a large-scale version of the  CD optical system.   This is used to demonstrate the various  optical signals that are read from the CD and to show how the  optical section is related to the electronics (digital audio  signals) and servo (focus and tracking signals) systems.   Electromagnetics The goal of this group of laboratory exercises  is to bring a variety of electromagnetic fundamentals employed in  CD technology to the attention of the students.  Optics and  Optical Devices This laboratory exercise is designed to introduce  students to some of the properties of continuous-time and  discrete-time, linear, and time-invariant systems.   Topics  covered in both lecture and laboratory exercises include Fourier  analysis, frequency response, Kirchhoff's and Ohm's laws, power  transfer and impedance matching, operational amplifiers,  analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion (ADC and DAC),  quantization effects, sampling, and aliasing.   Each of these  topics is motivated through the use of audio band circuits and  computer simulations.",
