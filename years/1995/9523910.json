In this research, a team of scientists at the Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution will study the role of protozoans in the  fate and transport of trace metal and organic contaminants in  coastal waters.  The suite of contaminants will include Cr,  Pb,Cd,PAHs, and PCBs. The focus will be on estuarine and open  coastal environments in which high concentrations of particle-  associated contaminants coincide with rich water column and benthic  microbial communities, because it is in such situations that  protozoans would be most likely to affect particle transport and  chemistry.  Effects of protozoan grazing will be compared with  bacterial and non-biological processes impacting the cycling of  contaminants.  Although the field work was originally planned for  both Boston Harbor and New Bedford Harbor; it has subsequently been  scaled back to involve only the latter.  Laboratory studies will  involve systems ranging from the very simple (one protist, one  bacterial species) to the complex (natural marine microbial  assemblages). The results should be extensible to contaminant  cycling by protozoans in other marine environments.",
