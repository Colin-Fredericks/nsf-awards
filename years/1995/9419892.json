 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brainerd  9419892    The  mechanism by which complex biological systems with many  interacting  parts  evolve  has  engaged  biologists   since  Charles  Darwin.  The goal of this research is to  determine  how  one such complex system, the respiratory pump used  for  breathing,   has   changed  during   vertebrate   evolution.  Reptiles, birds, and mammals ventilate their lungs  with  an  aspiration pump in which ribs, and in some cases a diaphragm  muscle, expand the chest cavity and suck air into the lungs.  Air-breathing  fish  lack the rib and  diaphragm  structures  that are necessary for aspiration breathing.  They take  air  into the mouth cavity and compress it, forcing air into  the  lungs.   Mouth  pumps use only muscles of  the  head  region  while  aspiration pumps use only muscles of  the  chest  and  abdominal  regions.  The transition between  the  two  is  a  significant  change in a complex system.   Some  amphibians,  however,  appear to be intermediate, using head muscles  for  inhalation  and body muscles for exhalation.  This  research  will   determine  whether  the  use  of  body  muscles   for  exhalation is common to most species of amphibians, and thus  is  a  probable  evolutionary step between  mouth  pump  and  aspiration breathing.  Pressure transducers, muscle activity  transducers, air flow transducers, and x-ray video  will  be  used to determine ventilation patterns in representatives of  all  three  orders of extant amphibians.  The  results  will  test  the hypothesis that use of body muscles for exhalation  is  an  ancestral character of the amphibians, and  hence  a  probable  intermediate  stage  in  the  evolution   of   the  aspiration pump.  In the long term, this research  will  aid  in identifying the sequence of behavioral, morphological and  neural  changes  that  resulted in  a  reorganization  of  a  complex   physiological  system  for  function  in   a   new  environment.",
