Results of climate model simulations and conceptual  paleoclimate scenarios provide hypotheses to be tested against the  geologic record.  Other questions are derived from regional changes  in the paleovegetational record that require climatic explanations.  Specific paleoclimatic questions are: 1) was there an east-west  gradient in effective moisture across northern Alaska during the  late glacial as well as the Holocene, 2) when did the major  increase in effective moisture related to late-glacial circulation  changes occur, 3) was precipitation either enhanced or reduced  during the period 11,000-6000 (calibrated) yr BP, when temperatures  were probably warmer that present, and 4) are there other rapid,  regional effective moisture changes in the record?  The major  contributions of this research will be 1) empirical data on  regional paleohydrology, and 2) an assessment of changes in  vegetation and other factors of the terrestrial system (e.g.,  eolian processes and watershed geochemistry) in the light of the  paleohydrologic and other paleoclimatic data.",
