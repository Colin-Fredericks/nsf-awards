 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, under the U.S.-Mexico CONACyT Initiative, is concerned  with an in-depth scientific understanding of the nature of the  relationship between mobile robotic agents and their environment.   The research addresses the agent-environment relationship directly  using schema theory and neurophysiological and ethological models  to ultimately provide credible, generalizable, and useful results  in this domain.  These systems will ultimately be grounded in both  simulations and actual robotic hardware.  An in-depth understanding  and dynamic modeling of the relationship a robot has with its  environment (i.e., the overall ecology) is important to ensure that  fielded robotic systems don't compete inappropriately with other  agents that can do the task more effectively (and by competing,  reduce their usefuless); that the robots are successful competitors  within the ecological system and can potentially displace less  efficient agents; and that they are ecologically sensitive so that  agent-environmental system dynamics are well-modeled and as  predictable as possible whenever new robotic technology is  introduced.  The research efforts will be tied together through the  use of software tools already in existence or under development at  both sites, including NSL, a neural simulation language; ASL, an  abstract schema language; and MissionLab, a schema-based  mission-oriented simulation and robot implementation environment.",
