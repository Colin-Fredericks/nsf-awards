 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424214  Shah   This project represents a continuation of a Research Experience for Undergraduates site which has operated successfully for the past seven years.  Over sixty undergraduate students from a half dozen institutions in Florida have participate in this program.  The key distinctive elements of the approach at this institution are (1) to have a full calendar year experience planned for the participants, so that they have time to follow a substantial project of their own through to completion, (2) to present each participant with several possible project to topics, so that they can feel they have chosen a project which is most interesting to them, (3) to immerse the participants in the general research environment almost as if they were graduate students, by having them meet with the faculty member once each week to discuss their project, participate in the weekly research group meetings, attend research presentations and meet with visiting researchers, and (4) to follow through over the year by working with the students to write a technical report on their project, to study for the GRE's and to apply to graduate programs.  In past years, a large fraction of the participants in this program have been able to prepare a paper for submission to a conference, have the paper accepted and then attend the conference to present the paper.  Several past participants have even accomplished substantial enough research to also result in journal publications.  Many of the past participants are now pursuing graduate studies at various institutions.  ***",
