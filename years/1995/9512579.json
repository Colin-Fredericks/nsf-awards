 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512579  Kelly    A high resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope  (FESEM) will be acquired and installed at the Materials Science  Center of the University of Wisconsin, Madison campus.  The  proposed FESEM has two features that make it an essential tool  for advancing several areas in materials science.  First, the  high image resolution capability makes it possible to study  microstructural features at the nanometer scale (above 1.2  nanometers) and to examine large sample areas.  This allows for  the study of materials that are difficult to prepare for  transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  The high resolution  capability will be used to study the microstructure of high  critical current superconductors, of surfaces modified by ion  implantation, and of nanocrystalline ceramics.  Second, the  instrument is equipped with an electron backscatter diffraction  pattern (EBSP) detection and analysis system which makes possible  the determination of the orientation of individual grains in a  sample.  This capability will be used to map the grain  orientation in high temperature superconductors and can provide  information on the critical current path in these materials.  %%%  The high resolution scanning electron microscope will serve  several research groups on campus working in materials related  problems.  It replaces an instrument which has five times lower  resolution and which is eighteen years old.  The new instrument's  ability to image large samples at high resolution will make  possible routine characterization of advanced materials and will  impact a broad range of ongoing programs in materials science.  ***",
