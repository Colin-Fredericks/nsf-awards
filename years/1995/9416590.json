 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416590  Emlet         This research will provide an approach with combined  laboratory manipulation and field experimentation for  examining ecological and evolutionary connections between  the two least understood components of the life cycles of  benthic marine invertebrates: larvae and juveniles.  Work  will examine the effect of larval nutrition on juvenile  performance in the field, a feature ignored in the studies  of recruitment biology.  Studies on recruitment biology are  currently focused on larval supply, and this research will  show whether there is a need to consider larval condition  and its influence on juvenile performance to explain control  of benthic populations by larval input.  Larvae will be fed  in the lab on cultured algal rations at levels approximating  coastal oceanic conditions.  By experimenting with an array  of invertebrates with different modes of life (sessile,  mobile) and different trophic modes (suspension feeders,  herbivores, predators), the work determines whether effects  on juvenile performance apply broadly.       This project provide field tests of the long  hypothesized (survival) advantages of greater energystores  and larger size at metamorphosis which are basic components  of most verbal and quantitative models of life history  evolution of marine invertebrates.  The approach is  strengthened by the use of species with 3 different  developmental patterns (pelagic feeding larvae, pelagic  nonfeeding larvae, and benthic encapsulated juveniles), in  that it will be possible to determine if the hypothesized  advantages readily apply to all types of development  included.",
