 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to develop an interdisciplinary  program for electronics manufacturing education that will provide  highly-trained technicians to U.S. industry.  A wide range of  activities that include all three subcategories of \"Advanced  Technological Education Projects\" will be necessary to meet this  goal.  First, associate degree faculty expertise will be enhanced  with industry fellowships, workshops, and seminars.  With better  understanding of industry needs, these faculty, along with a  practicing engineer from the Electronic Manufacturing Productivity  Facility (EMPF), will develop three new courses that are the basis  for a new degree option.  The laboratories which accompany these  courses will use facilities belonging to industry partners, the  EMPF, and the schools, along with equipment purchased under the  Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement section of this grant.   Additional activities, centering around the Mobile Electronics  Manufacturing Line and the EMPF, will link secondary teachers and  students with associate degree faculty, practicing engineers, and  technicians.  Such activities will allow for secondary teacher  enhancement and curriculum development.",
