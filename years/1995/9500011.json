 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500011  Hall  The Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Notre  Dame will use the requested funds to purchase a tunable  Titanium:Sapphire laser, Argon ion pump laser, and closed loop heat  exchanger for pump laser water cooling.  The equipment will provide  the necessary capabilities for the complete development and  characterization of new integrated optoelectronics devices and  integrated circuits (OEICs).  These structures will be fabricated  using a new oxidation technology for aluminum-bearing alloy  semiconductors (the \"native\" oxide of aluminum-gallium-arsenide  (A1GaAs)).  The planar waveguide lenses, buried strip waveguides,  and integrated laser sources to be developed will be useful  \"building block\" components broadly applicable in the further  evolution of OEICs.  These components will be applied for the  realization of novel and higher-performance integrated master  oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) devices.  As compact and  efdicient semiconductor laser sources, MOPA devices have enormous  demonstrated potential for generating high-power (>5 W), highly-  coherent radiation, and strongly merit further research.  The new  A1GaAs native oxide will also be investigated as a potential new  host material for rare-earth ions, promising a novel approach for  incorporating the dopants into III-V semiconductors to obtain  monolithically-integrated, optically-pumped, spectrally sharp,  temperature-insensitive luminescence sources with new properties  and wavelengths.  ***",
