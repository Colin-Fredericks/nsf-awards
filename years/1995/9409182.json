 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409182  Jahne    Research will be undertaken in response to a one-time Program  Announcement (NSF 93-101) for the Coastal Ocean Processes  (CoOP) Coastal Air-Sea Chemical Fluxes pilot study.  The  NSF/CoOP Study will augment and collaborate with the  ONR-sponsored Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) Advanced Research  Initiative (ARI) project scheduled for 1995 off the  coast of  Monterey, California.  The overall scientific project is  interdisciplinary, with the NSF/CoOP efforts addressing  chemical and biological parameters, while the ONR study  focuses on physical oceanographic and meteorological  parameters.     This is a collaborative project between investigators from the  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and from University of  Rhode Island.  The research will improve our understanding of  air-sea gas transfer under different environmental conditions  at the air-sea interface.  A new in situ instrument will be  developed to measure the gas transfer velocity (k) on time  scales of minutes to hours that are much shorter than  conventional tracer techniques (days or longer).   The  instrument will be integrated into a small research catamaran  called LADAS which is towed behind a research vessel.  LADAS  carries a scanning laser slope gauge, to measure the three-  dimensional capillary-gravity wave spectrum, meteorological  instruments, and a long-wave monitoring capability.  Addition-  ally a surface microlayer sampler will be installed on the  catamaran to enable coincident measurements of the gas  transfer velocity, small scale roughness, wind stress, and  surface chemical parameters.  LADAS will be deployed in  several field experiments to determine air-sea gas transfer  rates under realistic ocean conditions and especially to  relate these observations over different spatial and temporal  scales in coastal environments.  Such analyses will not  only provide a more accurate parameterization of gas transfer  velocity by avoiding biases caused by long time averaging, but  will also provide i nsights as to the transient nature of gas  flux.  The correlation of surface roughness and gas flux will  benefit future global remote sensing of air-sea gas exchange  since surface roughness is one of sea surface parameters than  can be remotely measured from aircraft and satellites.",
