These effects are different for different  cloud types, and the net forcing usually changes sign from day to  night.  A study of how clouds have changed in the past may help to  clarify the interactions of clouds with other parts of the climate  system and to infer changes in cloud radiative forcing.  For  global-changes studies involving clouds, a long period of record  with global coverage and with no change in observing procedures is  necessary.  Routine surface weather observations of clouds,  beginning about 1952 from ships in the ocean and 1971 from land  stations, meet these requirements. Creation of databases and  analyses of those databases are proposed to determine the changes  of cloud types and their diurnal cycles over the past 40 years.    Surface weather observations from land and sea have previously been  used to produce a global climatology of total cloud cover type  amounts, covering the 30-year period 1952-1981 over the ocean and  the 11-year period 1971-1981 over land.  These results were  published in a series of four climatic atlases, which have found  numerous uses in climatic research.  Recently an improvement to the  analysis procedure has been developed establishing an illuminance  criterion for nighttime observations.  By screening nighttime  observations based on the availability of sufficient moonlight or  twilight more accurate diurnal cycles of cloud amounts can be  obtained.    This illuminance criterion will be used to determine the  geographical distribution of cloud type amounts, their diurnal  variations, interannual variations, and long-term trends.  The  trends will be analyzed separately for day and night, since cloud  radiative forcing is generally negative in daytime but positive  at  night.  The research consists of the creation of a hierarchy of  three databases for climatic analyses of clouds, spanning the 45  years 1952-1996.    (1) Edited Cloud Reports Archive  (2) Global analysis of the average amounts and diurnal cycles of  total cloud cover and eleven different cloud types, using the  moonlight criterion.  (3) Global analysis of the geographical distribution of interannual  variations and multi-decadal trends in amounts of the different  cloud types (1954-1996 for ocean; 1971-1996 for land).    This work is important because cloud processes are among the most  important in climate change and long-term data about clouds are  essential to an improved understanding of cloud processes.    This project is co-funded by NSF (ROCEW and Geosystem Databases)  Global Change initiatives and NOAA's Office of Global Programs.",
