 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424569  Busch-Vishniac   This project will use a new six degree of freedom sensor based on lateral effect silicon photo sensitive diode (PSD) technology, to measure dimensions on manufactured mechanical components.  For a high volume production environment, the innovation is in meeting the technical performance specifications.  Resolutions on the order of 0.01-0.l  micrometer over a linear range of +/- 30 mm and angular resolutions on the order of 0.01 arc-seconds over a rotation range of  +/- 2 degrees are possible, and because these are primarily analog sensors, the goal is to make 1000 measurements a second so that it is feasible to use them for feedback process control in high volume production.  This project will address three topics of importance in achieving these technical goals relevant to manufacturing: an error analysis of the integrated sensor system, implementation and robustness issues when installed in a manufacturing environment, and detection of dimensions, as well as position, of a fabricated part.  To test the robustness issues, the investigators will work with a company to develop and install a prototype system in a pilot manufacturing environment.   Successful completion of this project will provide a new resolution, high speed, non-contact sensor technology at modest cost.  This enables closed loop control of dimensional or mechanical features in manufacturing and assembly systems that produce high volume and high quality products and components.",
