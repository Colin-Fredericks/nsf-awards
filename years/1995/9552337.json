In addition,  three introductory courses, two of them for non-science majors,  will be enhanced by an experience with lasers.  Although lasers  have become ubiquitous in post-graduate research, a lack of  adequate instrumentation currently prevents any meaningful  \"hands-on\" experience for our students.  Through the addition of  several assorted laser systems and peripheral equipment such as a  monochromator and digital oscilloscope, we plan to introduce  students to the physical basis of modern optics and to advanced  spectroscopic principles.  In Physical Chemistry and Instrumental  Techniques, many important spectroscopic techniques, such as Raman,  pulse-probe, and luminescence decay, will become integral parts of  our modern laboratories.  Those topics are currently limited to an  inappropriately small role in our classroom discussion.  The  proposed equipment is especially relevant in Instrumental  Techniques where students will assemble their own  spectrophotometers from the individual components, i.e., light  source, sample, monochromator, and detector.  In Optics, students  will construct lasers from individual components (i.e., gain media,  end-mirror, output-coupler, and tuning element) and examine the  role of each component in the overall operation of the system.   That exercise will complement theoretical discussions of  longitudinal and transverse modes and optical gain and losses.  In  General Physics, a mong other laser experiments, students will use  a pulsed nitrogen laser and a digital oscilloscope to determine the  speed-of-light.  The background of our Chemistry and Physics  students, most of whom go on to graduate or professional schools,  will be greatly enhanced by the curricular modernization supported  by this project.",
