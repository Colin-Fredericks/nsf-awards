 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary group of chemistry, biology and geology  faculty at Hampshire College will use recent advances in  analytical and separation chemistry to study a varied yet  unified group of problems, centering on the chemical  analysis of natural and anthropogenic materials. Because of  its unique interdisciplinary structure and strong history of  involving students in research, Hampshire College's School  of Natural Science is in a strong position to take advantage  of new technologies for interdisciplinary research as well  as for research training.    For example, in order to track the path of trace elements  such as zinc into teeth and understand nutritional stress, a  biological anthropologist, geologist and chemist will  collaborate in chemical analysis of the degree to which  nutrient elements in dietary sources predict the  concentrations of these elements in teeth. A chemist, an  ecologist and a geologist will follow the different species  of aluminum in a local pond. The interdisciplinary focus of  research and research training at Hampshire College argue  strongly for a widely accessible, flexible chemical analysis  laboratory.    Funds are requested for purchase and update of the equipment  listed below that will enable analysis of heavy metals,  light metals, and organic compounds:    1) An Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).  Along with an existing AA, an ICP-MS will provide increased  sensitivity and multi-element capabilities in the  quantitative analysis of trace metal concentrations in  diverse biological and environmental materials.  2) A High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system,  to replace an old system, for  quantitative analysis of  biological and environmental systems for organic compounds  and for the separation of biological compounds of interest  to physiologists and ecologists.  3) A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR), to  replace older units, along with  instrumentation already  available (NMR, GC-MS) will enable  qualitative, and in some  cases quantitative, structural information for chemical  species isolated by HPLC.  4) A Flow-Injection Analyzer (FIA) will allow on-line  analysis of water-soluble compounds such as nutrients,  rapidly analyzing for multiple nutrients in numerous  samples.  5) A Gas Chromatograph/Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer  (GC/IR-MS) will aid in separation, isolation and  identification of organic compounds; the IR capability will  enable stable-isotope studies on animals in vivo.  6) Auxiliary equipment for sample preparation and data  manipulation include a microwave  digester and other sample preparation equipment and  computers to control experiments and for data analysis.    Chemical analysis is an interdisciplinary meeting ground,  central to both faculty and student research in biology and  the environment. The following project areas form one  coherent focus of research in interdisciplinary chemical  applications: 1) development of analytical techniques for  characterization of metal species (applied to problems in  aqueous environmental problems), 2) remineralization of  nutrients from the benthos of Waquoit Bay, a Land Margin  Ecosystem Research site, 3) volcanic geochemistry (magma  mixing in the origin of granitic rocks), 4) plant-insect  chemical ecology (studies of plant chemicals produced as  deterrents to insect feeding), 5) analysis of nutrient  elements in teeth in  relation to known diet and 6) nutritional biochemistry of  proteins in ruminants.    The new instruments will support faculty and undergraduate  research and research training in a variety of settings.  Students' research training will be enhanced through use of  instrumentation in advanced courses, research-type projects  in courses, and senior theses. Increased collaborative  faculty research (involving students as well) will improve  faculty productivity.",
