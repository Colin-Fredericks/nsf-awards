Honey bees have long been an important model organism for  studies of how visual features of the environment can be  used for orientation.  Worker bees move over an enormous  space, traveling up to 10 km from the nest in search of  food, using landmarks and celestial cues to find their way.  Furthermore, they do this with a very small brain.  Thus  they present an extreme version of a problem that arises on  some level for all animals: given that there are limits to  the capacity of a nervous system to store and process  information,, how can the brain be designed to produce  appropriate behavior in a complex environment?    Previous work on how bees use features of the landscape for  orientation has focused of the specific features of the  landscape that bees learn about.  In this project, the  complementary issue of how the bees' spatial memory develops  is addressed.  The research will examine what bees learn as  a consequence of their first short (less than 10 minutes)  orientation flight in a new landscape.  By studying the  homing ability of bees that have been displaced from the  hive following their first orientation flights, the  experiments will address questions about how widely and  uniformly bees learn about a landscape around the nest,  whether the landscape to be learned influences the extent of  the bees' exploration of the landscape, and what role the  sun plays in learning landmarks during the orientation  flight.  This work should pave the way for studies of the  neural mechanisms of spatial learning in bees and other  insects.  Also, to the extent that other  animals face  navigational problems parallel to those faced by honey bees,  these studies may contribute to the d evelopment of general  theories about how spatial memory is generated.",
