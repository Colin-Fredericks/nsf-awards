 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional statistics education has been criticized for not  adequately preparing statisticians and engineers for careers in  industry and for being unresponsive to the needs of industry. One  difficulty encountered in trying to address this problem is that  there has not been sufficient interaction between industrial and  academic statisticians. This faculty enhancement project provides  a forum for such interaction.    Statisticians from twenty academic departments and twenty  statisticians from industry and government are coming together for  a five-day workshop to discuss common concerns, opportunities for  collaboration, and ways in which the two groups might learn from  and support each other. At the workshop each academic statistician  is being paired with an industrial statistician for continued  collaboration. During the nine months following the workshop, each  academic statistician is making a three-day site visit to  participate in the work environment of the industrial statistician,  and each industrial statistician is making a three-day campus  visit. Each industrial/academic pair is also collaborating on the  development of a case study based on actual practice in industry.  Follow-through activities include a capstone meeting to discuss the  site visits, plans for continued collaboration, and the case  studies. The case studies and other educational materials are being  compiled and disseminated by the project.    The case study collection provides statistics educators with  interesting, real problems from industry that can be incorporated  into statistics instruction. By fostering communication and  collaboration between industrial and academic statisticians,  academic statisticians are becoming more cognizant of the concerns  and needs of industry, and academic departments can begin to  address the related curricular issues.",
