 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kalton  9500125  The principal investigator plans to study a number of fundamental   questions in the theory of unconditional structure in Banach spaces.   Among the questions to be considered is the longstanding problem of   whether a complemented subspace of a Banach space with an unconditional   basis also has an unconditional basis, and a similar problem for   complemented subspaces of Banach lattices.  The resolution of these   problems could have a profound effect on the theory of Banach spaces.   Another question to be studied is whether a Banach space in which every   closed subpsace has an unconditional basis (or just local unconditional   structure) is necessarily a Hilbert space.  A number of other problems   concerning unconditional structure are also to be investigated.    Unconditional bases are a natural framework for the study of the   decomposition of functions (or signals) into basis elements (or simpler   pure components) as in the modern theory of wavelets.  This proposal is   concerned with studying situations where such decompositions exist and   where they fail to exist.  By studying the possible unconditional bases   of a certain space or class of functions one is able to obtain important   information concerning the space.  ***",
