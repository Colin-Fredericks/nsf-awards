 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arun Yethiraj is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the   static and dynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solutions.  The   conformational properties of the polyelectrolyte molecules in dilute   solution will be investigated as a function of ionic strength.  The   predictions of the theory will first be tested against molecular   simulations for a simple model.  The theory will then be used to   investigate the conformational behavior of a chemically realistic model   for polyacrylic acid.  Simulations of two-molecule systems that   incorporate the rest of the solution via site-site solvation potentials   will be performed in order to estimate the importance of intermolecular   interactions in polyelectrolyte solutions.  These simulations will also   be used to interpret light scattering experiments on polyelectrolyte   solutions.  Finally, single chain and two-molecule Brownian dynamics   simulations will be performed in order to investigate the viscosity and   self-diffusion coefficient as a function of ionic strength.  Yethiraj's   teaching goals at the undergraduate level  include: 1) promoting in-class   discussions; 2) promoting group learning; and 3) computer aided   instruction.  In graduate level courses he will introduce computational   techniques ranging from ab initio and semi-empirical methods in quantum   chemistry to Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of classical   systems.  Polyelectrolytes are charged macromolecules.  They display a richer   variety of properties than neutral polymers, and they have a wide range   of technological uses, for example: as flocculants, dewatering agents,   demulsifiers, and drag reduction agents; as additives in detergents and   cosmetics; and in the manufacture of membranes, ion-exchange resins, gels   and modified plastics.  The behavior of polyelectrolytes, however, is far   from well understood, and there has recently been an increased interest   in obtaining a better molecular level understanding of these systems.    Yethiraj's research will help to elucidate those molecular properties   which are important in achieving desired materials properties for   polyelectrolyte systems.",
