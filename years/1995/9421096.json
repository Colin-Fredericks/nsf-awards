 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421096  Warren  This project is the continuation of an integrated study of the  optical and physical properties of the antarctic snow surface.  It  has several components which concern the processes by which global  climatic variability is imprinted into the proxy data recorded in  the antarctic ice.   It is based on a very successful  three-year  field effort during which the principal investigator acquired a  substantial body of data, including the effect of surface roughness  (sastrugi orientation) on the angular distribution of reflected  sunlight, the spectral distribution of thermal infrared radiation,  the mechanism of dry deposition of atmospheric sulfates in the snow  surface, and the isotopic composition of hoarfrost.    The primary emphasis will be on the production of a climatology of  the long-wave and short-wave radiation budget at the surface, to  include the contributions of carbon dioxide, ozone, water vapor,  clouds, and atmospheric ice crystals.  Radiative transfer models  will be tested under both clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions, and  a monthly climatology of spectral and total long-wave cloud  radiative forcing at the surface will be determined.  These results  will feed into global programs studying the Earth's radiation  budget, providing  the coldest and driest surface end member  conditions.    In addition, interface temperature profiles will be analyzed for  differing mechanisms of heat transfer in snow, and sulfate aerosol  measurements will be studied to assess the contribution of wind  pumping to the deposition of trace elements in the snow.  ***",
