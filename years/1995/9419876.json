 "awd_abstract_narration": "Underpinning much of the current research in plant molecular  biology is the ability to routinely sequence genes of  biological and economic interest.  These genes are being  cloned as genomic and cDNA fragment from higher plant  species, as well as from the many microbes that act as plant  symbionts and pathogens.  The ability to isolate Arabidopsis  mutants and sequence the genes underlying specific altered  phenotypes has introduced a powerful new means of  deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which plants grow  and develop.  Unfortunately, much of the actual research  time spent by graduate students and postdoctoral associates  in plant molecular biology laboratories is occupied with the  rote, laborious procedure by which DNA sequencing `ladders'  are electrophoretically separated, detected and analyzed.  We estimate that at least 30% of their time is occupied with  this procedure, which takes time away from the more critical  and intellecutually demanding design of biological  experiments.    The purpose of this proposal is to obtain federal matching  funds to purchase an automated DNA sequencer.  This machine  will be supervised by Prof. Sussman and operated in his  laboratory by a full-time technician with salary provided by  state of Wisconsin funds.  These automated, fluorescent-  based sequencers are widely used in genome sequencing  projects, and have been shown to be a cost-effective means  of saving time and labor.  In addition to time savings,  other advantages of the automated technique include the  absence of radioactive nuclides and a decreased financial  burden associated with their safety and disposal.    Major users of this equipment include 8 faculty with  federally funded basic research program s in the area of  plant molecular biology.  The laboratories of these faculty  are in close physical proximity but are administered through  5 different academic departments (Departments of  Horticulture, Agronomy, Biochemistry and Plant Pathology in  the College of Agricultural  and Life Sciences; Department of  Botany in the College of Letters and Science).  Minor users  include several newly hired `applied' geneticists with  active research programs using recombinant DNA techniques  for more efficient breeding of improved crop plants.",
