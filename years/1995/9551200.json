 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like many other professions, landscape architecture and  horticulture require a great amount of attribute collection, data  inventory, analysis, and design.   In the past few years, major  emphasis has been placed on the integration of computer aided  design (CAD) and geographic information system (GIS) into the  university's undergraduate teaching curriculum.   Our students  are able to use these technological advances to build site  inventories and implement their design solutions.   Four  innovative experiments in the university's undergraduate basic  curriculum are investigating the real-time experience of  gathering information on-site and collaborating site data with  hands-on experience in computer software.   Global positioning  system (GPS) satellites provide digital coordinates and elevation  information for any location on the earth.   Along with a  data-logger, this system is an efficient tool for data collection  and data input in the field.    Students perform on-site design  scenario presentations to clients.   The university's landscape  architecture and horticulture program is utilizing GPS technology  in conjunction with GIS and CAD in undergraduate teaching.   This  project is also improving the current practice of teaching by  introducing an innovative mobile lab concept with on-site data  collection, terrain model construction, design emulation, and  client communication.",
