 "awd_abstract_narration": "African American, American Indian, and Latino students are severely  underrepresentated in the Los Angeles Unified School District's  (LAUSD) advanced math and science sequence.  Of the approximately  640,000 minority student who start out in the educational pipeline,  1% transition to calculus, and fewer than 3% take physics.  Of  those who complete these courses, few students meet scholastic  standards for admission to an engineering or science major in the  University of California system.    The UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Science and the LAUSD  Urban Systemic Initiative will implement a six-week summer and 12-  week academic year, commuter and Summer Science Camp for 40 African  American, American Indian, and Latino students in eight and ninth  grade.  Our major goal is to increase students' access to  educational experiences that: 1) set high expectations; 2) enhance  competence in advance math and science; 3) provide a instructional  approach that unifies the learning of math, science, and  technology; and 4) promote aspirations for professions in technical  careers.  Proposed activities include:    Math Connections:  A math curriculum emphasizing the  interrelationship algebra, geometry, and technology through group  discussions, computer exercises, and collaborative problem-solving  workshops.    Science Project:  Rocketry and Sea Vessels.  Two projects will form  the thematic focus to introduce the scientific process and explore  applications in team-oriented physics, math and related careers.   Each project will involve students in physics demonstrations,  interactive hands-on laboratory activities, field excursions to  industrial sites, and lectures from quest speaker and specialists  in various fields.    Career Explorations and Parent Involvement:  Major features:   Educational planning sessions, career fair, college day,  mentorships, role model quests speakers, and five family day  events.    Follow-up:  Support from the Information Technology Division of the  LAUSD wi ll ensure long-range tracking through the first year of  college.  Academic year Saturday Academies will reinforcement and  feedback on student course enrollment and performance.  ***",
