 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Edwin L. Sibert at the Department of Chemistry, the University   of Wisconsin at Madison, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for the theoretical analysis of   vibration/rotation dynamics of polyatomic molecules in the gas phase. The   quantum mechanical studies which Prof. Sibert is undertaking are in three   areas. The first area focuses on highly excited states where assignment   of states is difficult due to a high degree of mixing of different   rotational and vibrational levels. The problems due to this mixing are   avoided by investigation of properties of ensembles rather than the study   of individual states. The other two projects are devoted to describing   spectroscopy and dynamics at transition states of chemical reactions.   The research which is being carried out under this grant is valuable for   the interpretation and assignment of molecular spectra. Further, the   understanding that is being given by the research on the behavior near   transition states of reactions is essential to obtain reaction rates and   to accurately predict the distributions of reaction products.",
