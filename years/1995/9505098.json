As the continuum   hypothesis seems far from the basic properties of Lebesgue integral, these   principles seem far away from mathematical practice.  However, as in the   case of the continuum hypothesis, they affect the standard objects of modern   mathematics.  Set-theorists are developing a network of infinitary   combinatorial principles that provide answers to otherwise unsolvable   problems.  Some of these principles involve the existence of two-cardinal   combinatorial objects (e.g., morasses, or families of sets whose existence   is equivalent to the existence of morasses); these objects may be viewed as   generalizations of cardinals.  Although constructions which employ these   structures are usually more complicated than constructions by the usual   transfinite induction, they may be necessary in more complicated   situations.  The first objective of the project is to extend and develop   new canonical methods of applying Velleman's simplified morasses for   constructing structures in Boolean algebras, topology and other fields.  A   second objective is to develop new methods of constructing forcing  notions using two-cardinal combinatorial principles.  These forcing notions   are used directly for proving undecidability.  If the new combinatorial   methods are applied to forcing theory, this may result in a series of new   consistency results in pure set theory as well as in its applications.  The   third objective is to introduce relatively manageable principles equivalent   to higher gap morasses and develop methods of applying them to the theory   of Boolean algebras, topology and other fields.  Koszmider has selected   well-known open problems from various fields as test cases, conjecturing   that some of these can be solved using the above new methods.        Mathematics is the language of science.  Scientific problems are  translated into formal, precise and abstract mathematical problems.   Mathematical machinery provides solutions to these problems and gives   blueprints (known as theorems) that provide conclusions to given   assumptions.  Proving theorems is what mathematics is all about; theorems   directly or indirectly affect the way we formulate and solve scientific   problems.  Is proving theorems a perfect method?  No!  In 1930, Godel showed   that in any reasonable system of mathematics there will be conjectures which   will never be decided and probems that will never be solved, unless we add   new axioms in the foundations of mathematics.  Are these unsolvable problems   only artificial logical constructions?  No!  In 1964, Paul Cohen invented  the method of forcing, which since then has been used for demonstating   unsolvability of many problems of mainstream mathematics.  We need to know   what problems are unsolvable and what extra assumptions in the foundations   of mathematics (new axioms) make them solvable.  Based on his work in the   field and on partial research, Koszmider conjectures that certain   combinatorial principles will provide a new method for demonstrating   unsolvability of a large collection of important problems.  These principles   could thus serve as extra axioms.  These problems arise in various parts of   mathematics, such as infinitary combilatorics, Boolean algebra, and   topology.  Koszmider plans to formalize this underlying theme and to prove   its relation to classical principles in order to use them efficiently.  ***",
