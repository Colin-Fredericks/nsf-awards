One important objective of the proposed program is to understand the underlying mechanisms necessary to increase the number of women pursuing advanced degrees in engineering and qualifying for academic and research careers.  In brief, this program is divided into three parts.  The main focus of the program will provide 10 full fellowships each summer for three years for engineering students.  The program will pay each students a stipend plus housing costs.  Furthermore, we will guarantee at least 80% participation by women in this program.  In addition, we will pursue a second focus devoted to creating guidelines for faculty and principal investigators which will explain how to effectively conduct an undergraduate research program and interact with undergraduate students.  A brochure for students that answers some of their commonly held questions about graduate school and research careers will also be developed and widely distributed.  Additionally, two surveys - one for participating faculty and the other for participating students - will be developed as a means for evaluating our program.  In summary, not only will we supervise students, but we will also develop brochures, guidelines, and surveys that we believe will be broadly useful to interested faculty and students.  ***",
