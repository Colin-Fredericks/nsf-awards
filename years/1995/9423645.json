 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423645  Rajan         There is very little scientific evidence on how the  different financial systems of foreign countries affect the  financing choices of firms, and even less evidence on how these  choices affect industrial competitiveness.  This project attempts  to shed some light on how firms obtain financing in other systems  in order to improve our understanding of the effects of financial  choices on industrial competitiveness.          The first part of the project establishes the broad stylized  facts on financing and dividend decisions in a sample of large  industrialized countries characterized by different institutional  environments.  More specifically, the project explores the level  and the determinants of corporate leverage across countries, both  at the aggregate and firm specific level; analyzes the  determinants of the maturity structure of debt across countries;  analyzes the dividend policy in different countries; and studies  the determinants of inter-firm trade credit and how it varies  across the business cycle.  The second part of the project tests  different theories of corporate financing decision.  Myers'  Pecking Order Theory and Jensen's Free Cash Flow Theory are  tested using the dynamic aspects of financing choices.  A  theoretical framework is developed to identify demand and supply  of debt versus equity and used to analyze separately the effects  of different financial institutions and regulation on the supply  of, and the demand for, different financing instruments.   Finally, this project analyzes the social costs and benefits  under different bankruptcy codes and institutional settings by  studying the response of firms to financial distress in different  countries.",
