 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor  Gregory Gellene of the Chemistry Department of Texas Tech University will pursue  investigations on the symmetry- induced kinetic isotope effect, a new mechanism in  ion-molcule reactions.  Symmetry correlations between reactants and the interaction region  of the potential energy surface, based on nuclear conformations and isotopc substitutions,  have been fruitful in revealing new effects in chemical   reactions.  This research attempts  to provide answers to questions such as can the likelihood of a chemical reaction be  affected by the symmetry of the nuclear motions of the reactants, and how is the  macroscopic rate of a reaction modified by altering the symmetry of a system through  isotopic substitution.  The symmetry-induced kinetic isotope effect is a sofar little  recognized effect in physical chemistry.  The work done by Professor Gellene has  demonstrated that this effect is not only real, but can be quite large.    This effect appears  to play a significant role in the ozone chemistry of the earth's atmosphere, as well as in  laboratory situations.  This research will explore further this effect with the aim to bring  about an   improved model for chemical reaction theory.",
