Use of a US Navy  nuclear submarine for civilian (unclassified) scientific research in the Arctic Ocean has  been made possible through a Memorandum of Understanding between the US Navy,  the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, the US Geological  Survey, and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  The general  concept of using a submarine platform for marine geophysical work is intriguing and  there is clearly enough potential to warrant serious consideration.  The first step in  consideration of a possible cruise dedicated to geophysics is to determine the sort of  geophysical work that is achievable from a submarine and if the specific scientific  problems that might be addressed are important enough to encourage the research  community to submit proposals for consideration by the Foundation.  Essentially, the  potential role of a nuclear submarine in Arctic Ocean geophysical investigations must be  determined.  This workshop will address this issue and provide their recommendations to  the Foundation.",
