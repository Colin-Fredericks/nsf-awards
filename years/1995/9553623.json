These students will be  recruited from underrepresented  groups and populations with unusual  academic backgrounds. They will be  supported in their efforts to  pursue individualized,  multidisciplinary, and  collaborative thesis research  projects through the provision of  brad-minded faculty advisors,  theoretical and empirical training,  and the mathematical, statistical,  and analytical tools they need to  investigate a wide array of basic  and applied environmental problems.  These students will augment the  existing pool of graduate students  at UNM, many of who were drawn to  UNM because of its strong research  programs in population and  community ecology, landscape and  ecosystem ecology, biogeography,  evolution, systematics, and  behavior or due to the  opportunities provided by UNM's NSF-  LTER program (Sevilleta station)  and multidisciplinary training  opportunities among biologists and:  a) computer scientists at UNM who  are developing state-of-the-art  software for simulation modeling,  image analysis, and signal  processing, and  b) natural, social, and computer  scientists at the Santa Fe  Institute who are studying complex  systems.",
