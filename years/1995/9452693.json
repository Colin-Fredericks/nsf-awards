The program will emphasize advanced technology, design, applications.  In addition to several other applications, Computer Aided Design (CAD) projects will integrate various components of technology and its uses.  Evening seminars will be concerned with: ethics and other topics concerning technology and the citizen.  There will be field trips to major industrial locations where advanced technology is used, as well as recreation and reading during the weekends and evenings.  Students who exhibit a high potential for careers as technicians will be recruited nationally for the program.   ***",
