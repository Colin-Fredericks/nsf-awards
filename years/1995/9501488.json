 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  This study will examine the conditions under which welfare recipients are able to make the transition into the job market.  Theories examined include those relating to human capital, network links, and individual attitudes about the self.  A carefully selected sample of 50 AFDC recipients will be interviewed to learn which characteristics are most likely to lead to successful job transitions.  Additional information will be obtained from interviews with potential employers.  %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of urban poverty, welfare policies, and the pathways to employment.  The focus of this research on welfare and the transition to work makes it valuable for policy makers concerned with encouraging employment. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
