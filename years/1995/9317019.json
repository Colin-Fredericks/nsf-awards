 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317019  Day  The presence of well-documented stratospheric \"ozone hole\" events  and enhanced ultraviolet-B radiation levels in Antarctica provide  a unique opportunity to assess the effects of ultraviolet-B  radiation on plant performance.  There are several reasons to  expect the ultraviolet-B radiation may be a significant, and  increasingly important limitation to the performance of Antarctic  vascular plants:  Levels of terrestrial ultraviolet-B radiation  in Antarctica have increased considerably in recent years, and  are likely to continue increasing, particularly in austral  spring; Recent research on marine phytoplankton in Antarctic  waters has found that enhanced ultraviolet-B radiation levels  associated with ozone hole events are responsible for significant  reductions in phytoplankton productivity; Research on vascular  plants in other regions has shown that supplemental ultraviolet-B   radiation levels can limit the performance of many plant species;  and Recent investigations have show that the leaves of many  grasses and forbs from other regions are particularly ineffective  at screening ultraviolet-B radiation before it reaches  potentially-sensitive mesophyll tissue in the leaf interior.   Thus, one would suspect that the grass Deschampsia antarctica and  the forb Colobanthus quitensis, which are the only two vascular  plants native to Antarctica, are likely to be relatively  ineffective at screening ultraviolet-B radiation.  Surprisingly,  apparently no research has addressed the impacts of ultraviolet-B  radiation on Antarctic vascular plants.    The proposed research attempts to answer the question of whether  ultraviolet-B, particularly ultraviolet-B radiation associated  with ozone hole events, affects photosynthesis, growth, and  reproductive performance of D. antarctica and C. quitensis.  The  relative magnitude of this limitation will be assessed by using  experimental field treatments to compare ultraviolet-B radiation  to other potential limitations.  Selective filte rs will be used  to remove UV components from sunlight over naturally-growing  plants, while additional water or nutrients will be supplied to  other plants.  These field experiments will be complemented with  more detailed investigations using supplemental ultraviolet-B  radiation treatments in West Virginia.  Recently developed  techniques such as fiber-optic microprobes will be used to  examine the UV/visible optical properties of leaves and  reproductive structures in D. antarctica and C. quitensis, and  assess how these change in response to enhanced ultraviolet-B  radiation levels.  This approach will elucidate some of the  underlying mechanisms responsible for Antarctic plant responses  to ultraviolet-B radiation in the field.",
