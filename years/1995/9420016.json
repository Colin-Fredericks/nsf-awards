 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420016  Clouse  Brassinosteroids (BRS) are widely occurring plant compounds  with structural similarity to animal steroid hormones.  BRS  have numerous physiological effects, including enhanced cell  elongation, but little is known about the mechanism of  action of these plant growth regulators.  An integrative  approach was used to investigate a number of physiological  and molecular parameters associated with BR-promoted  elongation of stem tissue.  From a cDNA library of BR-  treated soybean (Glycine max L) epicotyl mRNA, a gene (BRU1)  was cloned which is regulated primarily by BRS within two  hours of treatment.  The BRU1 transcript levels are not  increased by micromolar concentrations of auxins,  cytokinins, ABA or BA3, and BRU1 expression is highest in  stem tissue.  BRS caused a marked increase in Instron-  measured plastic extensibility, suggesting that they may  promote elongation in part by altering mechanical properties  of the cell wall (wall loosening).  The kinetics of wall-  loosening closely followed the increase in BRU1 expresssion.  This suggests a possible role for the BRU1 protein in BR-  stimulated elongation.  The objective of this project is to  test this hypothesis and to further examine the regulation  of gene expression by plant steroids.    Despite the obvious growth-promoting effects of BRS on  plants and its demonstrated interactions with other growth  regulators, little is known about the molecular mechanisms  of BRS action.  Understanding BR activity has great  potential importance in basic developmental biology and  practical agriculture.  The precise biochemical mechanisms  of wall loosening during elongation remain elusive.  The  completion of the proposed experiments may increase our  knowledge of the molecular events controlling stem  elongation.  The proposed studies on BRS-regulated increases  in BRU1 mRNA levels should add to our knowledge of  posttranscriptional mechanisms and will, in fact, be the  first detailed study of the mechanisms of gene regulat ion by  plant steroids.  The analysis of BRU1, and other BRS-  regulated genes may also have future impact on development  of transgenic crop plants with altered growth properties.",
