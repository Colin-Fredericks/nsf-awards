 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of DNA Analysis Instrumentation for Molecular Studies         Our goal is to establish a common core facility for DNA sequence  analysis. We propose to purchase:  an Automated DNA Sequencer; a molecular biology CATALYST Labstation; an  Oligo Synthesizer; a PhosphorImager workstation; a Fluorimager; a  Computer System; a Biomek II robot; a Thermocycler: an Automated Film  Developer: a Vacuum Centrifuge: a Photodocumentation Station; and two  Ultra Cold Freezers (-80 and -30).          The participating faculty address a wide range of research  related to biodiversity and biotechnology. Their efforts share a common  theme of DNA sequence analysis and fall into two major areas: 1)  Molecular genetic approaches to study gene expression, RNA processing,  and molecular phylogeny, and 2) Molecular approaches in the study of  Population Genetics, Ecology, and Evolution. In the area of Molecular  genetic approaches to study gene expression. RNA processing. and  molecular phylogeny, faculty research and research training include:  Whalen's molecular genetic analyses of interactions between bacterial  pathogens and plants; Marquez-Magana's investigations of the molecular  mechanisms that regulate flagellin gene expression in Bacillus  subtilis; and Davis's functional significance and regulation of spliced  leader RNA trans-splicing in metazoa, the evolution of parasitism in  flatworms, and the molecular phylogeny of flatworms and early metazoa.  The focus of Ramirez' s research is to clone the RECI gene and further  characterize the RPD3 (a.k.a. REC3) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  which are implicated in the repair of damaged DNA and in mitotic  recombination. Goldman focuses on a structural unit of the eukaryotic  chromosome, the chromatin domain or loop, and its potential role as a  functional unit in the regulation of gene expression in mammalian X-  chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. Perara investigates  molecular approaches to the problem of protein transport across  cell ular membranes, with the primary focus on a systematic comparison  of the molecular mechanisms of secretory protein transport across the  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and the bacterial periplasmic  membrane. In the area of Molecular approaches in the study of  Population Genetics. Ecology and Evolution, faculty research and  research training include: Parker/Cullings' studies of plant community  and evolutionary ecology, dynamics of plant recruitment, life history  evolution and community turnover rates; Smith/Bayliss' investigations  of evolutionary ecology and conservation biology with research focus on  the role of transition zones between rain forest and savannah in  speciation and their role as related to conservation of rain forest  species; Arp's studies of physiological adaptation to environment,  sulfide tolerance and detoxification in mudflat invertebrates, ecology  and physiology of hydrothermal vent organisms; Randall's investigations  of evolution of communication and social organization in desert  rodents; and Rmutman' s use of modem molecular genetics to examine  population structure, biogeography and intraspecific phylogeny, and the  genetic architecture of complex phenotypes. Larson's research is in  population biology of nearshore teleost fishes, including their  behavior, feeding ecology, life histories, and population structure.  Desjardin focuses on taxonomy and phylogeny of fleshy fungi, primarily  Agaricales, using traditional and modern aspects of systematics,  including cladistic and morphometric analysis, utilizing morphological,  ecological, physiological, genetic and molecular data. Hollibaugh  addresses physiological ecology of bacterial communities in geochemical  cycles and foodwebs. Orrego employs the techniques of molecular  genetics for the study of genetic variation in natural populations as  displayed by sequences obtained via long distance PCR methods.              Our proposed instrumentation will increase the amount and  efficiency of our research an d training efforts and enable us to train  a greater number of students. The requested equipment will provide the  highest resolution available for the analysis of DNA/RNA using PCR  amplification, DNA sequencing, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis  (DGGE), Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP), and a variety  of other DNA/RNA detection and analytical methods. With the increased  throughput capacity for large numbers of samples that can be processed  rapidly and efficiently with longer sequence reading (>700 bp), we will  be able to do new high resolution analysis on much greater numbers of  samples more rapidly than in the past. For example, the ABI 377  Sequencer provides new longer gel formats that allow one to read 700  bases/run and 36 lanes/run that can be completed in 8 hour (or  overnight) runs and 300-500 bp runs in 2.25 hours, allowing 3 runs in  an eight hour period. Several faculty (Davis, Hollibaugh, and Parker)  will collectively sequence in excess of 10,000 samples/year which  represents one run of 36 samples each day for a year. While this alone  clearly justifies our need, the acquisition of the proposed  instrumentation would also allow us the capacity to triple this number.  We will also use the equipment for faculty enhancement short courses;  since 1991 we have presented 10 such courses-to over 240 faculty from  35 states.",
