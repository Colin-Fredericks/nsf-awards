 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550129  Hug    For more than 50 years, Ohio has had a program of environmental  education and the Ohio Department of Education has had a staff  member assigned to this program.  In 1994, the State adopted a  competency-based science education program and in 1995 they will  publish instructional objectives for social studies that will allow  for school curriculum development committees to design  interdisciplinary Global Chang Education curriculum.  Selected  science and social studies objectives can be achieved  simultaneously.  Global change topics that can be included in the  curriculum include decline of songbird populations in Central and  North America, destruction of rainforests, pressure on natural  resources of population growth, destructive effects of acid rain,  the consequences of desertification or desertization, depletion of  upper atmospheric ozone, among others.    By means of this planning grant, they will address the need for a  systematic, comprehensive implementation of these global issues as  they relate to and accomplish the instructional objectives of  science in the elementary and secondary curricula.  The goals of  the planning project are to 1) carry out an awareness program to  spread the information about this effort to elementary and  secondary school educators, 2) to compile a status report of Global  Change Education activities which currently exist in Ohio, 3) to  develop a Global Change Education Model that will become one of ten  educational reform models that are available to individual schools  as the basis for their Venture Capital program (this is a special  instate program from which school can receive up to $25,000 for  five years to institutionalize reform programs), and 4) to file a  final report to NSF which will also serve as the guide to  implementing the Global Change Education Model.    Cost sharing is 52% and comes from in-kind contributions made by  the Ohio Department of Education.",
