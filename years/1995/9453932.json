The three-year project targets directly 160 teachers and administrators representing 15 Missouri school districts.  In Year 1, 60 middle school teachers/administrators in teams and four regional associates explore the four curricula through a one-week summer institute that emphasizes the vision of the NCTM Standards; four three-day conferences, where each conference emphasizes one of the curricular projects and is led by representatives of that project; and implementation of at least one unit of study from each of the four curricula by each middle school teacher.  In Year 2, 100 additional \"colleague\" teachers from the 15 school districts join the summer institute.  The expanded teams receive training on the specific curriculum chosen by their faculty to be used in their school.   In Year 3, the project focuses on dissemination conferences and implementation of the new curricula.      Evaluation of project activities includes monitoring the professional growth of teachers/administrators as they interact with peers and staff via project meetings and electronic communications, and the impact of the new curricula on teacher views of mathematics at the middle school level.  Cost-sharing from the University of Missouri and from partner school districts represents 59% of the NSF award amount.",
