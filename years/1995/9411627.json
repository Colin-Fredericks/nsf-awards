 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411672         The central issues in the study of language involve the  relationship between language and nonlinguistic cognition.  Accordingly, the aim of the project is to determine the kinds of  conceptual and linguistic information that are called on to  create grammatical agreement, and to explain their interplay in  ongoing speech. Two general agreement relations will be explored.  The first is number agreement between subjects and verbs,  extending work carried out during the previous grant period. The  second is agreement between subjects and pronouns, specifically  reflexive pronouns and tag pronouns. Previous research focused on  three questions about the production of subject-verb number  agreement in English: (1) the nature of the verb's agreement  controllers, whether linguistic or pragmatic; (2) the nature of  the number information that is used in agreement, whether  grammatical or conceptual; and (3) the principal locus of  agreement implementation, whether created over grammatical  relations or across surface strings. The empirically derived  answers to these questions indicate that the verb's agreement  controllers can be linguistic rather than pragmatic, that the  number used during agreement implementation is grammatical, and  that the implementation is driven from a grammatical level, with  little influence either from conceptual features of the message  or from the phonological features of inflectional morphemes.       The new  research extends these results in three directions.  All three have to do with the cognitive context of agreement. The  goal is to better illuminate the transition from conceptual to  linguistic features, including the mechanisms that implement the  concrete details of agreement. The experiments examine (a)  whether the number and gender features that are called on in  subject-verb agreement are the same as the number and gender  features called on in pronominal agreement; (b) whether the  features that are responsible for agreement errors are the s ame  features that control canonical agreement; and (c) how speakers  create agreement-inflected word forms. In addition to these three  main themes, studies are proposed to extend the work  crosslinguistically, going beyond the minimal agreement system of  English. All of the investigations draw simultaneously from  controlled experimental methods for eliciting utterances and from  observations of agreement patterns in everyday speech. In these  ways, the research systematically enhances our understanding of a  cardinal facet of human communication, the production of  language. The emphasis on normal production and the role of  syntax in it makes the ongoing research program unique in  psycholinguistics.",
