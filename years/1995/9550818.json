 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the environmental problems facing the world today involve  inorganic contaminants (heavy metals, acid rain, acid mine  drainage, agricultural pollutants).   Undergraduate instruction  in environmental science must provide a means for investigating  these problems.   The use of an automated ion analyzer in  environmental laboratory courses and in student research projects  enables students to pursue questions that they were unable to  investigate with previous analytical techniques.   The LACHAT  flow injection automated ion analyzer has the capability to  analyze samples from different media for both cations and anions,  and is expandable to meet the needs of student research  interests.   The equipment is widely used in the private and  public sectors and provides students with important training on  equipment they will likely encounter upon graduation.   In  addition, the quantity and quality of student research projects  is improving, with timely studies of environmental problems  appropriate to the college setting in Pennsylvania.   The  students have access to agriculturally and industrially impacted  streams, lakes receiving acidic deposition and excess nutrient  loading, and acidic mine drainage sites.   The increase in  research opportunities for students can help them in their  postgraduation plans, whether they be in environmentally related  employment, or in graduate programs.",
