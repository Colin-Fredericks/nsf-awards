 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, will  examine and test a first-principles approach for determining the  relative depths of objects in images using only knowledge about the  medium and the intensities acquired in a single view.  Most methods  for inferring depth (or range) in computer vision have depended on  the use of multiple cameras and normally require the identification  of corresponding points in the resulting images. Alternatively,  rangefinder methods depend on sharpness-of-focus measures that  require calibrated-focus lenses and an unambiguous definition of  focus.  The planned approach is based on the physics of light  transmission and attenuation in a translucent diffuse medium.   These investigators have shown, in theory and with a small set of  experiments (in simulated biological tissue), that it is  straightforward to infer the relative depths of structures when  they are embedded in such a medium.  This work is particularly  exploratory because the original results arose as a byproduct of  other research and so the extent of its applicability in a more  general setting is not known.  Two of the questions to be probed  are: what are the limitations (e.g., minimum detectable depth  difference) and sensitivities (to assumptions, and to changes in  parameters) of the model; and what is the effect of the size and  shape of the object on determination of its relative depth.  The  research is aimed at the development of a capability to identify  unambiguously the relative depths of structures in an image, and  thus to prevent confusion about which structures overlie which  others. Because a single view is sufficient, it will be possible to  make this identification retrospectively, as long as the properties  of the medium are known.  This should be useful in evaluating  images arising, for example, in underwater, biological, and  atmospheric applications, as well as in more-turbid environments.",
