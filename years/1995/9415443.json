 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key problem in programming languages is the design and  implementation of a balance between static (compile-time) and  dynamic  (run-time) phases of computation.  A good balance allows  the generation of good  code without an undue burden on  programmers or compilers.  Finding this balance  relies critically  on intuition and experimentation, but these methods are not  enough by themselves.  As type systems and optimizing  transformations have  become more sophisticated, it has become  essential to provide rigorous means to  express static/dynamic  relationships at suitable levels of abstraction.  Programmers and  compiler writers rely on these relationships, so a precise but  approachable description of them is important.  Using intuition  and  experimentation alone may allow errors or valuable  opportunities for  generalization to go unnoticed.    The goal of this project is to develop and  apply techniques for  rigorously expressing and proving the relationships  between  static and dynamic semantics of programming languages.  Primary  objectives include (i) finding ways to specify meanings at levels  of  abstraction suitable for reasoning about sharing, copying, and  liveness; (ii)  developing ways to represent and manipulate  semantic specifications in a formal  manner; (iii) aiding the  development of new interface definition languages by  formulating  techniques for describing the properties that compatibility of  modules guarantees for systems that integrate them.",
