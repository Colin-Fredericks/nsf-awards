The phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosyl residues is know to be essential in the control of fundamental cellular processes including growth and proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeletal function and the cell cycle.  There is currently activity in characterizing the structure, regulation and function of both protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases, which govern by their coordination the levels of cellular phosotyrosine.  The objective of this meeting is to provide a format to integrate the study of these tyrosine kinases and phosphatases to see how they contribute to the biological systems.  The sessions will be based on physiological processes and cellular functions rather than categories of enzymes, to provide a biological context.  With the exception of the keynote address, all speakers will be selected from submitted abstracts.  This will allow emphasis to be placed on encouraging graduate students,  postdocts and young independent investigators to present the talks .  This will also facilitate the presentation of the most recent results. %%%  Meetings like this are important for encouraging interaction among scientists working in similar or related fields.  A meeting like this also provides opportunity for young scientists to present their work and also to meet others in the field. ***                         ;                                     Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9419619                             Una Solomon                         Una Solomon                 @     WAt                           @                                   @     WAt                                                                                                   @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                               ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e 3       e                   #                                                           j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       m   1                                                                                                   /               O           T       1   m                       j                                                                         m               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           g                                                                                                 9419619 Tonks This is s request for support of a conference on Tyrosine Phosphorylation and cell Signalling.
