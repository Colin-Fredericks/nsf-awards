Its primary goal will be to study almost periodical  phenomena and complicated dynamics arising in ordinary and parabolic  type of differential equations.  Particular attention shall be given  to problems of perturbation of invariant tori, quasi-periodic  bifurcations, dynamics of almost periodical parabolic equations such  as asymptotical behavior of solutions, structure of invariant sets  and existence of a global attractor, etc.  Techniques from  topological dynamics and nonlinear analysis as well as those found by  the PI in his previous works shall be employed to the current  studies.  %%%  This project is focused on problems in dynamical systems originating  in science and engineering problems.
