 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Mark Berg   of the University of South Carolina will study the interactions   responsible for solvent induced processes observed in solution phase   chemistry.  The polarized transient holeburning technique will be used to   study solvent interactions with electronic states, and coherent Raman   spectroscopies will be used to determine solvent interactions with   vibrational states.  Studies will be conducted as a function of    temperature to span the region from solid to liquid phase across the   glass transition to distinguish between phonon-induced and structural   solvation dynamics.  Systems to be studied include anthracenes and   tetrazines in a set of quasi-spherical solvent molecules.  The theory   necessary to explain and interpret the experimental results will also be   developed or expanded.    Much of chemistry takes place in the liquid phase.  However, because of   the interactions between solvent molecules, it is often difficult to   determine the processes responsible for chemical reactions.  Professor   Berg will apply sophisticated laser techniques to differentiate various   forms of these interactions and their effects on the internal states of   molecules.  Such studies will be of value in the design of new optical   materials.",
