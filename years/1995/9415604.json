The  specific applications include data analysis for flow near a  boundary, simplified models of energy dissipation in highly  turbulent flow, some instabilities of the motion on the  surface of liquids, and the motion of shaken sand.  This  theoretical project is co-funded by the Divisions of  Materials  Research and Physics.  %%%  This theoretical project involves both research and  teaching.  Under research, we study the separation of drops  from a mass of fluid, turbulent flow, and the motion of  granular materials.  Under teaching, we train graduate  students and postdoctorals to do research on the motion of  fluids and also develop new course material, for example,  for an undergraduate course on the subject of chaos.  This  project is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research  and Physics.  ***",
