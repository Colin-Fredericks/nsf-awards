A variety of  approaches have been used to address this important problem.  These different approaches, or levels of analysis, have led to  four different, albeit complementary, explanations for its  existence.  The four categories are:  (1) functional consequences  or selective advantages, (2) proximate mechanisms or  physiological requirements, (3) ontogeny of parental care  behaviors, or (4) phylogenetic origin and historical patterns.  Dr. Maddison and his graduate student, Mr. Burt will examine the  relative roles of phylogenetic and contemporary ecological  factors on the evolution of cooperative behavior by studying  several different species within the same family of birds.  These  birds are an excellent choice for an historical analysis given  the availability of a group of 26 different species and the  diversity of their social systems.  To accomplish their goals,  they will first collect behavioral data from a field site in  Kenya and then carry out a molecular analyses of the DNA.  These  results will be used for the phylogenetic reconstruction  algorithms to estimate the evolutionary relationships among the  species.  This multi-faceted project bridges the disciplines of  morphological and molecular systematics, evolutionary ecology,  and ethology. The outcome of the studies will provide the  framework for deciphering the existence of altruistic social  systems.",
