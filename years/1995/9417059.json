 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417059  Wapner    This award supports the participation of twelve U.S. scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Optimizing Relationships Between  Environment and Behavior, to be held at Clark University in  Worcester, Massachusetts from August 8-9, 1995.  The co-organizers  are Dr. Seymour Wapner of Clark University and Professor Takashi  Takahashi of the University of Tokyo. The main purposes of this  seminar are to advance cross-cultural collaboration and to provide  new opportunities to plan future research that will serve to optimize  environment-behavior relationships in the 21st century.  Topics to be  discussed include: environment-behavior relations for the 21st  century; general processes in environment-behavior relations;  environment-behavior relations in the city, in families, and in aging.    This meeting is the fourth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field held over a period of 15 years.  Although a core of individuals  has provided continuity from meeting to meeting, participants in the  seminars have changed through the years to reflect an appropriate  pairing between U.S. and Japanese participants and the progress of the  research.  The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of  expertise and geographical representation in the general area of  environmental psychology, and were selected on the basis of being  the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
