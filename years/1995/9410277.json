Resembling variability in North Pole temperature when  data are stratified according to the phase of the QBO, the polar-  tropical correlation suggests a physical connection to interannual  variability of solar activity.    Signatures of interannual variability in actual records of  stratospheric behavior will be studied to establish the physical  significance of interdecadal signatures and their relationship  to  solar activity.  The same investigation will be performed on  monthly-mean records of temperature and motion.  The sampling will  then be systematically degraded and stratified according to the  phase of the QBO to determine how much of the interdecadal  signatures in polar temperature and in correlation with the tropics  follows from actual solar variability and how much follows from  aliasing by the QBO.    Preliminary analysis indicates that biennial variability, which is  also present in the polar stratosphere, figures importantly in  producing the interdecadal variation of tropical-polar correlation.   As large as quasi-biennial variability in the polar stratosphere,  biennial variability represents an important component of  interannual variability and therefore is important in its own  right.  Biennial variations will be diagnosed first in the  stratosphere in global records of temperature and motion.  Once  understood in the circulation, the biennial variation will be  examined in ozone.  Biennial variability will then be traced back  to the troposphere, where it will be diagnosed in analyses of  motion and cloud cover.  This investigation will be explored in the  zon al-mean properties.   Eventually, biennial variability will be  explored in the zonally-asymmetric wave field, which in the  Eliassen-Palm flux, will be diagnosed as an agent for communicating  biennial variations from tropical convection in the troposphere to  the extratropical stratosphere.    This research is important because it seeks to add knowledge about  a controversial topic in sun-climate relationship.",
