 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many emerging networked applications have the property that communication among nodes is asymmetric.  Typically, servers can and/or must send much more data to clients than clients send back to the servers. Examples include wireless networks with mobile clients, cable and direct satellite broadcast  TV systems, information dispersal and information retrieval applications. Broadcast Disks technique  exploits the characteristics of such environments, by treating a broadcast stream of data that are  repeatedly and cyclicly transmitted as a storage device. The essence of this approach is to  superimpose multiple broadcast programs (or `disks`) spinning at different speeds on a single  broadcast channel; in effect, creating an arbitrarily fine-grained memory hierarchy. The technique  also integrates the use of client storage resources for caching and prefetching data that is delivered  over the broadcast. The Broadcast Disks approach provides improved performance for non-uniformly  accessed data and increased availability of important data. The challenges being addressed in this  project include: broadcast program  generation, caching and prefetching strategies, and adapting to  volatile data, changing client needs, and communication errors. The results of this research will be  techniques, analyses, and prototype implementations of this novel approach, which has the potential to  significantly improve the performance and availability of future distributed computing systems.   The  education portion of this project aims to develop new courses, software tools and laboratories that  will provide students at all levels with more direct, hands-on experience in building database systems  and applications.",
