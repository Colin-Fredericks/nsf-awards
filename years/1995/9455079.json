 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal builds upon a workshop by the same title being run in  1994. It proposes three faculty enhancement workshops for  instructors in two and four year colleges. Each workshop runs for  six days in June followed by a one day \"reflection\" workshop in  November. The goal of each proposed workshop is to provide  instructors in two and four year colleges an exposure to resources  available to teach the undergraduate introductory course in  Artificial Intelligence and some approaches for their effective  utilization. Major topics to be addressed include how to (1) obtain  available resources, (2) integrate classroom lectures, with  laboratory sessions and assignments using repository materials and  network facilities, (3) adapt and extend the available pedagogic  material, (4) improve learning and cooperation between instructors  and their students, and between students, (5) establish and  maintain cooperative arrangements between instructors at different  institutions, (6) assess the effectiveness of various pedagogic  methods for using the resources. Each workshop builds upon the  Teaching Portfolio produced in the preceding workshop. The Teaching  Portfolio, accessible using Mosaic, includes a variety of pedagogic  materials (e.g. syllabi, class-plans, exercises, projects,  discussion topics) and references to tools, programs, and other  materials available on the internet.",
