 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522568  Campins    A unique opportunity to study a particularly interesting comet,  2060 Chiron, is at hand.  Comet Chiron is now near perihelion  (February 1996) and will be at its brightest in 51 years.   Simultaneously, the European Space Agency's Infrared Space  Observatory (ISO), which is scheduled for launch in September 1995,  will be making observations of Chiron during its 18-month mission.   A coordinated ground-based and space-based study of Chiron, and two  other comets, will be carried out.  The combination of frequent  ground-based, and high sensitivity space-based, infrared wavelength  observations, will yield extensive information about these three  comets. The ISO observing time for these comets has already been  assigned to the team.  The following items describe the main goals  of the research.    1.  Characterization of Chiron's variability in the infrared  wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The usefulness  of ground-based observations in support of ISO arises mostly  because the time assigned on the ISO satellite to observe Chiron  (and most other targets) is not sufficiently long to characterize  their infrared variability, and observing time by the ISO satellite  will be spent mainly obtaining observations which are not possible  using ground-based telescopes.     2.  Theoretical thermal models of Chiron's nucleus will be tested.            a.) Thermal-infrared observations of Chiron's nucleus before  and after opposition can reveal which of those geometries presents  the cooler morning terminator, and hence distinguish between  prograde and retrograde rotation by detecting temperature changes.         b.)  Frequent observations before and after perihelion can be  used as a diagnostic of a number of nuclear characteristics,  including the pole orientation.     3.  Observations of secondary targets.  Similar, but necessarily  less detailed studies of Comets d'Arrest and Kopff, will be carried  out.  These two comets will also be observed by ISO, and will b e  well placed for observations in 1995-1996.",
