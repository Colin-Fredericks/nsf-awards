 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating an upper-level undergraduate laboratory  emphasizing real-time, non-destructive, field data-acquisition  and interpretation for civil and environmental engineering  (C&EE).   The campus serves as the laboratory bench.  Student  teams place sensors (e.g.  strain, pressure, conductivity, flow)  on chosen features such as a bridges, wells, storm drains and  retaining walls.   Teams then interface that equipment with  computer data-acquisition systems, calibrate and maintain the  data, and monitor responses to changing environmental conditions.   Thus, structural behavior under load, traffic flow and  intensity, air pollution loading, stormwater and groundwater  flow, and quality is recorded, analyzed and displayed using GIS  and visualization tools.  This educational thrust builds  practical experience in the infrastructure while addressing  traditional weaknesses in many C&EE curricula.   Students  encounter large, practical data sets in a radical departure from  conventional pedagogy.   By fostering interdisciplinary work  using tools and techniques from traditional electrical, systems,  and chemical engineering fields, C&EE students are trained to  manage information flows in \"noisy\" environments and to use those  flows in flexible operational strategies.  Restructuring of the  curriculum stressing interactive learning along with a blurring  of traditional disciplinary boundaries makes this innovative  course timely.   By serving as a practical \"capstone,\" with an  emphasis on problem definition as well as resolution, this lab  prepares C&EE students for the expanded demands of the workplace  and its focus on the collection and management of information.",
