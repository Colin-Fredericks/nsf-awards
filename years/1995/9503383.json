 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymorphism is a key feature of modern, strongly-typed  programming languages including Ada, C++, and ML. This research  program  investigates a new approach to implementing  polymorphism, based on associating  type information with each  activation of a polymorphic function, rather than  with data.  This approach permits type information to be utilized  effectively  at runtime or link-time, not just at compile-time.  It enables compilers to  generate polymorphic object code from  parametrically polymorphic source code,  while still using  specialized, space-efficient data formats that can be shared  with other software components.  The approach also supports a  large variety of  powerful non-parametric features in the source  language and in the development  and runtime environments. The  focus of the research will be on generating  prototype compiler  implementations and language extensions, that can be  evaluated  using performance benchmarks. The underlying aim of the  research is  to make polymorphic programs easier to develop and  to integrate into existing  systems, thereby, hastening the  acceptance of modern languages by industrial  and commercial  users as well as by academics.",
