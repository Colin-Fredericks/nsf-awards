In this study,  crack-induced  coupling mechanisms will be investigated with both  experimental and  modeling studies.  The focus will be on investigation of how  mechanical  loading, thermal loading, and the chemistry of the fluid  environment in the  cracks influences the flow properties of the rock.    Experimental emphasis will be placed on a series of coupled  mechanical/flow  triaxial tests in which both axial and lateral  permeabilities are measured  while samples are subjected to triaxial stresses up to and  past peak  stress.  Laboratory tests will also involve thermal loading  (both uniform  and borehole heating) and tests to study crack growth under  different fluid  chemistries.    Modeling will be focused on development of a finite element  damage model.  Fracture mechanics-based relationships will be developed  between the  coupling mechanisms, and will include crack interaction  effects.  These  relationships will be implemented into a finite element  model to predict  coupled behavior under complex boundary conditions.  In  addition, a  discrete crack boundary element model will be developed to  study the  capability of crack growth due to thermal loading and under  different fluid  chemistries (via subcritical crack extension), and the  capability of  calculating the permeability through a generated crack  population will be  added.",
