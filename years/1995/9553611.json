The goal of the \"Training  Within Environmental Biology  Program (Training-WEB)\" is to train  PhD students to carry out cutting-  edge, creative research and bridge  the gap between academia and  organizations responsible for  making decisions that impact the  natural environment. The student-  centered Training-WEB will enroll  participants in the Graduate  Program of Organismal Biology and  Ecology (OBE), a program housed  within the Division of biological  Sciences at UM. Graduate students  in the Training-WEB will benefit  from a collaborative training  process featuring coursework and  research training in conservation  and environmental biology, along  with a substantial internship in a  government agency, private  organization or business with  interests related to the  environment or conservation. At the  end of this training process,  graduates will have developed  skills appropriate for a variety of  nontraditional and traditional  careers in environmental and  conservation biology. Embedded in  the Training-WEB approach are  carefully considered retention and  evaluation processes, and attention  to recruitment, career development  and expanded opportunities for  greater involvement of groups  traditionally underrepresented in  science. This approach will be a  powerful new model for providing  the highest quality training for  all future graduate students in OBE  and the Division of Biological  Sciences at The University of  Montana.",
