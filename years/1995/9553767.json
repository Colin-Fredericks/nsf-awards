 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Industrial Technology and Safety Program at Keene State  College seeks a four-year project grant from the Advanced  Technology Education Program to plan, implement, and optimize a  revised curricula in its two-year associate degree program in  Design and Manufacturing based on the emerging Computer Aided  Engineering environment.  Today our graduates are entering an  increasingly competitive job market.  They need to have readily  marketable skill in order to compete for jobs or the academic  proficiency to go on to obtain advanced degrees.  The companies  that hire our graduates are facing enormous competitive pressure  from around the world.  The loss of our manufacturing base  continues and the resulting job loss is a significant  social-economic and political problem.  United State's companies  need a flexible and technologically competent workforce in order to  stem this tide.  The emerging role of the technologist must be one  that can fully utilize computer assisted technology.  This computer  environment is integrating once discrete job functions, of design,  manufacturing, and business.  The current limitations in existing  discrete curricula suggests a new \"seamless\" educational paradigm.  To address this situation we are suggesting three areas of study.   The first is a conceptual based curriculum, using a projects focus,  to deliver technical problem solving for meeting curriculum goals.   The second aspect of our proposal is to create a series of four  integrated courses in the area of product design and development  utilizing this computer assisted environment.  The third is to  establish a collaboratively working on these projects on the  InterNet, with other schools, government laboratories, and  companies.  The curriculum model we are creating is basically an  immersion model for our students that provide both a contextual and  constructivist environment for problem solving.  In this  environment students solve holistic and fully integrate problems in  math, science, te chnology, and business.  This curriculum model  emulates both the emerging computer assisted environment and the  world of work.  Our goals is to create this new curriculum paradigm  and study its effectiveness.  We are creating a model that is both  pragmatic and realistic and that can serve as a nation model.  This  is one of many solutions being offered to help improve the  competitive position of our graduates.  By breaking with  traditional paradigms it can serve as a model to entice  non-tradition, and minority students, as well as  displaced workers  to move into the exciting and challenging world of product design  and development.  Our project opens many new and exciting  opportunity for educational research.  Through this curriculum  project we will help guarantee our students the opportunity to  compete effectively and become contributing citizens in a global  economy.",
