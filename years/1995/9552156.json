 "awd_abstract_narration": "This course is designed to unveil physics to students in  introductory physics laboratory by teaching them to discover it  on their own.   The University Versatile Eclectic Introductory  Laboratory (UNVEIL) course combines several of the most effective  current laboratory teaching methods into one course designed to   (1) meet the needs of both premedical students and  science/engineering students who are mixed together in sections  of lab; (2) use technology both to teach physics and to introduce  students to professional-level equipment; (3) employ successful  pedagogy to maximize physics understanding.   Computers and  self-discovery pedagogy allow for a versatile laboratory where  students in the same room can perform different experiments.    UNVEIL combines Socratic guidance, self-discovery, computer  technology, and modeling methods to create a more effective lab  environment.    Equipment and software have been selected that  can largely be used by both groups of students, with each group  performing some specifically tailored experiments.   Newly  developed, versatile physics laboratory equipment, along with  Power Macs, LabVIEW data acquisition software, Mathematica, and  other software are used.  The laboratory course is one in which  students, armed with the laboratory manual, can select  appropriate equipment and design an experiment (with Socratic  guidance from the instructor and TAs) to examine the subject.    With the computer, students acquire data or enter data acquired  manually, plot graphs, and look at computer modeling of physical  phenomena.",
