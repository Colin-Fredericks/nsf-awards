 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501064  Helton       Most of the proposed research falls into three areas:  1. OPTIMIZATION OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS    Qualitative theory, computer algorithms based on this theory,   analysis of such algorithms.  Connections of this work with other   branches of mathematics.The engineering motivation here is strong; these   are the key optimization problems which arise il design of   systems and amplifiers where there are competing constraints,   time as well as frequency domain constraints, or uncertainty  in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control.  2. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS The point here is to find canonical nonlinear operator   theory which extends the classical linear theory of   Nevanlinna-Pick and many followers. That theory is the   core of linear control theory. Many systems which people wish to control   are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines), so there is a big demand for an effective nonlinear theory.  Unfortunately, the mathematical theory is new and primitive.   More general problems need to be solved and   special cases need to be understood in greater detail.  3. COMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA  Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are   rife with calculations in a noncommuting algebra.   Thus it is likely that someday there will be a branch of these   subjects devoted to their symbolic computational aspects.       Helton's group have, support, and are upgrading extensive   software, called NCAlgebra, for performing noncommuting   calculations in Mathematica.  The software is currently   at the level of a very powerful `yellow pad'.  The main issue now is what `intelligence' should go in   noncommuting packages. For example,  calculations with energy conserving systems  produce polynomials in matrices satisfying certain relations.   Thus it is natural to find a list of rules for simplifying   such polynomials tailored to this particular situation.  The goal is to find and understand `complete' lists of   simplifying rules.  Helton and collaborat ors   have successfully studied several situations of this type and   more are in progress.  ***",
