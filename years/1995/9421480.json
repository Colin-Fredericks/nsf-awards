 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program of research tests the PI's theory  that powerful perceivers are vulnerable to stereotyping others because: (a) their outcomes are not so contingent on those subordinate others; (b) their capacities are limited by overload; and (c) they can be personally motivated by a dominance orientation.  The powerful perceiver's  control motivations (lack of contingency on others and possible dominance orientation) make them less careful and combine with overloaded capacity to encourage stereotyping.  These dynamics have practical significance because the use of stereotypes by powerful decision makers has more impact than their use by the less powerful.  They have theoretical significance because the lowered social contingency (lack of  reciprocal outcome dependency) of powerful people paves the way for more autonomous motives to guide their impression formation (e.g., values, individual differences,  relationships external to the power relation).  The relative lack of contingency of the powerful also creates a greater challenge for influencing them. Six studies will test the PI's theor y utilizing two paradigms supported by preliminary data.  These paradigms  employ both manipulations of power and individual differences and include a range of stereotyped targets varying in  ethnicity, race, and gender.  The first three studies test the hypothesis that the powerful do not need to attend to their subordinates.  One  implication of this perspective is that the powerless may become anxious, a prediction supported by  previous work. To examine this implication, three additional studies investigate the dynamics of power  and control feelings to test a related hypothesis:  Some kinds of power do not make the powerless  anxious, and so avoid the debilitating interpersonal effects of anxiety.  Together, these six studies  examine situational and personality dynamics of the relationship between power and stereotyping, as  mediated by control feelings and capacity limitations.      Studies of power and stereotyping are  critical to the nation's effective use of its human capital.  Stereotypes ignore the merits of the  individual.  Thus, powerful decision makers who stereotype their subordinates will make uninformed,  inefficient, and ineffective  decisions.  Yet the PI's theory, tested in this program of research,  suggests that the powerful are especially vulnerable to stereotyping.  It also suggests that a  dominating, stereotypic leadership style undermines subordinate performance.  This research will  reveal how the powerful can avoid the debilitating effects of stereotypes and make the best use of the  available human resources.",
