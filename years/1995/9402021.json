 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402021  Palmer         Knowledge of spatial and frequency domain interferometric  (SI/FDI) techniques has progressed to a point where real scientific  gains are being obtained.  Using these relatively new techniques  has provided the scientist with additional observations to  investigate the atmosphere.  The first phase of the project is the  study of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) using a recently  acquired 915 MHz radar at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  We   propose to modify the radar so that FDI can be performed.  The main  goal is to study the effect on gravity wave propagation of low-  level jets, which exist in the Great Plains region.  The proposed  research also extends into the tropo/stratospheric regions, where  the PIs are interested in refining the observational methods.   Although the idea of \"corrected\" vertical velocities at VHF wave-  lengths was introduced in 1985, recent measurements at multiple  wavelengths has cast doubt on this idea.  The PIs intend to  investigate the problem using the MU radar facility in Japan, where  there is a VHF interferometric system along with a UHF boundary  layer radar.  The effect of the jet stream on refractivity layer  tilting will also be investigated using SI techniques.  Isentropic  surface are known to reverse in tilt above and below a jet stream  peak.  Japan has an extremely strong jet in the winter and it is  proposed to make measurements directly related to studying the jet  stream.  Using the Sondre Stromfjord radar in Greenland, the MU  radar in Japan, and the modified 915 MHz radar in Nebraska, the  dependence of FDI techniques on wavelength will be investigated.   The FDI techniques can provide an estimate of the vertical extend  of turbulent layers, which may have a dependence on radar  wavelength.  Observations using these three wavelengths should  elucidate this problem.",
