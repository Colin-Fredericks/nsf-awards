 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412482  Agris    This US-Poland Research project between Dr. Paul F. Agris of  North Carolina State University, and Dr. Andrzej Malkiewicz of  the Technical University of Lodz, is on \"Design and Chemistry of  Modified Nucleosides for Nucleic Acid Synthesis.\"  How modified  nucleoside chemistry, structure and dynamics relate to function  of RNAs, but also DNA, is not understood.  Once understood, even  for a small number of base modified nucleosides, this varied  collection of chemistries and structures can be applied to the  design and engineering of molecules important to biology and  medicine.  The evolution of the more than 80 modified nucleosides  in RNAs and DNA is connected with their site-selected positioning  and altering of nucleic acid chemistry and structure; the  potential to accomplish this is as varied as are the chemistries  and structures of the modifications.  The cooperating  investigators will develop new technologies and methods for  studying the site-selected incorporation of both native and non-  native modified and stable-isotope labeled nucleosides in RNA and  DNA, applicable, initially, to fundamental nucleic acid  biochemistry (molecular evolution, nucleic acid structure).  The  mutual benefit from the cooperative project derives from the  perfect complementary experiences of the two investigators.  Dr.  Malkiewicz is broadly experienced in the organic chemical  syntheses, chemistry and analyses of modified nucleosides and  small oligomers containing modified nucleosides; whereas Dr.  Agris is broadly experienced in the biosynthesis and analyses of  both the structures and functions of modified nucleosides in RNA.    This project in biochemistry fulfills the program objective of  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  Poland and the United States to combine complementary talents and  pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
