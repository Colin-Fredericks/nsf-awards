 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, involves the continuation of an experimental and molecular  modeling research program studying solute retention phenomena in  size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Professor Paul L. Dubin and  his students at the Indiana University - Purdue University at  Indianapolis have selected various model compounds of defined  geometry that are indicative of spherical and asymmetric solutes  which exhibit ideal and non-ideal elution characteristics on porous  glass SEC stationary phases. The impetus of this study is to derive  rigorous theoretical relations which correlate the chromatographic  partition coefficient of various solutes with their size and  geometry. In addition, Professor Dubin will incorporate  electrostatic effects to model protein separation by SEC. The  retention characteristics of several highly purified model proteins  will be measured at Superose 12 stationary phases. Electrophoretic  light scattering and capillary zone electrophoresis techniques will  also be used to characterize high molecular weight analytes.   Aqueous size exclusion chromatography is commonly used to assay  molecular weight distribution and identify mixtures of complex  synthetic and natural water soluble polymers. Retention order in  this technique is based on the size based partitioning of analyte  throughout varying sized pores of the stationary phase, with those  solute having geometries equivalent to that of the packing being  retained longer on the column. However, in cases where geometric  considerations do not solely govern interactions between the solute  and the stationary phase, the retention characteristics of analytes  at SEC stationary phases can be quite different from that of the  calibration standard, which can lead to gross errors in the  measurement. Prof. Paul Dubin and his students at Indiana  University will use various model compounds and molecular modeling  algorithms to derive a fundamental retention theory which relates  retention of polymeric solute with solute size.",
