The problems to be considered include:  (1) the construction and   characterization of wavelets of Battle-Federbush type and their associated   wavelet packets; (2) the general construction of multiwavelets from an   orthogonal multiresolution analysis generated by scaling vectors; (3)   determining properties of  certain classes of solutions of matrix refinement   equations; (4) applications of fractal multiwavelets to second order   hyperbolic partial differential equations; and (5) adaptations of fast wavelet   transformations by incorporating multiwavelets in order to study nonlinear   integral equations.    This project is being supported under the Research in Undergraduate   Institutions (RUI) activity.  The RUI activity is part of the Foundation's   effort to help assure a broad base for science and engineering research, and   thereby enhance the scientific and technical training of students in   undergraduate institutions.  The specific objectives of the RUI program are   to: (1) support high quality research by faculty with active involvement of   undergraduate students, (2) strengthen the research environment in   academic departments that are oriented primarily toward undergraduate   instruction, and (3) promote the integration of research and education at   predominantly undergraduate institutions.  This project will involve   research on the theory of multiwavelets.  Multiwavelet theory involves   replacing the classical dilation equation of wavelet theory by a matrix   dilation equation.  The relationship of the dilation equation and the various   features of the wavelet bases generated will be investigated.  The use of   wavelets for the numerical solution of partial differential and integral   equations will also be studied; these techniques will be compared to more   classical algorithms.",
