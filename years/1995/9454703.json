In an environment  created by the cooperation of business, higher education, state  agencies, K-12 education institutions, students and educators, this  project tests the benefits of open access to:         *    INTERNET and other telecommunications resources.       *    Quality mathematics and science instructional lessons            congruent with national and emerging state standards       *    On-going assistance through school-based support staff,       *    Electronic access to community resources, proximal and            distal to individual schools.    Project SMART tests technical support strategies and the scaling up  of training to the vast numbers of students and teachers who share  the need to \"do\" science and mathematics and contribute to the  creation of new curricula.  It provides answers to questions about  how a telecommunications infrastructure connecting all our public  institutions can foster out-of-school programs, establish life-long  learning programs, and inform the community.  Gender and equity  issues in telecommunications are the main thrust of this proposal.   Project SMART explores ways to promote equity among schools,  teachers and students in gaining access to and effectively using  technology.    Agreements with NYNEX Corp. provide free phone lines to public  schools throughout Rhode Island for access to a complete array of  Internet services.  Regional modem pools have eliminated toll  charges, removing a major obstacle to employing telecommunications  in the classroom. Therefore, because many of the difficulties  associated with the costs of telecommunications are being resolved,  this proposal focuses on the individuals and groups who will be  connected, as well as purposes for their connections.    Project SMART demonstrates how infrastructure changes underlying  almost three years of SSI activities in mathematics and science can  activel y support technology infusion into schools.  Project SMART  increases the capacity of training organizations to provide  training, ultimately, to every K-12 school teacher in Rhode Island.   Building based support staff will link each school to a state  network of educators developing effective applications of  telecommunications in science and mathematics.  In addition the  Rhode Island Office of Higher Education will introduce RINet to  several colleges and universities where is it not being used to  expand the infrastructure of the network.  Project SMART addresses  the need to change learning and teaching by using:         *    Expertise in educational and telecommunications methods            within Rhode Islands' colleges and universities;       *    Consultants able to support the needs of specific       *         populations of users;       *    Content area specialists;       *    Successful teacher pioneers.    The project supports successful applicant teams from every district  and teams of higher education faculty from teacher preparation  institutions.  Specific efforts address concerns noted in the  literature pertaining to gender and equity differences among  computer users by providing technical support to traditionally  under represented populations in team selection and project  involvement.    Instructional units created by participants will include embedded  assessment items and rubrics supported by a manual for educators to  access related telecommunication resources.  All participants  receive the full support necessary to:         *    Develop model instructional units;        *    Create, develop, modify or extend educational activities            using network;       *    Use electronic networks (Internet) for improved K-12            instruction in science and mathematics;       *    Maintain dialogue via Rhode Island Network (RINet).  ***",
