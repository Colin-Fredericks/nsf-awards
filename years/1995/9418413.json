While two of the CAD enzymes are similar to their bacterial counterparts, the Escherichia coli and mammalian dihydroorotases are significantly different.  Toward the long-term goal of understanding the regulation and structure of the CAD gene and the structure and function of the CAD protein, the following experiments will be pursued with this proposal.  First, the 5  end of the CAD gene will be placed upstream of the chloroamphenicol acetyl transferase gene, and the construct will be transfected into cells which can be induced to interrupt the normal cell cycle.  RNA protection assays will be used to determine the regulatory elements that control CAD transcription in such cells.  Second, site-directed mutagenesis will be used to identify crucial residues present at the carboxyl end of the mammalian dihydroorotase but absent in the bacterial enzyme.  Finally, the region of the CAD cDNA encoding the dihydroorotase domain  (middle enzymatic domain) will be replaced with the sequence encoding the E. coli enzyme to determine how bacterial enzyme function is affected by being part of a multifunctional protein. %%% The first three steps of the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines are catalyzed by carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase.  In mammals, these three enzymes are found together in a single translation product called CAD.  The proper function and regulation of CAD is essential for normal cellular metabolism, proliferation, and viability, and may be crucial in development and homeostasis.  Many questions remain about how the CAD gene and its protein product accomplish all these roles and how the gene evolved from three separate genes encoding monoenzymatic proteins, the arrangement seen in bacteria.  Experiments using genetic, molecular biology and biochemical approaches will provide greater insight into this complex protein that plays such a crucial role in normal animal development and physiology.
