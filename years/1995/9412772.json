FIB-  induced compositional mixing of MQW regions will be a primary  fabrication technique, while time-resolved and spatially-resolved  photoluminescence is the main technique to be performed for  evaluating the quality of these structures.  Since these  nanostructures are directed at enhancing nonlinear optical  interactions and improving semiconductor laser performance, we  expect to characterize nonlinear optical effects resulting from  quantum wires and microcavities and to determine the impact of FIB-  fabricated microcavity structures on semiconductor lasers.    Microcavity structures are finding advantageous use in vertical  cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and have considerable  potential for the formation of Fabry-Perot bistable switches.  As  a part of the proposed research, we will be applying FIB processing  capability to the fabrication of these structures.  The direct  write capability of FIB processing (mixing and milling) is expected  to provide significant improvement in device isolation and pn  junction formation.    The high resolution properties (~50 nm) of the FIB system and its  capability to direct write patterns onto samples will allow us to  fabricate several waveguide structures which will elucidate  nonlinear optical effects, including nonlinear distributed feedback  gratings, directional couplers, and Mach-Zehnder interferometers.   We expect to demonstrate all-optical switching with these  structures which will be characterized by low switching powers.  ***",
