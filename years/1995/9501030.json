 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rundell  9501030    Many objects of physical interest cannot be studied directly.  Examples include, imaging the interior of the body, the  determination  of cracks within solid objects, and material parameters such as  the  conductivity of inaccessible objects.  When these problems are  translated into mathematical terms they take the form of partial  differential equations, the Lingua Franca of the mathematical  sciences. However, since we have additional unknowns in the  model,  these introduce unknown parameters in the equations that have to  be  additionally solved for by means of further measurements. In this  proposal we deal with the practical aspects of this from a  mathematical perspective: We are interested in the question of  when a  unique determination can be made as well as designing algorithms  for  the efficient numerical recovery of the unknowns.  %%%  The recovery of unknown coefficients from second order partial  differential operators in multi-dimensions will be investigated.  Our  main goal is to prove uniqueness results and to develop  constructive  recovery methods for several particular cases. In practice, each  of  these problems reduce to uniquely recovering a coefficient in an  appropriately chosen finite dimensional space from a finite  number of  data measurements. This reduces the inverse problem to the  inversion  of the data-to-coefficient map in finite dimensions. In addition  to  developing reconstruction methods, the stability (or sensitivity)  of  these methods to perturbations of the data, as well as their  computational cost, will be studied.  ***",
