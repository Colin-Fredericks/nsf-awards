 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507503  Dial      Flight is the most common form of animal locomotion and birds represent one of nature's finest locomotor experiments.  Recent studies are providing new insights into the intricacies of the biomechanics, neuromuscular control, and the range of behaviors associated with aerial locomotion.  To interpret more clearly internal and external mechanisms associated with avian wing and tail movements during different modes of flight, Dr. Dial will employ several recently developed techniques (e.g., sonomicrometry, miniature tendon force-buckle recording, and 3-D infra-red, high-speed video motion analysis) along with well-established methods (e.g., electromyography, strain gauge implantation, high-speed 16mm cinematography) as birds fly within a variable-speed wind tunnel and flight obstacle course.  A number of separate projects are planned.  1) To determine how force production from the principal locomotor muscle (m. pectoralis) scales with body size, four species of birds (House sparrows, Black-billed magpies, Common ravens, and Canada geese), spanning a wide range of body sizes (25g to 4000g), will be implanted with strain gauges and recorded during different modes of flight.  Data from the two species will be augmented with in vivo sonomicrometric recordings to obtain more reliable measurements of pectoralis length changes during each wingbeat cycle, thus permitting more accurate estimates of mechanical work generated by the wings.  2) Tendon force buckle and electromyographic analyses will more accurately evaluate force production and activity patterns of key flight muscles within the wings of crows.  3) Strain records from wing skeletal elements and flight feathers of pigeons will significantly improve the understanding of wing kinematics as well as measure aerodynamic forces imposed on the flight apparatus.  4) Infra-red, high-speed motion analyses will produce the first 3-dimensional records of wings and tails of pigeons during maneuvering (asymmetrical) flight and of magpies d uring wind tunnel (symmetrical) flight over a wide range of speeds.  ***",
