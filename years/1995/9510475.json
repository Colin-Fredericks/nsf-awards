 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510475  Greene  This  project has as its goal the preparation and  characterization  of high  quality  neodymium-cerium- copper-  oxygen (NCCO) single  crystals and  thin  films  and  lanthanum-strontium-copper-oxygen  (LSCO)  thin films.  Comprehensive physical property measurements will  be  carried out with the aim of providing reliable experimental  constraints on the theories  for high temperature  superconductivity and anomalous  normal state  properties  of  copper  oxides. A detailed  comparison  of  the electron-  doped NCCO system and the hole-doped LSCO system will be  made in  order  to  better  understand the transition  between  insulating, metallic  and  superconducting phases  as  the  cerium,  strontium,  or oxygen composition is  changed.  %%%  Many  copper oxide materials are superconductors at  temperatures above the  boiling  point  of liquid nitrogen  (77K) and have  potential  for applications.  However, an  understanding of why  these  materials  are superconductors  at such high temperatures is lacking at  present.  The goal  of  this  project is to prepare and characterize  some  selected copper oxide superconductors by improved methods.  This is expected  to lead  to  a  better  understanding of  how these  materials  work,  and hopefully,  to insights on  how to prepare materials which  are  better for  technological applications.  ***",
