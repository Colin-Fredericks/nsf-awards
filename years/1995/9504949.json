 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development of new estimators, a  projection   pursuit  estimator and a wavelet estimator, for cell  probabilities of   high-dimensional ordered contingency tables.  A high-dimensional  contingency   table has two unique features: it is usually very sparse, and it  has a large   number of boundary cells. The projection pursuit method is used  to study the   features of high-dimensional data by looking at its  low-dimensional   projections.  The projected data is no longer sparse and the  projection   pursuit method does  not suffer from boundary effect since the  method is   not based on local  averages. When a smoothing method is  introduced,   one usually assumes that the contingency table has an underlying  density   function which has a certain  degree of smoothness.  Both the  order of a   kernel function and the optimal  choice of a smoothing parameter  depend on the smoothness of the underlying   density function.  This assumption seems unnatural.  One may not  have a prior   knowledge about the smoothness of an unknown density.  The  wavelet method can   adapt to the smoothness of an unknown density, and it avoids the  problem of   how much to smooth.  Therefore, one does not need to assume the  existence of   an underlying density function.        Contingency or cross tabulation tables occur very frequently  in biomedical science, social science,  and educational research.  For example, to study the public's  opinions on   five different policy issues (health care, tax, . . .) on a five  point scale   (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), a   five-dimensional cross tabulation table with 3,125 cells would be  needed.    Frequently when the number of cells is large, the table is  usually sparse,   i.e., has many empty cells.  Large and sparse tables provide  many challenges  for statistical analysis.  The research develops new tools for  analyzing this type of    categorical data.",
