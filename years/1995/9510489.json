 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510489  Peterson    This dissertation research investigation addresses the role  played by institutional arrangements, political behavior, and  environmental constraints in explaining the diffusion and outputs  of school reform efforts across 63 American cities.   The key  question of the research is:  what conditions made school reform  more likely during 1992-1995?  The dependent variable is the  incidence and out put of reform, as measured in scaled responses  produced by interviewing seven knowledgeable sources in each  sample city.    This investigation is the first attempt to examine the fate of a  number of reform policies across a large sample of cities.  By  creating an original data set measuring the appearance of five  educational reforms across the U.S., the rate at which they were  debated and implemented, the role of key hypothetical actors, and  board behaviors, this study will be able to offer unprecedented  insights into the determinants of school reform.  Meshing this  data with existent demographic, fiscal, and institutional data,  as well as the results from two questionnaires, proved effective  in the pilot study in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  ***",
