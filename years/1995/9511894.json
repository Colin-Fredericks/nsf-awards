 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stiner    This award under the NSF Faculty Early Career Development  competition will provide five years of support to Dr. Mary Stiner  to further her paleoanthropological research in Israel, to permit  her to develop a laboratory at the University of Arizona and to  allow the incorporation students into her project. The funding  will permit her and a student to travel to Israel each year to  conduct preliminary analyses of faunal materials recovered  through archaeological excavation. A sample will be shipped to  the Arizona facility where they will be subjected to extensive  examination. Funds will also permit the purchase of necessary  research and training equipment and laboratory supplies and will  provide student support.     Dr. Stiner's study centers on the analysis of recently excavated  faunas from Hayonim Cave in Israel. The work investigates the  human foraging niche in the Near East during the late Middle  through early Upper Pleistocene geologic periods, a question  fundamental to understanding the origins of modern humans in this  region. The long faunal sequence at Hayonim is important because  it fills a unique and crucial gap in our knowledge about the  emergence of anatomically modern humans. During this period  between ca. 200,000  to 50,000 years ago two different kinds of  humans were present in the Near East. One of these was directly  ancestral to modern day peoples and archaeologists wish to  understand their behavior and how they adapted to their changing  environment. Through the analysis of faunal remains, it will be  possible to reconstruct environmental change over time and to  gain insight into the ways in which people utilized the range of  animal resources available to them.    This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on human-environment interactions. It will provide insight  into the emergence of modern behaviors, support the research and  teaching career of a promising young scientist and assist in  student training.",
