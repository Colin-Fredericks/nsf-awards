 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455450  Mulder  This work produces a greatly needed and major revision (or complete  revamping) of Computer Information Science (CIS) oriented  curricula. Specifically it provides detailed curriculum guidelines,  supporting laboratory material, original learning/teaching  paradigms, and a methodology for dealing with complex information  systems. This major component of the Computing Sciences has been  overlooked by practitioners, educators, and the professional  societies for at least fifteen years. During this same period the  need for complex, large grain information systems to support all  aspects of business, industry, and government has exploded;  similarly, the technologies supporting the generation and usage of  information have changed dramatically. This has led to our current  dilemma: the availability of exciting new information technologies  to be applied, BUT few (new hires or practitioners), if any,  properly prepared to effectively apply these advances. This  academe/industry collaborative proposal addresses this dilemma, and  will produce solutions.  This work builds on what is available  today in CIS, adding to it substantial new course and laboratory  material, a methodology for dealing with large grain information  system complexity, development of teamwork and communications  skills in students, and will embed problem solving and design  skills within the recommended curriculum. To support this  curriculum, appropriate materials are developed and tested at  selected university/industry test sites. A new learning/teaching  paradigm (ie., Just in Time Learning) is developed and tested, in  which qualified students (guided by a faculty member) is  electronically linked with an ongoing industry large grained  information systems project. There are participating project team  members, receiving both project experiences and just in time  classroom/laboratory experiences. The Boeing Company and Motorola  are committed to supporting this original learning/teaching  paradigm.  In add ition to the 2 1/2 months per year that the PI and  Co-PI devote to this project, a team of ten (10) carefully selected  professionals (5 from industry and 5 from academe) are heavily  involved in the project. Three eminent CIS specialists will form  the National Visiting Committee to critique and guide the project,  and 50+ additional external specialists will review the results of  the project. ln this manner, the quality and applicability of  project results are assured. Widespread and timely dissemination to  the Computing profession will be conducted.",
