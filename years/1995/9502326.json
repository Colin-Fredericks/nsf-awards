However,  experimental data on the constitutive behavior  of  these  complex  systems  are scarce and  theoretical  models  predicting  the behavior differ significantly  from  one  to  another.   In  this  research project,  a  new  experimental  method  based  on  noncontact  optical  techniques  will  be  demonstrated  and  further developed to gain  a  fundamental  understanding of constitutive behavior of powder compacts.  %%%  A  new  experimental  method, based  on  noncontact  optical  technique,   will  be  developed  to  gain   a   fundamental  understanding  of constitutive behavior of powder  compacts.  The applicant's career goal is to pursue teaching excellence  as  well  as  research excellence in the field of  Materials  Science and Engineering.  By teaching fundamental principles  and  problem  solving skills and promoting  active  learning  through   curriculum  innovations,  it  is   expected   that  graduates   will   be  better  equipped   to   develop   new  intellectual skills, increase their technical knowledge, and  make  technology  innovations that will serve  our  societal  needs and national goals.",
