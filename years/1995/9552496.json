 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kozma  9552496    The goals of this policy study are to provide the National Science  Foundation's Networking Infrastructure for Education program with:  (1) a conceptual framework for studying the impacts of NIE  investments in network-based projects, (2) policy options for  resource allocations, and (3) recommendations for approaches to  evaluating the impact of the NIE program and its projects.  These  options and recommendations will be useful both to NIE and to other  agencies funding network-based projects.  An analysis of the  distribution of the NIE funds across types of programs and in  relation to other NII projects can reveal redundancies, gaps, and  emerging needs. An assessment of the nature of the NIE portfolio  within the larger NII context can illuminate potentially powerful  partnerships for leveraging NIE's investments in pursuit of  education reform. Evaluation recommendations will help NIE program  staff advise proposers on their evaluation plans, assess the  quality of proposals, and monitor the execution of projects.   Improved plans for formative and summative evaluation of projects  will also increase the likelihood of project success and make it  more efficient and inexpensive to assess the impact of NIE, when it  comes time to evaluate that program.    These goals will be accomplished in the following seven steps:  (1)  SRI staff will meet with the staff of NIE and other related  programs to identify policy and evaluation issues and identify a  panel of national experts that will work on the project; (2) SRI  staff will propose and refine a conceptual framework that describes  the ways in which networkbased projects can affect educational  reform and provide NIE staff with information on the distribution  of their resources across the framework relative to the investments  of other federal programs and those of the private sector; (3) SRI  staff will formulate different evaluation criteria an methodologies  for NIE projects with different goals and activities; (4) on th e  basis of these analyses, SRI staff will make preliminary  recommendations regarding funding alternatives and evaluation  guidelines; (5) these recommendations will be reviewed and modified  by a panel of experts in science, education technology, policy, and  program evaluation; (6) a national Policy Conference will be  convened to review and discuss the recommendations; (7) on the  basis of these discussions, SRI staff will write up the final  recommendations to NIE staff.  ***",
