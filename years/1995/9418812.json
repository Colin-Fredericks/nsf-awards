 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418812  Anandan    This three-year award will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in  theoretical physics between Jeeva Anandan of the University of South  Carolina and Roger Penrose of the Mathematical Institute, University  of Oxford.  The objective of their research is to study a possible  connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.  They will  investigate unsolved problems in quantum state reduction using  quantum gravity, and will study the incorporation of gravity into the  geometry of quantum theory in Hilbert space.  Theoretical and  experimental implications of quantum state reduction in  superconductors and molecular interferometry experiments will also  be investigated.    Dr. Anandan brings to this collaboration his expertise in quantum  geometry, foundations of quantum theory, general relativity, and their  relationship to each other.  This is complemented by the considerable  experience and expertise of Dr. Penrose in general relativity and the  geometry of space-time and quantum gravity.  The project will  advance understanding of the relationship between gravity and  quantum mechanics and will have important applications in subfields  in physics, astronomy, and chemistry.  ***",
