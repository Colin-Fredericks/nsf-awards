 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220287  Chan    This US-Bulgaria Joint Cooperative Research on Iterative Methods for Large-  Scale Discretization Problems is between Dr. Tony F.-C. Chan and Dr. Barry F.  Smith of the University of California Los Angeles, and Dr. Panayot  Vassilevski, Dr. Svetozar D. Margenov, and Dr. Oleg P. Iliev of the Center of  Informatics & Computer Technology.  The research topics will include  computational study (performance and analysis) of efficient iterative methods,  based on domain decomposition, multilevel, and on ILU techniques for solving  discretized differential equations.  Such a collaboration will benefit both  sides which have different experience on various aspects of multi-level,  domain decomposition and general preconditioning methods.  The research will  focus on anisotropic, nonsymmetric, indefinite and/or almost indefinite  problems obtained when discretizing elliptic equations with strong anisotropy,  convection-diffusion type problems, elasticity equations including the  incompressible limit, and Navier-Stokes equations, for example in stream-  function vorticity formulation.  Advances in deriving efficient solution  methods for problems such as Navier-Stokes equations should be applicable to a  large class of important processes in, say, ecology, weather prediction, oil  and gas recovery, design of new constructive elements and materials, and in  fluid dynamics.    This research in mathematics fulfills the program objective of advancing  science by enabling leading experts in the United States and Bulgaria to  combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***",
