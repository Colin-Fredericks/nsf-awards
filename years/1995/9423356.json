 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423356  McPheron    Glutathione transferases are a ubiquitous gene family  found  in   plants  and  animals.   Glutathione  transferases   are  involved  in  the  conjugation of  glutathione  to  reactive  organic   molecules,  especially  lipophilic  or  fat-loving  molecules  like  many pesticides and plant  allelochemicals.  This  research  will  analyze  glutathione  transferaqes  in  insecticide-resistant and insecticide-susceptible strains of  an  apple bud moth, and determine how this class of  enzymes  is  expressed and functions.  The effects of plant  extracts  of   differing   chemistries  on   glutathione   transferase  expression  and activity will be monitored using radioactive  glutathione  transferase messenger RNA  and  also  by  using  purified   genetically-engineered  glutathione  transferases  placed  in  E.  coli ( a model bacterium used in  molecular-  genetic   studies).     Defining  the  interaction   between  glutathione transferase expression and activity and  foreign  organic  molecules will lead to a greater  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  by  which organisms deal  with  potentially  damaging    chemical    compounds.    Because    glutathione  transferases are found in bacteria, plants and animals,  the  knowledge  gained will be broadly applicable,  ranging  from  increased  understanding insecticide resistance to increased  understanding of  resistance to anti-cancer drugs in humans.",
