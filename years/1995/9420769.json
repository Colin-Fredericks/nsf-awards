The fundamental methods of this research are aimed at making  protein design a practical science.  Genetic engineering has opened the way to designing new proteins with diverse uses: catalysts,  drugs, specific toxins, scavengers, signals, and biomaterials.  But crucial to these designs is  control of 3-D structure.  Protein function depends on structure.  We must be able to design  animo acid sequences that fold into predictable three dimensional structures.  This project aims to define the problem of the connection of amino acid sequence to 3D structure  for two classes of small,  -helical proteins.  These are bundles of  -helices, and  -helical coiled-  coils, an important special class of  -helical bundles.  For these two classes of proteins, amino  acid sequences have been designed to fold and oligomerize in predetermined ways.  The main  principle of folding and assembly used in these designs is the removal of apolar sidechains from  contact with water, and the exposure of charged and polar side chains.  This principle of  segregation according to polarity may be termed amphiphilicity.    The main analytical method used is x-ray structure determination of the designed proteins.   Designed proteins are synthesized (or expressed); purified, crystallized, and structures determined  as the basis for the next turn of the design cycle.  One of the main design tools used is semi-empirical computational energetics.  A major extension  of such methods is termed Profile Refinement.  In Profile Refinement, the conformation of a  protein is computed by permitting the protein structure to change in such a way that each amino  acid residue, or atomic group, seeks an environment within the protein that is most like its  average environment in the database of known protein structures.  Profile Refinement is based  on principles of amphiphilicity, rather than of c lassical energetics.  Nevertheless, Profile  Refinement can be combined with classical energetics, perhaps to create a more powerful method  for assessing protein designs, and for improving partially correct protein models, derived from  low-resolution structure determinations or homology models.  Among designed proteins whose structures will be determined is a coiled-coil that is a domain  swapped dimer.  That is, two tripled coiled-coils from a dimer by exchanging a helix.  The  ability to design domain-swapped dimers will simplify methods for designing larger oligomeric  proteins.  %%%  This project is aimed at making protein design a practical science.

Two classes of protein will be designed: bundles of  -  helices, and  -helical coiled-coils.  The proteins will be synthesized (or genetically expressed),  crystallized and the structures determined.  The results will then be used for a second turn of the  design cycle.  The ultimate objective is the design of proteins to carry out specific functions.  ***",
