 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453978  Milliman    The School of Marine Science (SMS), as part of the Virginia  Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) at the College of William and  Mary, proposes using NSF Graduate Research Traineeships as a key  component in a program to attract and produce more minority Ph.D.s  in coastal marine science at.  Each year two to three applicants  will be awarded three-year fellowships, followed by a one-year  teaching fellowship (funded by SMS).  In most cases the remaining  years will be funded through the competitive proposal process. Some  students would enter directly into the Ph.D. program; others,  particularly those with course or experience deficiencies, might  first obtain an MA.  Some students would begin taking core courses  at SMS immediately upon matriculation.  Other students may need  remedial courses in science and math from the main campus at  William and Mary.    The NSF Graduate Research Traineeships represent one part of a  comprehensive minority training effort at SMS, one that already  includes an undergraduate summer internship program.  Some of the  internal funds of SMS will be spent to support sabbaticals for  established minority scientists at SMS/VIMS, particularly faculty  from historically black colleges.  Other institutional funds will  be used to advertise and promote VMS's minority program.  The goal  of this activity is to produce at least 10 minority Ph.D. graduates  who will then serve as role models in academia for future  generations of students.  ***",
