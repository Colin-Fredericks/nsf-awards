 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research spans two areas of computer engineering that  are  currently considered quite far apart.  The research is aimed at  problems  in the design and implementation of operating systems,  computer architecture  and digital circuits.  And the research is  based on the algebraic theory of  Moore machines (state machines  with output).  A new method for defining,  composing, and  reasoning about very large-scale Moore machines and their  products was developed in prior work.  The research uses this  method to  analyze and validate (or invalidate) some interesting  systems and design  principles - including bus protocols, fault  tolerance and scheduling  mechanisms, and asynchronous circuit  design rules.  The research goals are to:  clarify understanding  of the examples.  Clarify or develop design principles  for  reliable systems, and investigate the basic mathematical  properties of  real-time sensitive and concurrent state transition  systems.",
