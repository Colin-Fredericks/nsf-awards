 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455331  Cromartie  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer programs are powerful  tools for spatial data analysis and mapping, widely used by  environmental professionals.  Specific GIS curricula, however, are  not available for undergraduate environmental studies.  The goal of  this project is to design, develop and test an integrated set of  core environmental science modules, incorporating GIS and related  technologies. All components, lecture, laboratory, and field, are  linked through the GIS in a multi-media framework.  An  interdisciplinary setting is provided for modules for the core  courses.  Advanced students are involved in developing, testing,  and implementing the new modules as teaching assistants in the core  courses. Modules emphasize self-paced instruction, collaborative  learning, group learning, and student-initiated projects. There are  plans to assess the pedagogical effect of the integrated strategy.   The revised curriculum represents a significantly improved  education practice for undergraduate environmental studies  students, other science majors and non-science majors. Study of  fundamental scientific concepts are integrated with study of  management, decision making, and ethics in a technically  sophisticated framework. The project demonstrates how GIS can  enhance problem solving, critical thinking and communication  skills.  Nationally, this project will serve as a model for  environmental science. It will produce sets of interactive  courseware and manuals that other programs can adapt to their own  curricula. These will be disseminated electronically and through  publications and workshops. Because the course materials will  conform to a national consensus curriculum, other institutions  should be able to incorporate them with minimal modifications.",
