 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is the third year of a three year continuing grant  awarded to the Florida Institute of Technology.  The principal  investigator has transferred to the University of Central Florida,  and had no residual second year funding; thus, the one-year award  to UCF.    The project investigates the rotational bursting of F-coronal dust  particles to high density coronal mass ejections in the F-coronal  region.  Rotational bursting of F-coronal dust may take place due  to the tension caused by high spin rate, which can be driven by  four different spin mechanisms.  These mechanisms will be  investigated theoretically.    Repeated rotational bursting from the parent particle and its  fragments will alter the size distribution of the dust, and  ultimately result in ejecting the resulting smaller particles from  the solar system by the action of solar radiation pressure  overcoming the gravitational attraction of the Sun.***",
