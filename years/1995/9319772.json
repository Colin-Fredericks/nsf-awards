 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concentrates on algorithms that discover  information about graphs.  To discover almost anything  interesting about a  graph it is necessary to look at the  whole graph.  On the other hand, there are  important  sequential algorithms whose running time is proportional to  the size  of the input graph.  Two of these algorithms solve the problems (a) of   finding a depth-first spanning tree and (b) of finding a breadth-first   spanning tree.  This  research seeks to answer two questions:  (1) How quickly and efficiently  can the problems that these algorithms solve be solved in  parallel?  (2)  Can several instances of these problems, on the same graph,   but with different starting vertices, be solved by a much more efficient   technique than just solving  each instance separately?    An affirmative answer to the second  question will result in a faster algorithm that finds    the diameter of a graph, an important problem in network design.",
