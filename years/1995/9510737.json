The Symposium will  be held in Siena, Italy, in September 1995.  It is convened  under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic  Research and will be hosted by the University of Siena.  The  US, through the Office of Polar Programs at the National  Science Foundation, maintains a strong research program in  Antarctic earth sciences.  Representation in this meeting is  in the best interests of both the US research community and  the US Antarctic Program's Polar Earth Sciences Program.  This meeting is one of the few opportunities for the  international earth sciences research community to focus on  research problems in Antarctic earth sciences and to share  information about recent progress in Antarctic earth  sciences.  This meeting has historically been an excellent  venue for exchange of scientific information and it has led  to new lines of research and new collaborations.  Furthermore, the Antarctic Treaty requires each member  nation to share and disseminate information resulting from  Antarctic research activities.  Participation of US  researchers in this meeting is a meaningful way to meet this  requirement of the Antarctic Treaty.",
