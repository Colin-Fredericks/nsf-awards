In contrast to past  practice, these courses are not connected with a particular lecture  course.  The first semester course consists of an introduction to  chemical instrumentation. As the student progresses through the  three semester sequence, the experiments increase in complexity and  sophistication until in the third semester the experiments consist  of projects that typically take several weeks to complete.         The Chemistry Department has a variety of modern  instrumentation available for undergraduate instruction and  research.  However, there are some substantial gaps in the  instrument collection that limit the types of experiments that can  be undertaken.  The purpose of this project is to incorporate  Fluorescence Spectroscopy into the laboratory sequence.  This   technique will be used for quantitative analysis, for measurement  of basic physical properties, and for study of reaction mechanisms.   This wide variety of applications will result in a substantial  increase in educational quality.",
