 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in deductive methods, applied  to  automate the synthesis of software built from component  libraries.  Software is constructed from relatively large-scale  components, rather than  from the primitive instructions of a  programming language.  Theorem-proving  techniques are invoked to  identify the relevant components and to compose them  to solve the  problem at hand.  The goal is to put computing  power in the hands of a broader segment of the population and to  increase the  productivity and accuracy of the expert  practitioner.    The software is  constructed to meet specifications expressed in a  logical or graphical  notation.  Specifications are elicited from  the user via a dialog with a  graphical user interface.  The  specification is phrased as a mathematical  theorem, which is  proved by an automatic deduction system. The proof is  conducted  in an application domain theory, which describes the components  in  the software library, the constructs of the specification  language, and the  background knowledge necessary to glue the  components together to meet the  specification.    The theorem is proved by the automatic deduction system Snark,  which has been implemented for applications in software  engineering and  artificial intelligence.  A program that meets  the original specification is  extracted from the proof and  translated into the desired target language.  Software is  produced with high assurance of correctness---it is verified by  the proof from which it is extracted.    This research is expected to make  subroutine libraries, component  libraries, and software reuse libraries  accessible to users who  are largely ignorant of the contents of the libraries,  their  conventions and terminology, or even the target programming  language.",
