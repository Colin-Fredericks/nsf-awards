 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  (IBN 9423593)  West, Meredith    Experimental  evidence has shown that  many  animal  species  show   natal   populational  preferences  with  respect   to  reproductive  patterns.  In the present research,  an  avian  model  of  cultural evolution is used to explore how  social  learning  may  be implicated in such reproductive  patterns.  Different  populations of subjects are exposed for extensive  periods  to  distinctive social populations prior  to  their  breeding  seasons.   The reproductive preferences  are  then  tested.  Measurements are made of the proximate dynamics  of  the  development of individuals' preferences.  In  addition,  the  behaviors by which individuals communicate reproductive  preferences,  in  particular, the use of  vocalizations  and  responses   to  vocalizations,  are  measured.   Preliminary  results  confirm that social learning exerts direct  effects  on   the  transmission  of  reproductive  preferences.   The  proposed  studies explore in more depth the  nature  of  the  learning mechanisms and test whether learned preferences can  be  passed on to subsequent generations of individuals.   If  such   cultural,   transgenerational  transmission   occurs,  current  theories  and  concepts  of  the  role  of  genetic  programs  in  guiding and determining reproductive  outcomes  will  have  to  re-evaluated.  New  theories  will  have  to  incorporate  the exogenetic or cultural mechanisms  deriving  from  models  of  social learning.  In that human  societies  show  analogous  dependence  on cultural  transmission,  the  results  of  these  studies will  provide  a  new  and  more  ecologically appropriate model of the evolution  of  complex  behavior.",
