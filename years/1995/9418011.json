 "awd_abstract_narration": "Garven  9418011   This proposal seeks to increase our basic understanding of the role of large-scale groundwater flow in geologic processes such as stratabound ore formation in carbonate rocks.  Ancient limestone-dolostone aquifers in North America contain significant ore deposits of lead, zinc, barite, and fluorite that appear to have origins related to the migration of deep groundwater over 10's and 100's of kilometers.  A large ore district has been the focus of exploration and intensive geologic research over the past two decades:  The Ozark Dome in southeast Missouri.  Although much has been revealed about the geologic characteristics and conditions of ore formation in this setting, much controversy still surrounds issues such as the geochemical reactions causing ore mineralization, the actual pathways for brine migration (aquifers or faults), and the mechanisms causing migration of the ore-forming fluids.  Geological and geochemical data are now abundant for this carbonate-hosted ore district.   Recent work aimed at understanding hydrogeologic processes at the basin-scale has shown that the ores in Missouri were probably formed by deep groundwater moving updip through foreland basins and rifts adjacent to the Ozark Dome (Garven et al., 1993), but the actual flow patterns have yet to be mapped at smaller scales (L<10km).  Many geochemical models have been conjectured for ore deposition in the Southeast Missouri district, yet no mechanisms have been tested in a framework that includes the effects of fluid flow and heat transport.   A primary objective of this proposal is to use recently developed hydrogeologic-geochemical modeling tools to explore and compare the paleohydrogeology of ore formation in the Southeast Missouri.  Prior NSF support of the Hydrogeology Program at Johns Hopkins University has resulted in the development of a new three-dimensional finite element code for modeling coupled groundwater and heat transport in sedimentary systems.  Additional research at JHU has resulted i n the development of a new two-dimensional, reactive flow computer code that can be used to simulate groundwater chemistry, patterns of rock alteration, and ore mineralization over geologic time.  The proposal project will apply theses tools to test conceptual models of ore formation in Southeast Missouri.",
