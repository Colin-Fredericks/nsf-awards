 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions, involving interactions between soil, plants and atmospheric gases, and their dependence on the history of land use by humans.  An important question in ecology is how the history of land use has a long-term impact on a local ecosystem.  While studies often address interactions of physiology with an organism, or of an organism with its community, we know little about the interactions across the whole range of levels from cellular chemistry to ecosystem for a single defined locale.  This collaboration brings together investigators from three different small colleges, representing atmospheric and soil chemistry, plant productivity, and plant ecophysiology.  Using the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at Harvard Forest, they address key issues of local spatial heterogeneity in chemical resources and fluxes, nutrient cycling, microclimatology, plant growth, and population patterns and species diversity.  Incorporation of the historical aspects of human land usage in the past century adds a dimension of social science.  Novel questions about the role of local heterogeneity and the unique approach to interactions between hierarchical levels raise important issues for ecosystem models.  Results will provide perspective on many issues related to global change of ecosystems, and human effects on global change.  This project also promises to immerse undergraduates from all three colleges intensively in an unusual breadth of multidisciplinary field and laboratory research.",
