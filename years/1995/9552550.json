Some programs also contain information about other sciences such as marine biology or chemistry.  The series is carried on 519 affiliate stations in 627 carriage locations in the United States and can be heard in all 50 states.  Of these stations, 315 are public radio stations and 204 are commercial stations.  It also is broadcast by the Armed Forces Radio network and by the Voice of America.     The current grant will enable the producers to enhance the series by:    - Adding programs for weekend broadcast, thereby increasing the number of programs produced each year from 260 to 365.  - Making a concerted effort to add more stations, particular commercial stations, that carry the series.  - Working with Kalmbach Publishing, fulfilling listener requests for free copies of science magazines.  - Producing and distributing classroom materials in collaboration with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific  - Conducting a second and third annual \"Earth & Sky Young Producers Contest.\"  - Expanding \"Earth & Sky's\" on-line presence on the Internet.    The writer/producer/host will continue to be Deborah Byrd and Joel Block, VP of Byrd & Block Communications, Inc., will continue as studio producer and co-host.  The principal content consultant for astronomy is Derek Wills, a McDonald Observatory astronomer, and the primary earth content consultant is Cliff Frolich, a research scientist at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics.",
