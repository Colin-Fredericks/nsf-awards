 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cutting tools form the backbone of manufacturing operations for metals, polymers, and advanced materials such as intermetallics and composites of all types. Recently, the impetus for manufacturing has increased the focus of many overseas companies on efficient methods of manufacturing. Hardness and high-temperature strength of the cutting tools increase with a decrease in WC particle size and improved dispersion of the hard second phase in the matrix. Contiguity of the tungsten carbide grains also plays an important role in the tools' performance. Hence, a variety of methods have been proposed to decrease the particle size including coprecipitation of tungsten and cobalt and subsequent carburization. However, these techniques result in the formation of embrittling (-phase complex carbide thereby resulting in inferior mechanical properties. In order to solve these problems, Materials Modification Inc., proposes the use of a synergistic combination of novel technologies that can be used to tailor properties in cutting tool inserts so that several of the problems such as contiguity between WC particles, presence of light elements at grain boundaries, and non-uniform matrix distribution will be eliminated. Phase I will concentrate on synthesis, consolidation, and evaluation of properties while Phase II will focus on further process, optimization, prototype development, field evaluation, and coordination with major manufacturers for commercialization of this technology.",
