 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yale University is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program to support a comprehensive renovation of research space for the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology.  The department, located on the first floor of the Sterling Hall of Medicine, was constructed in 1924.  Research laboratories are in poor condition, and do not support the demands of an intensive and evolving research program in integrative biology.  Members of the department perform research that is thematically integrated around the physiology of cell membranes.  At the molecular level, research focuses on molecular mechanisms of membrane proteins that function as ion channels, transporters, and signal transducers.  Investigations at the cellular level integrate data on individual membrane proteins to elucidate the mechanisms of control of cell functions such as muscle contraction, regulation of cell pH and volume and establishment of cell polarity in neurons and epithelia.  At the tissue and organ level, researchers concentrate on complex neural networks and transport of fluid and electrolytes across the epithelia.   Renovations will include changing laboratories from a series of small, oddly shaped rooms in to seven larger, flexible laboratory modules.  Two modules will be designated as core facilities, one for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and one for Imaging.  Several smaller laboratory support spaces will be renovated to accommodate cold rooms, a computer room, biological and radioactive waste holding rooms, and a telecommunications utility room.  The work will involve the removal of non-structural walls; installation of partitions; installation of modular casework; repair of floors, and installation of improved lighting.  In addition,  more receptacles will be installed as well as improved environmental air quality, temperature control, and fire protection systems.  The project will enhance the functionality of laboratory spaces, as well as provide two vital core facilities, used by seven faculty members, and a number of post doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students.  Advantages will accrue through enhanced efficiencies allowed by greater open space in the design and flexibility of laboratories, and the introduction of state-of-the-art communications links. Together with the faculty, the modernized research facilities will carry the department into the 21st century, permitting research and training programs to expand and increase in productivity.",
