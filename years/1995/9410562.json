 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neidle       Although some research on American Sign Language (ASL) syntax has  been done, the field still lacks consensus on even the most basic  questions regarding ASL phrase structure.  Many theoretical  controversies may, in fact, be a consequence of inadequate means for  written transcription and reporting of visual-gestural data.  This has  precluded both the replicability of results and accessibility of the  raw data for direct inspection by the scientific community.  The  representation of ASL signs using English-like glosses has  obliterated-and implicitly undervalued-extremely important manual and  non-manual information expressed through signing.  Glosses are  inconsistent and frequently ambiguous or misleading. Reliance on  glosses may well have given rise to incompatible and contradictory  theoretical claims found in the literature.       We will develop a prototype of a linguistically oriented  computerized multimedia database of ASL that allows simultaneous  access to raw video data and to representations of that data in  linguistically useful formats. It is our hope that our prototype will  lead to subsequent funding for the development of a large-scale sign  database, accessible through a server, via the Internet, to the ASL  research community.       We come to this task with a very specific research agenda: to  test and refine the hierarchical representation of functional  categories in ASL that has emerged from our recent studies focusing on  Agreement; grammatical relations; and Tense and Aspect.  We have  achieved sufficient understanding of the syntactic organization of ASL  to lay out the major components of its phrase structure, and to  identify what is needed to complete the picture.  To answer those  outstanding questions, we will investigate several constructions in  detail: the tag construction, rhetorical questions, and relative  clauses.  We intend to use standard methods of linguistic elicitation  and argumentation, supported by multimedia documentation of our da ta.        While the two parts of the project are different in nature, we  believe that significant progress in the understanding of ASL syntax  can only be achieved by syntactic analyses based on the kind of  rigorous attention to data that current technologies now make  possible.",
