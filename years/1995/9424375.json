 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of habitat fragmentation has been built upon an understanding of how lost habitat,  isolation of habitat patches, and increased habitat edge lead to declines in populations.  This  understanding has, in turn, formed the foundation for principles of resepve design in conservation  biology.  In order to design reserves in the future, traditional studies of fragmentation must be  augmented to include: (1) the effect of variation in patch quality in the habitat remaining on  individuals in the population, and (2) how these effects over time affect population growth or  decline.  In the arid west, and throughout much of the world, several factors including irrigation and  domestic water use, have combined to result in a general trend toward salinization of water available  for wildlife.  High salt levels have been shown to pose serious health threats to wildlife, especially  young birds.  This project will determine the capacity of young water birds to withstand various salt  loads.  The results will allow water management to predict the costs to wildlife of increased  salinization.  Eventually,  results can be integrated into population models as factors affecting  survival.  These modeling results will allow for major improvements in wetland reserve design.",
