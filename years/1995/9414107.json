 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504905  Rogers  This award supports Eric Flint, a graduate student of  Professor Craig A. Rogers in the Center for Intelligent  Material Systems and Structures, Virginia Polytechnic  Institute and State University, to spend five months  carrying out research at the German Aerospace Research  Establishment (DLR) in Braunschweig, Germany.  His host for  this period of dissertation-related research is Jorg  Melcher, Deputy Head of the Division of Adaptive Structural  Systems of the Institute of Structural Mechanics of DLR.  This Institute is possibly the strongest in Europe in the  area of adaptive structural vibration control.  Research at  CIMMS is focused on characterizing the electrical and  mechanical behavior of \"smart\" actuators as part of complex  structures.  Mr. Flint is working on intelligent design of  such smart system technology.  Research in the German  institute has concentrated on building structurally-  integrated actuators and designing control algorithms to  isolate vibration and control aeroelastic effects..  Mr.  Flint's dissertation research visit will provide an active  link between the U.S. and German research groups, giving  CIMMS access to the large test structures and other types of  stack actuators available at DLR.    The control of undesirable vibration and other behavior in  truss-like structures by passive design improvement is  reaching its technical limit.   Active control offers a way  to further improve the performance range of structures.  Adding a method of putting force into the structure creates  force paths which can be used to control and eliminate  excess vibration.  A promising approach is multi-layered  stack actuators, which consist of thin layers of active  materials that are mechanically in serial and electrically  in parallel.  This area of control-structure interaction is  of widespread interest in the U.S. because of  its potential  to significantly improve the efficiency and performance of a  wide variety of structural systems, from airplanes to   communication antennae, as well as suppressing vibration in  heavy machinery, bridges and certain types of buildings.  ***",
