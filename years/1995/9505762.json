NASA and NSF will jointly  upgrade the station software to automatically produce ozone  images every orbit as the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer -  Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) satellite passes overhead, and make them  available to users worldwide, via the INTERNET.    Approximately $96,000 is required for the project.  NASA has  provided $66,000 for the prerequisite activities that need to be  accomplished at the NASA Goddard Space Center.  This award of  $30,000 will upgrade the NASA Antarctic Interactive Support  Launch Support (NAILS) system at McMurdo Station; develop,  install, and test real-time ozone image processing software on  the NAILS; and provide documentation and training for winter-over  operators at McMurdo.    The tasks funded by this award will be provided by a NASA Goddard  contractor and reimbursed by NSF/OPP.  It is recommended that  this award be funded in FY-1995 at $30,000.",
