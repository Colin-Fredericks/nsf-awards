 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508663  Corliss   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for exchange of mathematiaal   scientists between academia and industry at different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Based   Graduate Research Assistantships provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend   part of their time in the classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting. These   awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.    Almost all systems of interest in a corporation involve many  interconnected systems and subsystems that impact the performance of the  enterprise.  The purpose of one part of this research is to investigate  the area of Hierarchical Modeling and Architectures and build a tool kit  of models that will combine the best features of analytical  queuing theory methodology; the new paradigms of object-oriented  programming techniques such as C++; advanced dynamic systems concepts; and  advanced operations research methods. A second area of research is a study of how to   manage information on a global basis to better understand consumers worldwide. This will   be done by working with a database established to facilitate learning from research through   cross-country and within-category analysis of consumer test results.",
