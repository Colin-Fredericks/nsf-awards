 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are being requested for the acquisition of a low vacuum scanning  electron microscope (SEM) with a digital image storage and output  capability. The model proposed for purchase, a JEOL JSM-5410LV, can  achieve a resolution of 4 nm in the high vacuum mode and 5.5 nm in the  low vacuum mode. Accelerating voltages range from 0.5 to 30 kV and  magnifications can be as high as 200,000X or as low as 15X. Specimen  chamber pressures vary from 270 Pa (2 Torr) to 7 X 10-4 Pa (5 X 10-6  Torr) in the low and high vacuum modes, respectively. A SEM with these  specifications has many advantages for botanical research, but the main  asset is that plant tissues can be observed directly without the need  for chemical fixation, dehydration or metal coating in the low vacuum  mode. This will not only represent a savings in preparation time, but  also will provide more accurate representations of delicate specimens  to be observed and in some cases will obviate the need to alter or  actually destroy specimens that are unique in character, e.g.,  paleobotanical material. Furthermore, digital images of specimens can  be stored electronically and added as TIFF files to databased botanical  specimen records. The high vacuum mode also can be used to provide high  resolution imaging comparable to currently-marketed, conventional SEM's  that employ a tungsten electron source.    The SEM is an indispensable instrument for systematic and morphologic  plant research. The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) requests funds to  purchase a new SEM to replace the currently used 10-year-old  instrument, which is nearing the end of its useful life. The SEM is  used at the NYBG to investigate pollen grains, spores and various plant  tissues such as epidermises, vascular elements and floral components.  Such investigations provide micromorphological data that are essential  to the research of the Garden's staff and graduate students. The  instrument also will be used for the identification of varying plant  samples as a key compo nent of paleoethnobotanical investigations and  for the purpose of supplying essential information to the public and  certain government agencies. The proposal includes detailed  descriptions of research activities and identification services  performed at the NYBG using the SEM.    Results from Prior NSF Support:  D. L. Lentz has not received an NSF grant within the last five years.",
