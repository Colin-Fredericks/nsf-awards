To facilitate these efforts, the International Geosphere-  Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the World Climate Research Programme  (WCRP), and the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change  Programme (HDP) have established a Global Change System for  Analysis, Research, and Training (START).  START is an evolving  system of regional research networks, each of which will consist  of at least one regional research center and a number of regional  research sites.  Among the most developed of these networks is  the Inter-American Institute for Global Change (IAI).  Also under  development are the European Network for Research In Global  Change (ENRICH) and the Asian-Pacific Network for Glmbal Change  Research (APN).  In addition to encouraging and supporting the  involvement of leading U.S. scientists in the IAI and other  regional research networks, the federal agencies participating in  the U.S. Global Change Research Program (US/GCRP) have sought to  facilitate these valuable international collaborations by  sponsoring the international START secretariat.  For the past few  years, operations of this activity have been supported by the  Consortium for Interdisciplinary Earth Science Information  Network (CIESIN).  Changes in CIESIN's budget have forced it to  focus on other activities, however, and as a result, the American  Geophysical Union (AGU) will provide core support for START  secretariat operations.  Funding for these activities is provided  by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, and the U.S. Department of Energy on behalf  of all participating agencies in the US/GCRP.       During its initial years of operation, the START secretariat  has played an important rol e in building the international  linkages necessary to increase the involvement in global change  studies of researchers from around the world, and especially from  developing nations.  The regional research networks are at  critical stages of development, and a strong START secretariat is  essential to continue this essential work.  AGU's sponsorship of  the START secretariat should strengthen START's foundation and  enable it to effectively attain its goals of promoting research  on the regional origins and implications of global environmental  changes and of enhancing indigenous scientific capacities for  global change research.",
