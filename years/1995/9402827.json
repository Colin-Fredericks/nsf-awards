 "awd_abstract_narration": "While much significant work has taken place in safe  monitoring  of non-real-time, conventional programs, very little has in fact  been done for real-time programs, and especially for real-time  programs that  implement complex safety-critical functions and  operate in distributed and  parallel environments. In this  project standard compiler static analyses and  prior analysis and  transformation results for reducing complexity in real-time  programs are combined to support safe and non-intrusive  monitoring of complex  real-time programs.  Existing transformations frequently  result in idling and  delaying non-functional code that is introduced to provide  time-  preserving balance across alternate branches of a conditional or  alternate combinations of resource requests.  These segments of  nonfunctional  code can be used to insert non-intrusive software  hooks to monitor real-time  execution.    The project seeks new ideas and prototyped  techniques in the areas of verification, simulation, monitoring  and debugging -  both static and dynamic. The primary focus  is techniques for safe and  non-intrusive monitoring of complex  real-time programs. Collaborative research  involving industrial  partners is pursued to validate and transfer these  results.",
