In spite  of  significant  research on  conventional  superconductors  the advent  of  high-  temperature superconductors  has  shown  that  vortex motion  is not very well understood. The initial evidence for this  was provided by measurements of the Hall effect in the  vortex state, which showed  motion  opposite  to the  direction predicted  by  conventional theory.  Subsequent  measurements have shown anomalies  in  the  Nernst effect,  as well as surprising  non-linear effects. The proposed  work will  extend  our  earlier  work  in this  field,  studying  Hall  and longitudinal  conductivity, the dynamics  of strongly-driven  vortices, vortex  motion  in  ultra-thin  superconducting  films,  vortex  motion induced  by  temperature gradients, a modified Giaever flux transformer  experiment,  and  the  effect of order-parameter symmetry  on  vortexdynamics.                                                     .  %%%  When  a  magnetic field is applied to type-II  superconductors such  as high-temperature superconductors,  it penetrates the  material  in  the form  of  vortices  containing a quantum  of magnetic flux.  Motion  of these  vortices creates an electric filed in the superconductor,  which leads,  for example, to non-zero resistivity when  current is  present. Since  most  applications of  superconductors rely on zero resistivity, understanding  of  vortex motion is important. The  research  proposed here  is  aimed  toward understanding vortex motion resulting  from  a  number of different driving forces. The resistance and Hall  resistance of  superconductors  will  be  measured, with  emphasis  on  nonlinear effects as the current is varied, to  understand the effect of pinning, vortex-vortex  interactions,  quantum  states  in  vortex  core,                  and  possible  effects of order-parameter symmetry. The motion of  vo rtices in  response  to  temperature gradients will also  be  measured,  which provides an alternative area for  testing theories of vortex motion, as well  as  providing a  unique probe for studying the internal structure of  vortices.                       .  ***",
