Software has been used for 10 years to teach cellular  biophysics to juniors majoring in engineering and science at MIT.  The software is used in lecture demonstrations, special recitation  classes held in electronic classrooms, as a basis of homework  assignments, and for more intensive research projects defined by  students.  Use of the software has greatly enhanced students'  interest in and comprehension of topics in cellular biophysics.   All the software has been developed by student programmers and is  currently available only on UNIX workstations at MIT.  The software  is written in C and XWindows.  In the current project  undergraduates and graduate students are converting this software  to run under a vendor distributed computation and visualization  software package (MAT LAB) which is available on all the common  computer platforms including Macintoshes, PCs running Microsoft  Windows, and UNIX workstations running XWindows.  The conversion  allows students and instructors to more readily customize the  software for their own use, and greatly facilitates software  maintenance for faculty.  A software textbook is being published  and distributed with floppy disks of the software.  The software  and software textbook will be companions to a new textbook on  cellular biophysics that is in preparation.  The combination should  provide a new set of educational materials for teaching cellular  biophysics to students in engineering and science.  The approach is  to provide rigorous, in-depth mathematical treatments as well as  the e mpirical basis of important biological, chemical, and physical  principles of cell biophysics.  The software together with the  software text allows students and faculty to explore these  principles in new ways.",
