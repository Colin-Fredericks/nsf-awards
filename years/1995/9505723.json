 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505723  Blau    Funds are requested to help support expenses for invited speakers  for the 54th annual symposium of the Society for Developmental  Biology (SDB), entitled, \"Genes, Development and Cancer\", which  will be held August 26-29, 1995 at the University of California at  San Diego. This year's symposium is organized by Helen M. Blau,  current President of SDB, together with Nadia Rosenthal, Associate  Professor at Harvard Medical School, and will be attended by  researchers and teachers interested in the study of development,  including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. They expect  that the meeting will be of medium size (300-400 registrants), and  they encourage junior level attendance by providing them some  financial support. The meeting will include a broad range of  topics, following the extremely successful organization of talks  and posters that was newly established for the past two years' SDB  annual meetings. Plant, animal and microbial systems will all be  represented in sessions organized around \"themes\" rather than  specific systems or organisms. A particular focus will be the  control of the cell cycle and its relationship to developmental  processes and cancer. They plan 60 scientific talks, beginning with  an opening evening keynote address. Highlighted during the next  three days will be a series of one keynote and six plenary sessions  that include eighteen exciting invited speakers. Additionally,  there will be eight \"minisymposia\" arranged in two sessions (four  minisymposia running in parallel during each session). The  minisymposia will be organized and chaired by experts in the areas  and at least two talks will be given by junior people in each, thus  providing them with an opportunity to speak at the national level.  Poster sessions will also provide opportunities for young people to  present their work. They will be available for viewing during most  of the meeting providing ample time for discussion. Reflecting the  growing role of the SDB in th e affairs and concerns of its  membership, this year's meeting will include three issue-oriented  workshops on education, the concerns of women, and on the concerns  of minorities.  ***",
