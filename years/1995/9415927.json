Project funding  will enable Dr. Kangari and one of his graduate students to  each spend a total of six months in Japan, resident at the  Shimizu Corporation, in order to conduct cooperative  research on the SMART project, a totally automated system  for high-rise building construction. The researchers will  focus their attention on: productivity improvement of the  SMART project, statistical analysis of quality enhancement  by SMART, safety improvement of the construction work  environment, and comparison of the SMART project with  similar systems in the U. S. It is expected that the  collaboration will lead to new findings and recommendations  that could assist the industry in the U. S. and Japan.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of robotics in the  construction industry. The U. S. engineer and his graduate  student will have the opportunity to become familiar with  research techniques, data, equipment, and facilities at the  Shimizu Corporation's Advanced Technology Division while  contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
