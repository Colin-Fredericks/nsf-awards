 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521649  BRUSCA   Isopod Crustacea are a very large and diverse group of invertebrate organisms that need both systematic, monographic revision and training of additional researchers.  The two investigators being supported by this award work on the family Cirolanidae (Crustacea: Peracarida: Isopida) and are the only systematic specialists for this group in the United States.  They have engaged the collaborative efforts of a European worker at the University of Copenhagen, who is the only other active worker on this group in the world.  Together they will coordinate an excellent training program, engaging students from the undergraduate through postdoctoral level.   It is anticipated that five generic revisions will be produced by student trainee workers and that they, collectively with the senior researchers will produce a phylogenetic analysis and generic level revision of family.  The research and education of one postdoctoral trainee and three graduate students will be supported and five undergraduate students will be involved and, hopefully, become interested in research and subsequent graduate studies in Systematic Biology.  Results of all research efforts will be published.  In addition, electronic dissemination of the research results, including data matrices, keys with digitized images of key characters, and bibliographic, specimen, species-level and genus-level databases will be developed and made available tia Internet.   Our knowledge of the biodiversity in this family of isopod crustacea will be markedly enhanced.  New young scientists will be trained in modern methods of systematic research.  And information will be made available that should be of utility in many other areas of research dealing with this group of organisms whose members include scavengers, predators, and even parasites of fish.",
