 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  This award supports a geophysical study of the Bransfield  Strait region of Antarctica using recently collected  multichannel seismic data.  University of Texas Institute of  Geophysics (UTIG) multichannel seismic (MCS) data (EW91-01  data) has enabled detailed analysis of structural style and  rifting processes in Bransfield Strait to be carried out.  The analysis has brought new insight to the ongoing  extensional processes in Bransfield Strait.  This project  will build on this work to consider Bransfield Strait in the  full context of a fore-arc/back-arc tectonic system.  This  project will primarily use UTIG (EW91-01) MCS data, but will  also incorporate other geophysical data from the region that  are available from the United Kingdom and Italy.  Bransfield Strait is a young basin apparently undergoing  active (intracontinental?) extension located between the  Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, a small  chain of islands to the northwest trending roughly parallel  with the Peninsula.  Although the South Shetland Islands  show no recent arc volcanism, they lie above a subduction  zone which still appears to be active, albeit with  subduction occurring at a slow rate. This tectonic setting  and interpretation of other events affecting plate motions  in the vicinity have lead to the currently-held view that  Bransfield Strait has opened as a backarc basin in response  to South Shetland Trench roll-back or retreat.  However, the  modern stress regime is unclear.  The focus of study thus far has been on the structural style  and rifting processes observed in recently-acquired UTIG  (EW91-01) MCS data in Bransfield Strait.  Initial seismic  interpretation indicates that intracrustal diapirism, as  evidenced by faulting of overlying sediment and associated  high-amplitude seismic events, may be an important element  of observed extension. Besides the significance of this  diapirism with respect to active rifting processes, it also  has implications regarding the evolutio n of the extensional  stress regime in Bransfield Strait. It is possible that  transtensional tectonics to the northeast of the Strait are  increasingly important relative to trench rollback in  driving extension in the Strait.  This project will consolidate the geophysical analysis of  Bransfield Strait and build upon it by considering the  Strait's relationship with the adjacent South Shetland  Trench and \"forearc\". EW91-01 MCS data are ideally suited to  an analysis of whether structures seen in the \"back-arc\"  relate to structures and processes at the trench and \"fore-  arc\".  A key part of this analysis will be to test the  hypothesis that trench roll-back is causing \"back-arc\"  extension in Bransfield Strait.  High quality MCS data from  Italy and the United Kingdom will be integrated with the  EW91-01 MCS data for more comprehensive areal coverage and  seismic analysis of structural style in the \"back-arc\" and  `fore-arc\". EW91-01 potential field data  will also be  incorporated in the study.  Comparison of the northern Antarctic peninsula with other  regions characterized by similar, though not necessarily  identical, active tectonic settings (e.g., Lau Basin, Gulf  of California) should allow an estimate of the relative  importance of processes of marginal basin formation and  evolution on global versus local scales.  Furthermore, the  common history that the Antarctic Peninsula Pacific margin  shares with the South American Pacific margin as parts of  the convergent plate margin of Gondwanaland means that  Bransfield Strait can be considered a modern analog for  Early to mid-Cretaceous evolution of the Rocas Verdes  marginal basin of southern Chile.  The Rocas Verdes Basin  history  is critical to understanding early stages of Andean  orogenesis.",
