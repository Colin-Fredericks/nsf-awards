 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streams are complex three-dimensional ecosystems in which surface and ground water  components are interaction the interface between the surface and subsurface affects the transfer of  water and solutes between the stream and ground water and  varies in response to variable climate.  The main objectives of this research project are to quantify the sources and flow dynamics of water at  the ground water/surface water ecotone of headwater streams and to determine biogeochemical and  ecological responses resulting from these interactions.  Three objectives are central.   First, the  hydrology of the ground water/surface water ecotone will be determined.  Three montane catchments with  different alluvial sediment types (fine-grained to coarse cobble) will be instrumented.  Hydrologic  models that characterize surface transport and exchange with the subsurface (OTIS), three-dimensional  flow dynamics within the ground water ecotone (MODFLOW), and hillslope routing of water from the  upslope to the stream (TOPMODEL) will be used.  These models will be used to describe the transient  hydrologic nature of headwater catchments and to quantify the temporal variation in ground water/  surface water exchange.  Seco nd, the three-dimensional biogeochemical structure of the ecotone will  be investigated.  They will describe the vertical distribution of  biogeochemical processes in  downwelling (ground water rechange) and upwelling (ground water discharge) reaches of streams.  In  addition, the will determine whether flooding or drying will relocate many microbial processes.  Third, they will measure the response of biotic communities to variation in the hydrologic exchange.  Specifically, studies will be undertaken to assess the community structure and biomass of benthic  algal assemblages, rates of primary production and respiration, and controls on algal community  structure and succession in the stream-aquifer interface.  The ecotone between surface waters and  ground waters is extremely important.  The terrestrial portion, the riparian zone is crucial to  improving water quality and wildlife habitat.  The aquatic component includes a dynamic subsurface  that regulates nutrient content and cycling.  ve. T  varies in response to and discharge verying 1996.",
