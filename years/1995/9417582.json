 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417582  Pichersky  Flower scents exert strong influence on plant reproductive  success, and thus are crucial determinants of yield in fruit  crops that require scent-seeking pollinators.  However, the  biosynthetic pathways of floral scents have scarcely been  investigated on the biochemical, genetic and molecular  levels.  Dr. Pichersky proposes to study scent production in  Clarkia, a genus of annual plants native to California.  Clarkia breweri is the only species in the genus with floral  scent; its flowers are visited mostly by hawkmoths.  The  odorless flowers of C. concinna, a closely related species  from which C. breweri arose, are visited mostly by  butterflies, whereas all other outcrossing Clarkia species  are pollinated by bees.  The investigator has identified two  major pathways that contribute to the floral scent of C.  breweri. One of these pathways, the subject of this propoal,  results in the production of the monoterpenes linalool and  linalool oxides.  It has been shown that this pathway also  operates in C. Concinna flowers as well, albeit at a greatly  reduced level, and it therefore appears that the evolution  of monoterpene emission in C. breweri has occurrred by up-  regulating this pathway.  To test this hypothesis, Dr.  Pichersky and his colleagues have already developed an  enzymatic assay for linalool synthase (LIS), the enzyme that  catalyzes the formation of linalool, and have purified the  protein.  They will now  develop a spectrophotometric assay  for linalool epoxidae (LIE), the enzyme that catalyzes the  formation of 6,7-linalool expoxide, an intermediate in the  formation of linalool oxides.  They will isolate and  characterize the Lis and Lie genes from both Clarkia species  and investigate the genetic and molecular control mechanisms  that govern their expression and are responsible for the  interspecific differences, using recombinant promoter - GUS  reporter gene fusion and plant transforation and DNA-protein  interaction assays.  The cellular and subce llular  localization of the enzymes will be determined using a  combination of immunological techniques.  The data obtained  will increase our understanding of the biochemical and  genetic control of flower scent production, and may lead to  future ability to manipulate these traits in agronomically  important plants.",
