In today's high-volume applications like the Internet  bulletin boards, most files are simple text files.  In the future,  files are expected to consist of hypertext documents, with  significant audio and video components.  Already, a few seconds of  low-quality audio occupy hundreds of kilobytes.  These numbers are  indicative of the large sizes of future multimedia files.  Other  applications of the future which are thought to involve large file  sizes are those arising from scientific applications, large-scale  databases and network-wide system backups.       In this proposal the principal investigators take issue with  the notion that large files should be routed as small files  conventionally are -- by breaking up the file into packets and  relying on packet routing algorithms.  They examine and propose to  study the problem of scheduling large file transfers.  Past  approaches traditionally avoid collecting information across  networks to schedule particular files, simply because the overhead  of doing so overwhelms any benefits accrued in computing optimal  schedules.  However, when file sizes are very large and are also  known in advance of transmission, it makes eminent sense to collect  information and compute good schedules, thus utilizing network  resources efficiently. The researchers will formulate a file  transfer scheduling problem, argue its importance, assess  shortcomings in the available  research on this problem and outline  issues for future research.    ***          *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking and Communications Research Program  4201 Wilson Blvd. Room 1175  Arlington Va 22230    (703) 306-1949  (703) 306-0621 (FAX)",
