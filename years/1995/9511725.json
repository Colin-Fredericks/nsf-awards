 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a cultural anthropologist from San Jose State University analyzing data collected in India on pre-college students' attitudes towards women in science fields.  The project will test theories of the underrepresentation of women in science fields against this data from over 5,000 questionnaires administered to 1,600 students in 6th, 9th and 11th grade classrooms.   Theories to be tested relate to the hypothesis of self-selection (that females avoid science due to their felt inadequacies in math), structural barriers (that females face a social definition of science as `male`), and cultural models (that the definitions of appropriate life-style and gender behavior create a `patrifocal family model` and a peer group dynamic that prevents women from choosing these fields.)    This research is important because gender disparities in professional fields limit the benefits society can expect from these fields as well as limiting the accomplishments individuals can expect from their choice of occupations.  Advances in our understanding of why women avoid science fields -- and which parts of the avoidance are determined by specific cultural features -- will help policy makers develop incentives to level the playing field.",
