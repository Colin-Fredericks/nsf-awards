 "awd_abstract_narration": "9401908  CAI         This project is aimed at developing a fast and stable pCO2  microelectrode based on a flat tip Iroxide pH microelectrode and  evaluating the accuracy and applicability of pH and pCO2 sensors  for measuring benthic carbon recycling rates and pore water CO2  chemistry.  The pCO2 microelectrode will be a marked improvement of  an earlier pCO2 sensor.  It is planned to enhance and optimize the  response rate, stability, and precision of the pCO2 electrode.  The  accuracy of the pH and pCO2 microelectrode measurements will be  evaluated by profiling various laboratory incubated sediments and  comparing the results with TCO2 concentrations from whole core  squeezing samples.  In situ measurements and evaluation also will  be conducted in two coastal environments.  A goal in the future is  not only to collect high resolution and artifact-free in situ  profiles with microelectrodes, but also to over-determine the pore  water carbonate system by combining the in situ microelectrode  measurements (O2,pH, and pCO2) and the in situ sampling techniques  (TA, TCO2, and nutrients) in a single device.  The measurements  will define the O2/C/N ratios during organic carbon early  digenesis.  This strategy will also give the three state-of-the-art  approaches, microelectrode, whole core squeezing, and benthic  chamber incubation, a reliability and internal consistency check.   This combined approach is essential for determining benthic  response to the seasonal changes of C input and in delineating  controls over the pore water carbonate system and CaCO3 preser-  vation and dissolution.",
