 "awd_abstract_narration": "9524061  Vandermeer  Most global warming models predict an increased frequency and intensity of tropical storms.   The frequency of hurricanes will almost certainly have a long-term effect on the biodiversity of tropical rain forests.   Understanding the details of post-hurricane succession will enable a more accurate assessment of the exact nature of these impacts on biodiversity.  This project continues an ongoing project which has followed recovery and reassembly of a tropical forest since Hurricane Joan struck in 1988.  The forest is now entering a new phase of recovery where competition has become more intense and competitive thinning is beginning as the forest enters another stage of succession.  Measurements of tree diameters and crown heights of a large number of marked trees will test several theories of competitive thinning.  Biodiversity will be measured for arthropods, and physical and chemical factors will be followed in the soils and at ground level.  This research will provide a basis on which to predict the biodiversity consequences of increased hurricane frequencies.",
