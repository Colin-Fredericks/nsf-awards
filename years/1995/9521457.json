This award will support  the participation of ten U.S. scientists/engineers and two U.S.  graduate students, each of whom will present scientific papers.    The reduction of natural disasters in water environments is a  matter of great concern in many parts of the world.  In the  United States, the need for minimizing such natural disasters has  been given special attention following the great flood of the  Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois Rivers in 1993.  Because of  the 1993 flood, interest in the scientific and engineering  aspects of disaster prevention or reduction due to flooding also  has grown in other countries, as well.  Prevention and reduction  of disaster due to the failure of dams and other causes also is  of interest.    The joint seminar will provide an opportunity for U.S.  participants to exchange scientific information with Korean  scientists and engineers on problems in the field of this joint  seminar.  The participants from both countries are recognized  experts whose presentations will be of mutual interest and  benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-  Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of  mutual interest and benefit.  Korean participation is supported  by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) with the  cooperation of the Korea Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO) and  the Korea Institute of Construction Technology (KICT).  ***",
