 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intersymbol Interference (ISI) is caused by multipath effects or  bandwith constraints and presents a major obstacle in modern high-  speed digital transmission.  When the communication link is also  fading with time, it is essential for the equalizer to be able to  follow the channel's time variations.  While several adaptive and  blind methods have been proposed for time-invariant or slowly  fading channels, relatively little attention has been given to the  rapidly fading case.    The major goal of this project is to use basis expansion ideas as  a tool for the equalization of rapidly varying channels.  In this  framework, each time-varying coefficient is expanded into a set of  basis sequences, and the expansion parameters are estimated using  novel adaptive and decision directed schemes.  Next, basis  expansions are combined with time-varying correlations and higher-  order statistics to address time-varying, blind equalization in a  rapidly fading environment.  Finally, based on physical intuition  and experimental data, the selection of the \"best\" basis which  captures optimally the channel's dynamics is being addressed.   Complex exponentials are being investigated for the mobile radio  channel, while wavelet expansions are being considered for channels  with abrupt changes, and are being compared with stochastic channel  modeling approaches.",
