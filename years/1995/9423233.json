Columbia Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory  Title: The Theory of the General Circulation of the Atmosphere    The proposal id submitted for consideration as Small Grants for  Exploratory Research (SGER) because it contains noval ideas that  need to be tested and which, if proven true, would significantly  enhance our understanding of the climate.  The proposed research  continues the development of a climate theory based on an  hypothesis of Lorenz (1960) that the turbulent wind velocity is the  maximum allowed in the earth's atmosphere.  As turbulence  efficiently mixes properties that are conserved with fluid motions,  it is further hypothesized that the earth's climate may approach  the maximally mixed state characterized by a minimum number of  degrees of freedom.  To test this hypothesis, the theory thus seeks  to derive this climatic state that is consistent with balance  requirements imposed by fundamental conservation laws.    The proposed research here constitutes the part of the theory that  derives the atmosphere structure.  Although this structure may not  be uniquely determined without full closure of the system, it is  nevertheless demonstrated that, even without such considerations,  the model atmosphere is sufficiently constrained that it resembles  the observed atmosphere, including its division into dominant air  masses and the distribution of the zonal mean wind.  The theory  thus provides a plausible explanation of the general circulation of  the atmosphere that is logically closed, i.e. essentially free of  empirical constraints.",
