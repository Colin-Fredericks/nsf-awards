UMBC's highly successful Meyerhoff  Scholarship Program, initiated in 1988, is designed to facilitate  the recruitment and retention of minority scholars into these  fields.    NSF support is requested to expand and enhance current efforts.   Four groups of forty-four outstanding African American students  scholars would be financially and academically supported, through  the bachelor's degree, with the understanding that they will  continue on to a graduate or professional degree.  Each student  would receive strong academic enrichment and support, beginning  with a summer bridge program prior to entering the University.  A  UMBC faculty member would work with each student on a significant  research project, and each students would be assigned a practicing  scientist or engineering professional as a mentor.    UMBC has received support from individuals and corporations for  this program and is committed to continuing its efforts.  These  students will form a cadre of talented professionals who will move  into leadership roles in their chosen fields in science and  engineering.  They will also serve as group/role models to  succeeding classes of students scholars.  ***",
