 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521755  Ashe  The rove beetle (family Staphylinidae) subfamily Aleocharinae, which currently comprise over 900 genera and 12, 000 species throughout the world, is currently the most taxonomically difficult large group of beetles (Coleoptera).  However, aleocharines are abundant, and often dominant, components of the biological diversity of many microhabitats in both temperate and tropical regions throughout the world, and their abundance and diversity suggests that they may have substantial ecological impact. Aleocharines have diversified along many evolutionary pathways and offer outstanding opportunities for addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary biology and about the origin and modification of behavior, ecological associations, and their roles in ecosystem structure and function and patterns of biological diversity. The ability to address these issues is hampered by the inability of even the most experienced staphylinid worker to identify genera and higher taxa of aleocharines and the virtual lack of information about evolutionary relationships of aleocharines, especially at higher taxonomic levels. To address these problems, and to provide for training of the next generation of systematists, this project will: 1) provide comprehensive training for a Postdoctoral associate, and two graduate students, 2) provide identification guides to the genera od Aleocharinae of North America and Mexico, 3) make the character and image database available on-line through an Internet connection and 4) produce an analysis of evolutionary relationships of the higher taxa of basal lineages of aleocharines.   %%%  The project's outlines will provide access to basic systematics and basal phylogeny that could encourage additional research on the wide variety of aleocharine systematics, evolution and ecology, and the role that these beetles play in ecosystem structure and function, that previously could not be addressed. The training aspects will produce knowledgeable specialists in the Staphylinidae, as  well as excellent modern systematists that will be highly competitive for future positions.   ***",
