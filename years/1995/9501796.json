 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501796  Feng  The project will involve the application of new technologies  to the construction and retrofit of civil infrastructure  systems, specifically, high-rise buildings and bridges.  These new technologies will be applied to reduce the hazards  posed by wind and earthquakes on these structures with the  ultimate objective of improving public safety and reducing  both functional and financial losses.  Two projects entitled  \"Innovative Vibration Control Systems for Buildings\" and  \"Seismic Protective Systems for Bridges\" were chosen for  study during the award period.  Both will present  significant technical and theoretical challenges common to  interdisciplinary civil infrastructure research, and both  will involve collaborative efforts with industry, government  and allied disciplines.  The result of these studies should  yield significant contributions to the field of civil  engineering as well as lasting societal benefit.  The  educational portion of this project will address the need to  develop innovative and interdisciplinary civil engineering  curricula.  The main features of the plan are to develop new  curricula and upgrade the traditional curricula to reflect  the latest scientific and technological advances, design new  educational modules which effectively integrate classroom  instruction with research experience, introduce both  undergraduate and graduate students to interdisciplinary  research and encourage field and experimental study.  The  success of these efforts will enrich the educational  experience of students at all levels, attract promising  candidates to the field of civil engineering and produce  capable and innovative engineers.  ***",
