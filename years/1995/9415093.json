 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri at Columbia is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of chemical research facilities.  The Chemistry Department is housed in two buildings, Schlundt Hall and the Chemistry Building, erected in 1924 and 1972 respectively. As part of a comprehensive effort to improve the scientific capabilities of the department, the University will construct new teaching laboratories and renovate the Chemistry Building, the NSF project site.  The four-story structure includes a combination of research, teaching, and laboratory support facilities. NSF funds will be used entirely for the restoration of research and research training space within the building. Current deficiencies that impede research consist of:  inefficient laboratories and support facilities that were not originally design to handle increased research activity, inadequate ventilation and fume hood systems, obsolete mechanical systems, and the absence of fire protection systems.  Reconfiguration of laboratories will provide safer conditions for all research faculty and students. Not only will the renovation correct inadequacies and address ADA compliance issues, but the project will allow for the consolidation of departmental research activities,  and the centralization of instrumentation to be shared by all research teams in one location. Research programs impacted by the renovation include: supramolecular chemistry, environmental chemistry, radiochemistry and ultra fast  laser spectroscopy.  Approximately fourteen faculty members, eight post-doctoral fellows, 90 graduate students and 105 undergraduates will benefit from the modernization.",
