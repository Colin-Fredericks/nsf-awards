 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, coalition of faculty from three universities has  developed a new laboratory for signals and systems courses for  Electrical and Computer Engineering majors.  This laboratory  significantly improves signals and systems education by having  students design and implement systems that solve real engineering  problems.  Required signals and systems courses are very  important to electrical and computer engineering majors because  they provide the foundation for important subjects such as  communications, systems, control, and signal processing.   Unfortunately, these courses do not have laboratories or hands-on  activity associated with them.   However, it is very important to  have today's engineering students \"do\" real engineering problems  because they are motivated best by work that they readily  appreciate as relevant and useful.  This project builds a  laboratory for introductory signals and systems courses, which  has students design and implement solutions to real engineering  problems.   They test their designs on their own speech and music  waveforms and listen to the results.   The laboratory is built  around computer simulation software and data conversion hardware  using high-performance personal computers.   Problems are  assigned as homework projects without formal laboratory meetings,  therefore avoiding difficult curriculum changes.   Students in  this new laboratory focus on solving real system design problems  with the concepts, mathematical descriptions and block diagrams  that are the tools of a signals and systems course.   Audio  output helps them connect the frequency domain to reality by  associating the spectrum analyzer of their ears with what they  see from output plots.",
