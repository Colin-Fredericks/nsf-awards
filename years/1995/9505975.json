 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  NCR-9505975, California Institute of Technology, \"Coding Theory and Applications\", PI-McEliece:  Three topics in modern coding theory are studied:  Trellis complexity of convolutional codes, subgroup subcodes of Reed Solomon codes, and turbo-codes.  The first involves a novel way of reducing the Viterbi decoding complexity of a large class of convolutional codes, including many  codes currently used in practice (e.g. punctured convolutional codes and the unit memory convolutional codes).  This is a surprising spinoff of the large body of recent work on the trellis complexity of block codes.  The second considers a new class of algebraic block codes, the class of \"SSRS\" codes, which promises to break the \"bottleneck\" of Reed-Solomon codes, i.e. the restriction that the code length be no more that the size of the code  alphabet.  Finally the new class of \"turbo-codes\", recently introduced in  France, will be studied.  Turbo codes represent the biggest single step  forward in many years in high gain low complexity coding.  It is hoped to  develop a credible theory to explain the remarkable experimental results and enable the work to be pressed forward systematically.\r\n*****************************************************************************\r\nAubrey M.
