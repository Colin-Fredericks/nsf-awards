 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has demonstrated that the well-founded  semantics  and its equivalent, the alternating fixpoint semantics, can be  implemented efficiently on deductive databases (relational  databases with  additional function free logical rules, which may  introduce intertwined  negation and recursion). Logic programming  is a natural candidate for a  database programming language  because it shares the relational paradigm. This  project is  studying extensions to traditional logical languages that are  likely to be useful for database programming, including nested  relations and  aggregation.    Deductive rules involving aggregation as a primitive operation  permit a natural and concise expression of several well-known  optimization  problems, such as shortest paths in a graph.  However, implementation of  such primitive operations is  complicated by the fact they they occur inside  recursion; that  is, the relation being aggregated within a deductive rule is  also  being defined in part by that same rule. Greater complications  are added  if the rules may contain negation. This project is  developing algorithms to  implement aggregation efficiently within  recursion and negation.    Collection  types are a valuable adjunct to deductive  database languages, and are  closely related to aggregation,  nested relations, and complex objects.  A collection  type is any data type suitable for representing  a finite  set. With collection types, a language can manipulate relations  (and  nested relations) directly. This research is designing a language to  integrate  collection types with deductive database rules, with  sufficient restrictions on  the collection-typed objects to make  efficient implementation possible.   For example, the language  excludes unification among partially instantiated sets.  Integration of the functional programming paradigm and  the relational  paradigm of logic programming is also being  studied. Data typing plays a  central role. In logic programming  functional terms are normally  uninterpreted, and specific data  types are not declared. The main idea is to  establish contexts in  which functional terms are interpreted as user-defined  functions.  The objective is to provide a high level language that can  manipulate sets and relations in a convenient and understandable  way, with  sufficient power to solve practical applications.",
