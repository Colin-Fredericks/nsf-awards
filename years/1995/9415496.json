 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing need for effective formal methods of  constructing correct and reliable computer programs. This need  becomes  especially crucial in the case of concurrent,distributed,  real-time, or, more  generally, reactive systems. Such systems  typically involve a number of  delicate and subtle aspects such as  parallel operation of distinct, often  geographically dispersed  components, and ongoing, ideally nonterminating  computation where  each component repeatedly interacts with neighboring  components  in order to achieve a global goal or maintain a global invariant.   Many safety critical real-world applications programs can be  counted among the  reactive systems. Examples include: computer  operating systems, computer  network communication protocols, air  traffic control systems, on-board avionics  control systems, as  well as automated banking networks.    The approach taken  in this research to reasoning about such  reactive systems centers around the  use of Temporal Logic, a  formalism that can be used for specification,  verification,  design, and synthesis of reactive systems. This research  investigates to what extent efficient automation of temporal  reasoning about  reactive systems is possible. Considerable  attention is devoted to the  following particular aspects:  attacking the state explosion problem, reasoning  about many  homogenous processes, real-time reasoning, and synthesis of  reactive systems.",
