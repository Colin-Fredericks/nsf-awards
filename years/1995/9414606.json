 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414606  Prasad       High yield, high performance microelectronic devices require  large diameter silicon (Si) wafers with a high degree of  crystallographic perfection, uniform and low axial and radial  resistivity gradients, low oxygen impurity and highly uniform  electrical and mechanical properties.  Many of the inhomogenities  in crystals grown by the Czochralski (CZ) method (which is used to  manufacture almost all Si crystals for microelectronics  applications) can be attributed to the non-steady nature of the  growth kinetics due primarily to the continuous change in melt  height from start to finish.  As the CZ process is scaled up to  grow large diameter crystals, the forces which produce flow  instabilities and oscillations become much stronger.  To overcome  many of the shortcomings of the conventional CZ process, a  polysilicon pellets-feed continuous Czochralski (CCZ) growth  process will be investigated.  By reducing the melt height and  keeping it fixed, this novel process can suppress many kinds of  unsteady kinetics and inhomogenities.  A comprehensive program of  modeling, simulation, design and experiments will be performed to  develop a commercially viable CCZ process.  To simulate three-  dimensional (3D) transport processes in an irregular domain with  free and/or moving boundaries and interfaces, a high resolution  computer model based on multizone adaptive grid generation and  curvilinear finite volume discretization will be developed.  It  will then be possible to examine accurately the effects of melt  flow recirculation and oscillations, heat transfer from the melt  and crystal, crystal/melt interface shape and its dynamics,  impurity transport, and pellets melting in a range of parameters  suitable for industrial processes.  Non-invasive visualization of  temperature (using liquid crystals) and flow fields, digital image  processing and heat transfer experiments in an apparatus simulating  the CZ system to obtain basic information on the physics of the  process will  be investigated.  Computer reconstruction of 3D images  from two-dimensional horizontal and vertical pictures will be  attempted.  The results from numerical computations and laboratory  experiments will help in designing the CCZ growth experiments which  will be conduced in a commercial puller at an industrial research  facility to determine the optimal process conditions.       This project builds on prior research demonstrating the  feasibility of continuous Czochralski growth of silicon single  crystals using small pellets instead of melting a large block of  silicon.  Anticipated high probability of success is further  demonstrated by the industrial partner's commitment to allocate a  researcher to this project.  Successful completion of this project  will break down the current technological barrier limiting the size  of silicon single crystal that can be manufactured and lays the  foundation for converting the current batch process to truly  continuous process with the potential to increase the yield as well  as quality.  Successful commercialization of this technology will  enable the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge in this important  electronics market.",
