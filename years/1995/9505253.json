 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505253  Gabai       The investigation focuses on several of the central open  problems in three-dimensional manifold topology.  E.g., is the  homeomorphism type of a hyperbolic three-manifold determined by its  homotopy type?  Is a hyperbolic metric on a closed 3-manifold  unique up to isotopy?  Is every closed irreducible aspherical  3-manifold covered by 3-space?  Do theorems about Haken manifolds  or 3-manifolds with taut foliations generalize to manifolds with  essential laminations?       A three-dimensional manifold is a space M with the following  property.  Any sufficiently small observer in M believes that he is  living in standard three-dimensional space.  This assumes that the  observer is nearsighted, i.e. his vision is restricted to small  distances.  Despite the fact that 3-manifolds have an extremely  simple local structure, their global structures are in general  quite complex.  Though great efforts have been made in this century  to understand the nature of 3-manifolds and much progress has been  made these last 40 years, mathematicians still appear to be quite  far from a complete understanding.  This project addresses some of  the most fundamental open problems in the subject.  ***",
