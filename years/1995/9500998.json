The intent of this program is to encourage the early development  of academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The research  this investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving  bioremediation in management of hazardous wastes.  He plans on an  experimental approach to determine whether the controlled  addition of environmentally benign organic substances can enhance  the biodegradability of less benign pollutants such as benzene,  toluene, xylenes and trichlorethylene.    The research this investigator plans on conducting is expected to  be used in design of biologically-based processes for treatment  of water that contains hazardous organic substances.  The goal of  the educational component of this project is to incorporate  recent advances in knowledge gained from research into  traditional introductory courses for undergraduate engineering  students.  His plan involves revision of traditional courses,  developing new courses based on use of novel chemical and  biological processes and constructing a unit operations  laboratory that can be used for both undergraduate and graduate  courses.  ***",
