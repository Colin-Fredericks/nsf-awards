The research focus will be  on issues relating to the effects of atomic beams and strain  on thin film growth.  By using a low-energy atomic beam, a  pulse of energy may be delivered locally to the growth  surface and tune the kinetics.  The effect of such atomic  beams on low temperature growth, on three-dimensional  clustering mechanisms and on the crystallization of  amorphous material and regrowth phenomena will be  investigated.  In addition, the effects of biaxial strain on  the initial stages of growth and step distributions will be  investigated.  The main tool of study will be molecular  dynamics simulations using realistic potentials, coupled  with ab initio molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo  simulations.    The educational component includes the development of a  course on modern numerical methods in physics, development  of educational videos related to the research and research  experiences for undergraduates.  %%%  This is a CAREER award for computer simulation studies of  the growth of thin films of semiconducting material.  Understanding the growth mechanisms of these films is  vitally important for the semiconductor industry in addition  to providing fundamental insights into the underlying  physical phenomena.  The educational component includes the  development of a new course on computer simulation for  physics, the production of educational videos related to the  research and the incorporation of undergraduates in the  research process.  ***",
