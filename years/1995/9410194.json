 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410194  Holmstrom    This project covers three related topics in the economic theory  of organization: the design of incentive systems when account is  taken of the wide range of tasks and activities that employees  may engage in; financial intermediation; and a theory of trust in  face-to-face economic exchange. The first part explores the use  of implicit incentives and their interaction with explicit  incentives; the optimal design of jobs and job related  constraints with an eye on the current trend towards increased  worker empowerment and less bureaucracy; and the optimal  allocation of activities across firms, with the goal of  explaining where boundaries between firms are drawn.  The second  why firms use different sources of financing, what factors  influence their relative roles and how severe financial crises  affect real investment and the choice between funding options.   Third part explores why verbal promises are useful in economic  exchange.  It is well known that most contracts are not enforced  in court but depend on honoring one's word.  Will contracts be  simpler or modified in other ways when they rely on promises?",
