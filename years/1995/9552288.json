 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funding to equip the School of Engineering  and Technology Manufacturing Laboratory with a versatile rapid  prototyping facility to allow undergraduate students from the  departments of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering,  and technology to gain hands-on experience with modern Computer  Integrated Manufacturing processes, including Simulation based  Design, Design for Manufacture and Assembly, and Agile and  Concurrent engineering strategies.    By using the rapid  prototyping equipment, our engineering and technology graduates  can be better prepared for the rapidly changing manufacturing job  market.   Faculty teaching design, systems engineering, and  manufacturing courses will be able to demonstrate in real-time  concepts crucial to improving product designs.   Therefore, the  new equipment significantly enhances the manufacturing education  at the university and further improves its excellent record of  educating and training students.",
