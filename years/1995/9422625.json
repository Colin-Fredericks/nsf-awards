 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of practical  programming  tools in an integrated and open framework. Tools  that support modern  programming must deal with large  systems, multiple programmers, multiple  languages, a mixture  of existing and new code, and multiple processes and  threads. The work combines a variety of tools in an open,  extensible, and  powerful setting using control integration  and a simple form of data  integration based on fragments.  Fragments are semantically significant portions  of a program  artifact: definitions or scopes in a source file, sections  of  documentation file, rules in a configuration description,  etc.  The approach to  integration identifies such fragments  and keeps references to them in a simple  and small central  database.  This information is augmented with the data  necessary to identify fragments using database queries,  essentially usedef  chains and small amounts of tool-specific  information. In addition to fragment  and control  integration, the environment provids common facilities for  defining and managing the files and contexts that make up a  project, and a  common editor for all software artifacts.  The project manager serves as a front  end for managing  version control, configuration management, and multiple  programmers.  The common editor provides high quality  typography along with  support for hypertext links and  graphics.    On top of this environmental  framework, this project  investigates the development and utility of a variety  of  programming tools.  The research extends visualization tools  using a 3D  visualization package developed under a previous  NSF grant.  A single front end  would allow the programmer to  specify both what information (from a variety of  sources)  should be visualized and how it should be presented for each  particular application. Experiments measure the ffectiveness  of visualizations  for understanding both the static  structure and the dynamic behavior of complex  systems.  A  third set of tools involves editing.  The project would  extend an  existing editor to allow programmers to view the  system as a single electronic  document with dynamic and  static links connecting the various software  artifacts.  These links would be defined either by built-in queries  (e.g. go to  the definition of a name), by user-defined  queries, or by static links.",
