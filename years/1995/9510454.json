 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510454  Uemura    Muon  spin relaxation (muSR) measurements are proposed to study ground  state  properties  and  spin fluctuations in geometrically  frustrated  spin  systems,  such  as  the Kagome lattice  and  triangular  lattice  antiferromagnets strontium chromium (x) gallium (12-x) oxygen (19) and  lithium nickel oxygen (2), as well as in low-dimensional spin systems,  including  the doped Haldane spin chain system (yttrium, calcium)  (2)  barium  nickel  oxygen  (5), the spin-Peierls  system  (copper,  zinc)  germanium  oxygen (3), the one-dimensional organic conductor  aluminum  carbon  (60),  and  the spin-ladder cuprates, strontium  (n-1)  copper  (n+1)  oxygen (2n).  This proposal aims to reveal details of suggested  spin-liquid  ground  states as well as to  elucidate  the  process  of  destruction  of  the  many-body  singlet  ground  state  due  to   the  introduction  of  imperfections or doped charge  carriers.   The  muSR  experiments  will  be performed at the TRIUMF facility  in  Vancouver,  Canada.  %%%  Certain configurations of atomic arrangements in solids, such  as  the  triangular  or  Kagome lattice, tend to prevent the alignment  of  the  magnetic  moments  of  the  atoms  placed  on  it,  promoting  dynamic  fluctuations of the moments (spins).  Similarly, magnetic ordering  is  suppressed in low-dimensional arrangements of spins, such as  a  chain  of  magnetic  moments.  In these systems, novel magnetic  behavior  is  expected  at  low  temperatures, including  the  possibility  for  the  occurrence  of a \"quantum spin liquid\", which is a disordered  liquid-  like  dynamic state of the moments due to quantum-mechanical  effects.  This  proposal  aims  to  reveal the nature of  such  exotic  magnetic  behavior  by  utilizing a novel technique called muon spin  relaxation  (muSR),  which  probes  the magnetism within solids  with  radioactive  elementary  particles,  muons, produced  at  a  high-intensity  proton  accelerator (the TRIUMF facility in Vancouver , Canada).",
