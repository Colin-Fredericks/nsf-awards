 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to design, build, and use a novel \"optical trapping  interferometer\" which integrates the following functions: 1) real-time,  computer-enhanced light microscopic imaging; 2) multiple laser light  traps; 3) a dual-beam interferometer for measuring nm-scale  displacements of microscopic beads; and 4) a feedback system for  detection of force fluctuations in the pN range. The main use of this  instrument will be to detect and characterize pN forces and nm  movements generated by single microtubule motor proteins, including  kinesin, kinesin-related proteins, and cytoplasmic dynein. In cells,  such proteins carry intracellular cargos and walk in a particular  direction along microtubules; in so doing they accomplish various forms  of cell motility, such as vesicle transport and mitosis.    The proposed instrumentation is required for the PI's research on  microtubule motors and vesicle transport. A long-term goal of this  research is to determine the molecular mechanism of motility and force  production by kinesin, kinesin-related proteins, and cytoplasmic  dynein. Using the proposed instrumentation, the fundamental molecular  mechanical events which occur during movement will be defined and  related to intermediates in the ATP hydrolytic cycle. These molecular  mechanics will be related to the primary structure of the motor domains  by analysis of mutant proteins.    The proposed instrumentation is based on a prototype optical trapping  interferometer developed collaboratively between the PI's lab and the  lab of Dr. Steve Block at the Rowland Institute for Science (which  funded the instrument). Dr. Block has recently moved to Princeton with  the prototype instrumentation. The new optical trapping interferometer  will perform the same functions as the earlier version, including  manipulation of beads carrying single motor proteins onto microtubules  (Block et al, 1990) and detection of 8 nm steps corresponding to single  kinetic cycles of the kinesin motor (Svoboda et al, 1993). In  addition,  the new instrument will have fundamentally new features, the most  important of which are: 1) Accomodation of an improved assay system  which avoids direct irradiation of the motor protein; 2) feedback from  the interferometer output to the laser trap, enabling measurement of  isometric force fluctuations during the mechanochemical cycle of single  motors, 3) increased stiffness to diminish Brownian noise and thereby  reveal more details of the stepping process; and 4) three independent  laser light traps to allow a variety of manipulations.    The new instrument will be constructed around a custom optical bench  light microscope, developed by the PI and capable of high resolution  differential interference contrast (DIC) or fluorescence imaging.  Single microtubules (or possibly single actin or intermediate  filaments, or single strands of DNA or RNA) will be imaged in real time  by digital enhancement of the light microscope image. Two laser light  traps will be used to capture, apply tension to, and manipulate single  microtubules (or possibly other filaments) via latex bead \"handles\"  attached to the filament surface. Trapped microtubules will be  manipulated onto fixed bead surfaces carrying single motor molecules. A  third laser beam will be used as the source of coherent, polarized  illumination for an interferometer that will track the position of the  trapped microtubule (with precision better than 1 nm at 100 Hz) as it  is driven by the motor on the fixed bead surface. In other assays, the  third laser beam will be used simultaneously as the source of the  interferometer and as a light trap to manipulate beads carrying single  biological motors onto the surface of a trapped filament held in  solution. The latter use of the trap will benefit the investigation of  processive DNA enzymes using in vitro motility assays.    The proposed research bears on several fields: 1) The molecular  mechanism of cell motility, including muscle contraction and the  operation of processive DN A enzymes; 2) the mechanism of enzymatic  catalysis; 3) nanotechnology and surface chemistry.",
