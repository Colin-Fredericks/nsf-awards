 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mott  9420862  Experiments will be conducted to determine the relationships  between the functioning of a single stoma and the responses  of stomatal conductance in an intact leaf.  Recent studies  provide evidence that stomata in a leaf interact in complex  and unexpected ways such that changes in whole leaf stomatal  conductance may not reflect proportional changes for all  stomata.  Two levels of stomatal interactions will be  investigated.  First, interactions that could lead to  synchronized behavior of all stomata within an areole (the  smallest area of the leaf surrounded by veins) will be  investigated.  Several studies have shown that such behavior  is relatively common (e.g., patchy stomatal closure), and  Dr. Mott has  proposed a hydraulic mechanism by which the  movements of stomata within an areole could be synchronized.  This hypothesis will be tested using epi-illumination  microscopy to observe movements of individual stomata in a  intact leaf.  One or more stoma will be induced to open or  close by altering its light environment using small glass  fibers.  The response of that stoma and the responses of  neighboring stomata will be recorded using video digitizing  equipment.    The effect of changes in transpiration for one part of a  leaf on stomatal conductance of other parts of the leaf will  be determined using gas-exchange techniques.  Changes in  transpiration induced by changes in humidity, carbon  dioxide, and light will be used to evalluate the role of  hydraulically-based mechanisms in producing the conductance  responses observed in preliminary experiments.  Fluorescence  imaging will be used to quantify the spatial distribution of  stomatal conductance over the leaf surface.    Finally, cellular automaton modeling will be used to  simulate interactions among stomata and among areoles and  scale from single stoma dynamics to spatial and temporal  variations in whole leaf conductance.  Because the model is  computationally demanding, modeling work will be conduct ed  at an NSF Supercomputer Center.  Results from the  experiments described above will be used to structure the  model, and model predictions will be compared to  experimental results to test proposed mechanisms.",
