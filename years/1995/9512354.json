 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major need exists in the training of minority students in the  sciences. Delaware State University, a public land-grant institution,  provides an ideal setting for initiating a significant change in the  number of appropriately prepared students. With the opening in 1995 of  a new Science Center (750 sq. ft. new laboratory space dedicated to  this training facility), we propose to develop programs that will train  students, both undergraduate and graduate, in the uses of molecular  biology techniques. We selected this area due to its broad application  in biological sciences and the anticipated benefit to minority students  in particular who have been traditionally under-represented in  molecular biology fields. The expertise of the faculty is well suited  to train students in the diverse uses of the techniques of molecular  biology. Although the listed investigators will be the initial users,  the facility will be open to all faculty in order to develop the  scientific expertise needed for the students to become competitive in  their career advancement. Obtaining this equipment and the  establishment of the training facility for students will also form the  basis for additional research grant moneys to enhance minority training  in the sciences and allow us to more aggressively pursue industrial  collaborations. The proposal specifically describes the needs and  rationale for the equipment and the broad principles of training that  will be used.",
