 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511759  Riggs  A problem of major importance in biochemistry is the determination of the mechanisms by which different parts of proteins communicate with one another. The interactions between subunits that give rise to cooperative ligand binding in vertebrate hemoglobins (Hbs) have been intensely  studied for many years and have become relatively well understood. Although not widely recognized, additional ligand-dependent interactions between tetramers are widespread in many avian reptilian and amphibian Hbs.  This project seeks to determine both the structural basis and functional consequences of these interactions between Hb tetramers by means of site-directed mutagenesis, functional analysis, and X-ray crystallography. These tetramer-tetramer complexes have novel subunit contacts that perturb the heme-pockets in such a way that the oxygen affinity is greatly reduced. The ligand-linked dissociation to a higher affinity tetramer forms the basis for a new mechanism of cooperativity of ligand binding. We seek to determine the structural basis of these properties because they are of considerable physiological importance: they make possible delivery of oxygen to the tissues at higher pressures than would otherwise be possible. Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to construct human Hb mutants to have similar properties. Additional studies include the Hbs of the lamprey (vertebrate), an echinoderm, Caudina, and the diving beetle, Buenoa, all of which comprise monomers which undergo either mixed or self-association on ligand removal. Each of these systems possesses unique features that together with the self-associating tetrameric Hbs, will be used to generate the general rules that dictate how ligand binding is linked to dissociation. The long-term goal is to understand fully the structural and energetic basis for these ligand-linked dissociation processes that comprise important models for understanding allosteric regulation.   %%%          Many physiological processes, including oxygen transpor t, are mediated by  proteins that are composed of two or more subunits.  Self-association of these proteins to larger structures or dissociation into subunits often greatly changes the functional properties of the proteins.  The control of these changes comprises an important way in which the properties of these proteins can be changed to meet changing physiological requirements.  This proposal is designed to measure the self-association of bird and lamprey hemoglobins.  The efficiency of oxygen transport from lungs to tissues in birds is depends on this self-association which makes it possible for bird hemoglobins to deliver up to 30% more oxygen than is possible with human hemoglobin.   This is an evolutionary adaptation to meet the stringent evolutionary adaptation of flight.   This proposal aims to use procedures of DNA technology to determine exactly which amino acids in the protein structure are important for these unusual physiological properties.  Mutant hemoglobins will be constructed with amino acid changes in order to understand the self-association.  ***",
