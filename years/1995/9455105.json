 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD (PGCC) will hold a  five-day workshop in summer 1995, Integrating Computer Software  into Lower Division Engineering and Engineering Technology Courses.   The workshop will be for 20 faculty from engineering, engineering  technology, and science, who teach lower division courses in  community colleges and senior institutions in the middle Atlantic  states.    The workshop will include lecture/demonstration, visualization  activities, and computer work with Math CAD, MicroCAP, LogicWorks,  and PADS.  Each participant will bring three problems from three  different courses to the workshop.  These will be solved during the  workshop and developed into a \"book\" of practice problems and  solutions which will be given each participant.  Applications will  be shown to Statics, Dynamics, Strength of Materials,  Thermodynamics, Electronics, and Physics Courses.  Workshop  participants will also be introduced to Internet and its uses and  to the work of the NSF Engineering Coalition, Engineering Coalition  of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL).   Follow-up activities include the development by PGCC of a computer  bulletin board to allow workshop faculty and other faculty in their  home institutions to communicate and assist one another,  presentations by workshop participants in their home institutions,  and presentations and papers for professional meetings.",
