 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth 2010-Your Future:  Population Growth and Environmental Impact  is a four-week residential camp designed for 50 seventh and eight  grade minority students from Missouri.  The purpose of the camp is  to increase participant awareness and knowledge of environmental  issues and how science, technology, and mathematics are involved.   In addition, the camp will provide career guidance and motivation  for students to remain in school and continue the study of science  and mathematics.  Earth 2010 will involve a detailed environmental  study of Stone, Taney, and Greene Counties in Missouri.  Stone and  Taney Counties are rural, forested counties which are host to  millions of tourists each year.  Greene County is also experiencing  an increase in population which is related to this tourist  industry.  This influx of people has caused a variety of  environmental problems (e.g., increases in energy consumption,  waste production, and construction).  Students will be provided  with the background knowledge necessary to identify, examine, and  propose solutions to selected problems.  Lecture, discussion,  extensive hands-on experiential learning, and small group research  will be the primary tools used to examine these topics.  Social  issues and political ramifications associated with these problems  will also be examined.  The issues in these counties will be  related to issues in the students' home areas and the world.  A  multidisciplinary approach will be used with six academic  departments from Southwest Missouri State University being  involved.  Earth 2010 participants will have science and  mathematics knowledge and experience to become active members of  their community in environmental issues.  ***",
