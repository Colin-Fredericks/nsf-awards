For  example, a ball is distinguished from a donut by the fact  that a donut has one hole while the ball has none. The NSF  CBMS program, RIndex Theory, Coarse Geometry, and Topology  of Manifolds, S will give an overview of current work in  finding invariants for a class of geometric objects.  The  type of invariants studied in this research are similar in  spirit to those in the donut/ball example, though vastly  more complicated and useful.  There is already a hint that  this research could have  profound applications  in the  exploding field of biotechnology.  For example, index theory  gives biochemists the tools to describe and classify the  various ways that the macro-molecules of life twist and turn  in space, a difficult and extremely important problem.    John Roe of Oxford University will give ten lectures on this  multifaceted area of mathematics. The lectures will serve  several purposes.  They will present new and difficult ideas  that  blend  several areas of mathematics, including  topology, geometry and analysis.  They will also introduce  graduate students to ground-breaking and fundamental  mathematical research. Additionally, John Roe, a gifted  writer on mathematics, will  produce a monograph on these  lectures, which will prove a valuable resource for those  attending, and for the mathematics community at large.",
