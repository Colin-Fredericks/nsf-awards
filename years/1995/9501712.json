 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project focuses on both research and educational goals. The research  component of this project addresses fundamental questions in interactive systems  such as programming  environments or on-line access to travel services.  A key  factor for the success of interactive  systems lies in their speed and, thus, in  efficient algorithms for interactively handling requests.  One powerful paradigm  in the design of efficient algorithms is to reduce the amount of recomputation  by storing essential information gathered during earlier computational steps in  a suitable data  structure for later use.  In interactive situations an  additional difficulty arises:  The problem  instance changes incrementally,  which requires dynamic data structures.  While efficient dynamic data  structures are widely used, efficient dynamic data structures for graphs are  still in the research  phase.  This project includes the following research  goals:     (1)   Design of dynamic data structures which exploits recent progress  in using approximation and randomization in the design of graph algorithms; (2)  Applications of dynamic data structures to improve the efficiency of algorithms  for incrementally changing problems.  These applications can be used on problems  which do not necessarily fit the dynamic framework.  For example, using dynamic  techniques, a  faster algorithm for the consensus tree problem is explored.  This algorithm has applications in computational biology and in the theory of  databases; (3) Implementation of dynamic data structures for graphs,  which  extends the widely-used Library of Efficient Data Types and Algorithms (LEDA).  The Educational Component of this CAREER Grant includes the goals in  undergraduate and graduate education:  (1)  At the undergraduate level a basic  goal is to redesign the senior-level algorithms course to teach the use of  efficient advanced data structures by asking for implementations of algorithms  in homework assignments and projects using LEDA;  (2)  A second basic goal is to  promote the advancement of women engineers by:  Counseling and mentoring female  students; Giving presentations to industry and students; Participating in  workshops which are sponsored by Cornell University's outreach program,  Expanding Your Horizons Program, for (female) middle school students.",
