 "awd_abstract_narration": "This   proposal   addresses   a  variety   of   statistical   and  computational  problems  that arise  in  genetics  and  molecular  biology. An important aim of the research project is the training  and   development  of  post-doctoral  research  fellows  in  this  interdisciplinary area. The problems described here are  part  of  our   ongoing  collaborations  with  geneticists  and   molecular  biologists  from USC and elsewhere. All of them have  significant  computational and statistical components.         We  are  studying  statistical and  algorithmic  aspects  of       physical mapping. Among these are optical       mapping,  by  which  ordered restriction maps  are  produced       using  fluorescence microscopy. The long  term  aim  is  the       development  of  an  online program that  produces  such  an       ordered map.              We  are analyzing the efficiency of various physical mapping       strategies   based   on  variants  of  sequence-tagged-sites       schemes. In particular, we are studying inhomogeneous  clone       and anchor distributions, the effects of false, ambiguous or       missing  anchors, and strategies that allow for mixtures  of       clone walking and random steps.              We  are  developing statistical models for the evolution  of       genome   rearrangements  and  methods   for   reconstructing       phylogenetic trees from such data. This is motivated in part       by  data on rearrangements occurring in the promoter of GFAP       in the brain.              A  related  project addresses other aspects of  phylogenetic       tree reconstruction, in particular the effects of dependence       among  sites  when DNA sequence data is used  to  build  the       tree.  Motivated  by  data on rRNA promoters,  we  are  also       developing algorithms for fitting more detailed evolutionary       models when the underlying tree is known.              We  are  investigating the statistics of pattern  counts  in       molecular   sequences.   These  a re   frequently   used   to       characterize  biological features such  as  coding  regions,       regulatory sequences, splice sites and so on. Our  focus  is       on  the  development of useful computational algorithms  for       pattern  counts when the underlying sequence structure  must       be estimated from the data.              A further project addresses the estimation of deletion rates       in  mitochondrial genomes in humans. A PCR assay is used  to       detect  whether or not a cell line contains any mitochondria       with  the  deletion. The data comprise the  results  of  the       assay  on  several cell lines. We are developing analogs  of       the   Luria-Delbruck  method  of  fluctuation  analysis  for       estimating  the rate of deletions. The results are  used  to       study  the  role  of  the deletion in Kearns-Sayre  Syndrome       patients.              We   are  developing  Monte  Carlo  likelihood  methods  for       inference  in  genetics, aimed primarily  at  the  study  of       mitochondrial and nuclear gene variation in humans, and  its       use  in  the study of human evolution. One focus is  on  the       estimation  of  recombination rates, in  particular  between       human disease loci and a variety of marker loci.",
