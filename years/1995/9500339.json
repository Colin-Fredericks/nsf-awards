 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a  two year cooperative research project  proposed  by Dr. Gerald Kooyman,  University of California at San  Diego, and Ms. Moonyeen Nida Ramos Alava, Silliman  University, the Philippines.   This proposal is to conduct a  study of population biology, ecology, and behavior of  cetaceans (including dolphins) in the Philippines.   The  project  requests funds to support the P.I. and a Ph.D.  student to carry out a study in the Sulu Sea, the  Philippines, to estimate the abundance of marine mammals and  to understand  the relationship between abundance and  habitat types.  They will also study  feeding habits, and  the behavior and social structure of cetacean species.  Dr.  Kooyman is a specialist in this area and has an outstanding  record of research and publication.   His Ph.D. student, Ms.  Louella  Dolar,  has an in-depth understanding of the Sulu  Sea ecosystem.   This is an important area of marine  biology.  There is little or no available information on the  cetacean species in Sulu Sea.  This project  will make a  relatively large contribution to our state of knowledge on  this species and can provide useful data on the conservation  of this species.    Furthermore, this project is leveraged  dollar- for-dollar with funds from International Foundation  for Science, Department of Environment and Natural Resources  of the Philippines, and U.S. National Marine Fisheries  Service.   The relatively modest support from the National  Science Foundation can yield large potential benefits.",
