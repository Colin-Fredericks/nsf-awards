 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502530  Boulanger  The objective of this research project is to develop a  fundamental framework for understanding and describing the  behavior of \"liquefiable\" fine-grained soils subjected to cyclic  and monotonic undrained loading -- a necessary step in the  development of reliable design methodologies for assessing  liquefaction potential of soils.    The term \"liquefiable\" is used to denote fine-grained soils that  would be considered susceptible to severe strength loss during  earthquake loading. The primary task towards achieving this  objective is a comprehensive laboratory study of select  low-plasticity silts and clays over the wide range of conditions  necessary to establish a fundamental framework. The project  includes monotonic loading, cyclic loading, post-cyclic monotonic  loading, and consolidation tests over a wide range of confining  stresses and void ratios to investigate the interrelationships  between the undrained loading behavior and the conditions of  initial state, quasi-steady state, and steady state.  It also  includes an investigation of the influence of sample preparation  method, stress history, and loading path (i.e., triaxial versus  torsional shear) over a wide range of void ratios and confining  stresses    The results of this study will fill a vital gap in the  understanding of the behavior of fine-grained soils during  earthquake loading, and thereby assist in the development of  engineering procedures for assessing potential earthquake hazards  related to the earthquake loading response of fine-grained soils.    EDUCATION PLAN    The objective of the education plan is to equip civil engineering  students with a sound philosophy of engineering, a rigorous  grounding in engineering basics and fundamentals, and an  appreciation of the  complementary roles of theory and judgment.    The education plan covers several details which will enhance the  basic strength of the existing curriculum, and thereby contribute  to an inspiring, well-rounded education in civil  and  environmental engineering.  It includes the following items:  In  design courses, have a practicing professional assist in setting  up the design project, and then discuss alternative designs at  the end of the course; select these and other new course projects  to illustrate the complementary roles of fundamental theory and  engineering judgment in the practice of civil and environmental  engineering; develop an instructional video on drilling and  sampling procedures for site characterization; introduce computer-  based data-acquisition systems into the undergraduate laboratory  curriculum; involve undergraduates in research projects via  summer employment and independent research electives; and  introduce results from recent research in appropriate courses  ***",
