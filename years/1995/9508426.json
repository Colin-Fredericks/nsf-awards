These forces and trajectories are identified with surveys  and field work within representative villages in these landscapes.  They are then linked with the use  of remotely-sensed imagery and GIS to their general patterns of land-cover consequences within not  only the cultivated areas but within the adjacent reserves.  The research will contribute to an  understanding of the local-level dynamics that give rise to particular paths of agricultural change  and their land-cover impacts.  In addition the research assesses the role of one kind of  institutionalized protected area (natu re reserves) on agricultural change--a role that has not been  well developed within the agricultural change literature.",
