 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421983  Ramoa  Very recently it was discovered that, before the time that the  nervous tissue of the eye (the retina) can respond to light, the  nerve cells in the eye generate waves of activity that are  transmitted to the cells in the eye's central nervous system target  (the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus).  Importantly, the waves of  retinal activity are patterned, and they occur during a time of  development when the patterns of connections between the eye and  the brain are being established and refined.  This research is  designed to determine whether these spontaneous waves of activity  contribute to the definition of the connection patterns between the  eye and the brain, as well as how this activity interacts with  other central nervous system inputs to the cells in the dorsal  lateral geniculate nucleus.  It has long been known that patterns  of activity generated by light stimuli play an important role in  visual system development.  This research will provide important  information about how intrinsic, spontaneous activity contributes  to specifying the connectivity in the central nervous system.",
