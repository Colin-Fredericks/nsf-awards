 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500723 Harris  This work investigates the propagation of  surface waves over the curved elastic surfaces of a shell and  studies how these waves couple from one surface to another. The  curved shell is an elastic waveguide whose properties change  slowly with wavelength, these changes being caused by the varying  radii of curvature and thickness, while its two surfaces form  weakly coupled surface-wave waveguides. The propagation is  studied by asymptotically expanding the wavefields in inverse  powers of the radii of curvature with each term subsequently  expanded in the Rayleigh-Lamb modes. The beating over the  propagation path of the two lowest Rayleigh-Lamb modes gives rise  to a surface wave that couples back and forth between the two  surfaces. The scattering that a surface wave experiences when it  strikes a compact discontinuity near one of the surfaces or  encounters a region of roughness along one of them is also  studied. The compact scatterer is modeled by assigning it  reflection and transmission coefficients determined from a local  analysis of the wavefields near the discontinuity. The roughness  is modeled by working out the attenuation to the surface wave.  The results of this work will be compared to existing data at the  Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University.    Turbine blades rotated at high speeds and pipelines used to carry  oil or natural gas are among the common curved structures  ultrasonically inspected for damage such as fatigue cracking or  corrosion. Fatigue cracks in a turbine blade often occur at its  root, a location not always visually accessible. Corrosion to a  pipeline can begin at its interior supface where it cannot be  detected unless a section of the line is shut down. This work  investigates how these curved, elastic shell structures can be  inspected using surface waves that propagate first over the  exterior surface, then over the interior surface, ultimately  returning to the exterior surface where they are picked up. Th ese  waves detect damage to an interior surface and carry that  information to the exterior. Ultrasonic inspections must also  give an estimate of the seriousness of the damage. By modeling  scattering from a small surface crack or attenuation caused by a  patch of corrosion, this work enables the information carried by  a surface wave from one surface to another to be interpreted to  give quantitative estimates of the damage.",
