Aldehydes and ketones are adsorbed and exposed to reactive vapors.  Surface species are analyzed with carbon-13 magic-angle nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy.  Zeolite catalysts are synthesized and characterized with silicon-29 and aluminum-27 nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction, and sorption uptake measurements.    The compounds formed in this study are typical chemical intermediates that are presently produced using liquid acid catalysts.  Environmental considerations are forcing producers to shift to solid acid catalysts, such as those used in this study.  ***",
