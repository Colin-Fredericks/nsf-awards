 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida State University is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program to aid in the renovation of the second and third floors of the Carraway Building.  Occupied by the Department of Geology,  the facility was designed and constructed 40 years ago.  The range of research activities in which faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students are involved in span diverse disciplines within the Earth sciences, encompassing the areas of structure and tectonics, sedimentology, micropaleontology, marine geology, hydrology, geomophology, and isotope geochemistry.  Changes in faculty, and in growing research programs over the past 40 years, along with deterioration and aging of some of the physical infrastructure, have resulted in a precarious situation. The building is no longer adequate to support current and planned research and training activities.  The renovation will consist of relocating and consolidating activities dedicated for research and research training.  The intent is to make more efficient use of limited available space, by developing shared laboratories for purposes and activities common to research personnel.  As a result, there will be a reduction in the duplication of facilities, the alleviation of severe crowding in existing laboratories, and the provision of better access of facilities to students and staff. More serious problems associated with the design and aging of the facility that directly affect the quality of and potential for certain types of research activities will be addressed.  The renovation will supply adequate utilities to areas where they are needed, replace old and disabled fume hoods, and significantly reduced the level of dirt and contamination associated with the building's air-handling systems, exposed overhead pipes, and decaying acoustical tiles.  Upon  completion, the modernize facility will create the ideal laboratory setting, enabling the pursuit  of current and future research that will provide more opportunities for  students to engage in research training.  Moreover, the modernization of the laboratory facilities will enhance the department's capability to attract visiting scientists, and to recruit quality faculty members.",
