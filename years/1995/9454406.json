 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454406  Rosenstein    LEADERSHIP PROGRAM IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS -- PHASE III    Rutgers University, in cooperation with school district partners, develops a leadership cadre of teachers who are knowledgeable about concepts of discrete mathematics, who incorporate discrete mathematics into their classrooms and curricula, and who share their expertise and experiences with colleagues.  The five-year, principally regional (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA) project builds on a solid base of earlier NSF-supported projects and targets directly 660 teachers of mathematics in grades K-8.  Each participant attends a two-week summer institute, four follow-up sessions during the subsequent school year, and a one-week institute during the following summer.  Institutes are in both residential and commuter formats.      Participants at all grade levels in the program are introduced to the same topics in discrete mathematics and learn how these topics can be utilized at all grade levels.  In addition to their participation in all sessions of the summer institutes and academic-year follow-up sessions, program participants are expected to use institute materials and activities in their classrooms, provide workshops on these materials and activities for their colleagues, and work to change their school's and district's curriculum to include the materials and activities.    Project evaluation includes assessment of progress in achieving project goals, objectives, strategies, and timelines; evidence of continued refinement of curricular/instructional materials for teachers and of curricular sequencing for students; and evidence of effective integration of discrete mathematics topics into actual classroom use by teachers in all grade levels of K-8.  Cost-sharing from DIMACS/Rutgers University and from partner school districts represents 39% of the NSF award amount.",
