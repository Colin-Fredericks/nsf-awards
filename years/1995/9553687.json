 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project involves the development of a \"Welding  Lab on Disk,\" a sophisticated interactive computer simulation  software package, to supplement and complement hands-on welding  laboratory experiences for welding technology students.  The  project integrates the development of instructional media, teacher  enhancement, and instrumentation and laboratory improvement via a  coalition of Northern Illinois University, and Rock Valley College,  a two-year community college in the northern Illinois region.  The  goals of the project are to enhance students' understanding of the  interdisciplinary nature of advanced welding technology, to  minimize laboratory-related costs, hazards, and environmental  pollution, to motivate teachers via application of computer  simulation and research participation, and to attract women and  minorities into advanced technology programs.  Preliminary  development and research findings, documented by the recent  publications of the principal investigator, have shown that the  proposed computer software package will result in good engineering  economy and high pedagogical effectiveness.  An advisory and  evaluation board of outside experts will provide additional  expertise and experience.  The proposed project will complement  future research and development activities leading to \"Advanced  Technology Labs on Disk.\"",
