 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is exploring the application of optical systems for  high-speed database processing.  It is combining a parallel model  of computation, associative processing based on the use of content  addressable memory, with an inherently parallel technology, optics.   The purpose is to integrate into one study the elements of parallel  architectures, parallel algorithms, device technology, and  laboratory demonstrations which will test and demonstrate the  advantages of optics for high-speed database processing.    The approach taken on this project provides direct hardware support  for database operations.  It consists of identifying the basic  fundamental operaitons required for data base processing and  aprallelizing them as much as possible.  This is followed by  developing an optical parallel architecture that directly  implements the parallelized operations.  Parallel algorithms for  database processing are then developed that build on these  fundamental operations.  Consequently, the optical architecture  will support database applications in a truly parallel fashion.",
