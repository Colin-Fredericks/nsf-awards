This program is limited to minorities who are US  citizens, and attendance is open to any area of plant  science including regional meetings of plant science  professional societies and other related plant science  meetings.  Costs to be covered include transportation costs,  registration fees, and subsistence costs while in attendance  at these meetings.  Applicants will be asked to submit a  short proposal requesting funds to attend a specific  meeting.  The American Society of Plant Physiologists  Minority Affairs Committee will receive and review  applications.  Awards will be made on the merits of the  proposal.  Each award recipient will be required to submit a  report of the meeting attended to provide an assessment of  the impact of this project.",
