The ten-day conference will provide an opportunity for researchers  and industry of both the U.S. and Mexico and other invited guests  to exchange ideas and research results with the aim of enhancing  the overall research effort, reducing duplication, and encouraging  cooperation among the participants.  Speakers selected by the  organizing committee and NSF will set the stage for each day's  activities by making a presentation in which a group of related  topics are summarized and discussed.  Poster sessions of invited  and collaborating papers will follow summarizing the state of the  art in research and application of neurocontrol and answering  questions.  This will be followed by an informal discussion in the  form of a panel chaired by one of the invited speakers.  ***",
