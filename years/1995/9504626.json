 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rose Ann Clark  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Clark received her doctoral degree from   North Carolina State University under the supervision of Professor Edmond   Bowden.  Dr. Clark will continue research at Pennsylvania State   University under the sponsorship of Professor Andrew Ewing.  Her   postdoctoral research will target the development of electroanalytical   tools to probe the microenvironment of mammalian nerve cells.  The goal   is to utilize voltammetry and amperometry to monitor release at single   mammalian synapses in culture.  The research will involve construction   and utilization of microelectrodes of submicrometer dimensions.  Through   the monitoring of neurotransmitter release along axons, at single   synapses, or in artificial synapses, the research will contribute to our   understanding of the neurotransmission process.    The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
