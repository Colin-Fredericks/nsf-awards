 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopy equipment is being utilized within the manufacturing  processes and materials laboratory, and laboratory projects are  being developed for student use.   The microscopy equipment that  was used in the Materials Laboratory was limited to the extent  that only one person could view the image at any given time.    The instructor's ability to provide a meaningful answer to any  questions the student asked about the structure was dependent  upon the student's ability to describe what was seen.  The new  use of a video camera and console allows for a more positive  identification of and discussion of the observed microstructure,  since both student and instructor view the structure  simultaneously.   Other students benefit from the discussion of  the microstructure in question, and all can see that structure.    The imaging equipment is giving the student greater flexibility  in obtaining photographic images for inclusion in laboratory  reports.   Using the video camera and digital printer allows  making a hard copy without moving the specimen from one  instrument to another.   Since the digital images are less  expensive as compared with the photographic methods currently  used, time and money saved allow the individual student to make  increased use of the microscopy equipment.",
