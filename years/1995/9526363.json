 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,  investigates the area of fault tolerance for robotics. This  activity has produced a series of potentially valuable individual  ethods.  The goal of this project is to develop the foundations for  a rigorous approach to robotic fault tolerance.  The research  involves synthesis of a protective operating system shell  environment for robots, and incorporation of this environment into  a new approach for provably fault tolerant robotic systems. The  operating system shell is designed to protect the robot from the  effects of errors in the lower level manipulator system and the  higher level plan.  This shell is composed of a number of  fault tolerance tasks at a discrete decision making level. These   tasks will be identified and outlined for a three link planar  robot during the year of exploratory work. The robot will be  enhanced with two sensors per joint and will be kinematically  redundant for positioning tasks in the plane. This level of  hardware redundancy will provide fault tolerance capabilities to  the robot. A formal model will be developed for this simple example  robot and used to demonstrate the potential benefits of the  research approach. This work will provide formal methods to verify  fault tolerance for lower and higher level subsystems of a robot  system.  The key overall goal is to combine diverse techniques for  robotic fault tolerance into a provably correct methodology.  The  development of formal tools for the approach will be important in  proving rigorous results about robot fault tolerance. In the one  year of the SGER project, a series of fundamental examples will  demonstrate how the above approach can significantly impact this  emerging research area.",
