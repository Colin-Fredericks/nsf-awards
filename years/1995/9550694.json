 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550694  Community School District 23 (C.S.D. 23) situated in the Oceanhill-  Brownsville community of Brooklyn, New York, proposes to implement  a summer science camp.  This project will increase students'  interest in and exposure to science, engineering and mathematics.   The proposed science camp will serve 120 students from Junior High  School 263 and intermediate School 284 in this school district.   The primary goal of the project is to stimulate an interest in  mathematics, science and engineering for middle grade students, and  to encourage project participants to consider science, math, and  engineering as possible career choices.    The major focus of the project is an enriched interdisciplinary  math, science, engineering, and technology multi-media program.   Activities include:  1) Instruction through an  integrated/interdisciplinary curriculum; 2) Student centered  classroom activities; 3) Professional development and instructional  workshops; 4) Involvement of parents and community members as role  models and mentors for minority students; 5) Career exploration  through interaction with scientists, mathematicians and engineers;  6) Urban environmental studies; and 7) Activities focused on  research methodology utilizing computers.     Project participants will experience the excitement of \"doing  science\" in the areas of science, engineering, mathematics and  technology.  Students will be paired with teachers of physical  science, computer science, engineering, math, and technology from  various institutions of higher education.  ***",
