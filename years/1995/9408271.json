 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year funding of a two-year award.   The  objective of the proposed research is to better understand the  effects of using external telecommunications and data networks on  firm performance and the nature of relations among trading  partners.  The research will contribute to the base of knowledge in  this area by studying external network usage across firms and  across industries, using both qualitative case studies and  quantitative survey methodologies.  In particular, the research  will empirically test a model that proposes that the effects of  external network usage on firm performance and buyer-seller  relationships are dependent upon the attributes of the networks  used, firms, products, and the business context. The research will  focus on the openness of the telecommunications networks and on the  degree to which they carry computerized data.  These contingent  influences of network usage will in turn have their effects on  performance and buyer-seller structures through a number of  mediating factors, which the research will explicitly measure.  Mediating factors include the various type of costs firms  incur in the process of making transactions with trading  partners, the nature of the interpersonal relations that  exist between buyers and sellers, and the types of services  and products that are exchanged.",
