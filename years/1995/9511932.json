 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly relied on by government and private sector, sample surveys range from health care to prayer in schools, to the design of future automobiles.  They are a basic tool in commercial activity and in statistical operations of government agencies, and they contribute to induction and testing of theories in most of the social sciences.  Increasingly, they are a common experience in the daily lives of U.S. residents.  Efforts to maintain response rates, so as to preserve the representativeness of surveys and their inferential power, raise serious ethical issues for survey research.  Focusing on the issue of equity, this pilot project will design and test methods to:  explore public reactions to ethical issues in the use of incentives and to alternative ways to reduce nonresponse; and investigate the effect of these reactions on people's willingness to participate in surveys.  The investigators want to find out under what conditions, if any, people feel an obligation to participate in a survey; under what conditions, if any, they expect a tangible reward for their participation; what strategies to increase participation offend their sense of equity or their standards of politeness; and how these various beliefs combine to affect the likelihood of participation.  The pilot will examine the following methods to measure these variables:  direct questioning to measure beliefs, perceptions, expectations, and standards; videotaped vignettes to measure predicted behavior in response to different combinations of survey characteristics and reward; and a small field experiment to measure actual behavior.  The narrow aim of this research is to investigate the role of respondent perceptions in survey participation; it also has broader implications for understanding the motivational force of equity evaluations and the role of attitudes in influencing behavior.  Several articles and plans for further research should result from this award.",
