 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds the purchase of equipment to support  improvements in two upper-level aquatic biology courses:  Limnology and Planktonology.   These two courses serve the  Environmental Studies and Marine Biology degree programs,  respectively.   The new items of equipment include (1) a  videomicroscope system, (2) a light/temperature controlled  incubator to culture isolated phytoplankton and for controlled  growth of phytoplankton in nutrient enrichment experiments, (3) a  shaker for use in the incubator, (4) two automated water samplers  to permit water sampling during tidal, diel, and storm event  periods, a multiparameter water quality monitor for measuring and  logging dissolved oxygen, pH, depth, conductivity, and turbidity,  (5) an underwater quantum sensor for measuring and logging light  flux and other custom inputs, (6) a spectrophotometer for  nutrient analyses, and (7) two laptop computers to interface with  primary data gathering instruments and perform data analysis and  graphics.    This new equipment introduces students to  state-of-the-art research equipment and techniques, fosters  investigative approaches to scientific problems by students  working in small groups, focuses on water quality problems  associated with urban stormwater detention ponds (a national  concern) and local tidal creeks, and provides experience vital  for students entering graduate programs or employment in aquatic  biology.",
