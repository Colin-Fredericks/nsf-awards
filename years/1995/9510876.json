 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510876  Neumark    Lack of data on worker productivity plagues numerous areas of  empirical research related to issues of wage determination and  productivity: life-cycle earnings, wage discrimination, returns  to education, effects of marriage, job-specific human capital,  industry rents, etc.  For example, with data only on wages and  worker characteristics over the life cycle, it is difficult to  distinguish human capital models of wage growth from models of  long-term, incentive compatible contracts.  Typical wage  regressions reveal positive effects of age on wages, conditional   on a variety of covariates, but these positive effects neither  prove nor disprove that mature workers are more productive than  younger ones.  This project will be the first to use U.S. data to  estimate and compare plant- or firm-level estimates of wage and  marginal productivity differentials.  The productivity and wage  estimates will be analyzed in the contexts of such commonly  debated topics as race and sex discrimination in wages, the  causes of rising wage profiles over the life cycle, and the  returns to education and marriage.    This project takes a production function approach to plants   technologies, in which workers with different characteristics are  treated as substitute labor inputs in the plant, but with  potentially different marginal products.  The modeling and  estimation strategy permit a direct comparison of estimates of  relative wages of workers with different characteristics with  estimates of relative marginal productivities.  he approach is  applied to U.S. data using a match between long-form respondents   to the 1990 Decennial Census, uho work in the manufacturing  sector, and data on their employers from the Longitudinal  Research Database.  The employer-employee matched data set, the  Worker-Establishment Characteristics Database (WECD), combines  information with which to estimate production functions (such as   value of output, cost of materials, capital, and employment),  with  information on earnings and demographic characteristics of  the workers.  This is a unique data set.  Previously available  U.S. plant-level or firm-level data sets only contain breakdowns   of workers into production and non-production workers, and  previously available worker-level data sets contain little  information on the employers.",
