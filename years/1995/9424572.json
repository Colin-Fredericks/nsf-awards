Transport  and  x-ray  scattering  experiments have indicated that phase slip is driven  by  strains  in  the CDW, that it occurs via homogeneous thermal nucleation of  dislocation  loops,  and that slips strongly  modify  the  strain  profile near current contacts. The spatial distribution of  phase  slip  and  strain  between and beyond current  contacts  will  be  measured, and compared with models for CDW dislocation nucleation  and  motion. Spatially-resolved measurements of noise and Shapiro  steps  will determine the effect of phase slips on CDW  dynamics.  The coherence of the CDW response will be probed near the Peirels  transition,  where phase slips should become very  easy  and  the  effect   of  impurity  strains  on  slip  may  become  important.  Measurements  in  semiconducting  materials  such  as  TaS3  will  investigate  the effect of quasiparticle density on  phase  slip,  which  may  be  dramatic at low densities and  low  temperatures.  Detailed  spatially resolved measurements of time  dependent  CDW  relaxation   will  be  performed,  in  an  attempt   to   develop  quantitative   understanding   of  the   underlying   mechanisms.  Experiments  will be performed to investigate the  modulation  of  CDW  conductance using FET-like structure were the  semiconductor  is replaced by a CDW conductor.  %%%  Charge  density  wave  (CDW) conductors  are  among  the  richest  systems  in condense matter physics, and serve as a paradigm  for  study  of  many  fundamental issues occurring  in  a  variety  of  systems  such  as  superconductors, insulators, materials  growth  ...etc. CDWs can be represented as a sinusoidal modulation of the  electronic  charge density occurring in materials  with  specific  properties. The electrons in a CDW respond collectively and  with  some degree of coherence to ex ternal excitations such as electric  fields. This proposal investigates the phase slip process,  which  is  the  process  by which the CDW electrons are  converted  into  normal   electrons,  near  the  contacts,  in  order   to   carry  electricity  from the CDW sample into the remaining part  of  the  circuit.  A  number  of  electrical  transport  experiments   are  designed  to  explore  the  phase  slip  mechanism  and   related  relaxation  mechanisms  as well as a recently  discovered  field-  effect modulation of the CDW conduction.  ***",
