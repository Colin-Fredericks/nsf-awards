 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is directed toward the continued operation of an  array of unattended, automatic magnetic data collection platforms  on the Greenland ice cap and the reduction, distribution and  analysis of these data.  The MAGIC array complements the magnetic  stations on the coasts of Greenland.  The MAGIC magnetic stations  form a two dimensional array with station separation of about 150  Km.  The scientific objective of these magnetic measurements is to  investigate, in conjunction with the coastal stations, small-scale  propagating magnetic disturbances which appear to result from  moving filamentary field-aligned currents interacting with the  ionosphere.  Different classes of these systems have now been  identified and the origin of the field-aligned currents appears to  be near the dayside magnetopause within the magnetospheric boundary  layer.  It is particularly important to have a dense two-  dimensional array in order to resolve the motion and structural  evolution of these current systems.  The Greenland stations in  combination with the other GEM funded stations deployed in Canada,  permit us to observe these phenomena over a sufficient region as to  identify their generation location and resolve their motion and  spatial evolution as the propagate.  These data and the proposed  research are important to understanding the physics of the  processes which couple energy and momentum from the solar wind to  the magnetosphere and ionosphere, the physics of the magnetospheric  boundary layer and the mapping of boundary layer phenomena to the  high-latitude ionosphere.",
