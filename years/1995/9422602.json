 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9422602  Hicks    The objective of this collaborative project is to develop new  organometallic precursors for carbon-acceptor doping of indium  gallium arsenide (In0.53Ga0.47As) by metalorganic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD). A novel family of \"site-specific\" dopants will  be tested. The decomposition kinetics and doping efficiencies of  the sources will be screened in a micro-MOCVD reactor. In addition,  their mechanisms for decomposition on the InGaAs(100) surface will  be determined by infrared and x-ray photoemission spectroscopies  and by scanning tunneling microscopy. These studies will identify  the optimal compositions of the organometallic sources. Promising  carbon dopants will be used to grow InGaAs/InP heterojunction  bipolar transistors (HBTs). The performance characteristics of  these transistors will be compared to those synthesized using  standard zinc compounds for p-type doping. This research will have  a large impact on MOCVD growth technology. It will identify the  site-specific surface chemistry underlying acceptor doping of  compound semiconductors. Furthermore, it will hopefully solve the  problem of carbon doping InGaAs and InP, so that much higher  performance electronic devices can be synthesized by MOCVD. A team  of scientists from University, Navy, and Industry will participate  in this project. Partial support is provided by NSF for the portion  of the research conducted at the University.  %%%  Epitaxial thin films of indium gallium arsenide and indium  phosphide are used in a variety of electronic and optoelectronic  devices. Today, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of  these films is limited in scope because this process is not capable  of doping the layers p-type in high concentration and with sharp  dopant profiles. Carbon is the ideal acceptor for these  semiconductors. However, no organometallic compounds are available  which provide a high concentration of active carbon, while  maintaining the desired composition and crystal-qual ity of the  film. The objective of this project is to develop new  organometallic precursors for carbon-acceptor doping of indium  gallium arsenide by MOCVD. A novel family of \"site-specific\"  dopants will be tested.",
