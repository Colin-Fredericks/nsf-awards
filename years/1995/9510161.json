 "awd_abstract_narration": "With their tremendous economic growth, the Asian Tigers serve as  an excellent laboratory for examining the effects of rapid  industrialization on women's labor market status.  Beginning in  the 1970's, East Asia experienced rapidly rising real wages, with  Korean real wage growth outpacing its regional neighbors.   Understanding how  women's earnings in Korea performed relative  to men's will provide extremely useful lessons for other  developing countries seeking to follow the east Asian example.    The purpose of this planning grant research is to collect  additional data and provide a detailed assessment of earnings gap  determinants between men and women using two decomposition  procedures. The first, a level analysis, decomposes the earnings  gap in individual years into a portion explained by observable,  gender-specific skill differences, and a residual portion which  is commonly attributed to discrimination.  The second procedure  evaluates the contribution of changes over time in  gender-specific factors and in the overall wage structure to the  evolution of gender earnings gaps.  Using the latter technique to  examine the Korean experience will provide a more detailed  analysis of gender earnings gap determinants than earlier  developing country studies.    The planning Grant results will form an excellent basis for  preparing the subsequent NSF full research proposal. The future  proposal will examine the ability of Korea's labor policies to  generate reductions in gender earnings inequality. This research  will contribute valuable new evidence on whether the Asian  Tigers' labor reforms, designed to emulate the labor market  policies of industrialized countries, have actually helped female  workers to obtain higher relative earnings.  ***",
