 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552559  McCreedy    The Franklin Institute and the Girl Scouts of the USA will develop,  implement, and evaluate \"Girls at the Center,\" a family outreach  program that will foster girl-centered, learning within the context  of the family.  Partnerships will be promoted between local science  and technology centers and Girl Scout Councils.  It is a multi-  component program that will increase girls' and their families'  understanding of and interest in basic science principles and  processes.  Consisting of a series of family-oriented activities  that coincide with the school year, science/technology centers will  serve as the hosts.  These museum-based activities will be  supplemented by home-based activities.  The activities will follow  the constructivist theory of education and will cover a broad menu  of scientific disciplines including ecology, energy, and human  physiology as well as science careers opportunities.  They will be  linked to the requirements for the Girl Scout recognition (badges)  program.  It is building on the success of a previously NSF funded  project \"National Science Partnerships for Girls Scout Councils and  Museum\" and is expected to reach 75,050 girls and 112,575 adults in  25 sites across the US during the funding period.  It will be  institutionalized and will continue to operate in those sites as  well as expand to other sites after the NSF-funded period.",
