 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests biophysical instrumentation and computing  equipment to enable a broad interdisciplinary investigation of  fundamental aspects of protein folding and protein-ligand interactions.  The participating research groups are from the Biomolecular Structure  Center and the departments of Biochemistry, Biological Structure, and  Bioengineering at the University of  Washington.    The dramatic increase in the power of computers over the last five  years has ushered in a truly exciting new era in structural molecular  biology. There is now hope of understanding the multitude of complex  interatomic interactions in proteins at the level of protein folding  and proteinligand interactions. The development of adequate  computational models, however, requires detailed biophysical  characterization of relevant experimental systems. We propose to take a  combined biophysical and computational approach to understanding the  interactions which underlie the structure and function of proteins.  Spectroscopic methods will be used to probe the kinetics and  thermodynamics of protein folding and protein-ligand interactions in  detail. These results will be used to develop computational models that  have as their long range goals the understanding of the rules linking  amino acid sequences, protein 3-dimensional structures, and  protein-ligand interactions.    The work described in this proposal has three main thrusts. The first  part is focused on understanding the dependence of protein folding on  amino acid sequence, using extremely simple model proteins. The second  part is focused on the detailed understanding of a model proteinligand  interaction: the binding of biotin to streptavidin. The third part  seeks to extend knowledge gained in parts one and two to develop more  general methods for experimentally and computationally charactelizing a  wide valiety of protein ligand interactions, and for understanding the  \"restricted folding\" of a short peptide which is enclosed by a larger  multimeri c protein assembly.    The links between three areas are not merely conceptual; the  biophysical and computational methods required to address all three  issues are highly overlapping. In each case the range of scientific  questions currently accessible is limited by our current inability to  experimentally determine such key kinetic parameters as on-rates and  off-rates and to monitor protein folding reactions. We are similarly  limited by current computational resources as to the size and  complexity of model systems which may be simulated. The requested  instrumentation therefore consists of (1) absorption and circular  dichroism spectrometers with associated stopped-flow apparatus to  follow the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding in solution,  (2) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) apparatus which allows exquisitely  sensitive measurement of the kinetics of protein-ligand binding, and  (3) computer equipment to support the theoretical and predictive side  of the investigation as well as visualization of the model systems  under study.",
