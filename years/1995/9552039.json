 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds the development of an x-ray fluorescence (XRF)  spectroscopy laboratory in the Department of Geology.    Improvement of the analytical geochemistry laboratory is the next  logical step in development of the department's instructional and  undergraduate research program.    The new equipment consists of  a Rigaku RIX-2000 wavelength dispersive sequential XRF  spectrometer and associated sample preparation equipment to  support complete whole-rock, major-element, and trace-element  analysis of the full range of geological samples.   The  acquisition of this instrumentation allows full implementation of  a new geology curriculum that is aimed at improving the  undergraduate students preparation for entry both into the work  force and graduate school.   The new curriculum involves  reworking the mineralogy/petrology sequence of courses,  significant modernization of the sedimentation and stratigraphy  curriculum, updating of courses throughout the program, and the  addition of a capstone experience that will include a  collaborative research project for the majority of students.    The XRF is used directly for instruction in one introductory  course, four upper-division courses, and an interdisciplinary  course for chemistry majors and significantly enhances  opportunities for interdisciplinary teaching and research.",
