 "awd_abstract_narration": "From August 1991 to April 1993, CIRCE (the Center for  Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation at the  University of Illinois) executed a contract with the National  Science Foundation under the title \"Teacher Preparation Archives:  Case studies of NSF-funded Middle School Mathematics and Science  Teacher Preparation Projects.\"   The funding of the nine campuses  to develop exemplary programs for middle school teacher  preparation was a singular effort on the part of the Foundation.  This unique program highlighted both middle school education and  teacher preparation in a way never done before. The circumstances  of funding as well as the development and obstacles to campus  reprogramming are reported in detail in the final report. Several  interpretive chapters were also included.    That project culminated in a report entitled \"Teacher Preparation  Archives: Studies of NSF-Funded Middle School Science and  Mathematics Teacher Preparation Projects\" by Robert Stake, James  Raths, Mark St. John, Deborah Trumbull, David Jenness, Michele  Foster, Sherry Sullivan, Terry Denny and Jack Easley. Targeted  both for a general and specialist teacher educator audience, the  report runs over 300 pages as a paperback book.  An additional  1200 copies are being printed for distribution to anyone who  requests and is advertised through mathematics, science, and  middle school education organizations.",
