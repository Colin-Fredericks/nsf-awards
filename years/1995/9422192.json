The  equipment will have the sensitivity required to detect magnetic  signal from ultra-small magnetic structure in an applied magnetic  field range of + 5 Tesla. In addition, it will be equipped with the  ability to perform AC susceptibility measurements, which are  critical to the accurate non-contact characterization of  superconducting phases, and useful for the study of relaxation  phenomena in nanostructured magnetic materials. Finally, it will be  able to perform accurately at very low fields, so that magnetically  soft thin layers (useful for magneto-resistive sensor applications)  may be accurately characterized. An instrument of this kind is not  currently available at the University. An older instrument in the  Physics Department is being used continuously and does not include  AC measurement or ultra-low fields capabilities. The proposed  instrument will be used by a total of six faculty members and 20  graduate/undergraduate students.",
