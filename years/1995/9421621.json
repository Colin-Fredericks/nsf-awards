 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the scaling-down of direct-drive actuator  technology previously developed by the PI.  The prior efforts  involved theoretical electrodynamics models of generalized EM  actuators based on screw theory, and led to the development of  miniature, high-torque spherical camera-pointing motors.  The goal  of the current project is to adapt the theory and magnetic  technology to several robotic actuator applications at millimeter  and submillimeter scales,  This involves a combination of  simulations and theoretical investigations of scaling properties  and dynamics, development of a series of experimental devices to  serve as testbeds for the ideas, and exploration of several medical  and telerobotic applications of such miniaturization through  research collaborations and corporate partnerships.  The research  results will be disseminated  through multimedia, including  publication in mathematical hypertext and access to experimental  robots through the World-Wide Web.  The plan is to publish the  designs and details of experimental prototypes so that researchers  are be able to access our files and produce exact copies of the  devices.",
