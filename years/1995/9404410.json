 "awd_abstract_narration": "Puckett       The investigator undertakes the design, development and  application of numerical methods for modeling fluid flows in which  an essential feature of the flow is the presence of a moving  boundary or interface.  These methods are designed to study four  specific problem areas: flow in ink jet dispensing devices,  convection in weld pools, flames in compressible fluid flow, and  high-velocity impact events in the geosciences.  Work on these  applications is conducted in close collaboration with experts in  the relevant disciplines.  The numerical methods are based on a  collection of second-order \"Godunov\" methods for solving the  equations of motion and second-order volume-of-fluid interface  tracking algorithms for modeling the motion of the material  interface.  This methodology is coupled to a Cartesian grid method  dor modeling arbitrary boundary geometries and an adaptive mesh  refinement algorithm for locally concentrating computational  effort in regions where it is most needed to achieve a given level  of accuracy.  The project aims to produce a collection of numerical  methods that will enable researchers in the applied sciences and  industry to model a broad class of problems that involve the  motion of a material interface with confidence that the numerical  results yield reliable quantitative data that is in good agreement  with experiment.  A second goal is to develop students who have a  thorough understanding of this methodology and who can create new  models and numerical methods based on these models to address  problems that arise in science and industry.       Computer models are an increasingly important part of the  product design cycle in an ever increasing number of industries.  Device simulation models are now routinely used in the  semiconductor industry while the Boeing 777 is being called the  first airplane to be designed on a computer.  These models can  reduce the product design cycle by months and sometimes years.  However, there are still many importa nt industrial R&D problems  for which current numerical methodology is either inadequate or  nonexistent.  One such class includes problems that are  characterized by the presence of an interface between two  materials or between different phases of a material.  Examples  include fluid jetting devices, mold filling and casting, etching  of semiconductor devices, and thin film coatings.  The goal of this  research is to develop a new generation of advanced numerical  methods for modeling such problems.  These methods are designed to  model four specific applications: flow in fluid jetting devices,  convection in weld pools, flames in compressible fluid flow, and  high-velocity impact events.  Work on these applications is  conducted in close collaboration with experts in the relevant  disciplines.  For example, the research on fluid jetting devices is  conducted in collaboration with scientists at Xerox's Wilson  Research Center in Rochester, NY and at MicroFab Inc. in Plano,  TX.  The first goal of the project is to produce a collection of  numerical methods that will enable researchers in the applied  sciences and industry to model a broad class of problems that  involve the motion of a material interface, with confidence that  the numerical results yield reliable quantitative data that is in  good agreement with experiment.  The second goal is to meet the  ever increasing demand for scientists who are experts in the  design and use of computational models of industrial processes by  training students in all aspects of this field.  This training  includes student internships in industrial laboratory settings.",
