 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Interactive Systems Workshop is to bring together the principal investigators of the  projects within the Interactive Systems program to increase their awareness of related work from other  disciplines within the program, to foster interchange between the investigators across disciplines.  The areas covered by the Interactive Systems program seek solutions for the key bottleneck in  expanding the usefulness of computer technology today.  Whereas hardware or software resources were  once the critical issues, improved communication with the user has become the most pressing need.  While this problem arises in many areas of computer application and appears in various roles in  different NSF programs, the Interactive Systems Program has the ability to provide a single locus for  research on the core scientific issues that underlie communication between humans and machines that  apply across many application domains.  This workshop takes a step toward pulling together the basic  science in the Interactive Systems area into a single cohesive approach that can address core issues  that apply across  many areas of the application of computer technology.",
