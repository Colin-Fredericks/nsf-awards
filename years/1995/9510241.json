 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510241  Furdyna    The  objective  of  the  proposed research is to investigate  magnetic  ordering  and  magnetic interactions in cubic manganese telluride  and  manganese  selenide, as well as in their multilayers  and  alloys,  by  means of neutron scattering techniques.  These materials, which do not  occur  naturally  but  can  be fabricated in  this  crystal  phase  by  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), hold great fundamental interest  because  their   manganese   sublattices  consititute   frustrated   Heisenberg  antiferromagnets governed by short-range interactions.   MBE  provides  the  opportunity  to vary in a controlled fashion various  degrees  of  freedom which directly affect their magnetic behavior, such as strain,  magnetic   layer   separation,  dilution,  and  dimensionality,   thus  accessing  a variety of fundamentally new problems in magnetism.   The  research  will  focus strongly on investigating the  coupling  between  magnetic  layers  in  order to understand  the  nature  and  range  of  manganese-manganese  interactions  beyond  those   involving   nearest  neighbors.   New  neutron scattering experiments  will  be  initiated,  using ultrathin layers of these materials, in an effort to observe the  crossover  from three to two dimensions, and ultimately to investigate  magnetic  interactions in the two-dimensional limit  itself.   Samples  will  be prepared at Notre Dame University, and the neutron scattering  experiments  will  be  conducted primarily at the Missouri  University  Research Reactor.  %%%  The  objective  of  the  proposed research is to investigate  magnetic  ordering  and magnetic interactions in thin layers of cubic  manganese  telluride and manganese selenide, as well as in multilayers and alloys  thereof,  using neutron scattering techniques.  These materials, which  do  not  occur naturally but can be grown in this structural  form  by  molecular  beam epitaxy (MBE) hold great fundamental interest  because  the  manganese  ions  form  \"frustrate d\" antiferromagnetic  structures  governed  by  short-range interactions between the ions.   The  growth  technique  permits the controlled variation of factors  that  directly  affect  the  magnetic  behavior, such as  strain,  separation  of  the  magnetic  layers,  dilution  of  the  magnetic  ions,  etc.,   thereby  providing  access  to  a  range  of  fundamentally  new  problems   in  magnetism.
