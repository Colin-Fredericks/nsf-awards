 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the acquisition of a high performance  liquid chromatography, ionsprayTM mass spectrometry system, the API-100  produced by Perkin-Elmer Sciex. This instrumentation will complement  the existing equipment in the Mass Spectrometry Facility and will  significantly enhance the mass spectral capabilities at the University  and throughout the region by providing access to modern research  instrumentation for the academic and industrial research community. For  example, the existing equipment in the Mass Spectrometry Facility  cannot currently address the needs of investigators looking at small  polar molecules, neither can the existing equipment detect high  molecular weight species, features the proposed equipment will address.  This proposal contains brief research plans from ten investigators from  a variety of departments including Civil Engineering, Chemistry,  Botany, Chemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Food Science,  Textile Chemistry and Wood and Paper Science. Acquisition of this  instrumentation will substantially impact a large number of programs in  biotechnology, engineering and environmental research.                  The API-100 will offer improved sensitivity, accurate and  extended molecular mass detection limits, structural characterizations,  identification of post translational modification of peptides, the  ability to perform on-line separations, and the possibility of  exploring higher order structures and nonconvalent interactions  currently not accessible. One of the most significant advances in mass  spectrometric analyses has been the development of the electrospray  ionization and pneumatically assisted electrospray ionization  (ionsprayTM) sources. The ionspray source design permits effective  coupling of the analytical techniques of high performance liquid  chromatography and mass spectrometry. The desorption ionization  process, which occurs at atmospheric pressure, generates ions from  thermally unstable and nonvolatile species.  Even more important, is the  fact that the desorption process can deposit multiple charges on the  molecule, effectively extending the mass range of a standard quadruple  mass spectrometer. While highly sensitive and accurate molecular weight  determinations of large biomolecules are important, structural  information necessary for identification can also be obtained through  collision induced dissociation's in the ionspray interface. When  combined with appropriate enzymatic digestion's and liquid  chromatography, primary structure information can be obtained. This  combination of techniques provide important information in the  characterization of proteins, oligonucleotides and other biomolecules.                  This technique is not limited to the analysis of biomolecules.  Small, polar molecules such as phospholipids, polar metabolic products,  and environmental contanimants can be identified using the combination  of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Previous liquid  chromatography mass spectrometry interfaces such as flow-faqt atom  bombardment (flow-FAB) are ineffective for the analysis of small  molecules. For these applications chromatography is critical for  separation of the complex mixtures while the mass spectrometry provides  the molecular mass and structural characterization needed for  identification without interferences from matrices.                  The administrative and scientific infrastructure is already in  place to assure maximum benefit to the researchers who will utilize  this equipment. A Mass Spectrometry User Committee exists and is  responsible for establishing policy, operational guidelines and fee  structure for the Facility. Operation and maintenance of the equipment  will be the responsibility of the Mass Spectrometry Facility Staff  which includes a Director, postdoctoral fellow, laboratory supervisor  and undergraduate students working on their senior research. This  administrative structure guarantees open and impartial access to all  Facility equ ipment, not only by NC State researchers but by researches  at other system schools including N.C. A&T and UNC-Chapel Hill. The  proposed equipment will be incorporated into the existing Mass  Spectrometry Facility which was established more than a decade ago and  has maintained a reputation for excellence within the University and  throughout the local scientific community. Currently fifty percent of  the staff are women. The experience of the staff in both chromatography  and mass spectrometry assures the immediate and successful utilization.  A clear and urgent need, plus the advantages of improvements in  sensitivity, flexibility, and accuracy indicates that acquisition of  the API-I 00 is justified.",
