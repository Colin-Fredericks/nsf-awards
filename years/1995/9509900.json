 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509900  DEYOUNG  The general thrust of this proposal will be to examine the  behavior of nuclear matter as one moves from normal cold  conditions to highly excited conditions using the tool of heavy-  ion collisions.  Specifically we propose to measure: light  charged particle coincidences with intermediate mass fragments  (IMFs) to determine timescales at higher energies, angular  distributions of IMFs in coincidence with a heavy residue over a  range of energies, neutron-neutron correlation measurements at  lower energies, and coincidences between pre-equilibrium light  particles and heavy products at intermediate energies. We also  propose to continue a small effort directed towards development  of trigger algorithms and simulations for the STAR collaboration  at RHIC.  In addition to our own ambitious experimental program,  we will also support collaborative effopts proposed by others,  such as the anticipated measurements of the spin dependence of  particle emission from compound systems, investigations of highly  excited systems that do not fragment and additional measurements  of excited nuclei which do disintegrate.  Undergraduate students  from Hope College will be involved in all aspects of these  proposed experiments, and included on the publications that will  result.***",
