 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schubert will pursue four areas of inquiry regarding  tropical cyclones.  First, many aspects of hurricane dynamics are  poorly understood, including spiral bands, polygonal eyewalls, and  the oscillatory or looping paths hurricanes take.  An attempt will  be made to develop a unified dynamical understanding of these  phenomena using simple theoretical models and numerical simulation.   A second intriguing problem involves the phenomenon of twin  tropical cyclones.  These paired storms occur exclusively in the  west Pacific and Indian Oceans and play a role in the dynamics of  El Nino.   These systems will be investigated in a series of  modeling studies.  Another interesting phenomenon which has been  observed primarily from satellite observations is the development  of undulations in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) cloud  patterns and the subsequent formation of one or more tropical  cyclones, depending on the degree of curvature.  Dr. Schubert will  study the cyclone formation processes within the ITCZ in a series  of modeling studies.  In all of the modeling studies, he intends to  investigate the role of moist physics.  Finally, the recent  development by the principal investigator of a new coordinate  system based on vorticity for use in models opens the possibility  of formulating a three dimensional nonlinear balanced theory for  vortices.  Dr. Schubert will also pursue this possibility.  All  four topics represent important research problems that are critical  to improving understanding of the formation and behavior of  tropical cyclones.  ***",
