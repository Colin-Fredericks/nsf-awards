The teacher's residence provides a year long professional development  experience for teachers who will be an integral component of successful field experiences for preservice teachers.  The program also encourages participating teachers to become lifelong learners.  The postsecondary faculty members benefit by having a rich resource from which to develop new content and pedagogy.  The project brings solid content knowledge as well as classroom experiences and insights into the way young people do and learn mathematics and the sciences.",
