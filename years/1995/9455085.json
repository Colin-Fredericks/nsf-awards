 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, available in 1995, 1996, and 1997, offers a three-  week workshop that gives 20 persons each year hands-on experience  aimed at mastery of use of modern nuclear magnetic resonance and  mass spectrometry.  It is now widely accepted that these two  techniques are so powerful and central to chemistry that virtually  all institutions that instruct undergraduates in chemistry have  acquired this instrumentation or are planning to do so.  Since the  techniques are strongly complementary, they are taught in tandem in  this workshop, although attendees can emphasize one or the other if  they wish.  Participants will attend lectures, work in groups,  conduct experiments, and devise exercises.  Eminent scientists and  major vendors of the instrumentation will visit the course and  discuss with participants academic and industrial uses of the  techniques.  Participants will develop instructional modules for  use at their home institutions, and will share them with each other  at the course and via E-mail.  The experience will be reinforced  and continued through participation in the activities of research  groups and by donation of post-workshop instrument time at the host  institution.",
