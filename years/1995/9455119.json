 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years, object-oriented technology has become one of  the dominant technologies in the computing industry. In a recent  survey, it was reported that over 75% of the Fortune 100 companies  have adopted object technology to some degree for their computing  needs. This is in response to the increasing software maintenance  cost and backlog that is so prevalent in the software industry.  Because object-orientation is becoming one of the primary means for  problem solving, the need to teach object orientation in  undergraduate curriculum is growing.  This project provides two  2-week summer workshops for faculty who do not have any formal  training in the area of object-orientation. The objectives are to  introduce object-oriented concepts and to demonstrate how to  deliver effective courses and units on object-orientation. The  major topics addressed in this workshop include (1) object-oriented  analysis and design, (2) object-oriented programming, (3)  object-oriented databases, (4) integrating object-orientation into  computer science/information system curriculum, and (5) teaching  object-orientation to undergraduates. The workshop  includes  lectures and laboratory sessions in which participants have  hands-on exercises in each of the above main topics. Participants  also plan a course or course unit utilizing object-oriented  technology at their institutions during the subsequent academic  year. The tools used in the workshops include inexpensive or free  software that are easily obtainable by most universities and  colleges.",
