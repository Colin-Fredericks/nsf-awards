This program of fellowships is a joint activity of the Directorate for Biological Sciences of NSF and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation of New York City.  The five-year program is in its second year.  Eighteen two-year fellowships are offered each year for research and training  in theoretical, comparative, computational, and /or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes at the molecular level, within the framework of evolutionary change and adaptation of organisms, or in the use of molecular data to address broad evolutionary questions.  Fellows are elcouraged to broaden their scientific experience and perspective in molecular evolution by selecting a host laboratory where new conceptual approaches and experimental techniques can be learned.      The research and training plan supported by this fellowship is entitled:  The evolution of megapode (Aves: Megapodiidae) incubation strategies and their effect on mating systems: a molecular phylogenetic approach.",
