 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reed       The investigator and his colleagues use mathematical and  computational tools to investigate processing of auditory  information in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the lateral  superior olive (LSO) of the lower brainstem.  The purpose of the  study of the DCN is to understand how the DCN functions to extract  spectral information from complex sounds.  The purpose of the study  of the LSO is to understand the mechanisms by which it computes  and encodes azimuthal sound location by using interaural intensity  (and time) differences.  The purpose of both projects, which is  based on realistic neurophysiology and neuroanatomy, is to  understand how large groups of cells collectively perform  calculations.  In addition, a mathematical investigation of the  reasons underlying the apparent stability of trophic developmental  schemes as opposed to the instability of forward stochastic  schemes is carried out.  The investigators also investigate the  properties of reaction-hyperbolic partial differential equations.  Equations of this type occur in the transport of materials in  nerve axons (and other eukaryotic cells).  Previous modelling  studies have raised mathematical questions about the existence and  behavior of approximate travelling waves in reaction-hyperbolic  systems of partial differential equations.  Singular perturbation  techniques are used to extend to the nonlinear case previous  results on special linear cases where approximate travelling waves  have been shown to exist in the limit where the chemical rate  constants get large.  Probabilistic methods are used to derive  closed form approximate solution formulas in this asymptotic  limit.  Since little is known about how probabilistic techniques  can be used in linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems (as opposed  to elliptic or parabolic systems), this work may have important  applications to other hyperbolic systems.       The investigators use mathematical and computational tools to  investigate the processing of audit ory information by cells in the  brainstem.  The purpose of the project is to understand how large  groups of nerve cells work together to perform calculations such  as localizing sounds in space or recognizing the sound source by  analyzing the pattern of frequencies contained in the sound.  This  not only gives insight into how we hear and how the brain works,  but should also suggest designs for technological devices that  perform similar functions in the control systems of robots.  The  investigators also investigate a class of partial differential  equations that arise in the transport of materials in nerve axons.  These equations not only allow one to better understand how  materials are transported in normal nerve cells, but also give  insight into the breakdown of transport that occurs in the  presence of some workplace toxins and in certain diseases such as  Alzheimer's disease.",
