 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Profs. Robert C. Compton and Albert Tuinman of the Department   of Chemistry of the University of Tennessee will engage in a series of   investigations in the area of ion-molecule chemistry.  Specifically, the   investigators will study the properties of doubly charged negative ions   of polyatomic molecules.  The work consists of two parts.  1) Guided by   theoretical predictions, a search will be undertaken for multiply charged   negative molecular ions, and 2) the energy dependent cross sections of   the first and second electron attachments to such molecules as are found   in part 1) will be determined.   Special attention will be given to the   fullerene molecules C60 and C60F48.  The area of study of doubly charged negative ions has been beset with   great difficulties in the past, in consequence of which there has been a   lot of controversy.  Nearly all previous reports on doubly charged   negative molecular ions have been found to be based on spurious data and   experimental artifacts.  The present work is judged to have great promise   in achieving a breakthrough in this field.  This research is important   not only for its intrinsic value in an area of strong current interest,   but it also holds promise to be relevant to technical applications such   as the electrospray process.",
