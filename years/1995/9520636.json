Such approximations  constitute the natural generalization of Hartree-Fock  theories to systems with strong interactions and large  electronic fluctuations, including the cuprate high-  temperature superconductors.  The self-consistent field  approach provides a semi-analytical alternative to numerical  techniques like exact diagonalization or simulation.  The  research proposed concentrates on the extension of the self-  consistent field approach to (a) lattice models with  nontrivial unit-cell structure, including multi-orbital  models describing the cuprate superconductors; and (b)  lattice models with infinite-range Coulomb interactions.  In  addition, a program of study is proposed to improve the  treatment of nonlocal vertices in general two-particle  correlation functions.  %%%  New computational techniques will be investigated to deal  with systems of electrons which interact strongly and for  which existing methods are not applicable.  Of particular  interest, these new techniques will be applied to the  problem of understanding high-temperature superconductors.  ***",
