 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504497  Bousfield       Bousfield will continue his research in homotopy theory, using  localization methods to expose and analyze unstable periodic  phenomena.  During the 1980's, remarkable progress was made toward  a global understanding of stable homotopy theory, showing that some  major features arise chromatically from an interplay of periodic  phenomena arranged in a hierarchy.  This project is part of an  effort to develop a similar understanding in unstable homotopy  theory.  In recent work, Bousfield introduced a hierarchy of  localizations, called the vn-periodizations for positive integers  n, which serve to resolve a given space into a chromatic tower with  monochromatic fibres.  He will work to understand these  vn-periodizations of spaces as well as the closely related  homological localizations.  He has already established strong links  between v1-periodizations and K-homology localizations of spaces,  leading to solutions of old problems concerning the K-theory of  iterated loop spaces.       Geometric objects or spaces play a central role in  mathematics, arising for instance from the solution sets of systems  of equations.  Beyond their usual measurements, such spaces have  deeper properties which persist even after drastic deformations.  These properties begin almost trivially with the number of separate  components and the number of holes but become tremendously rich and  informative in higher dimensions.  The field of homotopy theory is  devoted to their study using powerful algebraic and geometric  techniques.  Various periodic phenomena in homotopy theory have  been discovered since the 1950's, and an exciting \"chromatic\"  approach to the subject was developed in the 1980's, allowing  resolutions of confusingly complicated phenomena into much simpler  periodic parts.  This approach was originally restricted to certain  simpler phenomena known as stable phenomena, but it is now being  extended to a full, fascinating, important range of unstable  homotopy theoretic phenome na.  ***",
