During Phase I work,  Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5 was selected as uniquely suited for use  in biotrickling filters designed to treat air emission.  Phase II  research will attempt to: (1) establish potential co-substrates for  hydrohalocarbon oxidation; (2) develop an on-line gas  chromatographic method for continuous monitoring of pollutant  halogenated hydrocarbons; (3) show the feasibility of using M.  caccae JOB5 in bench-scale biotrickling filters and verify  mineralization of target compounds; (4) establish the optimal  feeding rate to these biofiltering devices; (5) obtain data on the  long-term use of the biotrickling filter; (6) use this information  in cost analyses of estimates for construction of a full-scale  biotrickling filter, and in projecting capital and operating costs  in comparison with those of conventional physical/chemical  treatment technologies; and (7) incorporate this information into  a final report and commercialization plan for the technology.  It  is suggested that the development of a bioreactor system for the  removal and destruction of hydrohalocarbon vapor emissions  potentially could offer significant cost reductions and overall  savings compared to today's conventional air treatment options.  %%%  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project involves  the development of a biocatalyst-based reactor system for the  destruction of pollutant compounds that contribute to ozone  depletion and global warming.  During Phase I work, Mycobacterium  vaccae JOB5 was selected as best suited for use in biotrickling  filters designed to remove these pollutants from the air.  Phase II  research will attempt to: (1) find out what kind of compounds can  be removed from air with this microbe-based filter system; (2)  deve lop an on-line gas chromatographic method to continuously  measure the concentration of these pollutants in air; (3) show the  feasibility of using M. caccae JOB5 in bench-scale biotrickling  filters and verify that the filtering device destroys the target  compounds; (4) establish the rate at which the filter system can  destroy pollutants; (5) obtain data on the long-term use of the  biotrickling filter; and (6) use this information in cost analyses  for building a full-scale biotrickling filter, and comparing  capital investments and operating costs for this novel  biotechnology with conventional physical/chemical treatment  technologies.  Finally, these data will be incorporated into a  final report and commercialization plan for this novel technology.   It is suggested that the development of a bioreactor system could  provide significant cost reductions and overall savings compared to  today's conventional air treatment options.  ***",
