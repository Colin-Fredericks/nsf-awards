 "awd_abstract_narration": "McMillan  95-54240    A project to link K-12 students and teachers to practicing University, industry and agency scientists using  networked technology, with the aim of increasing the practice of authentic, project based math and science.    A significant portion of science and math teaching, inquiry, and application at the primary and secondary grade levels can be furthered by the virtually unlimited possibilities for information gathering and sharing via computer networking. Yet teachers and their students often do not take advantage of the facilities available, or do not have access to the technology that would make this possible. Alaska, with its far flung population and limited road system can especially benefit from networked technology. We should morph into the virtual classroom where students, teachers, and practicing scientists from throughout Alaska and the world engage in animated conversations, conduct experiments, and exchange information using the information networking.    The main goal of the proposed Partners in Science project is to further math and science learning in grades K-12 in the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District (FNSBSD), two rural Alaskan school districts (Iditarod and Gateway), and among isolated home-schoolers. In addition, the project will share the educational experiences and new concepts developed on a statewide, national, and global level. To accomplish this, the proposed project has been broken down into objectives that focus on its three main components: the students, the teachers, and the technology.    In order to achieve these objectives, the proposed project will link practicing scientists from higher education, government, and industry with teachers and students, using the latest information networking technology. It will be instrumental in igniting a redefinition of technology's place in the education process in the targeted school districts. We are very hopeful that Partners in Science is very effective in pulling in the most isolated student s in our state -students in rural districts and students being taught at home by their parents (homeschoolers).    A central feature of this project is the creation of Virtual Science and Math classrooms at the elementary, junior high and high school level. Teachers will be intensively trained in these classrooms in the best practices used to achieve the math and science standards expressed in Goals 2000 and Alaska 2000, using electronic and person-to-person networkworking to practicing scientists. Several levels of training are proposed to allow the opportunity to participate by our eager, yet inexperienced teachers to the most able and ready staff.",
