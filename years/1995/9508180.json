This system will be housed in the X-ray  Mineralogy Laboratory of the Department of Geological Sciences.  The university will provide 44% of the total cost of this system.  This equipment will replace an antiquated and presently  inadequate powder X-ray diffraction unit.  The present instrument  has heretofore served as the only powder diffractometer servicing  the entire Central Campus of the University of Michigan.  In  addition to its use in the principal investigator's highly  regarded research in clay mineralogy, the new facility will be  available to qualified students and faculty of other departments  including members of the Departments of Geological Sciences,  Chemistry, Physics and the College of Pharmacy and Dentistry.        ***",
