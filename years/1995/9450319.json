 "awd_abstract_narration": "9450319  Wyche    Brown University proposes to expand its Summer Research-Early  Identification Program (SR-EIP) in the biomedical sciences to a  year-round research and career oriented experience for highly  motivated Brown underrepresented minority students in the life  sciences and engineering.  The program, Research Careers for  Minority Scholars (RCMS) at Brown University, will involve talented  students from the freshman through senior year and expand the  career options for those students during the four-year period of  the proposal.  Students will be matched with faculty sponsors who  will provide mentorship, guidance, and a first-rate research  environment starting in the freshman year.  During the summer  following the freshman year, students will participated in a nine-  week program comprising a continuation of the research experience,  seminars and field trips, weekly research colloquia by Brown  faculty and outside speakers, and visits to industrial companies.   During the junior and senior year, students will be encouraged to  apply to Brown's Ph.D. programs and to other highly selected  graduate schools.  One measure of the RCMS experience's success at  Brown will be the number of recruits to graduate degree programs.   The program's goal will be to produce a minimum of 15 pre-doctoral  candidates by the year 2000.",
