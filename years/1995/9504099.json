 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504099  Kenny, Thomas    This project is concerned with the design, fabrication, and  characterization of micromechanical structures and devices.  Emphasis is on the characterization of the fabricated  micromechanical structures.  Accurate non-contact  measurements of mechanical properties are also very  important.    This instrumentation will be used in support of several  experiments, including characterization of tunneling  sensors, study of mode shapes in micromachined sensor  components, and fundamental characterization of mechanical  microstructures, with emphasis on evolution of  characteristics with environmental parameters, such as  pressure or temperature.    This interferometer-based measurement system is on its way  to becoming a standard for micromechanical structure  characterization in industry, and represents a unique  resource in the academic community.  It will provide a  fundamentally new capability for microstructure  characterization, and enable graduate students to carry out  measurements using equipment which they can expect to  encounter in industry after graduation.  This  instrumentation represents an invaluable enhancement in the  device testing capabilities at Stanford as uell as an  opportunity to carry out ground-breaking research into the  fundamental properties of micromechanical structures.",
