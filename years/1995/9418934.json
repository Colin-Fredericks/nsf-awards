 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cohen  9418934  The PI will perform theoretical studies of the high pressure properties of candidtate mantle phases in order to better constrain the physical properties of the mantle.  Several important and basic questions will be addressed, including: 1) thermal effects on predicted and recently veriied ferroelastic phase transitin in SiO2 from stishovite to CaCl2 and elastic and anelastic properties at the transition; 2) possible high temperature phase transitions in McSiO3, 3) behavior of iron in oxides and metal-insulator transitions in high pressure oxides, and 4) transport, thermoelastic, and anelastic properties of mantle phases.  A combination of the following theoretical techniques will be used: a) first-primciples electronic structure calculations using the Linearized Augmented Plane Wane (LAPW) method, b) ab initio models methods that make assumptions about bonding and ionicity but are many orders of magnitude faster than LAPW, c) hybrid \"constrained potential modles\" that correct the ab initio models to give better agreement with the first-principles calcuations, d)lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulation using these potentials to obtain temperature dependent properties, and e) a newly developed tight-binding total energy model that includes covalent and metallic interactions.  This work will give important predictions for geophysics and geochemistry that will aid understanding of the evolution and dynamics of the Earth and terrestrial planets.  It will give predictions of mineral properties in the experimentally difficult regime of the high pressures and tempreatures of the deep Earth.  It will also increase our understanding of experimental observations of mineral behavior.  The predictions helo guide experimental studies.  Finally, students from high school to the post-doctoral level will be trained in scientific, theoretical and computational methods.  ****",
