 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417071  Campbell           The recently discovered photosynthetic prokaryotes  Prochlorococcus spp., which contain a unique set of pigment  including divinyl chlorophyll a and b, have been shown to be  an important component of the phytoplankton community  contributing 25 to 60% of total chlorophyll biomass.  In  the subtropical central Pacific Ocean, Prochlorococcus  dominate in the upper 100 m of the water column in  chlorophyll and carbon biomass.  The primary goal of this  research is this research is to examine the factors which  limit the growth and distribution of Prochlorococcus.  A  primary objective is to investigate the effects of light and  nitrogen-source on the growth of different Prochlorococcus  strains in culture and in the field.  Specifically the  research will conduct the following experiments on  laboratory cultures of Prochlorococcus: 1) compare the  effects of irradiance and nitrogen source on photosynthetic  parameters (P vs. I and N vs. I), nitrogen uptake rates and  growth rates; 2) determine nitrogen uptake rates of varying  Prochlorococcus populations in the central Pacific; and 3)  assess the ability of NH4 to inhibit NO3 and urea uptake in  Prochlorococcus.  In addition to the laboratory experiments,  four quarterly cruises will be conducted to station ALOHA in  the North Pacific where field populations of Prochlorococcus  will be compared with the distribution of other  phytoplankton species with depth and nutrient profiles.  Further, field populations of Prochlorococcus will be  assayed for growth rates, the effects of light intensity on  growth rate, and nutrients addition experiments.  Finally,  monoclonal antibody probes will be used to provide a means  of certain identification and enumeration of distinct  Prochlorococcus populations.",
