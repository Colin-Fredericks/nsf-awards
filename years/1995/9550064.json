The RASEM will be a Regional Center that  will work with other educational entities and organizations in  the three-state region for the purpose of encouraging students  with disabilities to pursue science, engineering, and mathematics  (SEM) careers.  The Center will provide leadership, coordination,  assistance, evaluation, and dissemination to state departments of  education, two- and four-year colleges, secondary schools,  national research laboratories, and public and private sponsors.   The three-year project will support strategies that remove  obstacles that impede students with disabilities from pursuing  careers in SEM fields.  The Center will also cooperate with the  Alliances for Minority Participation (AMP) and the Comprehensive  Partnerships for Minority Student Achievement (PMSA) programs in  assisting student participants through critical educational  transitions.  Students with disabilities at the secondary level  of education will be encouraged and assisted through strategies  that include conceptual videos, student stipends, adaptive  technologies, computer networking, SEM summer camps, and  supercomputer experiences.  Workshops will be offered to  precollege teachers and administrators to dispel stereotypes and  promote teacher involvement in support of students with  disabilities.  Strategies to be used on the college level will  include financial incentives, removal of impediments to effective  learning, and establishment of collaboration with other  educational partners.  These collaborations will stimulate  research opportunities and mentoring relationships.  RASEM should  assure a steady growth in the number of persons with disabilities  who select SEM career paths serving as a model for other centers  in the country.",
