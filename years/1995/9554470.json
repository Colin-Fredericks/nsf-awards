 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shacklett  95-54470    The NSF Networking Infrastructure for Education Implementation Grant will provide a process  model for integrating a networking infrastructure into the Morse High School Center for Tech-  nology and Pacific Rim Studies magnet. The infrastructure will support Morse High School's  effort to implement reform concepts contained in the master plan for high schools in California:  Second to None: A Vision of the New California High School. The project centers on the develop-  ment of an interdisciplinary career path curriculum supported by multimedia technology. The  goal of the proposed educational reform is that every high school graduate will have the knowl-  edge and skills needed to make the choice of immediately entering the workforce or to continue  in post-secondary education before engaging in a career. The project will result in a process model, documented on CD ROM and disseminated through the Internet. that can be used by other schools which are integrating technology and implementing educational reforms to improve student achievement in  math and science.    The project will develop a process model for implementing Second to None that includes the following components:      development of an interdisciplinary curriculum for five magnet career paths: Aeronautics, Engineering, Science, Tourism, and Languages    integration of high quality math and science courses in each career path    a Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) program    a \"Tech Prep\" certification program    early entry to college-level study through telecourses and community college courses on and off campus    a collaborative model K-16    a process for delivering staff development for teachers and other staff functioning in a Second to None teaching and learning environment    a process for involving industry as full partners in the Second to None teaching and learning environment    a process for integrating a networking infrastructure that will support and enhance student learning, staff developmen t, industry and parent/community involvement, and administration/ classroom management.    Over the three year period, the project will:      network the entire school    train teachers and other school personnel in the use of technology    utilize school/parent/industry design teams to develop the career path curriculum    replicate school/industry/university models providing students hands-on experience using technology and on-the-job experiences    infuse math and science in each career path    redesign courses using applied, problem-solving approaches    integrate technology and accompanying new teaching/learning methodologies, including ethics, in the classroom curriculum    develop academic support programs using technology for students who fail to meet minimum standards in math, science, and reading",
