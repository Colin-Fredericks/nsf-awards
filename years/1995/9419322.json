 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419322  Chavez    This proposal was submitted in response to a one-time Program  Announcement - NSF 93-101 for the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)  Coastal Air-Sea Chemical Fluxes pilot study.  The Announcement  suggested that a mutually beneficial opportunity exists to  coordinate an NSF/CoOP research effort with the ONR-sponsored  Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) Advanced Research Initiative (ARI)  planned for 1995.  The CoOP study might complement the ONR physical  processes study by encompassing biological and chemical  oceanographic processes aimed at developing a mechanistic  understanding of air-sea fluxes.  The overall scientific project  would be interdisciplinary, with the NSF/CoOP efforts addressing  chemical and biological parameters, while the ONR study focuses on  physical oceanographic and meteorological parameters.     This research is a collaborative effort with the University of  Southern California.  The work will determine the effect of  phytoplankton productivity on the fate of upwelled CO2 in coastal  environments.  The PIs intend to make measurements of pCO2, TCO2,  NO3, NH4, urea, pigments, POC, PON, biogenic silicon (BSi) and  Si(OH)4 and also perform incubations with 14CO2, 15NO3, 15NH, and  15N-urea to estimate and interpret biological activities within the  region of the experiment.  The ultimate goal is to determine how  nutrient concentrations control uptake of \"new\" CO and the length  of time that high surface water pCO2 concentrations remain above  atmospheric levels.  Because the rate of new production controls  the length of time newly upwelled CO2 are exposed to the  atmosphere, its measurement is key to a thorough understanding of  the CO2 flux transfer from ocean to atmosphere.  Data collection  will be conducted through both underway and station shipboard  activities as well as through drifters and moorings.  Phytoplankton  species determinations will be made on selected samples.  Finally,  the ratios of uptake of carbon to nitrogen, disappearance of  CO2:NO3:Si( OH)4 from the water column, and POC:PON:BSi will be  calculated from collected data.  The proposed work will be  coordinated with physical and meteorological experiments to be  conducted by other researchers.",
