 "awd_abstract_narration": "Representing curved shape is a fundamental problem in  geometric modeling and design.  A variety of approaches  currently exist for  modeling curved shape, by far the most  popular of which is a boundary  representation (B-rep) whose  surfaces are trimmed NURBS (non-uniform rational  B-splines).  Unfortunately, building a modeler based on trimmed NURBS is  exceedingly difficult for at least two reasons.  First,  trimming two NURBS  patches to agree along a common edge  usually involves complex surface/surface  intersection  algorithms and substantial approximation.  Second, even in  the  absence of sharp edges, patching is often required since  a single NURBS patch  is capable of modeling only surfaces  topologically equivalent to planes,  cylinders, and tori.  Modeling surfaces of other topological types (even those  as  simple as a sphere) require the surface be decomposed into  a quiltwork of  individual NURBS patches.  Complicated  continuity conditions must then be  imposed to guarantee  that adjacent patches join smoothly.    Subdivision  provides a promising alternative to NURBS.  Using subdivision, a polyhedron is  mapped to a sequence of  denser polyhedra whose limit is a curved object.  Each  new  polyhedron is derived from the previous polyhedron by  splitting each of  its faces into four new faces and  positioning its new vertices using a fixed  averaging mask.  Different masks yield surface features such as corners,  curved  edges, or smooth faces in the limit object.  The  method is simple, requiring  only polyhedral modeling.  The  method is general, producing objects with smooth  faces and  sharp curved edges without trimming or patching. Finally,  subdivision provides a hierarchical representation that  allows the design of  efficient multi-resolution processing  algorithms.    This research addresses a  combination of theoretical and  applied problems whose solution is essential if  subdivision  is to be of use as a practical method for modeling curved  shape.  Specifically it develops:         Curvature continuous subdivision methods;   Subdivision methods for local refinement and  introduction of shapes and  edges;        Functional subdivision methods over irregular  triangulations  (necessary for FEA)  and algorithms for:   Conversion to and from other  representations such as  NURBS,          Editing and display of subdividion  surfaces,         Finite element analysis over subdivision surfaces,   Computing the intersection, union, or difference of  subdivision surfaces.",
