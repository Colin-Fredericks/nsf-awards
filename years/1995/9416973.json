 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is undertaking a systematic investigation of a  general class of structural program analysis problems. The term  structural  program analysis refers to compile-time program analyses that deal with the  types and structure of values  computed by programs. This class of program  analyses is broad,  including within it the classical dataflow analyses of C and  FORTRAN compilers, type inference for languages such as ML, and analysis of  class membership of values in object-oriented  languages.  The primary goal of  this work is the synthesis of set constraint  techniques for structural program  analysis in a common framework;  in particular, an implementation of set  constraints suitable for  use in a general class of program analysis problems  will be  developed and distributed for use in research and teaching.  There has  been considerable activity directed towards using set  constraints for  structural analyses in recent years. Most of the  work has been directed either  towards studying the theory of set  constraints itself, or at applications of  set constraints to  particular problems. Set-based analysis is the exception;  set-  based analysis provides a high-level characterization of a class  of  program analyses in terms of set constraints. Currently,  however, there is no  general-purpose implementation of set  constraints available for experimentation  with set-based (or any  other class of) analyses. This system is expected to be  expressive enough to encompass all set-based analyses and many  analyses that  are not set-based.    Aside from the primary goal of developing an  `off-the-shelf`  implementation of set constraints that can be used in many  settings, the project also pursues three secondary goals. The  first goal is to  develop a common technical language for  structural analyses. The second goal is  to describe the structure  of the design space for structural program analyses  using this  common technical framework. The tradeoffs between accuracy and  speed in structural analyses are poorly understood.  By studying  these  problems in an abstract setting, it should be possible to  make general  statements about the relative efficiency and  precision of various program  analysis techniques that apply  across a wide spectrum of applications. The  third goal is to  design algorithms using the above results. General algorithms  are  sought that would provide the best precision-speed tradeoffs for  various  classes of analysis problems.",
