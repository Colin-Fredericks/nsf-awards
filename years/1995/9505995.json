Our approach relies on the concept of the graph.  Model  uncertainty is quantified using the gap metric which measures  potential graph perturbations, and suitable margins are developed  to ascertain performance and robustness of stability for the  uncertain system.  In our past research, we have developed  computational and theoretical tools for robust control of linear  systems with an energy-type (L2-norm) performance specification.   The use of these tools has been demonstrated via application  studies, and related software has become available within a  standard commercial package (u-tools).       Over the next three years, we propose an intensive program to  develop theoretical and computational tools for robust control of  nonlinear systems.  The robustness will be quantified using  suitable gap-like metrics.  In particular, we introduce a variety  of possible distance measures which may be appropriate in different  situations.  We propose to compute suitable robustness margins  which guarantee robustness of stability and performance.  These  margins can be tailored to a variety of Lo, L2, global, and semi-  local stability and performance requirements.  Further, we will  develop related tools for robust feedback design under such metric  uncertainty.  Emphasis will be placed on computational issues and  application studies.   ***",
