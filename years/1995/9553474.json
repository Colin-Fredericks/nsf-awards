 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553474  Papert    This project proposes to study and foster the development of  technological fluency in K-12 students.  In our view, technical  fluency involves not only knowing how to use technical tools, but  also knowing how to construct things of significance with those  tools.  Technological fluency involves the ability to express,  explore, and realize ideas with new technological media-and to take  advantage of those media to enhance learning in other domains.    The project focuses on two primary themes in the development and  support of technological fluency:    * Access to knowledge.  How can we provide students with better  access to the knowledge they need, when they need it, as they are  engaged in construction activities?  To serve these needs, we will  develop initial versions of a constructopedia-a new kind of  knowledge source in which concepts are indexed according to their  uses in construction.  The constructopedia is a browsable,  interactive database, designed to help students build new  constructions-and to help them make connections to mathematical and  scientific ideas underlying those constructions.    * Representations of knowledge.  New media call out for new  representations.  The language and forms most appropriate for  representing phenomenon in one medium might be quite inappropriate  in another.  We aim to develop new representations of scientific  and mathematical knowledge that are more intuitive and concrete for  students, and better suited to the nature of computational media.   Our goal is not to make traditional representations of  science/mathematics.  We will pay special attention to  \"epistemological shifts\"-for example, emphasizing dynamic  representations over static ones, and developing new ways of  casting knowledge computational terms (such as \"agent-oriented\"  descriptions of knowledge).    New representations of knowledge, and new access to knowledge, are  needed in all domains, but we will focus our efforts on two domains  for which our past wo rk has laid the ground: (a) the  physics/mathematics of motion, and (b) systems theory concepts  (such as feedback and dynamic equilibrium).  We will explore and  develop new representations of knowledge in these domains, and we  will create \"constructopedia samplers\" to support student  construction and learning in these domains.  Each sampler will  include examples, descriptions, explanations, and illustrations  (including graphic animations and video clips) related to the  conceptual themes.    We will make our constructopedia materials available widely, both  on the World Wide Wed and in CD-ROM format.  We will work directly  with teachers and students at a number of sites, with an increasing  proportion of our effort going to sites supporting the transition  from school to work, and to informal (non-school) settings.  We  intend to collaborate closing with user of our materials, using new  information channels to accelerate and enhance the development  cycle for the materials, using new information channels to  accelerate and enhance the development cycle for the materials,  making the development process more rapid, open, and transparent.   We also plan to use new information channels to make the evaluation  cycle shorter and richer.  We will pay special attention to the  dangers of \"dilution in dissemination,\" exploring ways to  strengthen not only the adoption of our materials but the  appropriation of our ideas.  ***",
