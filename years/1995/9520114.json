 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:   This project supports the participation of a delegation of eminent US scientists and engineers from academic institutes in a `Symposium on Science and Engineering Education in the 21st Century` organized by the American University in Cairo.  The meeting scheduled for April 9-12, 1995, has the following objectives: examining present and future trends in the use of high technology computer and multimedia applications in basic sciences and engineering education; identifying curricular changes to meet challenges of development; examining the state of-the-art and future trends in the theory and practice in basic science and engineering education; and discussing needs for life-long learning for continuous human development.  Seven US academics who have long experiences in S&E education and development are invited to participate to cover the areas of computer science, physics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, biology, and chemistry.  Several plenary lectures will be presented by these scientists and others from Europe and the Middle East.   A number of workshops are planned to demonstrate the latest software packages in the various scientific disciplines, with emphasis on interactive dynamic simulation techniques that link and integrate knowledge across disciplines.  The proceeding of the Symposium will be published, and will include the plenary lectures as well as selected presentations from participants.    Total participants are expected to number 400 to 500 and will include scientists from Egypt and from other Middle East countries in a wide range of science and engineering disciplines, and will also include representative from the industrial and business sectors as well as prospective employers of scientists and engineers.  A selected number of graduate and undergraduate students. will also be invited.",
