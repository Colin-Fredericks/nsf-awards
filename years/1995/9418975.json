 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418975  Lawton  This award deals with the PR5K gene from Arabidopsis  thaliana which encodes a novel receptor with structural  features related to plant defense proteins.  The kinase  domain of PR5K is presumed to be involved in cytoplasmic  signal transduction.  The extracellular domain is closely  related to a group of antimicrobial proteins that includes  the pathogenesis protein PR-5, osmotin, thaumatin and a  bifunctional inhibitor of maize.  By analogy with other  receptor kinases, this domain is the predicted binding site  for a polypeptide ligand.  The structural relationship  between the extracellular domain of PR5K and known  pathogenesis-related proteins suggests a possible functional  relationship in the expression of the defense response.  Thus, cellular targets of antimicrobial proteins such as PR5  might also serve as ligands for activation of the PR5K  receptor.  A close structural relationship is also seen for  the secreted and kinase-linked forms of the S-locus  glycoproteins of Brassica and these molecules have been  proposed to form a functional unit that specifies self-  incompatibility during pistil-pollen interactions.  This  proposal is concerned with characterizing the PR5K receptor  and dissecting its possible role in the perception of plant  defense signals.",
