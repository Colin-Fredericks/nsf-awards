 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surfaces in 4-dimensional space exhibit knotting behavior   similar to circles in 3-space and are mathematically central to basic   understanding of 4-space. The primary point of view is topological.   Basic steps in the program are as follows. (1) Represent knotted   surfaces and isotopies of these surfaces as data sets. Traditional   topological constructions do not readily give rise to formulas, thus   calculations for coordinates of vertices is a non-trivial matter.   Computations based on the concept of an energy of a knot give rise to    interesting, useful, and in some sense, natural placements and   motions of knotted surfaces in four dimensional space.  A second   method is local in nature and is based on the investigator's methods   of higher dimensional knot moves.  A third method involves   interactive computer graphics.  (2)  Represent knotted surfaces in a   symbolic way.  To a surface in 4-space one can associate a   combinatorial object called a knot diagram. There is a calculus for   such diagrams similar to that which exists for classical knot   diagrams, a goal is to implement this.  From a knot diagram one can   determine some algebraic invariants of a knotted surface.  A   presentation of the knot group is one such example.  Using examples   (produced in part (1), above), higher dimensional diagrams will be   generated and analyzed with the hope of finding other combinatorially   defined invariants. (3)  Develop visualization techniques for the   search and verification of mathematical relationships between   examples.  It is not enough to \"see\" these objects, one wants to get   a mathematical understanding.  One such new visualization technique   uses a parameterized texture to provide natural visual cues for   higher dimensional information. Another involves interactive   manipulations objects in 4-space.  Currently, the investigator is   developing use of the CAVE in conjunction with parallel computation   as the best current tool for such a four-dimensional inte ractive   environment.            The basic question is: what is four dimensional space ?  One   is looking for mathematical answers with emphasis on computation and   visualization.  The study of four (and more) dimensions is not at all   esoteric.  Mathematically, a dimension is nothing more than a number.    Anything that needs to have four independent variables to describe it   can be considered to be a subset of four-dimensional space.  The most   well known example is an \"event\".  An event happens at a certain   place and a certain time.  Three numbers are needed to locate the   position of the event and the \"fourth dimension\" is time. The reason   that four-dimensions is very different than three is that it is   difficult to visualize.  This is a focus of this research.  The   things that we visualize best are surfaces, so it is natural to use   surfaces in four-dimensional space as a visualization tool. In   addition surfaces provide powerful mathematical probes into 4-space.   This investigation relies heavily on \"state of the art\" equipment.    To grapple with the complexities of the computation, use is made of   \"super-computers\".  To grapple with the complexities of visualization   and manipulation, use is made of a \"virtual reality\" system.  In   summary, the broad significance of this program is the extension of   frontiers of visual understanding for complex information using   modern computational tools.",
