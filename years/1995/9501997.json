 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is in the area of computational molecular biology;  specifically it addresses problems in protein folding and the self-assembly   of virus shells.  The `grand challenge` problem associated with protein folding  is to determine how a protein will fold in 3-dimensions when given  only its  amino acid sequence.  An important first step in tackling the protein folding  problem is a solution to the motif  recognition problem (i.e., given a known 3D  structure, or motif, determining whether this motif occurs in an unknown amino  acid  sequence).  The goal of this effort is to develop new algorithms, based   solely on the right pairwise correlation probabilities, which out perform existing  motif recognition algorithms. An implementation  of these algorithms, is being  programmed.  In fact, the package  is aiding in the discovery of the coiled-coil  motif in such  viruses as Mollney murine leukemia, influenza hemagglutinin, and  HIV.  The coiled-coil motif is thought to be the mechanism by  which proteins  fuse with or bind to the cell membrane.   This  continuing research deals with  recognizing motifs when less data  is available, predicting inter-strand  interactions in motifs, and  finding new insights into the 3-dimensional  structure of  proteins.    The second part of the project involves studying the  self-assembly  of virus shells.  In particular, by computationally modeling how  these shells are built, it is hopefully possible to suggest ways  of interfering  with the growth of these viruses and of causing  their deformity.    The  Educational Component of this CAREER Grant includes:  (a) Development of  interdisciplinary (computer science, mathematics,  and biology) undergraduate  and graduate courses and curriculum in  computational molecular biology,  discrete mathematics and the  theory of (biological) algorithms; (b) Development of  both  undergraduate and graduate seminars in computational molecular  biology.  Participation of undergraduate students in developing  the extended system  project and the Virus Shell Assembly project.  (This is part of the Research  Experiences for Undergraduates  Program at NSF and Undergraduate Research  Opportunities Program  of MIT.)",
