 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554466  Larson    The Alaska Federation of Natives and the University of Alaska  Fairbanks have established the Alaska Native/Rural Education  Consortium (ANREC) to implement recommendations from a seminar  series that focused on instruction to Alaska Native students.   Working through institutions of higher education, the Alaska  Department of Education, and tribal councils, the consortium  will  undertake a five year initiative to systemically document the  indigenous knowledge systems of Alaska Native people and develop  pedagogical practices that will integrate indigenous knowledge into  the curriculum, and restructure instructional practices to  capitalize on Native learning styles, to improve the science and  mathematics achievement of students in Alaska Native village  schools.    The focus of the proposed initiative is on providing an opportunity  for the Native people of Alaska to formulate a renewed educational  agenda regarding the structure, content and processes that are  needed to increase the application of Native and non-Native  science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) knowledge  to the solution of educational problems in the Arctic environment.    The overall project is organized into the following three  initiatives: (1) Native Ways of Knowing and Teaching (the  preservice component); (2) Culturally aligned Curriculum  Adaptations (the curricular component); and (3) Elders and Cultural  Camps (the inservice component).  These activities will be  implemented in the five (5) cultural regions of the State.  It is  anticipated by the Year 2000, the Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative  will involve 48 of the 54 public school districts in the state,  impacting 302 schools, with a total of 2925 certified staff serving  31,515 students.    In addition to the pedagogical impacts, ANREC plans to establish a  Native Sciences Advisory Board, with national membership and  reflecting the culturally relevant science and mathematics  knowledge held by Native scientists and enginee rs.  Although the  Board will provide guidance to the content of ANREC's activities,  it is hoped that other systemic initiatives or organizations  involved with teaching native students will benefit from its  existence.  ***",
