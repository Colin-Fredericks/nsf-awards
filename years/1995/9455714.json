 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate science education for both students majoring in  science and engineering, and those students who are non-science  majors must evolve to bring students in contact with the tools  needed to efficiently grasp critical and emerging scientific  issues. In 1991, the University of Arizona started a two-semester  sequence \"Introduction to Global Change\" to teach non-science  majors about the Earth system. The course teaches basic  scientific principles in the context of global problems and  challenges facing scientists, policy makers and citizens alike.  The current project further develops this general-science course  sequence in order to more fully integrate information  technologies into the courses, and to explicitly design materials  that promote collaborative learning and critical thinking skills  through several different instructional strategies.  PIs are  working with an independent, professional evaluator to develop  and implement 10 modules for the two-course sequence. A module is  a course unit focusing on a single topic, and involves laboratory  sections, lectures, homework, discussions or other resources. The  focus of their efforts is on: i) developing computer-based  laboratory exercises as the centerpieces of the modules, ii)  implementing the computer-based tools with the classes, iii)  assembling and preparing the additional material needed to  complete each module (e.g. visual aids, study questions,  background material, references), and iv) documenting each module  in a workbook for the classes. The workbook, including  documentation of software and data, will be made available to  faculty at other colleges and universities interested in  developing similar global-change courses.  An important aspect of  this project is the explicit assessment of the effectiveness of  different instructional strategies on students of different  gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class. This  multidisciplinary teaching effort is part of the University of  Arizona's global-change resea rch program.",
