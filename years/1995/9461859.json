 "awd_abstract_narration": "The monolithic ring approach to building powerful, highly-coherent laser sources is been well proven at the two wavelengths of 1064 nm and 1319 nm.  The commercial market and the thus technological value of this laser design increased if more wavelengths were available at  the same high power and extreme coherence.  This research explores lasers based on the monolithic ring resonator design at a number of wavelengths other than 1064 nm and 1319 nm.  These lasers may applications in absolute-distance interferometry, astronomical instrumentation  for detection of astronomical millimeter waves, atomic clocks and precision metrology using specific near infrared and visible wavelengths.   The Phase I objective is to powerful, single-frequency, diode-pumped laser oscillation on a number of laser lines that have not yet been used commercially.  Two techniques are employed. First, using Nd:YAG, the research uses wavelength-selective coatings to get as many wavelengths as possible. Second, lasers at two quasi-three level laser lines - Nd:YAG at 946 nm, and Yb:YAG at 1030 nm - are constructed by using diffusion-bonding to create monolithic resonators with doped and undoped regions.   The range of single-frequency laser lines which are available is expected to be expanded.  Phase II  will be the design of lasers at wavelengths identified in Phase I.",
