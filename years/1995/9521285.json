 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521285  Cabrera   This project is to develop a low-cost Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) optimized for shallow water applications.  In addition to lower instrument cost, the new system will provide a number of significant advantages over existing ADCPs such as: ability to measure closer to the surface/bottom, more rugged transducers, lower power consumption, smaller size, and simpler operation and deployment.  It has demonstrated the feasibility of achieving these goals with the use of state-of-the-art electronics and application specific hardware to reduce cost, size and power consumption.  It has also demonstrated how new transducer design and optimized pinging schemes can significantly reduce sidelobe interference thus increasing the likelihood of accurate measurements close to the surface/bottom.  In addition,  a number of materials and construction techniques for transducers and underwater housings that can be used to improve the ruggedness of the system in areas of high biological activity were evaluated.  Research will continue in some of the areas identified.   Two complete field-worthy prototypes will be constructed and extensive field testing and system evaluation in cooperation with academic institutions will be performed.   The device will allow the relatively low cost measurement of currents in bodies of water to further studies in ocean research, nearshore erosion and bridge pillar deterioration, etc.",
