 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506358  Mohler    The identity of individual segments in Drosophila is regulated by  the expression of the homeotic genes within specific segments.  These homeotic genes encode transcription factors that regulate  segment specific expression of other morphogenetic genes.  Homologues of many Drosophila homeotic genes have been identified  throughout much of the animal kingdom, where they are often  expressed in analogous portions of the embryonic body plan.  Analysis of the roles of the Drosophila homeotic genes and of the  interrelationships among these genes during Drosophila embryology  is likely to provide important developmental principles involved  generally in animal development. The cap'n collar (cnc) gene of  Drosophila is a recently identified homeotic gene, which is  important in defining the identity of the mandibular and labral  segments during embryonic development. The research proposed here  will continue the analysis of the role of this gene in Drosophila  development and initiate studies into the biochemical mechanisms of  its function. In particular, this study will characterize the role  of cnc in post-embryonic development by the identification of  tissues expressing CNC protein during post-embryonic development  and by the analysis of the effects of cnc- clones within those  tissues. This study will also further define cnc's function as a  selector gene through the analysis of developmental defects  associated with expression of cnc in inappropriate tissues. Unlike  most other homeotic genes which encode monomeric DNA-binding  proteins, cnc is unique in encoding a subunit of a dimeric bZIP  transcription factor, which is closely related to the p45 subunit  of mammalian NF-E2. To investigate the potential role of  differential heterodimer formation in specifying alternative  developmental fates, other bZIP genes that encode potential  heterodimeric partners of CNC will be identified: both potential  Drosophila homologs of the Maf subunit of NF-E2 and Drosophila  cDNAs en coding peptides capable of binding the CNC leucine zipper  domain. The DNA binding specificities of homodimeric CNC and of  heterodimeric complexes containing CNC will be investigated.  ***",
