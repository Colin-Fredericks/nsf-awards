 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is setting up a development platform for  embedded system design projects that will use a real-time  microkernel.  The platform includes: a) real-time microkernel  software used in designing embedded systems ranging from small  single processor systems to network distributed systems; b) core  hardware cards that contain base hardware required for any  embedded system development; c) an In Circuit Emulator (ICE);  and, d) 4-PC networked platform for hardware and software  development of embedded systems around the microkernel.  Major  use of this equipment occurs in undergraduate student's major  qualifying projects, which in addition to being significant also  provides the capstone design experience required by ABET.  The  use of these components is based on the philosophy of not  starting embedded system hardware and software development from  scratch.  Instead, tested hardware and software modules are used  and reused when possible so that the students can successfully  undertake and complete ambitious embedded systems projects.   Additionally, using a microkernel provides a systematic design  methodology, experience with tools commonly used by engineers in  the industry, and a better appreciation for the interaction  between operating systems, device drivers, and the underlying  hardware.  The emulator speeds up hardware and software co-design  processes significantly.  Having a dedicated development platform  for embedded system projects allows students to efficiently share  and access the equipment.  Training and experience gained with  this equipment will prepare students to better tackle complex  problems when they join the industrial work-force, and will help  in structuring a top quality program in embedded system design  that can serve as a model to others.",
