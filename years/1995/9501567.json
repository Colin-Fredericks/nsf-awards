The research this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving our  understanding of nonaqueous phase liquid entrapment and  dissolution processes in heterogeneous subsurface systems, to  formulate conduct mathematical models and experimentally verify  them to test hypotheses descriptive of the dissolution processes.  Her education plan involves using the results of the  research to  formulate open ended problems and using them as a basis for  providing experiential learning opportunities for students.    Results are expected to provide a more fundamental understanding  of phenomena associated with movement of nonaqueous fluids  through porous media than now exists leading to an improvement in  models used in engineering design of remediation processes and  systems for decontamination of soils contaminated with these  types of fluids.  The teaching plan this investigator plans to  pursue is likely to produce innovations in the use of computer  programs as tools for engineering analysis and design.  ***",
