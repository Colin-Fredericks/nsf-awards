In particular, the following  questions will be addressed: (1) How do temperature-induced changes  in myelin lipid composition affect myelin membrane fluidity in fish  adapted to different growth temperatures?  (2) How do these changes  affect the interaction forces between myelin lipids and proteins?   To address these questions, the following specific aims will be  accomplished: Aim 1. Membrane fluidity of cerebral and spinal cord  myelin lipids from fish adapted to different growth temperatures  will be characterized using carbon-13 magic angle spinning NMR  spectroscopy and correlated with variations in myelin lipid  composition to determine how changes in myelin lipid composition  affect myelin membrane fluidity. Aim 2. Short-, intermediate-, and  long-range attractive and repulsive forces in myelin membranes from  fish adapted to different growth temperatures will be evaluated  with the Surface Forces Apparatus and correlated with changes in  membrane fluidity to determine how changes in myelin membrane  fluidity affect myelin lipid-protein interactions  %%%  The dynamic state of lipid in biological membranes is a central  feature of current models of membrane organization.  The motion of  membrane constituents is referred to as membrane fluidity.  This  research will evaluate central nervous system myelin membrane  fluidity as a function of temperature-induced development in fish.   In particular, the following questions will be addressed: (1) How  do temperature-induced changes in myelin lipid composition affect  myelin membrane fluidity in fish adapted to different growth  temperatures? (2) How do these changes affect the interaction  forces between myelin lipids and proteins? Membrane fluidity will  be characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.    Short-, intermediate-, and long-range attr active and repulsive  forces in myelin membranes from fish adapted to different growth  temperatures will be evaluated with the Surface Forces Apparatus  and correlated with changes in membrane fluidity to determine how  changes in myelin membrane fluidity affect myelin lipid-protein  interactions.   ***",
