 "awd_abstract_narration": "These hands-on laboratory exercises focus on the hydrology of a  small local watershed.   The new laboratories provide an  integrated, interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes direct  student involvement in the collection and analysis of  hydrological data.   The use of data from a familiar and  accessible field site adds to the student's knowledge of  hydrological principles and methods while at the same time  synthesizes their understanding of ecosystem function and value.   The surface-water monitoring equipment and recording rain gauge  provided through this project are used to monitor all significant  surface-water inflows and outflows from the field site.   The  surface-water monitoring equipment includes upgrades for two  existing gauging stations and monitoring systems for three new  gauges.   The recording rain gauge provides important rainfall  intensity and duration data that will be used in conjunction with  the surface water data.   The equipment and the data generated  from it are used repeatedly throughout the semester to study  various components of the hydrological system and to develop  simple models of system function.  These revised laboratory  experiences can affect about 250 students over the next 5 years.",
