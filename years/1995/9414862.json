 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to construct a theoretical  framework for understanding and design of reactive devices starting  from the description of a high-level task.  The research is based  on a new class of robot algorithms that the PI calls ``reactive  algorithms.''  These offer insights into how a robot itself can use  its body parts like \"analog computers'' and be computationally more  powerful than its \"digital brain,'' and perhaps may ultimately shed  some light on the question of how insects with far fewer neurons  than a robot are able to accomplish much more complicated  manipulation and locomotion tasks.  So far the main applications of  these ideas have been in constructing new parallel-jaw grippers and  multifingered (2- and 3-fingered) hands, a \"twirling-machine'' and  a walking machine.  The PI has built a prototype parallel-jaw  gripper (\"NYU reactive gripper'') based on these algorithmic ideas.  The resulting gripper reduces the necessary computing power to only  a few simple digital circuits, utilizes primitive sensing  abilities, i.e., no more than a dozen infra-red emitters and  detectors and operates in a smooth manner without disturbing or  damaging the manipulated objects.  The PI has been investigating  how to describe these devices and prove their correctness using the  Ramadge-Wonham Discrete Event System (DES) formalisms. Another goal  is to understand the \"computational'' complexity of these devices  based on a framework for analyzing the \"competitiveness'' of on-  line algorithms in comparison to an idealized clairvoyant  algorithm. Other theoretical questions relate to the effect of  noise, algorithmic modification for immunization against noise, the  sensor-placement problem, and stability and convergence properties.",
