 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the purchase of two speech analysis  stations, each consisting of a Macintosh PowerPC running Soundscope  software. A single laser printer and tape backup system serve both  stations. This equipment will be used by the Principal  Investigators and several auxiliary users, primarily graduate  students, for the acoustic analysis of speech data, experiments in  speech perception and statistical evaluation of findings.       The objectives of purchasing this equipment are to support a  specific research strategy in linguistics, phonology in  particular, and to provide speech analysis facilities for faculty  and graduate students in the Linguistics Department. We aim to  encourage detailed acoustic and statistical investigation of  language data in the service of developing, testing and extending  quantitative models of phonological behavior. Two central  questions in phonology are i) what constitutes phonology as  opposed to phonetics and ii) how do the two domains interact.  Recently, considerable advances in modeling have been made  through well-designed experimental and instrumental analysis of  processes that are hypothesized to be phonological in some  languages but have a phonetic counterpart in others. Comparison  of findings has led to a notion of phonological 'target' as  opposed to phonetic interpolation, each with a specific phonetic  profile. Such work provides a starting point for differentiating  phonetic from phonological processes. We hope to contribute  towards this developing metric by modeling varying data.       The projects to be undertaken are designed to investigate  the interaction between phonetics and phonology by comparing  findings from a broad base of data from diverse languages (Bantu,  Salish, Russian, English, Japanese). The phonological processes  under investigation include tonal behavior, the realization of  laryngeal features and the phonetic basis of sound change and  loan word phonology.",
