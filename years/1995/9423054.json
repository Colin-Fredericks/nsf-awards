The case studies will document state/federal interaction in each program, identify problems or barriers encountered, and suggest changes in program design to address problem areas.  Regarding the S/UICRC program, all existing centers will be included in the study.  Interviews will be conducted with each S/UICRC director, the NSF program directors responsible for S/UICRCs and the appropriate state official.  The state official will be the member of NGA s Science and Technology Council of the States or their designee.  Officials from approximately 20 states will be interviewed with regard to the SBIR program, in addition to NSF staff with responsibilities for administering the SBIR and STTR programs.  A panel of state and federal policymakers , as well as outside experts, will then be invited to participate in a one day workshop to critique the case studies and to recommend program modification as needed.   NGA will submit a final report in the form of a  White Paper  summarizing the findings from the case studies and proposing specific actions that might be taken by NSF management and the nation s Governors to strengthen the partnership between NSF and state governments.                              ;                                                 Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       January 12, 1995                    kathleen latta                      darla j. clark              @    \u0131DR                            @    % $                            @    O& h                                                                                                   @    8 C                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      16                                                                                      ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e 3       e                                                                               j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       :   1                                                                                                           `               k   T       @   :                       j                                                                         :               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                                                                                                                             January 12, 1995  Abstract for NGA proposal #LPA-9423054 --  Creating a Science and Technology Partnership   The National Governor s Association proposes to conduct case studies of the NSF State/University/Industry Cooperative Research Centers (S/UICRCs),  the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), and  the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.
