The Trainees, who will be  advised by world-class researchers  in these areas, will study and do  research within the context of all  five centers of strength, and will  serve as mediators for developing  both their own expertise and a  broader contribution to the  knowledge necessary for improving  science and mathematics education.  Trainees will participate in a wide  range of cutting-edge research  efforts at the University of  Illinois in technologies for  learning, many of which are already  supported by NSF.",
