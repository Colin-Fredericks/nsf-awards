The theoretical argument is that the outcome variation from interactions of  particular demographic and natural-resource situations is amenable to historical explanation.  The central hypothesis, that a confluence of demographic and institutional changes in the  late-19th century provided the basis for current resource scarcity in modern Malawi, will be  explored via a three-part research design:  a social survey, historical research, and  environmental analyses.  There are two research sites, one in southern Malawi (the Zomba  district) and one in central Malawi (the Kasungu district).  Field research is to be undertaken  from August 1995 through July 1996.  The research seeks to advance population and  resource theory by bridging the Malthusian focus on demographic demand on ecosystems and  the Boserupian focus on social and institutional determinants of resource use and supply.",
