 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphs are powerful tools that can be used  to model objects and  relationships between objects.   Indeed, many distinct problems can  be cast as optimization   problems in graph theoretic terms.  Specifically, graph theory   provides an excellent way to model problems  related  to transportation, network design, scheduling,  robotics and many other areas.  It is used to develop  and illustrate the power of different  algorithmic tools.  There  are three broad areas from which the particular  problems  considered in this proposal are abstracted: (1)  Network  Design: How can a network that connects a given  set of sites be built?  How can  the network be made  reliable, and also provide high bandwidth between sites  (while keeping the cost low)?  Such fundamental  questions are addressed here.  (2)  Motion Planning: How does an agent navigate in an  environment?  What are  good navigation strategies for  navigating in unknown environments?  In this  case the  agent discovers the environment by actually touching  obstacles.  How  does an agent record an approximate map  of the environment, when working with  limited memory?        (3)  Scheduling:  Precedence based scheduling problems  arise  in the context of manufacturing and compilation for  parallel machines.  How can effective heuristics for  such problems be designed?  For most of these  problems  it is very difficult to obtain even an approximate  solution in  polynomial time.      Education Plan:    Most computer scientists are constantly  faced with the task of  designing algorithms to solve problems.  Although these  arise in  many different contexts, some basic principles underlie the  design of  efficient algorithms and data structures.  As a part of the Education  Program of this CAREER award, the PI is planning:    (a) to undertake the training of  students in designing algorithms, and (b) to teach them the importance of  re-examining existing algorithms so as to make them simpler and more efficient.  An algorithms lab  where students undertake projects, implement algorithms, and  act  as consultants to students in other research groups is a significant  step in this direction.",
