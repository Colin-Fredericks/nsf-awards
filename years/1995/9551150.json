 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most important advances in aquatic ecology in the  past two decades include the realization that carbon dynamics,  particularly organic carbon, and microbial processes contribute  significantly to the production and overall functioning of many  lakes, streams, and wetlands.   Furthermore, on a global basis,  the carbon cycle is profoundly influenced by emissions from  aquatic systems.   This project modernizes and enhances under-  graduate education in aquatic ecology with the use of equipment  that emphasizes the roles that fixation of inorganic carbon  (photosynthesis), degradation of organic carbon (decomposition),  and microbial utilization of organic carbon play in freshwater  systems.   Beyond providing new laboratory experiences for stu-  dents, the project engages students in the \"process of science,\"  both within and outside the classroom.   Students can use the new  equipment to ask numerous questions about important processes  involving the function and regulation of entire aquatic systems  and various freshwater organisms.   As a model program, this  project can influence the direction of limnological education in  the U.S.",
