 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510065  Fredlund  This research will provide a baseline technique to test the hypothesis that the Great Plains grassland is currently, and has been throughout most of the Holocene, in dynamic equilibrium with long-term climate fluctuations on the regional scale. Under this hypothesis, the dominant grasses of the region should have been able to rapidly adjust to climatic change during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. This project will begin to test that hypothesis through the analysis of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene fossil record from the region. The first stage of this process is to calibrate and validate the tools that will be used to measure grassland response in the fossil record: phytolith and stable carbon isotope analysis. Current interpretations of these methods are based on theoretically sound but imperfect relationships with grass taxonomy and community composition. This study will analyze soil samples from an array of over 50 modern prairie sites from across the region. Grass phytolith assemblages, (13C of soil organic matter, and (13C or organic carbon occluded within opal phytoliths will be analyzed for each sample. If the technique can be calibrated in this fashion, a direct relationship can be determined between (13C in fossil phytoliths and the general C3/C4 ratio of community composition. This, in turn, can be related directly to climate.   This project will provide an important assessment of the ability of (13C analysis of phytoliths to address vegetation-climate relationships over the Holocene in grasslands. Although much is known about forest dynamics during the Pleistocene and Holocene, there is very little detailed information on the regional dynamics of the Great Plains in response to climate change.",
