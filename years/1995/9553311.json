 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553311  Frierson    The goal of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-  CH) RCMS project will be the motivated, excite, and encourage  minority students to pursue graduate studies and research careers  in science. The project has two components.  The first component  will focus on providing in-depth research experiences for the  students, starting the summer after their sophomore year.  This  component will be termed UNC-RCMS.  The second component calls for  special participation of NSF affiliated Alliance for Minority  Participation (AMP) students in the UNC-CH Summer Pre-Graduate  Research Experience (SPGRE) Program and will be termed the SPGRE-  AMP Connection.    At steady state, a total of at least 32 students will participate  each year.  Annually, at least 16 students (eight juniors and eight  seniors) will participate in the UNC-RCMS components throughout the  year and 16 students will participate in the SPGRE-AMP Connection  during the summer.  A major aspect of the project is to provide the  projects throughout their junior and senior years with the goal tat  they matriculate in graduate science programs after graduating.   Another feature is for the students to spend the summer after their  sophomore year at a corporate laboratory in Research Triangle Park.   In the subsequent summer, the desire is for the students to spend  the summer at another major research university.    An expected outcome is for a number of SPGRE-AMP students to enroll  in UNC-CH graduate programs and for UNC-RCMS to students to enter  science and math Ph.D. programs at other major research  universities.",
