 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of numerical methods for large   systems  is central in the development of efficient codes for    fluid dynamics, elasticity, and other core problems  of   continuum mechanics.  Many other tasks in such codes  parallelize relatively   easily.  The importance  of the algebraic  system solvers is therefore increasing with   the appearance of  parallel and distributed computing systems, with a   substantial  number of fast  processors, each with relatively large memory.  The   development of improved  methods will, together with more  powerful computer systems,   make it possible to  carry out  simulations in three dimensions, with quite high   resolution,  relatively easily.    Work will continue in developing   iterative substructuring  and  other domain decomposition methods for increasingly   difficult  elliptic  problems.  Domain decomposition algorithms are iterative    methods, often of  conjugate gradient type, for the parallel  solution of the   large linear, or  nonlinear, systems of algebraic  equations that arise when   partial differential  equations are  discretized by finite elements, finite   differences, or spectral  methods.  In each iteration step, local problems representing   the  restriction  of the original problem to a potentially large number  of   subregions are solved  approximately.  The subregions, which  can be allocated to   individual processors  of a parallel computer,  form a decomposition of the entire   domain of the  problem.  In  addition, the inclusion of a coarse subproblem   substantially increases the efficiency of the preconditioner.      In this study,  which combines mathematical analysis with the  design and   numerical testing  of algorithms, a special emphasis  is on the study of   elements and other high  order finite element methods, on   nonconforming methods  such as  the mortar finite elements, and on the difficulties   which are  related  to distorted subregions or elements.",
