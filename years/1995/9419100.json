We will  concentrate on three important problem areas:  1) investigating  performance and computation problems in parallel and distributed  architecture and system design; 2) developing parallel numerical  methods and software for solving large real-world problems; and 3)  building software tool and environment for parallel and distributed  computing and performance evaluation.  Our underlying goal of this  research is to understand the comparative advantages and  disadvantages of various types of multiprocessing hardware and  software environments, and to discover new methods that efficiently  solve different types of application problems on parallel and  attract more minority graduate students to participate in high-  performance computing research supported by our established and  growing expertise in the proposed research areas.  The proposed  projects are major research activities in the newly established  High-Performance Computing and Software Laboratory at the  University of Texas at San Antonio, which has been funded by NSF,  the U.S. Air Force and industries.  ***",
