 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dean    The National Science Foundation will continue its long term  support of the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring  Research. This grant allows the laboratory to hire a full-time  dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological samples and also  provides support for student assistants.    The technique of tree-ring dating was pioneered at Arizona.  because the rate of tree growth is determined by environmental  conditions, yearly growth rings in a tree vary in form and  thickness. It is possible to build up a tree ring chronology by  cross matching trees from the present to well back in the  prehistoric past and then to use this \"master record\" to date  small wood samples collected from archaeological and other  situations. For archaeologists in the Southwestern United States,  this technique has been a boon because it allows materials to be  dated within one year. This far exceeds the accuracy of  radiocarbon dating.    Because it has not been adequately supported and because many  archaeologists lack the funds to pay for its services, the  Arizona laboratory has not been able on its own to keep pace with  archaeological requests for sample dating. This project will help  to remedy that situation.  In particular, it will benefit young  scientists and those not associated with main line research  institutions.",
