 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing environmental awareness and regulation have motivated research into new methods to remediate toxins from atmospheric pressure gas streams.  At the First International EPRI/NSF Symposium on Advanced Oxidation Techniques, plasma remediation was identified as a promising technology treating contaminated gas streams and air.  Plasma remediation of toxic gas streams from mobile emitting sources (for example, Nox emission from diesel truck engines), remote or sporadically emitting sources (for example, diesel emergency generators) or small installations (for example, volatile organic solvents, VOCs, released from dry cleaners) require inexpensive, low-voltage, compact, and reliable systems which efficiently and selectively convert the toxic gas to benign or more treatable products.  Dielectric barrier discharges are candidates for these systems.  In this project, multidimensional computer modeling of the plasma remediation of contaminated atmospheric pressure gas streams will be performed.  The goals of this work are: a) Investigate the hydrodynamics and plasma chemistry of plasma remediation systems using dielectric barrier discharges; b) develop computer models of plasma remediation of toxic gases capable of being used to design practical manufacturable systems; and c) collaborate with experiments being performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Southern California to validate the models and implement recommendations.  The test system will be Nox remediation from diesel exhaust.  Remediation of VOCs will be investigated later.",
