 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Caulkins under the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for research and educational activities, and to foster contact and cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that support research and education.  Dr. Caulkins has already made significant research contributions to the field of operations research, and he has the potential to become a leader in academic research and education.  This award will allow the investigator to build on his existing research and to provide an intellectual basis for policies that respond to the problems associated with the consumption, distribution, and prohibition of illicit drugs.  During the tenure of his award Dr. Caulkins will (1) use price data as a window on market behavior and will compare arrest and seizure records with local price series data to see if enforcement can create `spot shortages` and, if so, how long they last; (2) study the relationship between wholesale and retail prices to estimate the effect of regional enforcement on prices; (3) study wholesale prices in different locations to better understand transaction/transportation costs, arbitrage efficiency, and the spatial character of drug markets; and (4) study how to divide resources between various programs such as interdiction, domestic enforcement, treatment, and prevention.  Illicit drugs are consumer goods, and the more that is understood about the markets for these goods, the easier it will be to design policies that mitigate the costs associated with those markets and, thus, to design interventions.",
