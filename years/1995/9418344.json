 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418344    Byrne       Ancient deformed accretionary prisms commonly preserve  patterns of multiple microstructure such as cleavage generations,  fiberous overgrowths and oriented vein sets. Inversions of these  kinematic indications to relative plate motions during the  deformation event, which is of fundamental importance, is quite  speculative due to lack of rigorous tests of the hypothesis that  they accurately reflect such motions. This project will examine the  pattern of overprinting fabrics and kinematic indicators from the  Shimanto Belt of Southwest Japan, an example selected because of a  well-known and significant change in convergence directions during  the deformation of the Belt, and because this well exposed area has  recieved considerable geologic study. Results should provide a  clear test of the idea that such features can be inverted to obtain  the relative convergence directions between the plates involved.  Success in assessing the degree to which such inversion results in  accurate plate motions will be widely applicable to other origins.",
