These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of   doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry.   Gregory G. Luther received his doctoral degree from the University of Rochester   and will work under the direction of Mark S. Alber at Notre Dame, Jerrold E. Marsden at   Berkeley, and Jonathan Robbins at Hewlett-Packard. Collaborators at Los Alamos   National Laboratory will also participate. The research will be on soliton-based long-haul   optical communications systems. Both advanced analytical and numerical techniques will   be used to study details of soliton and soliton-like solutions of the nonlinear wave   equations that model optical communications and information processing systems.",
