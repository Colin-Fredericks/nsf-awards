Berthold Community College, Little Hoop Community College,  United Tribes Technical College - are seeking to connect to the  NSFNET.  These two year colleges are located in remote areas of  North Dakota.  These are all relatively small and offer a complete  range of course selections including transfer curricula, para-  professional, and pre-engineering.    Each campus includes use of the state's On-line Dakota Information  Network and other library resources to improve student ability to  deal with information.  This is a particularly important task given  the isolation of Indian reservations and their need for  information.  The colleges will work with North Dakota's  sophisticated, higher education network to accomplish the  connection.  The North Dakota Information Network will provide  technical assistance and will provide the gateway service.    Each college will begin their work toward connection by installing  appropriate local area networks.  Then training in the use of the  connection will be accomplished with the help of Electronic  Pathways, an organization devoted to helping Indians connect to the  Internet.",
