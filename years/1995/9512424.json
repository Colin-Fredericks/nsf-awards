 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technologies derived from the genome projects for humans and other  model systems offer an extremely effective and economical approach for  studying many important biological questions as well as mechanisms of  animal and plant pathogenesis. Furthermore, the availability of the  necessary equipment and training in modern technologies is clearly an  important role of the University of Minnesota in serving its Land Grant  Mission. Recent and future faculty recruitment on the University of  Minnesota, St. Paul Campus has necessitated the development of a core  High Throughput Genetic Analysis Laboratory. In addition, university  strategic planning including the Colleges of Agriculture, Biological  Sciences, Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine lead to the recognition  that the University of Minnesota now has the opportunity to establish  an internationally recognized center focusing on emerging DNA  technologies on the St. Paul Campus. Most importantly, as illustrated  by the individual project descriptions, is the already present critical  mass of researchers who have existing needs for high throughput DNA  sequencing and genotyping capabilities.    Such technologies will permit the utilization of DNA sequencing of  nuclear and mitochondrial DNA genes to address questions concerning  speciation patterns, phylogenetic relationships among plants, bacteria,  protozoan, birds and mammals. Technologies developed by the laboratory  will provide insights into strategies for monitoring environmental  changes, the identification of emerging plant and animal pathogens, and  direct genotypic selection for specific physiological characteristics.  The intellectual environment associated with such technologies will  foster new partnerships both between colleges as well as with the  private sector. Finally, this infrastructure will serve to enhance  undergraduate, graduate and professional student recruitment while  providing new training opportunities for current undergraduate and  graduates.    Critical for this  strategic venture is the presence of appropriate  faculty who will stimulate new interdisciplinary research programs and  who will bring new skills associated with these emerging technologies.  At present on the St. Paul Campus, the Food Animal Biotechnology Center  encompasses several different research programs that have as their goal  to develop new molecular technologies associated with animal production  through the identification and modulation of genes affecting growth,  development, reproductive performance, efficiency of feed conversion,  lactation and disease resistance. The goal of the Plant Molecular  Genetics Institute on the St. Paul Campus is to span the molecular,  cellular, and whole plant levels and to complement the University's  plant breeding programs. Finally, faculty in the College of Biological  Sciences play a leadership role in genetics and developmental biology  at the University of Minnesota. In order to provide for efficient and  effective utilization of this multiinvestigator laboratory, technical  support will also be provided as part of the institutional match.    To complement these existing programs, the College of Veterinary  Medicine is committed to hiring new faculty who will bring new skills  associated with these emerging technologies that require extensive  instrumentation. These individuals, who will have an already  established track record, will serve to stimulate future applications  and further intercollegiate interactions. Several of the participants  of this proposal will serve on theses search committees. In addition,  to stimulating faculty recruitment, this core laboratory will also  provide trained support staff, within and outside the university, to  permit contemporary usage of the equipment throughout the region.",
