 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Manglik  U/ Cincinnati  CTS-9502128    The research in this proposal will aid in understanding the effect of non-Newtonian fluids (which includes most fluids in the food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, chemical processing and biomedical industries) on heat transfer due to convection in duct flow and in pool boiling. The experimental work will be complemented by a numerical study of flow through geometries of the type common to extended surface heat exchangers. This work could affect the future design of heat exchange equipment used in the industries mentioned above.    The educational plan will bring the research program directly into the classroom through introduction of a senior elective course in Industrial Heat Exchange Engineering and Design and the development of new experiments in the undergraduate heat transfer and fluid mechanics laboratory. These will involve modern measurement methods such as liquid crystal thermography, LDV, and contemporary flow measurement techniques, as well as experiments that demonstrate heat transfer measurements in contemporary applications such as  plate-fin exchangers, heat recovery systems, and micro-electronic cooling.",
