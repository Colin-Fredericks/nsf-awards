 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dieci       The investigator and his colleagues organize an international  conference on numerical methods for dynamical systems.  The  interaction between dynamical systems and numerical analysis has  grown in recent years as the limitations of classical quantitative  numerical analysis have become increasingly apparent.  In practice,  a common goal of computation is to obtain information about  solutions over moderate to long time intervals, yet classical  error analysis is generally not meaningful past a short initial  transient.  It is thus fundamental to the numerical analysis of  differential equations to address both the efficacy of existing  computational methods and the design of special methods for  computation over long time intervals.  Specific topics to be  covered include convergence of integration algorithms over long  time intervals (including long-time error bounds and convergence  of invariant sets), stability of integration algorithms over long  time intervals (including preservation of dynamical structure and  spurious solutions), new approaches to error analysis (including  shadowing results and backward error analysis), and design of  computational techniques for invariant sets such as algorithms to  compute invariant torii, inertial manifolds, heteroclinic orbits,  homoclinic orbits, and Lyapunov exponents.       Differential equations describe how one position in space of  a physical system at a particular time influences neighboring  positions in the immediate future.  It is this local nature of a  differential equation that makes it possible to model complicated  physical situations, because it means that the entire system does  not have to be described simultaneously.  But this also means that  obtaining the correct differential equation model of a system is  not the end of the story, because it is necessary to solve the  differential equation to obtain information about the original  system.  Accordingly, the study of solutions of differential  equations has grown int o one of the major areas of mathematics  while becoming centrally important in science and engineering.  The  introduction of the computer made it possible to approximately  solve differential equations on a wide scale for the first time.  Over the last thirty years, numerical mathematicians have made  great progress in devising methods to approximate a specific  solution of a differential equation and in analyzing the accuracy  of the approximate solution.  The classical approach to study  numerical methods for differential equations is very good at  describing the behavior of the approximation of a particular  solution in a small region of space over a short time interval.  But understanding the nature of nonlinear equations requires  knowledge about many solutions over relatively long time  intervals.  In response to this need, there is increasing interest  in using numerical methods to study structures and patterns in  solutions of differential equations, which is known as the  dynamical behavior of the equation.  This conference gathers  leading experts from the United States and from around the world,  representing nearly all aspects of the area, together with  interested students and other researchers, to discuss the current  state of the art and to stimulate new developments.  The conference  is expected to have a long-ranging impact on many applications in  science and engineering.",
