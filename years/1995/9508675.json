 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Herschel Rabitz is supported by a grant under the Optical   Science and Engineering initiative in the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of laser techniques for   controlling molecular dynamics.   The research will emphasize: 1) the   establishment of bounds of possible control over molecular systems; 2)   the determination of the essential features of laser pulses for achieving   practical control; 3) the development of advanced laser field design   techniques for molecular control; and 4) a full exploration of the role   of adaptive laboratory feedback as a means of overcoming inherent design   uncertainties and laboratory errors.  Although the research is   theoretical in nature, it will be closely coordinated with parallel   laboratory efforts at Princeton and elsewhere.   The outcome of this   research is expected to lay the broad foundations for performing   optically controlled molecular manipulations, as well as opening up a new   means to probe the complex physical processes occurring during molecular   dynamics.  Since the invention of the laser chemists have dreamed of selectively   exciting regions within a molecule thus causing a controlled chemical   reaction to occur.  It was long ago realized, however,  that   intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution occurrs so rapidly that   it is impossible to concentrate enough energy in a selected bond to cause   it to break.  Now,  with the advent of laser pulse modulation techniques,   and the application of control theory, it appears that the dream of laser   selective chemistry may become a reality.",
