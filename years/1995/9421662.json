Wieman,  Department of Physics and Joint Institute for Laboratory  Astrophysics, University of Colorado, to pursue with Dr. Donghyun  Cho, Department of Physics, Korea University, for 24 months, a  program of cooperative research involving high-precision  spectroscopic measurements on spin-polarized cesium atoms which  are subjected to various electromagnetic fields.  The  collaborators will use apparatus which they developed to study  phenomena produced when these cesium atoms are subjected to very  intense, tunable, narrowband, laser light at 540 nm.    In addition to producing high-precision data about the cesium  atom itself, the proposed research will use new ideas and  techniques that will have general application in the field of  measurement science.  The collaborators have a common interest in  high precision spectroscopy of atomic systems.  Dr. Cho has  participated in construction of the apparatus to be used at the  University of Colorado and will develop, in Korea, additional  equipment which will lead to improved sensitivity in the proposed  experiments.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the  U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase  the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of  mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported  by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
