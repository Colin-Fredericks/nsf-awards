 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a state-of-the-art Molecular Biology  Laboratory.   The laboratory is not only providing Biology and  Chemistry majors in-depth exposure to the rapidly expanding field  of molecular biology, but also providing an introduction to  nonmajors enrolled in the General Education class, Biological  Concepts.     The laboratory consists of six workstations; each  includes the equipment necessary to perform the following  contemporary experiments: structure, function, and isolation of  DNA; electrophoretic separation of proteins and DNA; molecular  weight determination; restriction nuclease mapping of DNA;  analysis of a genome segment; and recombinant DNA experiments.    The data resulting from these experiments are correlated and  analyzed utilizing the latest software programs.   Limited  instruction on the use of internet, modems, and GCG programs for  gene sequence analysis is also provided, with an indication of  the role they play in molecular biology.   The laboratory is  linked to the university-wide Novelle network.   This gives  access to the internet and data banks around the world.   This  laboratory enables the university to enhance the education  provided for its students in molecular biology.   Additionally,  the project provides students with a positive experience, perhaps  motivating them toward a career in the sciences.   For the  nonscience student, this laboratory makes the often bewildering  world of biotechnology more understandable, a must for everyone  in the world of tomorrmw.",
