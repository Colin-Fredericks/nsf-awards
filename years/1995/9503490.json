 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503490  Flynn    The Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) is a recently-  available materials characterization technique which allows  low energy electrons to probe the outer layers of a solid.  With LEEM it is possible first to image surface topography,  second to observe diffraction from the periodicities of the  near-surface structure, and third to image using  photoelectrons and thus probe the spatial variation of  electronic structure.  These instruments are very well  adapted to the examination of samples through the range from  high temperature to below room temperature.  In situ  dynamical studies offer special opportunities to view in  real time not only bulk but also surface phenomena.  As LEEM  instruments operate in the limit of ultrahigh vacuum where  surfaces remain uncontaminated for many hours, the dynamics  of surface structure and reactions thus become accessible.  A further major asset is the availability in the vicinity of  the sample of access ports that can house molecular beam  sources for eptiaxial growth conducted before or during  observations.  Commercial machines which offer these  powerful combinations of capabilities are just now becoming  available.  The time is therefore ripe for the dedicated  application of a LEEM instrument to materials research  problems of critical interest tot the materials research  community.    This machine will be used to study the real time imaging of  kinetic step flow processes that occur during growth,  oxidation or other reaction on the surfaces of precisely  tailored samples.  Our focus on the materials themselves  promises to document and systematize information of this  type for a variety of crystal types, in addition to the  discoveries of new processes that typically rewards this  type of exploratory research.  This (LEEM) will be placed in  the University of Illinois EpiCenter, a central facility  dedicated to the crystal growth and surface processes of  metals, ceramics, and semiconductors.",
