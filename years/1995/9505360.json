 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505360  Hollis    This proposal supports a one-year postdoctoral fellowship  for Dr. Kendall Hollis at Nippon Steel Corporation in  Futtsu, Japan.   Project funding will enable Dr. Hollis to  undertake a collaborative research effort with Dr. Nobutaka  Yurioka of Nippon Steel Corporation.  The investigators  intend to study the formation of the coating from molten  particles and how the dynamics of the deposition process  determine the micro structure of the resultant coating.  As  the application of coatings by plasma spraying can greatly  reduce the fabrication cost or greatly extend the useful  life of equipment, it is anticipated that the technology  will continue to receive attention by government and  industrial laboratories for many years to come.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Hollis will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  equipment at Nippon Steel Corporation while contributing to  the overall research effort.  Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
