Its major goals are:  to increase the awareness of high school girls about  careers in SEM, to introduce them to SEM role models on the job, to have them collaborate on  a research problem with a SEM mentor, and to positively impact their choice of a career.   Through seminars, industrial site visits, and panel discussions, the girls are to learn about SEM  careers and job opportunities--what they require and how they are achieved.  This project  provides opportunities for all the girls to acquire skill in using statistics and technology to  support their future research efforts.  In collaboration with a SEM mentor at the University, each  girls will gain hands-on research experience in a university laboratory setting.  Afterward, each  girl will independently solve a related research problem at her home school with the support of  an on-site resource teacher and the University mentor, via Internet.  In addition, the girls will  disseminate SEM career information to their peers.    Participants should leave the residential program prepared with a knowledge of SEM careers,  technological skills that will support problem solving, and experience in using the scientific  method of discovery.  They will have explored SEM careers and interacted with professionals  in these fields.  They should have acquired skill in using spreadsheets, software packages,  graphing calculators, word-processing, and Internet communications.  They also will have  engaged in group and independent research projects supported by SEM mentors and high school  resource teachers.  In addition, they should have developed the confidence and self-esteem to  choose an appropriate career--and successfully embark upon it.  ***",
