The  PI has recently found (Zentall & Sherburne, 1994) that when  animals learn such a task, the S- actually acquires some value  from being presented with the S+ (relative to the appropriate  controls).  The purpose of the proposed research is primarily to  determine the learning mechanisms by which such transfer of value  takes place.  First, it is possible that the S- becomes a signal  for the presence of the S+.  Second, it may be that the sight of  the S- (followed by responding to the S+) followed by reward,  results in a direct Pavlovian association between the S- and  reward.  Finally, it may be that presenting two stimuli at the  same time results in an association between them (through the so-  called \" principle of contiguity\").         A second purpose of the proposed research is to examine the  involvement of this value-transfer effect in other learning  phenomena.  For example, there is evidence that overtraining on a  discrimination can speed up the reversal of that discrimination  (i.e., the overtraining reversal effect).  The PI proposes to  show that overtraining allows additional value to transfer from  the S+ to the S-.  In addition, value transfer may be involved in  transitive inference effects that have been reported in animals.  If animals have been trained on four simultaneous  discriminations, symbolized as A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, D+E-, they  appear to order those stimuli from best to worst (i.e.,  A>B>C>D>E) as evidenced, in particular, by the strong preference  that they show for B over D on test trials.         Although the principle of value transfer appears in  simultaneous discrimination learning in animals, there appear  to  be important parallel effects in certain human social  perceptions.  For example, there is evidence that the  presentation of an attractive female together with an automobile  enhances the perceived value of the automobile.  Similarly, one's  self regard may be enhanced by living in a city in which the  professional sports team is successful.  Thus this research might  shed light on puzzling associative phenomena that occur in  people.",
