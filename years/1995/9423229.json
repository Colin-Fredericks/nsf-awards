 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molinari & Idone/Abstract           The objective of this research is to determine the structure  and mechanisms of lightning occurrence in hurricanes.  This study  will include nine hurricanes that have come within the nominal  range of the National Lightning Detection Network.  Of primary  interest are the convective structure of hurricanes as revealed by  the lightning, the potential for lightning as an early warning  indicator of storm intensification, and the reasons for variation  in lightning among storms.  The variation of lightning between  early and late stages of tropical cyclones will also be examined.   This should provide information on the role of convection during  hurricane development, and the role of eye wall debris in  suppressing lightning as the hurricane matures.         In addition, the lightning data will be combined with Doppler  and non-Doppler radar data at the Hurricane Research Division of  NOAA and with rawinsonde data in order to study rainbands in  Hurricane Andrew and the fluctuation of eye wall lightning in  Hurricane Elena (1985).  In the former study the goal is to  understand the dynamics and thermodynamics of a rainband for which  simultaneous and coincident sounding data are available.  In the  latter, our interest is in the mechanism of eye wall lightning and  what processes turn it on and off.         Finally, hurricanes which occur within the grant period will  be investigated using data from the National Lightning Detection  Network.  This data should allow examination of both intra-cloud  and cloud-to-ground strokes.  Of primary interest is the nature of  hurricane eye wall electrification.",
