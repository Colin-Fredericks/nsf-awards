The geodesic spaces which are  the universal covering spaces for finitely presented groups are of  primary interest.  Essentialy this project is an attempt to find  groups whose boundary has dimensions of different kinds that  disagree.  Such a group for integral cohomological and covering  dimensions would give a counter-example to some form of the Novikov  conjecture.  First he plans to construct and investigate groups   whose boundaries have rational cohomological dimension and covering  dimension that are different.  The phenomenon first was observed by  Bestvina-Mess.  While cohomology groups of the sphere at infinity  have a relation to the Novikov conjecture, cohomology groups of the  tangent sphere of a geodesic space are relevant to the  Hilbert-Smith conjecture.  These two spheres are connected by a  map, called the geodesic contruction map.  It turns out that the  geodesic contruction map can raise dimension even in the case of  Coxeter groups.  That phenomenon is relevant to the old problem in  Group Theory: Does geometric dimension of a group coincide with the  cohomological dimension?  The corresponding problem for topological  spaces was solved negatively by the investigator.       One of the most basic of topological properties is the notion  of dimension.  For very common spaces such as spheres and planes,  the dimension is clear.  However, when one attempts to formulate a  general definition that will apply to a much wider class of spaces,  some of them quite complicated, the \"obvious\" notion of dimension  turns out to be elusive.  In fact some spaces, the so-called  fractal spaces, have a natural dimension that is not even a whole  number.  One is left with several alternative definitions, all of  which agree for uncomplicated spaces, but which may differ in  general.  To understand the notion of dimension fully, one should  understand when the differen t definitions can be expected to agree  and when they may not.  The investigator is exploring several of  the outstanding conjectures and problems along these lines.  ***",
