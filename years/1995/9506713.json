 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506713  Shirey  This proposal requests support to continue application of the Re-Os isotopic system to a wide range of problems concerning crust-mantle-core differentiation on the Earth.  With the funding requested in this proposal we hope to address the following topics:  1) the mechanisms of formation of continental lithospheric mantle, focusing especially on across-craton variability, addition of lithospheric material at craton margins and the implications for Archean and Proterozoic tectonics; 2) secular changes in the Os isotopic composition of the convecting mantle that may reveal if the mantle records the effects of a) changing ratios of oceanic to continental crust production through time, b) decline in extraterrestrial input of PGE's to the mantle during early Earth history and c) mass exchange between core and mantle, and 3) Os isotopic characterization o lower crustal xenoliths to determine their initial mantle extraction ages in order to evaluate the significance of magmatic underplating as opposed to continental collision in thickening continental crust.  These studies all make use of the unique characteristics of the Re-Os isotopic system that when used in conjunction with Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic data offers the potential of new insights into the chronological, tectonic, and chemical evolution of the solid earth.",
