The activities  include (a) two national meetings approximately one year apart of representatives from groups  interested in science and engineering advanced technological education including the principal  investigators from many current Advanced Technological Education (ATE) projects and  centers, private and public sector leaders, and professional associations; (b) a roundtable of  experts on issues in science and engineering advanced technological education; and (c) a live  national teleconference on such issues.    The sequence of programs is designed to provide people interested in advanced technological   education opportunities to network with one another; identify significant issues related to the  delivery of effective science and engineering technological education; disseminate the results  of these activities to a broad national audience; and, broadcast a national teleconference on  these issues.    Expected outcomes include a sharper understanding of the characteristics of successful science  and engineering technological education programs for all stakeholders in this arena, the  development of additional resource documents of use to current and future participants in  these education programs, and an increased awareness of the value of each of these activities  for deliverin g information to a broad audience.",
