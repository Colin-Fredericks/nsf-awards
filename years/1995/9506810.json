 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506810  Hopper and Martin    The Hopper and Martin laboratories collaboratively study an  unusual category of yeast genes that code for \"sorting  isozymes\".  These are enzymes coded by the same gene but  located in more than one subcellular compartment.  Study of  these genes has provided information about the cis signals  that target proteins to their correct destination, and  promises to provide a means of uncovering gene products that  play roles in the sorting process.  TRM1 codes for 2  isozymes, an amino-terminal extended protein found in  mitochondria and a protein lacking the extension found in  mitochondria and nuclei,  MOD5 also encodes 2 isozymes; the  amino-terminal extended Mod5p is in mitochondria and the  form lacking this extension is in nuclei, but the cytosol  has contributions from both isozymes.  CCA1 codes for 3  isozymes.  The amino-terminal extended longest form is  located in mitochondria and the other two forms are in  cytosol/nuclear compartments.  Trm1p, Mod5p, and Cca1p are  all involved in tRNA biosynthesis.  tRNAs encoded by the  nuclear genome are located in the cytosol and the nucleus.  One goal of the proposed studies is to determine whether  cells require both nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of Mod5p  and Cca1p for the reactions they carry out.  In addressing  this problem, sequences necessary and sufficient for nuclear  import of these proteins will be identified.  Then the  sequences will be altered to determine the consequences of  mislocalizing them.  The amino-extended forms of Trm1p and  probably Cca1 and Mod5p possess both mitochondrial and  nuclear targeting information, yet are not found in the  nucleus.  Mechanisms that could account for the dominance of  the mitochondrial targeting information will be explored.  In particular, the hypotheses that mitochondrial targeting  signals play a role in coupling import to translation will  be tested.  These studies are timely as new information  suggests an association of translation and mitochondrial  protein i mport.  Proper function of a eukaryotic cell is  dependent upon appropriate subcellular distribution of  proteins.  Although there is a growing body of literature  that addresses the trans-acting components that assure  appropriate distribution, much remains to be learned.  The  hypothesis of the PI's is that the natural distribution of  sorting isozymes to multiple cellular compartments can be  used as a powerful new tool to study protein delivery to  mitochondria and nuclei and that the outcome of such studies  may have general applicability for understanding the sorting  of proteins with a single subcellular destination as well as  those with multiple destinations.  The understanding of  sequences necessary for the distribution of sorting isozymes  allowed the PI's to devise genetic studies to identify  components that affect the distribution process.  The first  genetic studies using Mod5p identified 4 genes: MDP1/RSP5,  MDP2/VRP1, MDP4, and PAN1.  Mutations of MDP2/VRP1 and PAN1  cause a decrease in the mitochondrial pool of Mod5p.  Other  mitochondrial proteins also may be affected because these  mutations cause respiratory deficiency and conditional  growth even though Mod5p itself is unessential.  MDP2/  affects the actin cytoskeleton and PAN1 codes for a protein  that interacts with 3' ends of mRNA and affects initiation  of protein synthesis.  Finding MDP2 and PAN1 implicates the  actin cytoskeleton, proteins synthesis and 3' mRNA sequences  in the distribution of proteins between the mitochondrial  and the cytoplasm.  Studies to decipher the mechanism of  action of MDP2 and PAN1 are proposed.  Success using one  sorting isozyme to identify genes that alter its  distribution to mitochondria predicts success of  complementary studies to identify additional genes that  alter the distribution of Mod5p as well as Cca1p.  Genetic  schemes to accomplish this are described in the proposed  work.  %%%  This is a project engaged by two collaborating women  scientists, one a biochemist and one a  geneticist, who use  multidisciplinary approaches to a fundamental question in  biotechnology: how a protein which is the product of a  single gene can be sorted to multiple locations within the  cell.  The basic problem behind cellular protein traffic is  how to coordinate that protein traffic in the context of a  structurally complex cytoplasm, composed of many different  membrane-bound and non-membrane delimited compartments. If a  protein is targeted to a single compartment, it can be  initially made with a \"targeting signal\" which can  subsequently be cleaved, depending on whether it is  necessary for the protein's subsequent function.  Targeting  signals for the mitochondria and nucleus are known for  several proteins which come to reside solely in those  compartments, but this project concerns some proteins which  are involved in tRNA modification which are found in both  the mitochondria and nucleus and which contain both types of  signals. The project examines what happens when these  signals are changed in a way which changes the balance of  the protein between the mitochondria and nucleus.   Although  the protein is coded by a single gene, different sizes of  the protein exist, with the longer form found in  mitochondria and the shorter form in the nucleus.  Genetic  analysis has found some intriguing genes which alter the  amount of the longer form in the mitochondria.  One of them  affects the initiation of protein synthesis and one affects  the actin cytoskeleton of the cell.  The coupling of the  synthesis (translation) of the protein to targeting to the  mitochondria is examined. This project also addresses how  altering the initiation of protein synthesis and the actin  cytoskeleton can change the distribution of the protein  between the nucleus and mitochondrion.  This study provides  insight into how the sorting information necessary for  maintaining  complex cellular compartmentation is regulated  by the interactions of  newly-made proteins with other  cellular components.   ***",
