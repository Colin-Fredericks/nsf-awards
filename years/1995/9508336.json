 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Chandler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the   statistical mechanics of dynamics and structure of liquids.  Four   specific research areas are targeted: 1) dynamics of solvation will be   studied in an attempt to understand the interplay between solute and   solvent relaxation times and length scales; 2) confined fluids and the   dynamics of their surface induced phase transitions will be studied in an   effort to understand the effects of confinement on time scales for   relaxation and nucleation of phases; 3) self assembly and the stability   of membranes will be studied to characterize conditions for stability and   assembly of complex fluid structures; and 4) metallization in fluids will   be studied to understand and contrast the structures of metallic and   insulating liquid phases such as are observed in metal/ammonia solutions.    In all of these areas Chandler will address natural phenomena with the   development of models, and treat those models with statistical field   theory and simulations.  Theoretical models for gas phase systems have relied heavily on   simplifications based on weakly interacting particles undergoing elastic   collisions.  Models for the solid state rely on simplifications arising   from the symmetry and order of the solid state.  In both of these areas,   theoretical models are quite well developed, and agree well with   experimental data.  Theoretical treatment of the liquid phase, on the   other hand has been difficult because the systems are not orderly, and   yet the interactions are strong.  Over the past 20 years, several good   theoretical models have started to emerge, for example, the so-called   `reference interaction site model` developed in part by Chandler and   other collaborators.  Chandler is continuing to improve upon the   theoretical models for liquids, and to apply them to new systems which   have important chemical significance such as molecular assemblies and   molecules undergoing conformational changes and chemical reactions.",
