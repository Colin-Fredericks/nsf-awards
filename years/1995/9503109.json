 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerning   reasoning   and   decision   making   in   uncertain  environments.  The  standard  approaches  to  dealing  with  this  uncertainty   are  quantitative,  and  typically  make   use   of  probability  theory.   The  long-term goal  of  this  project  is  provide more qualitative methods that can be used effectively  by  agents  reasoning about uncertainty. The project focuses  on  the  interplay between beliefs and actions, and how this can be  dealt  with in a qualitative framework.  Of particular interest are  two  uses that will be crucial in attaining the long-term goal: belief  dynamics   and   action  selection.  Belief   dynamics   involves  understanding  how  an agent's beliefs should  change  after  the  agent  makes  an  observation or performs an action.  To  capture  belief  dynamics, a formal model for belief is used that includes  time  explicitly.   The  ultimate goal of  this  research  is  to  provide  a  basis  for  a  general theory of  qualitative  belief  dynamics.  Action selection involves understanding how  an  agent  should  act,  given  his beliefs.  The usual  decision  theoretic  approach   uses  a  utility  function  describing   the   agent's  preferences and a probability distribution describing the agent's  beliefs.   But in many situations it is infeasible to  completely  quantify uncertainty. An alternative approach that dispenses with  preferences describes the agent's choice of action by  a  program  directly  specifying the behavior of the agent in  terms  of  his  beliefs,   allowing  compilation  of  plans  directly  from   the  specification that we want it to satisfy.",
