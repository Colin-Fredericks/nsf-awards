 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500956 Vanden-Broeck  This proposal is concerned with the  study of waves propagating at the surface of a fluid. An  important example is the train of waves generated by an obstacle  (i.e. a ship) moving at a constant velocity at the surface of  water. Existing theories are based on a number of simplifying  assumptions. It is proposed to extend and improve existing  theories by removing some of these assumptions. It is expected  that the research will uncover new families of solutions.   In  particular it is proposed to study the effect of a layer of mud  on ship waves. The proposed approach consists of replacing the  classical assumption of a rigid bottom by an appropriate boundary  condition derived from lubrication theory. It is also proposed to  calculate periodic and solitary waves in presence of vorticity  and surface tension. Previous and preliminary calculations have  shown that there are many different families of solutions. It is  intended to study them further and to calculate numerically the  interaction between solitary waves.",
