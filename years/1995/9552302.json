 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small class size and extensive laboratory experience are integral  to the newly developed Environmental Science program.  The  current interest in environmental issues by students provides an  excellent opportunity to develop their interests in science  through lab experiences that address key environmental problems.    This laboratory experience is enhanced through the acquisition of  equipment to assess air quality.   This will enrich the current  curricula and enable students to participate in a genuine  research experience under the direction of faculty.   The project  also incorporates experimental laboratories into introductory  courses in environmental science and chemistry.   Students in the  upper-division courses collaborate with scientists from the  Environmental Protection Agency on environmentally related  projects.   They also share their expertise with students from  local inner-city schools.   To accomplish this, the project funds  the purchase of a high-volume sampler for measuring atmospheric  particulate matter, a mass flow meter and vacuum pump for  sampling nitric acid vapor, and a nitrogen oxide analyzer.   In  addition, the project provides a computer system for data  acquisition and analysis.   This equipment permits the expansion  of laboratory offerings and provides students with a unique  opportunity to participate in environmental research.",
