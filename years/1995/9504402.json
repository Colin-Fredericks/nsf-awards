The results of the workshop will  significantly accelerate the rate at which this technology  is implemented in practice, bringing about a more rapid  realization of the productivity gains and reduced  environmental impacts offered by vacuum consolidation  technology.  Current challenges faced by port authorities in  the U.S. and abroad offer a test bed opportunity and will  enable preparation of successful feasibility pilot programs  to evaluate this technology under various site conditions.  It is anticipated that different design approaches could be  tested and shared with the participants of the workshop at a  later stage.  ***",
