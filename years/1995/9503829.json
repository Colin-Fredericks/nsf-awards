 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the use of hierarchical methods  for accessing and visualizing large and complex multi-  dimensional data sets.  Visualization can provide an  efficient and powerful means of exploring such  data  However, most visualization methods are developed for  moderately sized  non-hierarchial data sets that can be  imaged acceptably fast on graphics  workstations. In  practice, there are many data sets that cannot be  effectively  explored using these methods.    The project is developing and implementing  visualization  approches designed for very large, multi-dimensional data  sets  over a variety of grid types.  Such data sets present  significant problems in  the management of time and space  resources, which will be addressed by this  research.  The  unifying theme will be the use of hierarchical data  structures  to manage both resources effectively.    Addressing time efficiency, techniques  are being developed  for the selective traversal and rapid interactive imaging  of  the data.  For space efficiency, various data models, such  as wavelets, are  investigated to achieve compression, while  being directly amendable to  visualization.    These hierarchies are being integrated with existing  visualization techniques for isosurface extraction, direct  volume rendering,  and flow visualization, many of which have  already been developed at UC Santa  Cruz and elsewhere for  non-hierarchial data.  Techniques for rectilinear,  structured, and unstructured grids are studied.  Parallelization of these  methods of SIMD and MIMD machines  is also is being explored.    This research  is developing new algorithms for visualization  of large, complex data sets, as  well as making software  systems available for use by scientists.  Software is  modular to facilitate integration with existing  visualization packages.  While  the main objective is  visualization, the hierarchical methods developed will  also  be of use for any data analysis hampered by access problems  in dealing  with  very large data sets.",
