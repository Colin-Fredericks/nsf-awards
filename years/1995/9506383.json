 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project exploits recent advances in the use of  sophisticated  mathematical methodologies to address related fundamental  questions in the foundations of computation theory and  programming language  semantics. Many important questions arise  out of a desire and need to capture  in a semantic setting both  minor and major variations in computational  strategies.   The  significance  in investigating such variations  lies in the  fact  that they can both provide a means of interpreting  increasingly  sophisticated programming language constructs, and also isolate  fundamental  mathematical processes at work that help define and  distinguish between  different notions of computation.    The main focus of the research entails the  utilization of new  approaches in the use of algebras, monads and comonads,  categories, logic and sheaves to provide a systematic and  conceptual approach  to the interpretation and solution of these  questions. Questions to be  addressed include:  finding an  algebraically robust interpretation for partial  data types and  partial maps; generating an intrinsic characterization of fixed  point constructions, including the generation of recursive data  types, and  isolating the special role of invariance in  this  process; defining a  categorical foundation for semantics in  general and describing a synthetic  domain theory in particular;  and  identifying and utilizing in a semantic  setting logical  properties resident in sheaf-theoretic structures.    General  areas of investigation include partial data types and  computation, fixed point  semantics, monadic and comonadic  computation, invariance and algebras, and  partial sheaf  semantics.  Technical tools include functorial liftings on  categories of algebras, refined partial map classifiers,  algebraic uniformity,  induction and coinduction principles,  natural and dinatural transformations,  monadic and comonadic  strength, domain theory and extensional PERs.",
