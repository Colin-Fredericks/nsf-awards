 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert A. Harris at the Department of Chemistry, University of   California at Berkeley, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical research related   chiral coherences. There are several topics where research is required in   order to establish fundamental understandings of these coherences and of   the special chemistry which may arise from them. One important topic   concerns the investigation of methods to prepare chiral coherences; in   particular, to identify methods which will have a high degree of coherent   behavior. Another important topic concerns the measurement of this   coherence; here, research to asses the usefulness of neutron scattering   as a way of making such measurements could lead to a valuable   experimental tool. In addition, research is required to develop a   suitable theory of second harmonic generation in order to interpret and   explain the activity of chiral adsorbates on surfaces.  The concept of chirality, the notion of left handed and right handed   chiral molecules, has been known and studied by chemists for sometime.   The recent discovery that excited states of molecules can be used to   create coherent superpositions of chiral molecules opens the way to a   range of new phenomena. In particular, it may open the way to the   discovery of systems which have a new chemistry governed by the   principles of superposition and parity conservation.",
