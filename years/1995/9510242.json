 "awd_abstract_narration": "Straus    Under the direction of Dr. Lawrence Straus, Mr. Thomas Berger  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study a  large series of materials excavated from archaeological sites in  Israel, Jordan and Syria. All date to the Natufian period which  immediately precedes the emergence of settled agricultural  societies in the Near East. In addition to architecture, site  ecology and chronological placement, he will focus on the stone  tools and chipping waste which was recovered in abundance at all  localities. He will attempt to locate the sources of the stone  raw material and to reconstruct the processes used to manufacture  finished tools. He will also examine how these changed through  time. On this basis he will gain insight into the social and  economic organization of the Natufians and determine how the  moved over and utilized their landscape.     The Neolithic Revolution, marked by the domestication of plants  and animals, constitutes one of the major turning points in human  prehistory. It set the base for complex societies and the  emergence of social hierarchies. Archaeologists have come to  realize that one must intensively examine the period which  immediate precedes the Neolithic Revolution to gain insight into  its cause and this is the goal of Mr. Berger's research. The  project will produce data of interest to many archaeologists and  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
