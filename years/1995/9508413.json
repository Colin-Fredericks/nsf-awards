 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508413  Donahue    An Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) using a 2 MV General  Ionex tandem particle accelerator has been operated at the  University of Arizona since 1981.  The primary mission of  this AMS laboratory is twofold.   It operates as both a  service laboratory to provide radiocarbon (l4C)  determinations of samples of geophysical and archaeological  importance to the scientific community at large, but also  supports a wide range of in-house scientific research.  The  laboratory presently analyzes the l4C content of over 3,000  samples a year for many scientists from many parts of the  world.  Just under half of the current laboratory analyses  are for in-house research, or for research undertaken in  collaboration with external researchers.  Such in-house  research has focused on a diverse set of topics. Some of  this research has been oriented toward improving AMS  technology in terms of chemical preparation of samples,  improvements to instrumentation and data reduction and  interpretation.  The labs efforts have enabled them to  obtain unprecedented precision in l4C analyses.  They  currently are able to produce l4C/l3C ratios with  measurement precisions of +0.5% in a counting time of about  30 minutes per sample, for recent material. High-precision  measurements as accurate as +0.25% have been reported by  this facility using multiple target determinations.  Other  in-house research projects are oriented towards more basic  science goals including studies of in-situ production of 14C  in rocks and ice and improvements to the l4C calibration  curve using tree rings or coral l4CU-Th measurements.  This  grant supports operating and maintenance costs of the  Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) laboratory and  will allow them to maintain and improve the high standards  of AMS measurements that the scientific community has come  to expect from this facility, and to develop new  applications of AMS, which will then be available to the  scientific community.  As part of this  grant, Arizona will  upgrade their existing AMS system with an injection system  with an electrostatic analyzer, a high-resolution injection  magnet, a fast isotope pulsing system, a high-energy  analysis system with an electrostatic quadrupole lens, a 90  magnetic analyzer, and a cylindrical electrostatic analyzer.  Support for the next International Conference on Accelerator  Mass Spectrometry, to be held in Tucson in March 1996 is  also included.    ***",
