Delzell  of a continuous solution to Hilbert's seventeenth problem.    The principal investigator aims to prove an analogous  result for the Kochen representation of an integral-definite  rational function.  This requires finding an appropriate p-adic  analogue to the real notion of a pre-ordering.  By studying the  universal theory of p-adic fields, the principal investigator  and her collaborator Luc Belair think that a successful  definition of \"pre-valuation\" can be found.  A further goal is to  study the \"fine\" p-adic spectrum, in which the structure of the  sets of nth powers is added.  The second project is also related  to the structure of nth power sets in a p-adic field.  The  principal investigator and her collaborator D. Macpherson have  recently defined the notion of \"P-minimality\" and have shown that  a field with this property must be p-adically closed.  Important  further questions are to show that expansions of p-adically  closed fields by analytic functions are P-minimal, and to study  the differentiability of definable functions in P-minimal  structures.       Model theory is concerned with the study of mathematical  objects which are defined by axioms.  Model-theoretic algebra  applies the theory to particular algebraic objects, in this case  to p-adic fields.  P-adic fields are number systems in which a  notion of distance exists, in a way similar to that for the real  number system, but in which the prime integer p plays a special  role.  The first problem in this research concerns a  representation of certain functions of p-adic fields  which reveals some of their essential properties; the question is  whether this representation varies in a predictable way.  The  second problem, also at the heart of understanding the nature of  the p-adics, asks whether the geometry of sets definable in the  p-adics in first order logic has important features in com mon  with the corresponding sets of real numbers.  ***",
