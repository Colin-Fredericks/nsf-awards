 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408623  Jim Chen       This project addresses both modelling and experimentation to   investigate a modified single roll caster using the concept of   \"Intelligent Processing of Materials\".  Such a study will also lead   to the advancement of similar technology, melt spinning, which is   known as a rapid solidification process (RSP).  The materials   produced by RSP possess refined and homogeneous microstructures   and much improved physical, magnetic, and mechanical properties.    Building on prior work of simulating hot rolling process, this  project on single roll casting of thin strips has the process  potential to reduce the energy consumption and manufacturing cost  by more than 50% as compared with the  conventional steel making  where several process steps are involved including casting, rolling  and heat treating.   The study will include the development of (1)  macro-scale modeling for predicting the melt flow and  solidification phenomena as well as predicting the ribbon geometry,  (2) experimental investigation of interface heat transfer and  solidification behavior, and (3) model validation and process  optimization.       Primary metals processing technology has been moving towards   direct casting of thinner and thinner cross sections.  Initially,   the process step between ingot casting and hot rolling was   eliminated by the development of direct, one step, continuous slab   casting.  The next step of eliminating slab casting followed by   rolling by a single step, continuous strip casting remains a   technical challenge, particularly for higher melting metals such as   steel.  Successful completion of this project has the potential to   revolutionize the way thin strips of metals are manufactured at   substantially reduced cost with a low capital investment.",
