 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416579  Jones    Year to year variations in the number of fish which survive  the first year of life (termed recruitment or yearclass  strength) are often sufficient to control the success or  failure of the fishery a few years later.  Despite the  scientific and economic benefits which would result if  yearclass strength could be estimated before fish reached a  marketable size, recruitment prediction has proved to be an  elusive goal.    Likely mechanisms contributing to year-to-year variations in  the yearclass strength of Atlantic croaker include  variations in the location and timing of spawning, the age  and date of subsequent advection to the estuarine nursery  area, the duration and relative growth  rate while in the  estuary, and the age and date of migration out of the  estuary as an adult.  In conjunction with age-structured  measures of growth and survival based on otolith daily  growth rings, these hypotheses can be testes using a new  laser-based elemental analysis technique (LA-ICPMS) to  retroactively determine the hatching site and estimate the  age and date of subsequent migrations in individual fish.  The technique is based on the a cellular nature of the fish  otolith (earstone), which forms through the concentric daily  additions of mineralized tissue around a central nucleus.  Given the fact that the elemental composition of a given  daily ring reflects the elemental composition of the otolith  at the appropriate daily increment.  By corollary, water  mass differences at the time and place of hatching will be  reflected in elemental composition differences in the  otolith nucleus.    Previous work confirmed the analytic potential of LA-ICPMS  and provided the first demonstration that otolith elemental  composition does indeed reflect characteristics of the  ambient water.  The strength of the current project lies in  the refinement of this approach, and its application in a  field study using sample sizes well above that of any other  study of this type (1200 otoliths). Su ccessful completion of  this project has implications not only for recruitment of  Atlantic croaker, but for studies of recruitment, stock  structure,  migration and fisheries management around the  world.  ***",
