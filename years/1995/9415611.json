The potentially reactive layer of  amorphous iron, manganese, and aluminum oxides coating much  of this sediment  is exposed on the continental shelf to  seawater, mixed with labile organic matter derived from  marine plankton, and then deposited in shelf sediments where  it undergoes a variety of diagenetic (burial-related)  biogeochemical reactions.  Having documented a variety of  such diagenetic processes in their past work, the PIs will  now look in more detail at the variety of minerals in Amazon  Shelf deposits and attempt to distinguish those of  continental origin from those which have been formed in situ  by diagenetic reaction.  Mineralogical analysis will involve  transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and  electron microprobe to determine particle structures and  composition -especially to newly-precipated minerals from  those of  continental origin and to document the formation  and/or dissolution of surface coating over originally  deposited particles.  Oxygen, strontium, and boron isotope  analyses will be used help establish the origin (continental  or marine) of the variuos mineral phases.       This research is geophysically provocative for two main  reason.  Some authigenic Amazon Shelf minerals like siderite  (a reduced iron carbonate) are found in ancient sedimentary  deposits whose paleoenvironmental characteristics are  unclear and have long been in dispute; determining the  origin of such minerals in present-day deposits could help  solve such problems.  Secondly, the Amazon River is a major  contributor of fresh water, solutes, and sediments to the  world ocean; thus understanding the fate of materials  delivered to its delta is important for understanding a  large part of global marine geochemistry.",
