 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists and educators in two consecutive workshops in May, 1995, in Great Britain and The Netherlands, to share experience in using innovative science educational materials focusing on the physics and technology of the bicycle.  The workshops are organized and hosted by Dr. Keith Williams, Dean of Technology, British Open University, at Milton Keynes, Great Britain, and Dr. Frits Gravenberch, Director of Research, National Institute for Curriculum Development, Enshede, The Netherlands.  U.S. participation is coordinated by Dr. Dean Zollman, Physics Department, Kansas State University.   A collaborative effort by participants from these three countries, joined by a few invited experts from other countries, will identify priorities and improve the efficiency of future research to benefit the science and technology education communities in all three countries.  Parallel research and development in the United States, Great Britain and The Netherlands has lead to the creation of science and technology teaching materials which focus on the bicycle. These materials have proven to be effective in enabling students to learn about scientific principles as well as technological applications, in a familiar and interesting context.  Groups in each of the three countries are now in the early stages of enhancing their traditional instructional materials by adapting them to a digital multimedia environment.  By working together, these groups can collaborate to develop instructional materials which build on the strengths of each group.  The results of the collaboration should be a set of truly international instructional materials which utilize the most recent advances in digital multimedia.",
