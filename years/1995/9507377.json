IBN-9507377      Evolution of Complex Colony Structure in Social Insects      Social behavior is the outgrowth of interactions among  individuals. Social systems are complexes of behavioral  traits that have evolved within a species in response to  certain environmental conditions. The goal of this project  is to understand how particular environmental conditions  affect social systems in insects.    The PI has previously studied two populations of the forest  ant Myrmica punctiventris. One population near Burlington  Vermont, has ant colonies that contain a single queen and  all her daughter workers. Within those colonies the queen  lays her eggs, and the workers care for them, forage for  food, keep the nest clean, and so on. A second population  near Albany, New York is vastly different in its social  system from the Vermont population. There, a colony can  contain a family of queens and a separate family of workers.  Two completely different families share living quarters,  with one family dominating the egg-laying and the second  family doing the work.    The goal of the present project is to understand the  environmental conditions that have driven the Vermont and  New York populations in two such different directions. The  researchers will manipulate food availability and  availability of nesting sites in a large field experiment.  By charting occupancy of nests and reproductive biology  throughout the three-year experiment, they should be able to  determine if and how these two environmental factors affect  social systems.    The PI will also will continue detailed genetic work on this  species.  She will clone DNA to find   suitable markers to  use in genetic experiments. These DNA markers will yield  information on who is the mother and who is the father of  workers and reproductives in ant nests. With these data, it  will be possible to measure the importance of genetic  determinants of social systems as well.",
