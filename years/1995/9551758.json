 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant equips an activity room to provide improved physical  science instruction, primarily to elementary education majors.    The course expansion from one term to a year-long sequence offers  increased course content with a balanced mix of laboratory  experience, physical science concepts, and pedagogy.   The course  models approaches and methods of teaching science, based on the  belief that new teachers rarely try methods that they have not  directly experienced.   Consequently, the course upgrade centers  around an activity-based, guided-inquiry format that relies  heavily on teaching tools developed and tested by leading  researchers in physics teaching and on experience with the  Workshop Physics mode in algebra- and calculus-based courses.   Previous course requirements for the elementary education program  have been such that they can be satisfied by enrolling in  traditional large sections of biology and astronomy with little  or no laboratory component.   The department has offered an  activity-based physical science course since 1990.   However, it  has been available to only 24 students, typically one quarter per  academic year, because of the lack of space and equipment.    Continued success with this limited physical science offering,  proven track record with other activity-based physics courses,  and in-service teachers workshops have led to a serious  discussion about the need for a year-long physical science  course.   A fully implemented course can lead to improved  physical science instruction for preservice elementary teachers  and serve as a model for other institutions.",
