The pilot  project has already trained 40 teacher-leaders and impacted over  500 teachers at all grade levels, and the present project builds on  this base.  It involves teachers, principals, administrators, and  parents to create a district-wide culture to support sound  mathematics education for 20,000 students at 24 elementary, 4  middle, and 5 high schools.  During its 5-year life, the project  will have directly impacted 436 elementary, 24 middle school, and  34 high school teachers, including training 36 elementary, 8 middle  school, and 10 high school teacher-leaders.  The program for the  teachers consists of 5 sequential 1-week summer institutes plus 8  full days of follow-up during the school year, focusing on such  matters as:  restructuring the teacher's own conception of  mathematics; creating collaborative learning environments in the  classroom; alternative assessment; a study of modern curricula;  etc.  There are also programs for parents (6 evening sessions) and  administrators, including 33 building principals.       Cost-sharing is 104% of the NSF contribution.",
