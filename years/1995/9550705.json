 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550705  Lopez-Garriga  The Chemistry Department of the University of Puerto Rico at  Mayaguez, presents a research proposal to (1) create a cluster of  research scientists, (2) establish a research facility dedicated to  study fast kinetic and dynamic processes in chemical systems, (3)  assist in the education of the students in the department, and (4)  strengthen the existing research capabilities.    The cluster, ULTRAFAST DYNAMIC PROCESSES IN CHEMICAL SYSTEMS, will  focus its scientific activities on (1) subpicosecond studies of  ligands in heme proteins, (2) resonance Raman spectroscopy with UV  picosecond excitation, (3) ultrafast photolysis studies of ligand  displacement reactions, (4) formation of agostic bonds and  cyclometalation in organometallic complexes, and (5) dynamic  studies of surface photochemical reactions.  The major goal of the  cluster is to make significant contributions to the scientific  community in the research areas of interest indicated above and to  assist in the scientific and intellectual development of students  in our University.    Our University is committed to develop the department as a center  of excellence in chemistry and provide the adequate education and  research training for undergraduate and graduate chemistry  department in the last five years.  The construction of the new  chemistry building, with over 100,000 sq. ft. of laboratory space,  is approaching completion and is expected to open in the 1995-1996  academic year.  The new building will serve as the main site for  the research operations of the cluster.  This support reflects the  major role and commitment from the University to:  (1) science  education and training of hispanic and black graduate and  undergraduate students in modern spectroscopic techniques, (2) the  involvement of high school students in basic research, and, (3)  improving the research competitiveness of Puerto Rico in the  sciences.    To develop the intellectual capabilities of our undergraduate and  graduate students  and members of the proposed research cluster,  nationally recognized speakers will be invited to present and  discuss their research findings related to dynamical processes in  chemical systems.  The cluster proposes an external advisory board,  whose members will be chosen from the speakers of the conference.   They will meet with the investigators to review the progress  accomplished and will provide written recommendations, to be  included in the RIMI reports for future development as overall  performance.    With the approval of the herein proposed research program, the  Chemistry Department will add a major thrust to its research  programs nurtured initially by a previous RIMI Program, MRCE, and  EPSCOR.  Therefore, the University will be able to increase further  the quality and training excellence of our undergraduate and  graduate students in modern spectroscopic techniques.  Thus, our  students will find a better niche for advanced degrees and  additional training in prestigious universities and our sprawling  pharmaceutical industry will be better served.  In a similar way,  researchers will be more professionally assisted resulting in a  concomitant increase in productivity.  ***",
