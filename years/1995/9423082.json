 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct methods for solving sparse linear systems are   because of their generality and robustness. For linear   systems  arising in  certain applications, such as linear programming and  some   engineering applications, they are the only  feasible methods   for numerical  factorization.  This project is  developing a scalable   parallel direct solver for  solving sparse  symmetric-positive definite(SPD) systems of   linear equations,  and is investigating its utility and effectiveness in the   context of  linear  programming problems and least square problems.    A highly   parallel formulation  of the factorization phase of the  direct solver for SPD   systems has been  developed.  This is being  extended to the other three phases   (ordering, symbolic  factorization and triangular system solving) of a complete    scalable parallel  direct solver.    Parallel formulations are being   investigated on a variety of  hardware platforms, including traditional MPPs such as CM5   and  Cray T3D, as  well as clusters of DEC and IBM workstations.  The  parallel   algorithms are being  implemented in a portable form using  a programming library   that supports  collective communication, and  will be made available to   researchers and  practitioners  elsewhere.",
