 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9502892 Eaves  This research is to be directed along three  closely related concepts,  namely, the solution of equations and  paths of equations with  homotopies, the solution of parametric  or short paths of equations  with infinitesimals and ordered  fields, and the formalisms of a linear  problem and linear  algorithm. The essence of the first concept is  following the  path of solutions where there is one dimension of  freedom, while  perhaps, using approximations, subdivisions, and/or  Newton's  method. The essence of the second concept is doing  arithmetic  with infinitesimals and, transferring algorithms, problems  and  solutions from one ordered field to another. For certain problems   and algorithms a parametric version of the problem can be solved  by  lifting it to an ordered field containing an infinitesimal to  obtain a  single problem, the original algorithm is run in the  new ordered field,  and the solution is lowered to the original  field to obtain a short path  of solutions to the parametric  problem. The essence of the third  concept is the precise  identification of what a linear problem is and  what type of  algorithms solve them.   This research is to be directed along  the concepts related to the  solution of systems of equations;  the pertinent systems of equations  are widely applicable in  engineering, science, and management.",
