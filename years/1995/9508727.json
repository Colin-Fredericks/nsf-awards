 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508727    A conference on \"Attribution Processes and Person Perception\" will be held at Princeton University on March 23-25, 1995.  The purpose of the conference is to bring together experts in the fields of person perception and attribution theory to discuss the emergence of new perspectives on problems that owe their origin or direction to the work of Edward E. Jones who, with his students and colleagues, helped to forge and develop these areas of inquiry, which have been central to the field of Social Psychology for the last thirty years.   The conference goals will be achieved through a series of eight paper sessions. Each session will include presentation of a theory and empirical paper by a current, major figure in the field followed by two knowledgable discussants, who will react to the focal paper, as well as interactions with the audience. In addition, invited addresses by senior scientists will discuss the overall themes of social psychology and the influence that Ned Jones had on those themes before his untimely death in August, 1993.",
