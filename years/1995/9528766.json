 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9528766  Richard Florida  Carnegie Mellon University    This award, through NSF's Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing initiative, will support research into the relationships among three innovations in manufacturing systems:  continuous quality improvements, lean or low-inventory production, and reduction or elimination of waste/ by-products. The research is guided by the research literatures on quality, lean production, and \"green\" production.  In addition, the research investigates the influence of local characteristics on innovation adoption or non-adoption, working from the thesis that localized networks of information, labor, and regulation (public and private) provide an important source of industrial innovation.  Based on the results of a recently-completed survey of manufacturers, the project will support the development of intensive case studies of a set of facilities and their management, competitive structure, and localized regulation.  The results of the research should have relevance to the fields of geography, regional development, and industrial innovation.",
