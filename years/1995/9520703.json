 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is suitable for an SGER, due to its  interdisciplinary nature, involving applications of geometric  modeling and  scientific visualization to provide improved  representation and display  techniques for the cornea.  The  application has the potential of  revolutionizing the field of  optometry.  Instead of the current trial-and-error  method of  fitting contact lenses a much faster and precise procedure can be  developed.  Furthermore, it will enable fitting contact lenses to  people whose  corneas have complex and/or irregular shapes,  something which is impossible  with the current state of the art.  A successful completion of the project may  induce the  manufacturers of contact lenses to embark on a development  effort,  but at present they don't have the financial incentive to  take the risk.  Thus  the small investment in this project can  have significant impact.  The PI is  highly qualified and is  strongly motivated, due to a personal vision problem.  I  recommend funding.",
