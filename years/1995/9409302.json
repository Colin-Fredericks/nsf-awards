 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409302  Dekel    This project focuses on three research topics: (1)  Experiments  and or mutations are an important ingredient in the models used  in the recent research on learning and evolution in economics.   The proposal develops models where rates of experimentation are  themselves learned or mimicked and then explores how different  aspects of the environment influence the rate of experimentation  that arises in the long run.  (2) Models where the possible  information received by an individual does not partition the set  of states of the world have been used to introduce various  elements of bounded rationality into decision making and game  theory.  However, these models implicitly assume that players are  unaware of their information sets, while the applications in  games often implicitly assume that the information structure is  common knowledge.  The research explores this apparent conflict  by explicitly developing a dynamic process of how players use  their information.  A related objective is to develop an explicit  model of forgetfulness to see how it corresponds to the general  models without partitions.  (3)  Models of herds, or  informational cascades, where buyers mimic preceding buyers  rather than using their own private information ignore the fact  that sellers have strong incentives to entice buyers to create a  herd/cascade for their own product.  The research will explore  the extent to which this can happen, what types of sellers will  invest in falsely creating herds/cascades, and whether more or  less information is used when sellers are activity trying to  create herds/cascades.",
