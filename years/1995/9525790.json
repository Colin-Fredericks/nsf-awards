As a first step, a multi-layered neural  network clustering algorithm employing the Kohonen self-  organizing feature map categorizes the Internet homepages  according to their content.  The category hierarchies created  could serve to partition the vast Internet services into  subject-specific categories and databases.  After individual  subject categories have been created, domain-specific concept  spaces (graphs of terms and their weighted relationships) are  generated for each subject category.  The concept spaces can  then be used to support concept-based information retrieval, a  significant improvement over the existing keyword searching and  hypertext browsing options for Internet resource discovery.  Lastly, using homepages in each subject category, a genetic  algorithm client-based \"spider\" (agent) that can perform a  global, stochastic search on the Internet based on individual  searchers' preferences will be developed.  While focused on  Internet, the concepts and results of this research are  expected to be generally applicable in other networked  environments.",
