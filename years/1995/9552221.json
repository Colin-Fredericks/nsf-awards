 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project new experiments in optical spectroscopy and  magnetic resonance are introduced into the undergraduate physics  curriculum as part of an innovative upper-division laboratory  course for physics majors.   The course (Spectroscopy and  Magnetic Resonance) investigates electronic transitions in  molecules and solids, vibrational and rotational transitions in  molecules, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.   Students are  exposed to the most important experimental techniques in visible,  infrared, and magnetic-resonance spectroscopy.   The first  component of the course introduces absorption spectroscopy,  laser-induced fluorescence, and photoluminescence.   In the  second section, students investigate Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.   The third component  introduces pulsed (i.e., Fourier transform) nuclear magnetic  resonance.   This course has a significant interdisciplinary  component.   The experiments and techniques explored in this  course are central to physics, physical chemistry, and  biophysics, and the experiments developed in this course are  available to students in chemistry and biology.",
