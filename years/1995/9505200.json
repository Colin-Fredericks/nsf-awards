A wheelchair robot kit, with a notebook computer providing the platform for the user interface, will be utilized to create a low-cost, general-purpose wheelchair robot that can be used as a navigational assistant in wheelchair accessible indoor environments.  The system is planned to be easy to use and to increase the efficiency of the user's travel in the wheelchair.    Seven women students at Wellesley College will be involved with the Principal Investigator in the project.  Since women are underrepresented in computer science and engineering in general and in robotics in particular, this project is particularly appropriate in the opportunity it provides to expose women undergraduates to possibilities in research activities and to encourage them to continue with further study in this area.  With the planned complementary educational activities, the project will also bring new technical breadth to their computer science education at this liberal arts institution.  ***",
