 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506725  Cannon       This project asks, \"Does variable negative curvature imply  constant negative curvature in dimension three?\"  More precisely,  the project seeks a proof that a negatively curved (Gromov  hyperbolic) group with 2-sphere at infinity acts coaompactly,  isometrically, and properly discontinuously on hyperbolic 3-space.   This goal would constitute a major step forward in establishing  Thurston's important geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds and  would also have important consequences in the study of Kleinian  groups, negatively curved groups, conformal mapping, and Riemannian  geometry.  Prior work of the principal investigator and coworkers  has reduced the problem to the study of discrete conformal mapping  problems about finite subdivision rules in the plane.  Secondary,  but related, problems concern algorithmic techniques with  negatively curved or almost convex groups.       All of geometry and its applications takes place within  mathematical models or \"spaces.\"  Topology seeks to classify these  models and to understand their chief local and global properties.  The most important of these models are the \"manifolds,\" the locally  Euclidean spaces.  Mathematicians have to great effect long since  classified the 2-dimensional manifolds and have a corresponding  valuable, yet conjectural, picture of 3-dimensional manifolds,  called \"Thurston's geometrization conjecture.\"  The project seeks  a proof of one piece of that conjecture, namely that 3-manifolds  that in the large behave like negatively curved spaces can in fact  be smoothed so as to have constant negative curvature in the small.  An affirmative answer would reduce many problems about 3-manifolds  to well-developed techniques involving matrix theory, algebra, and  analysis, with corresponding economies in mathematical physics and  elsewhere that these models are used.  ***",
