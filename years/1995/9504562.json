 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oh       The investigator develops numerical methods for solving  three-dimensional crack propagation problems.  In order to obtain  any practical solutions for crack propagation, the Finite Element  Method (FEM) requires use of either graded discretizations (very  small elements near the crack front, larger elements elsewhere) or  special singular basis functions.  The graded discretizations make  the computation very expensive, while singular basis functions  destroy the nice band structure of the FEM.  Thus, the standard FEM  is impractical for accurate numerical simulation of 3-D crack  propagation.  The accuracy of the FE solution depends on the  regularity of the true solution.  The investigator studies a new  method, called Method of Auxiliary Mapping (MAM), to deal with  three-dimensional singularities: vertex, edge, and edge-vertex.  To  remove the ineffectiveness of the FEM in the presence of  singularities, MAM transforms a region where the stress functions  are singular to a region where the transformed stress functions  are of higher regularity.  The investigator also studies three  auxiliary mappings for these purposes.       The annual cost of fracture-related damage in the United  States (human injury and loss of life aside) has been estimated at  more than $10 billion.  Metal fatigue has been cited as the  probable cause of several recent airline accidents, and the  airworthiness of aging fleets is a national concern.  Material  failures are a major concern for other large engineering  structures (ships, bridges, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric  dams, and so on).  Thus, for effective inspection and preventive  maintenance programs, an accurate fracture analysis is demanded.  However, because of the complicated geometry and nonlinearities  that characterize fracture mechanics, the use of analytical  techniques is very limited and in most cases not practical.  Numerical methods seem to be the only feasible approach for such  analysis.  On the basis of very successful results o f the stress  analysis for plane elasticity problems, the investigator studies a  new method that should yield highly accurate numerical simulation  of three-dimensional fracture analysis.",
