 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to recover a missing link in the  early history of English banking,-- the legal background to the  rapid dominance of England in European banking.  As such, it  fills a gap that the strictly economic evidence in banking and  archiving does not supply.  Bankers during that time were  familiar with that law and often sought to refine that nexus  which for historians does not reflect itself in printed legal  materials.  However, there is in an unpublished archive a body of  law pertaining to early banking in England.  The project will  retrieve and analyze that forgotten legal tradition through an on  site inspection of this unexplored archive.  The fundamental  research questions to be addressed concern the degree of  regulation banking faced in its early evolution.  Were there a  range of legal regulations relating to negotiable instruments,  reserves, registration of banking conveyances, and deposits that  are unknown to historians today but existed at the time?  This  research is important because it will shed important new light on  the evolution and regulation of financial institutions.",
