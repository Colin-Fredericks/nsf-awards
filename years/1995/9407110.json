 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current available testing methodologies have not been widely  or productively utilized in industry for several reasons, including such factors  as deadline pressures, necessity of a large initial investment in software and  hardware, impracticality of methodologies, or inability to work with embedded  systems.  This project addresses one testing issue which has been  problematic for industry:  embedded systems.    The inherent  multiprocessing in embedded systems makes them particularly difficult to  test.  For example, each instrument control and display may be implemented as  its own thread of execution.  Testing all possible interleavings quickly results  in a combinatorial explosion.  Code complexity directly contributes to these  combinatorics.  One approach for handling complexity is through abstraction.  This research seeks to develop a testing strategy based on state pools and constraints.  Contraints represent relationships that must be  maintained between objects.  By treating these relationships as atomic units,  execution granularity can be increased, reducing the number of interleaved execution  paths.  With the cooperation of an industry partner, application to production systems is being explored.",
