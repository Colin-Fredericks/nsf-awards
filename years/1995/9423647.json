 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423647  KNOX  This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the  research vessels MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON, and R. G. SPROUL, operated  by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean science research.    The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites, communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data  retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Robert Knox is fully qualified to direct  this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the  acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will allow the institution to upgrade systems on all  three ships including, but not limited to, winch, communication,  navigation and safety systems.  ***",
