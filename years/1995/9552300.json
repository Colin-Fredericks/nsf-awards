 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds two new research-oriented courses in the  upper-division biology and environmental science curricula:  (1)  Life at the Edge: the Physiological Ecology of Life in Extreme  Environments and (2) Bioenergetics.   Students in these new  courses are engaged in the actual \"doing\" of science as they  conduct open-ended scientific inquiries for the lab portion of  these courses.   The new equipment, together with existing  equipment, enables students to design their own research projects  in many areas of ecological physiology and bioenergetics,  including studies of whole animal responses to environment as  well as the cellular bases to those responses.   These research  experiences are critical to providing context for the lecture  portions of these courses as well as stimulating the development  of skills in scientific inquiry that are not possible in other  formats.   The objective is that students learn and use methods  of physiological inquiry and construct their own understanding of  physiological phenomena.   Another aim is to bring these skills  into the classroom and design and implement a \"research as  curriculum\" pedagogical model.",
