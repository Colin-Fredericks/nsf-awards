The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe    conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support  for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the  deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational  equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite    receivers to pin point the location of research sites,    communication equipment including radio transceivers and    satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data    communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.        The Project Director, Dr. Gary Greene is fully qualified to    direct this project having had considerable experience in    overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard    equipment.        This project will allow the institution to replace a worn out  undersized crane, and acquire NECODE modules and a search and  rescue transponder for safety.  ***",
