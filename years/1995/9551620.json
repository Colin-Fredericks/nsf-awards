 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, a multipurpose computer is being used to  complement traditional laboratory and field investigations.    Students carry out a variety of simulations, use self-guided  multimedia learning materials to learn laboratory- and field-  related concepts, and analyze data.   They also manipulate and  quantitatively analyze images captured with microscope equipment  and a new gel scanner.  The project allows faculty and students  to create multimedia teaching modules from original materials.    Photographs, video, and sounds are being digitized and edited.    With presentation software, they are incorporated into multimedia  modules.   These interactive modules are being made available in  the new laboratory, in existing laboratories, and over the  university network for students to study at their own pace.  The  new equipment includes the following: (1) a computer laboratory  with five Macintosh computers, five PC-compatible computers, five  laserdisc players, presentation and simulation software, and  several laserdiscs; (2) a Macintosh graphics development station  with a capture board, video tape recorder, video camera and  software; and (3) a video scanner and light boxes for  electrophoresis and chromatography gels.  The new laboratory  directly affects at least 360 science majors in the College of  Science and Engineering, including all entering freshmen biology  majors, all sophomore biochemistry and chemistry majors, and 130  upper-division biology students.",
