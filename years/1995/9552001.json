 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, state-of-the-art diode array detector  spectrophotometers, microscope attachments, an ELISA plate  reader, cold cabinets, and supporting equipment is purchased and  an HPLC system upgraded to achieve full integration of  collaborative learning activities into selected core and elective  courses in the Biology Department.   Incorporation of  collaborative approaches to laboratory work have been highly  effective in a trial program in Research and Analysis.   This  approach is now enalarged to include additional core courses and  elective courses in biology.   The new equipment permits the  introduction of modern cellular-focused activities and projects  into a required sophomore-level course, enabling faculty to  introduce students to this important phase of biology early in  their curricula.   As a result, a significant increase in  hands-on student involvement is occurring in a number of courses.    A corresponding expansion in the range of undergraduate research  projects our students might pursue is anticipated.   The new  equipment is greatly enhancing the learning opportunities  available to students.",
