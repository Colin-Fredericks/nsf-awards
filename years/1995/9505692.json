 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Gregory L. Hillhouse, Chemistry Department, University of Chicago, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division to develop metal mediated reactions of   nitrous oxide and related species. The oxo and imido insertion reactions   of nitrous oxide and organoazides will be utilized to synthesize a series   of late transition metal hydroxides, alkoxides, and imides. The metal   systems will be chosen so that reductive elimination reactions will   result in the clean formation of cyclic organic molecules that contain   oxygen or nitrogen heteroatoms. Systems will be constructed in which the   metal catalyzes these transformations.  One of today's greatest chemical challenges is the selective oxidation of   organic substrates. A very attractive oxidant is nitrous oxide, a   molecule which liberates only nontoxic and environmentally friendly   nitrogen gas after it serves as an oxygen transfer agent. Moreover,   nitrous oxide is recognized as both a `greenhouse gas` and a   stratospheric `ozone depleter`;  it would be advantageous to find new   uses for this gas, which is now an underutilized biproduct of the   chemical industry. In this project metal systems will be designed to   activate nitrous oxide toward oxygen atom transfer reactions and metal   catalysts will be developed to facilitate these reactions. As a result   new uses for nitrous oxide and some related species will be developed.",
