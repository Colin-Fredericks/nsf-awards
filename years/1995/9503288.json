This  meeting   includes   a  two-day  workshop   with   technical  presentations   of  the  participants  related   to   recent  advantages of bridge engineering and a study tour of  bridge  structures  and  organizations.   Ten  meetings  have   been  conducted  so far, and all of them have proven  to  be  very  fruitful  and productive experience for the participants  of  both countries.    The  workshop will be held in Japan in May 1995, to  support  the  participation of U.S. delegates who will make technical  presentations and participate in the study tour.",
