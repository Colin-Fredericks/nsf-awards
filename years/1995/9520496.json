 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year fellowship for postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Widner the opportunity to obtain training in cognitive psychology at the University of Texas at Austin.  Dr. Widner's   research interests have centered around the processes underlying memory retention.  He now wishes to refocus his interests to identifying the processes responsible for retrieval   failures.  During his postdoctoral tenure he will (1) study the processes and types of information incorporated into memory assessments and memory predictions; and (2) develop techniques that will result in more accurate memory assessments and predictions.  Research findings reveal that the ability to assess the contents of our memories and to predict our memory performance is relatively poor.  Inaccurate memory assessments can   have serious consequences in decision-making behavior, learning, and reading performance.  It is important that the mechanisms underlying such inadequate performance be identified and techniques developed to increase the accuracy of such processes.",
