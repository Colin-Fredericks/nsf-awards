 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510092  Congleton     This award provides funding for the establishment of an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Ergonomics at  Texas A&M University.    The research activities of the Center will contribute to the  technology and information base necessary to evaluate and  redesign existing workplace environments and work methods and to  provide the leadership for the effective design of future work  systems.  The Center will provide an opportunity for industry to  coordinate and direct research objectives in response to safety,  health, and ergonomic guidelines and standards that are being  adopted.  A focused research program will span interdisciplinary  fields aimed at reducing injury/illness rates; reducing  cumulative trauma disorders; reducing costs; increasing  productivity; and developing responses and research for increased  regulatory activity.  These technical programs are well developed  and aimed at solving key problems of both academic and practical  importance that will enhance and extend the reputation of the  Center and encourage growth in membership.    The Principal Investigators are competent researchers, actively  engaged in research within the area of interest to the Center and  it is their reputations that have resulted in the commitment of  10 companies to support the new Center.  Their proven leadership  skills should help ensure the success of the Center.     The Program Manager recommends that Texas A&M University be  awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing  award.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers  Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of  renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program M anager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
