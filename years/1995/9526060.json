 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526060 Dupuis  An International Symposium on Gallium Nitride and Related Materials is being held to address current topics in materials growth and characterization including several contemporary topics of increasing importance, namely;  Kinetics Of Chemical Reactions; Surface Chemistry Of Precursors; Synthesis Of Novel Precursors For Nitride Growth; Properties Of Wurtzite And Cubic Nitride Materials; Electronic And Structural Properties Of Interfaces And Thin Films; Defect Structure Of Interfaces And Materials; Growth Of Heteroepitaxial Films; And Substrates For Heteroepitaxial Growth.  There are also a number of sessions dealing with physics and device aspects with a strong emphasis on fundamental processes.  Additionally there will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the Symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate the critical scientific issues in this emerging research area, and to consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them.  %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status of Gallium Nitride and related materials, and especially critical materials research issues in epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device and circuit fabrication along with current assessments of the most important contemporary research issues in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of electronics and photonics.  These materials have particular advantages and characteristics for development of blue-green lasers and LEDs useful in a host of display and communications technologies.    ***",
