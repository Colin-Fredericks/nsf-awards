 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9406233  Flavonoid derived pigments are almost universally found in the  plant kingdom, providing color to flowers, fruits, leaves and  storage organs. The most commonly found flavonoid derived pigment,  the anthocyanins, are derived from 3-hydroxy flavonoids. The  biosynthesis of the flavonoid derived pigments in maize presents a  unique system for the study of the structure and function of  transcriptional regulators. A large number of maize genes have been  reported that directly affect the amount, hydroxylation pattern and  distribution of flavonoids and flavonoid derived pigments. Several  of the genes encoding enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway  have been cloned and characterized: C2, CH1, A1, A2,BZ1, BZ2, as  well as others which are shared between the 3-deoxy and 3-hydroxy  flavonoid biosynthetic pathways: C2, CH11, A1. The regulation of  these pathways in maize is controlled by two classes of regulatory  proteins: those with a Myb-homologous domain (C1 and P1) and those  with a basic helix-loop-helix domain (members of the R and B  families). Anthocyanin production requires the interaction of a  member of the C1/P1 family and a member of the R/B families. Thus  the pattern of anthocyanin pigmentation in any particular plant  part is given by the combinatorial, tissue specific expression of  the regulatory genes. The goals of this work are to 1) determine  whether the regulation of C2 and CH11 by P and C1 is similar to  that of A1 2) characterize the regions of P required for the P  regulatory function 3) structurally analyze the DNA binding domain  of P and its' relation to other plant Myb-homologs and 4)analyze  possible interactions of P with other factors.  %%%  The biosynthesis of the flavonoid derived pigments in maize  presents a unique system for the study of the structure and  function of transcriptional regulators, in that the absence of the  intermediates or final products of the pathway does not affect  maize viability and P activity can be readily scored  by inspection  of the kernels and cobs. The potential of the system is increased,  in that mutants of almost every gene in the pathway are available.  The results of this study should give greater insight into the  mechanisms of combinatorial regulation of biosynthetic pathways in  plants.  ***",
