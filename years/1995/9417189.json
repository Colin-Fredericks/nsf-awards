The  collaborators assembled also include phenomenologists from the  University of Pennsylvania and the University of Hawaii as well as  theorists from Nagoya University and the National Laboratory for  High Energy Physics (KEK).   This project will address some of the  most important areas of research in the phenomenology of  fundamental particle interactions. This collaboration will facilitate in-  depth studies of the phenomenology of physics beyond the Standard  Model on the following topics: physics at linear e+e- colliders;  supersymmetry; strong WW scattering; astrophysics; and B physics.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working in the area of theoretical physics.  The U.S. scientists will  have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  equipment at Tohoku University and KEK.  Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
