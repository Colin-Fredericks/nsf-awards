 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554576  Beckman    In recent years we have observed  extensive interest among industrial  BS-level engineers, chemists, and  biologists in returning to school  to pursue a PhD in chemical  engineering. In each of these  cases, the parent company has  contributed significantly to the  work via access to corporate  analytical labs, chemical samples,  and outright cash gifts. Given that  we have found that these non-  traditional students are often  amongst our best graduate students,  due to their drive, experience, and  maturity, we propose to employ the  title graduate fellowships to  support an increased number of such  students in PhD research. Our  experience is that research  programs which emphasize water  minimization are of great interest  to our industrial colleagues, and  thus we feel that use of the  proposed fellowships in the area of  waste minimization to attract  students returning to school form  industry will lead to a large  number of  applicants. Further, we  propose to collaborate with the  University of Pittsburgh  Manufacturing Engineering Program  by offering Pollution Prevention  over MSEP's distance learning  program. By participation in MSEP  we foster greater interaction with  local industry, and can identify  and recruit students with interests  in continuing on for the PhD vial  research in waste minimization  topics.",
