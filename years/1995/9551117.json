 "awd_abstract_narration": "This school maintains a well-equipped manufacturing laboratory  containing both manual and computer numerically controlled (CNC)  machine tools.   However, while these machines are well suited  for discrete production of parts, they do not provide a  continuous process that can be run, altered and monitored.    Consequently, laboratory efforts in statistical process control  (SPC), process monitoring, and design of experiments (DOE) are  unfortunately artificial.  In light of today's increasingly  competitive manufacturing environment, it is essential that  engineering students are well trained in the entire manufacturing  process and exposed to state-of-the-art process monitoring and  control during their education.  Such exposure enables them to  more effectively make the transition from student to practicing  engineer.   This project has obtained some important components  to an existing CNC lathe in the manufacturing laboratory that  will allow a production run of process to be executed.   These  components include a wire straightener/cut-off machine and a  pneumatic bar feeder.   These two pieces of equipment allow the  department's Cincinnati Milacron Talon CNC Lathe to be run in a  production mode.   A simple part program for a rotational element  (e.g., a screw or an electrical terminal) can now be run for  hundreds of pieces without human intervention.   Students have  access to a \"process\" that can be periodically sampled as part of  an SPC exercise, disturbed as part of a DOE exercise or  continuously monitored as part of a metrology exercise.",
