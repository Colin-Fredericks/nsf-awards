 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501060  Grant    The principal investigator analyzes mathematical models  involving nonconvex energy functionals that incorporate both bulk  and  gradient effects, in an effort to better understand the nature of  dynamical metastability, which typically appears in the form of  slow  migration of transition structures, such as steep fronts or  vortices.  Energy methods of the type developed by Bronsard and Kohn have  proven  successful in establishing the existence of dynamically  metastable  solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation, the Cahn-Hilliard equation,  Cahn-Morral systems, and equations for modeling phase transitions  on  lattices.  The investigator will apply similar techniques to  equations  in higher-dimensional domains, with multiple state variables,  with  multiple (or a continuum of) low-energy phases, with gradient  energies  involving convolutions, or with complex dynamical behavior.  %%%  In several mathematical models of physical systems (in  particular,  models from materials science) certain structures have been  discovered  that eventually undergo significant changes but take an  extraordinarily  long time to do so.  This phenomenon, sometimes called dynamical  metastability, is important to identify and understand because  macroscopic properties of a material (e.g., brittleness) may  depend  sensitively on the underlying structure.  This project will  contribute  to this understanding and, therefore, to the development of new  materials and the improved use of existing ones.  The models  exhibiting  dynamical metastability are general enough that the results of  this  project should have implications in other contexts, as well.  ***",
