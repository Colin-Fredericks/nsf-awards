 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports work on Group 5 and 6 metal clusters  with labile ligands by Dr. Duward F. Shriver, Department of  Chemistry, Northwestern University.  The overall goal of the work  is to synthesize extended solids and large molecular clusters  containing redox and photoredox active early d-block metal  clusters.  New compounds will be synthesized and characterized  photochemically and electrochemically, and used as the basis for  preparation of micro- and mesoporous solids and for markers in  electron microscopy.  These compounds will serve as precursors  to: (1) mixed clusters with potentially interesting bonding,  reactivity, electrochemistry and photochemistry; (2) clusters  containing atypical ligands for these metals; and (3) solids  consisting of clusters of clusters with size and shape  selectivity for small molecules and redox or photoelectrochemical  activity.  A number of possibilities for interaction of clusters  with functional groups on solids will be investigated. For  example, silica-supported molybdenum clusters will be  investigated as a solid medium for photochemical or  photoelectrochemical transformations of small molecules.  Heavy  metal clusters will be employed as markers for functional groups  on polycarbon species.  Also, some clusters, which can be readily  imaged by high resolution electron microscopy and analyzed by  electron nanodiffraction and spectroscopy, will be utilized to  differentiate between competing structural models for carbon  nanotubes.    Molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, and tantalum form \"clusters\" in  which six metal atoms form an octahedral core around which are  associated ions, such as chloride.  In this project easily  exchangeable ions will be associated with some of these clusters  so that they can be attached to surfaces of novel materials.  The  size, photochemistry, and electrochemistry of these clusters can  then be used to determine the shape of the support material t o  which they are attached, or to increase the chemical capabilities  of both the cluster and the surface.  The results could be  helpful in characterizing known materials or in synthesizing new  materials.",
