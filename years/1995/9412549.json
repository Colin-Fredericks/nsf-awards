Toward Efficient Default Reasoning          This is the first year finding of a research project involving  a three year study of a novel approximation-based, approach to  tractable nonmonotonic reasoning.  Nonmonotonicity is a critical  part of most human reasoning tasks.  Despite this, current  nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms are inherently undecidable in the  general case, and are intractable in all but the most restrictive  cases.  To address this intractability, two known, weak,  techniques-context-limited reasoning and fast, incomplete  consistency testing-will be combined to develop a powerful,  tractable, approximation mechanism.         Neither of these techniques, alone, suffices, however.  Since  consistency is undecidable in the first-order case, context limited  reasoning does not, by itself, guarantee tractability, Furthermore,  known fast, incomplete consistency tests generally fail in  realistically-complex knowledge bases.  The goal of this research  is the show that the combination of the two techniques  synergistically yields a tractable approximate nonmonotonic  reasoning mechanism that overcomes the limitations of either  technique alone.         The conditions under which this approach gives justifiable  results will be formalized, and probabilistic arguments will be  developed showing that the approximations induced are reasonable  for certain useful types of default reasoning.  Formal results will  be proved showing that the approximations converge to fully-correct  reasoning as additional computational resources are expended.  The  mechanisms necessary for building and maintaining contexts and for  dealing with the errors induced by the approximation will then be  studied.  Finally, these ideas will be implemented and evaluated  empirically against non-trivial knowledge bases.",
