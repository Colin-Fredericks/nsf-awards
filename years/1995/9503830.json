 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems in propositional logic, such as Boolean  satisfiability,  are studied from the point of view of   developing practical  algorithms, although the problems are often NP-complete or   co-NP-complete.  Such problems are of practical importance in VLSI  design   verification, test  generation, related CAD applications,  as well as automated   verification.  Many other  applications also occur naturally.    E.g., higher  order theorem  provers require a satisfiability checker as a   module.  Recent  hardware advances bring solution of some of these problems    within reach.  Algorithms are being implemented and tested for  performance   in typical  applications, such as test pattern  generation, sequential   circuit verification,  and program  verification.    Model search (usually called   the Davis-Putnam  method) and  resolution are two well known, but somewhat   conflicting,  strategies for solving propositional satisfiability.  Model    search ``succeeds''  by discovering a satisfying assignment,  whereas resolution   ``succeeds'' by  detecting that no such  assignment exists.  Some work on   combining the two ideas  in one  algorithm has recently appeared.  This project   investigates more  powerful combinations of these methods.  Besides resolution,    recognition can be valuable.  The goal is to identify    contexts in which  resolution, equality recognition, and other  inferences can   be beneficial in  reducing the search space.  Equally important is to find   implementations, usually  requiring advanced data structures.      Another goal is  the development of application-independent  methods.    Heuristics described in  the literature for particular  applications are examined to   determine whether  the application  content can be abstracted away, making the   heuristic applicable  to a logic problem without knowing its origin.",
