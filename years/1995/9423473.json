Males and females are often very different in ecologically important ways, such as extreme differences in body size, behavior, diets, or habitat.  To understand diversity and the environmental variables important to its maintenance, it is important to consider specializations between sexes as well as between species.  Accurately understanding the amount and patterns of diversity in the natural world is becoming increasingly critical for conservation efforts.  With limited resources, management decisions must not only be well informed but also gain the most efficiency with the funds and lands available.   This project will determine to what extent such specializations contribute to diversity within the adaptive radiation of Anolis.  Differences in diet, behavior, body design, and habitat use will be compared in fifteen species of Anolis.  Data will be collected by behavioral observations, habitat censuses, and examination od stomach contents.  The radiations of Anolis have occurred independently on two islands, which provides enhanced power to statistical analyses.  In addition, the relationships among the species are well-understood.",
