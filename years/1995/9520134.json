 "awd_abstract_narration": "For doing medical diagnosis, one may wish to design a learning algorithm   which attempts to determine from test data which combinations of symptoms indicate  that a person will develop a  certain disease.  The test data may consist of a  collection of patient profiles, with the outcomes of  a large number of tests on  each patient, and a bit indicating whether the patient subsequently  developed  the disease.  One may further assume that whether a patient develops the disease  depends  only on the presence or absence of a few symptoms, and all other  symptoms are irrelevant.  In that  case, a good learning algorithms should  output a hypothesis that is also a function of a small number  of symptoms.    A hypothesis can be used to predict whether future patients will develop the  disease.   If the hypothesis depends on only a small number of clinical tests,  it saves time and money.  In recent work, the investigator has shown a  polynomial time PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) algorithm which learns  k-term disjunctive normal form formulae which depend on at most r variables  (where r is unknown and may be a function of the total number of variables)  by creating a disjunctive normal form (DNF) hypothesis which contains at most  poly(r) variables.  An initial goal of this project is (a) to demonstrate   a similar result for the class of decision lists.  Additional goals    include:  (b) the exploration of different paradigms   where extracting relevant information is important; (c) the discovery of  efficient algorithms for the current problems; (d) the development of a   theoretical framework for measuring relevance under which universally   applicable techniques for reducing irrelevant information can be found.  In addition to the research described above, the PI will teach a graduate  seminar on computational learning theory with the expectation of attracting  graduate students to the area.",
