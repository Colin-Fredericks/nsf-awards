 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510377  Holland       Holland's research is in model theory, a branch of  mathematical logic.  In recent years, many new structures of  interest to model theorists have been constructed as  homogeneous-universal models for classes of finite models with a  notion of dimension.  Among these new structures are the new  strongly minimal structures built from existing ones by the method  of fusion introduced by Hrushovski.  Holland has begun a general,  systematic study of arbitrary fusions from a geometric point of  view.  The new perspective gained therefrom enabled Holland to  produce a simple, more transparent construction than that of  Hrushovski in a particular case.  She intends fully to generalize  the simplification and to continue the systematic study of fusions  both from a geometric point of view, to see what new information  the provide on the classification of geometries that arise from  strongly minimal structures, and from a model theoretic point of  view, to see whether variations on the strongly minimal  construction might provide further examples of model theoretic  interest.  In parallel, Holland intends to work toward a unified  framework in which to view all of the new work on  homogeneous-universal models.        Holland intends to use the planning period to refine her  research project, formulating the specific, plausible conjectures  that should constitute a credible NSF proposal.     ***",
