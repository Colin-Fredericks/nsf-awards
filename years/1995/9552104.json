 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to incorporate gas chromatography  and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the first 2 years of  coursework.   Students are introduced to chromatography and mass  spectrometry through a series of three experiments in the first  semester general chemistry course.   The final experiment in this  set involves sample collection, extraction, and analysis of  herbicides from local lakes, streams, and rivers.   Students in a  new interdisciplinary Environmental Analysis course use gas  chromatography to measure methane production from different types  of soils and incorporate their results into a simple global  climate change model.   Organic Chemistry students make extensive  use of gas chromatography for assessing purity of reaction  products, and GC-MS to determine the identity of products and  by-products.   Analytical Chemistry students utilize deuterated  internal standards and selected ion monitoring to measure the  concentration of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in local lake  sediments.   Analytical students also utilize the GCs and GC-MS  in mini-research projects of their own design.    By acquainting  students with the principles of chromatography and the unique  problem solving capabilities of GC-MS early in their chemistry  experience, the project (1) creates excitement in lower division  courses; (2) gives students confidence in their ability to  utilize sophisticated instrumentation; (3) allows upper level  courses to focus on problem solving capabilities of the  instrumentation, rather than on details of operation; and, (4)  allows students to pursue student-initiated research.",
