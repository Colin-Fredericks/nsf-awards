Specifically, the research  involves the development of: a)  nonparametric extensions of logistic  regression for multiclass responses, including additive,  projection pursuit and basis expansion techniques, as well as rank  reduced models similar to Fisher's LDA;  b)  a  new adaptive algorithm  for basis selection, similar to  Friedman's MARS model, which uses a  natural penalized criterion to simultaneously select variables and  shrinks their coefficients; c) a technique for locally adapting the  nearest neighbor distance metric to combat the curse of  dimensionality.      Many important problems in data analysis and modeling focus on  prediction. Some important examples include   computer assisted diagnosis of disease (e.g. reading  digital mammograms), heart disease risk assessment, automatic reading  of handwritten digits (e.g. zip-codes on envelopes), speech  recognition, to name a few. This  research is about enriching the  current toolbox of well established statistical models in a natural  way to  address some of these more complex scenarios. Often new  exotic techniques, such as neural networks, are ``black boxes'' that  appear to produce good results, but do not provide the analyst with an  interpretable model, diagnostics or similar feedback to give them  confidence that the box has produced sensible results.     Statistics can play an active role in these important prediction and data  analysis problems through the development  competitive and defensible   models.  This research does just that by   creating a blend between the well understood classical techniques and  the new techniques that allow for  model exploration.",
