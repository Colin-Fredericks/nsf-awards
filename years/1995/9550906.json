 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the inclusion of a Hewlett-Packard GCD, a  capillary gas chromatograph with an electron ionization detector,  in a newly developed chemistry curriculum.   The two guiding  principles in developing this new curriculum are (1) courses  should be discovery-based with students being actively engaged in  scientific inquiry and (2) the boundaries which have  traditionally separated the subdisciplines of chemistry should be  removed.   The new curriculum includes a 1-semester, discovery-  based introductory course and is followed by intermediate and  upper-level courses that continue to illustrate the  interdisciplinary nature of chemistry.    The Hewlett-Packard GCD  is a dual use instrument in that it may operate as a capillary GC  or as a GC/MS.   As such, this instrument will fill two important  gaps in instrumentation and will be extensively used in four of  the eight core courses required for the new chemistry major, as  well as in advanced electives and in independent research  projects.   A significant number of majors from other disciplines  also enroll in two of these four courses, extending the impact of  the inclusion of this instrument in the new curriculum beyond the  doors of the chemistry department.",
