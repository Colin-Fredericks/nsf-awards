 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university's Advanced Computing Laboratory (a) introduces  parallel processing (PP) and high performance computing (HPC) into  a spectrum of mathematics and computer science (Math/CS) courses;  (b) increases the breadth and depth of undergraduate  multidisciplinary student research; and (c) creates and widely  distributes PP and HPC user guides specifically tailored to  undergraduate needs.   The equipment purchased through this grant  enables new instruction, creating two new courses and enhancing  seven existing Math/CS courses.   Student research, utilizing the  new laboratory, is integrated within the curriculum at three  levels, including the required multi-year seminar courses.    Drawing on their course and research experiences, students develop  user-friendly guides for PP machines and HPC software.   In  addition to its primary audience of Math/CS majors (including  pre-engineering and teacher education students), the laboratory  serves Biology and Chemistry majors.   The Ohio State University  provides a software library to facilitate student work in graphics  related projects.   As a result of the new laboratory and software  (a) graduates are better prepared for professional careers; (b)  students are more motivated to pursue graduate school; (c) students  assist in advancing scientific education through dissemination of  user guides and presentation of research findings at conferences,  in journals and through various on-line methods; (d) partnerships  with local companies are strengthened through collaborative  research projects; and (e) the course model can be replicated at  other institutions.",
