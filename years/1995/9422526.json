 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422526  ORING   The study of habitat fragmentation has been built upon understanding how lost habitat, isolation of habitat patches, and increased habitat edge lead to declines in populations.  This understanding has, in turn, formed the foundation for principles of reserve design in conservation biology.  In order to design reserves in the future, traditional studies of fragmentation must be augmented.     This study will evaluate the effects of fragmentation using a population of American avocets (Recurvirostra americana).  Research will be conducted at three scales.  At the individual scale, mark/resighting methods will be used to understand individual movement patterns.  At the population scale, system dynamics modeling will be used to construct a population model.  At the landscape scale, data will be used to develop a spatially explicit understanding of the relationship between patches.   Research conducted will make theoretical and applied contributions to the field of conservation biology.  First, it will provide direct answers to applied questions about reserve design and conservation of inland wetlands.  Second, it will evaluate the importance of wetland loss versus wetland degradation for avian populations.  This understanding is critical to the basic principles of scientific reserve design wherever loss and degradation of habitat are occurring, and findings will have application to reserve design worldwide.",
