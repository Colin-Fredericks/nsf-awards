Macromolecular  Photochemistry and Photophysics (MPP) is of unquestionable  scientific and technological importance. The results of basic  research on this topic would have an impact on technological  areas as diverse as degradation of plastics by sunlight, the  development of optical computers, and the fabrication of  increasingly smaller circuits for electronics applications. The  Center will draw upon the considerable body of expertise of nine  current faculty in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry,  Physics and Astronomy, and Polymer Science at USM, and make use  of existing equipment and other physical facilities. It will draw  these faculty closer together and promote synergism in their  research efforts through a broad spectrum of activities such as  participation in joint research projects, funding of graduate and  undergraduate students, participation in a seminar series and  international conferences, participation in a literature  discussion group, funding of travel to conferences and  industrial, academic, and government labs, funding of a seminar  series and consultant's visits to the campus with special  emphasis on visitors from industrial labs, provision of  specialized courses in photochemistry and photophysics, and  provision of modest support for operation and repair of common,  specialized research equipment. The Center faculty will also  serve the departments in an advisory role particularly in such  matters as identification of important research areas and  selection of new faculty, library acquisitions, and equipment  acquisitions. The Center will generate promotional materials for  such crucial activities as recruitment of graduate students and  informing industry of the Center and the expertise of its  faculty. Photochemical projects range from studies of the  photochemistry of polyimides to the development of new  functionalized photopol ymerizable monomers. Photophysical  projects range from the use of fluorescence probes in sol-gel  systems, associative thickeners, and surfactant polymers, to  studies of dynamic light scattering in liquid crystal polymer  dispersions.",
