 "awd_abstract_narration": "Odegaard    With National Science Foundation support, Nancy Odegaard and her  colleagues will conduct a program to improve the conservation of  and access to perishable archaeological artifacts excavated from  a number of sites in the American Southwest. This collection  consists of an estimated 21,500 artifacts and ethnobotanical  lots. Based on a conservation survey, approximately 18% require  improved housing; many others require major or minor conservation  treatment. To remedy these problems, the team will undertake  necessary conservation, improve storage of materials and  consolidate and organize associated documentation. The related  computerized database will be updated and a user's guide  developed.    The archaeology of the United States Southwest is important for  several reasons. First, this region saw the rise of complex  societies which in prehistoric times linked communities with  roads which stretched across large expanses of deserts, which  constructed multistory buildings which housed hundreds of  individuals and which devised ways to survive in a harsh and  unpredictable desert environment. Secondly, because of the dry  conditions, perishable organic materials are often well preserved  and these provide insights which are rare in archaeological  situations. For example it is often possible to reconstruct local  environmental conditions and then determine the subsistence  strategies which human groups took to adapt and respond.    The perishable organic materials at the Arizona State Museum are  an endangered and valuable archaeological resource. With NSF  support, they will be properly conserved and made more available  for scientific research.",
