 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502142  Kovacic    This work is supported  by a National Science Foundation Faculty Early   Career Development Award.  The research will focus on the theory of near-  integrable systems. These systems are small perturbations of completely   integrable ordinary and partial differential equations or integro-differential   equations. Two areas will be addressed: multi-pulse homoclinic orbits in   low-dimensional systems, and regular and irregular dynamics of the   Maxwell-Bloch integro-partial differential equations that describe ring-  cavity laser optics. The proposed research in the area of multi-pulse   homoclinic orbits is a  continuation of the author's previous work on   unstable resonant systems. It will exhibit several new classes of multi-pulse   orbits in a large family of near-integrable systems, and thus reveal the   intricate phase-space structure of the systems in this family.  This research   will also provide computable methods for verifying the presence of these   complicated homoclinic orbits, and therefore irregular dynamics, in specific   examples.  Applications of these methods in mechanics, fluid and solid   dynamics, and nonlinear optics are also proposed. In the area of the   Maxwell-Bloch equations, the proposed research contains a broad array of   theoretical, computational, and applied questions.  These questions include   finding new explicit solutions of the integrable Maxwell-Bloch equations,   homoclinic orbits and chaotic dynamics, finite-dimensional attractors,   stabilization of the excited states of lasers, numerical simulations of   solutions, and mathematical descriptions of fiber lasers and diode lasers.   Comparisons with realistic physical and engineering applications and   experiments are also proposed.  The education component involves   translating  the author's research experience into a geometric and   dynamical-systems oriented approach to teaching courses in differential   equations on the sophomore, junior-senior, and graduate levels, and   advising  students and involving them in research collaborations with Los   Alamos National Laboratory.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-  wide program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single   program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally underrepresented in science   and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance   the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic   careers that include both research and education.  The research component   of this project involves intended research that addresses both regular,   mainly time-periodic, and irregular, or chaotic, behavior in two classes of   physical systems in mechanics and laser optics.  The work will focus on   mathematical models that are near-integrable, that is, models whose degree   of approximation is a small step away from making them explicitly   solvable.  By neglecting certain small quantities, these models do become   explicitly solvable, or integrable.  The explicit solutions obtained in this   way may be used to approximate the solutions of the more complicated   near-integrable systems.  The proposed work will thus develop a   mathematical description of the mechanisms behind certain types of   behavior of the physical systems under investigation, such as the irregular   beats in the amplitudes of coupled pendula, and some of the regular and   chaotic  operation regimes of lasers.  Numerical computations will be used   to motivate the  analytical investigations and confirm their findings, as well   as to extend their results to mathematical models that are less simplified and   thus not amenable to either explicit or approximate solution, but are more   phys ically accurate.  Comparisons with realistic physical and engineering   applications and experiments are also proposed. The  mathematical   techniques discovered in the course of this investigation should be general   enough to apply to similar problems in other areas of physics, such as   nonlinear fiber optics, solid, and fluid mechanics.  The education   component will involve incorporating the author's research experience into   classroom work on the sophomore, junior-senior, and graduate levels and   advising students and involving them in research collaborations with Los   Alamos National Laboratory.",
