 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423013  Moodera  Experimental investigation of the properties of magnetic materials  by  the surface-sensitive technique of spin-polarized tunneling is the aim  of  this  research program.  In particular, electron tunneling between  ferromagnetic metals, through ferromagnetic insulators,  and  exchange  effects   in   ultrathin   films,  and  at  the   interfaces   between  ferromagnetic metals and paramagnetic metals will be studied.   Planar  tunnel  junctions will use superconductors as electron-spin  detectors  at   low  temperature  and  voltage.   Our  recent  success  in  using  ferromagnetic  metals as electron-spin detectors at  room  temperature  and  higher  voltages  greatly broadens this  field  of  research  and  suggests technological uses.  %%%  Improvement of computer magnetic memory systems is currently  of  high  priority.   Study  of surfaces and interfaces has become  increasingly  pertinent from the point of present and future technology.  This is  a  proposal for the study of the physics of magnetic effects in thin film  surfaces   and   trilayers  using  the  technique  of   spin-polarized  tunneling.  The recently discovered large magnetoresistance effects in  ferro-magnetic tunnel junctions at room temperature promise  important  applications  for  these  effects in  READ/WRITE  sensors  and  memory  elements.  ***",
