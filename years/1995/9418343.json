 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418343  WU           This project is related to an already funded Continental  Dynamics project directed by Thomas Henyey and David Okaya of the  University of Southern California (USC), titled \"Geophysical  Investigation of a modern Continent-Continent Collisional Orogen:  The Southern Alps, New Zealand\" (referred to as the main project).    The main project concentrates on the South Island, with an onshore  reflection transect, onshore/offshore refraction/wide angle  reflection transect and a passive seismic study using local  seismicity and teleseisms as the center pieces.  The last component  involves a six months deployment of broad band instruments on the  South Island to record local earthquakes and teleseisms for focal  mechanisms, SKS anisotropy and deep mantle structures directly  under the South Island.         This project aims to provide a broader regional coverage by  deploying stations on Chatham Island east of South Island; near  Auckland, North Island; in Southeast Australia, in cooperation with  Prof. Brian Kennett of Australian National University; and on the  South Island, for a total of 11-12 stations.  The stations would be  deployed for 14 months, with part of the deployment overlapping  with that of the main project.  The specific questions to be  addressed are: (1) What is the lateral extent of the lithospheric  deformation associated with the New Zealand orogeny?  Does it  involve flow of mantle materials on both sides of the orogen? (2)  What is the precise nature of the upper mantle anisotropy that has  been discovered to the west of the South Island?  Is it related to  the New Zealand orogeny or to flow under the Pacific plate to the  northwest of New Zealand? (3)  What are the deeper structures under  the Chatham Rise and the Lord Howe Rise?  Are there deep lateral  differences that drive mantle dynamics?  (4)  Are there high  velocity (and high density) zones under the South Island?  What is  their lateral extent?  ***",
