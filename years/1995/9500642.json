Preliminary work  on problems  involving nonlinearly elastic deformations of  anisotropic materials  will be conducted. Several areas of  research will be considered. The  first concerns the  determination of instabilities describing non- radially symmetric  deformations (of both isotropic and anisotropic)  solids under  symmetric loading conditions. Mathematically, boundary  value  problems for nonlinear ordinary and partial differential   equations governing equilibrium will be studied. A second related   issue is to examine the effects of loading perturbations on  bifurcation  solutions describing radially symmetric cavitation  instabilities (void  nucleation and growth in solids). The third  focus will be on the  determination of (i) generalized elastic  moduli for nonlinear  anisotropic materials, (ii) their  connection to the corresponding linear  moduli, and (iii)  constitutive inequalities to describe physically  reasonable  response of hyperelastic materials. Finally, problems in  which  the direction of anisotropy (transverse isotropy) is non-  constant will be considered, with interest toward potential   applications in biomechanics, such as modeling of the heart.    The National Science Foundations mandate to ensure the vitality  of  the Nations scientific enterprise includes concern for the  quality,  composition, distribution and effectiveness of the  human resource  base in science and engineering.  Within this  context, the Foundation  is committed to enhancing the current  rate of participation of women  in science and engineering  careers, in general, and as active  participants in all of its  programs.  Research Planning Grant awards  are made: (1) to help  increase the number mf new women  investigators participating in  NSFs research programs; and, (2) to  facilitate preliminary  studies and other activities related to the  development of  competitive research p rojects and proposals by  women who have  not previously had independent Federal research  funding.   Research Planning Grants are one-time awards that may be  used  for preliminary work to determine the feasibility of a proposed   line of inquiry, and/or for other activities that will facilitate  proposal  development.",
