The  study will analyze the institutional framework for economic  activity and the contractual relations between government and  private enterprise in a state where institutional reform was  implemented to eliminate traditional constraints to industrial  innovation and economic growth.  One set of legal institutions,  the federal New Industries (IN) act of 1893, will be examine to  see how the government allocated and adjudicaton property rights.   Hypotheses about how well Mexican property rights were defined  and whether Mexico business was highly politicized will be tested  and an analysis completed of the effects of property rights  policies on investments levels and the competitive structure of  industry.  In sum, this project will re-examine the Mexican  political economy using theoretical tools of the economic theory  of property rights.  Data will be collected through examining  extant legislation, congressional debates and newspaper  commentaries to ascertain the intentions of those who established  and administered public policy regarding property rights and  economic promotion.  The complete administrative records of the  IN program available in the Mexican national archive and  supplementary materials in the notarial and judicial archives  will also be used. In addition, data will be collected from the  financial press.",
