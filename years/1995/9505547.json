 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505547  Discher      This award is under the North American Research Fellows  Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers from  the United States, Canada and Mexico, to visit research  establishments in one or both of the other two countries for  periods of three to twelve months. The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Dennis E. Discher to work with Dr. Evan Evans  at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser  University in Vancouver, British Columbia.    Under the direction of Dr. Evan Evans, Dr. Discher will  receive extensive training in experimental biochemistry and  biophysics and will hone his ability to mathematically  formulate and analyze system models of different scales.  His principle area of study will be the determinants of  membrane structural viability with general implications  toward biomembrane organization and function.  He will focus  on the red cell membrane.  Its encapsulating membrane is a  prototype for the general material character of eukaryotic  cell membranes. He will work on determinants of membrane  strengths and mechanisms of failure.  What will emerge from  their work will be the first detailed, molecular  understanding of forced failure of a cell biological system.  Beyond the fundamental science, red cell membrane mechanics  falls within national and international interests in both  novel material systems and any number of biological problems  such as malarial parasite invasion of red cells.  ***",
