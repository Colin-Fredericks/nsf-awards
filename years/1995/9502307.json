 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the implementation of continuous-time  analog VLSI chaps for processing of sensory signals.  Two specific  analog sensors are being developed: 1) a single-chip visual time-  to-contact sensor that reports the amount of time until the chip  collides with an oncoming obstacle (assuming constant relative  motion), and, 2) a sound localization chip that computes the  direction (in two-dimensions) of a sound source using signals from  two microphones.  Though these projects may appear to be unrelated,  the proposed solutions using adaptive analog computation in CMOS  hardware lead to many common problems that must be solved.  By  providing a cross-fertilization between auditory and visual  processing, it is hoped that the underlying biological  computational primitives and neuronal representations will be  discovered.  The resulting low-power analog devices have obvious  applications in such areas as collision warning sensors for  intelligent automobiles and improved, low-power hearing aids.    The educational plan at both the undergraduate and graduate level  has a strong interdisciplinary emphasis.  Too often students are  taught to specialize in a narrow area and are consequently unable  to relate their work to an overall system objective.  Teaching  objectives are: 1) to stress the interdisciplinary nature of real-  world systems, and 2) to introduce students to problem solving  techniques for real-world signal-processing applications.  In  existing classes, the use of laboratories and computer experiments  where students can do hands-on experimentation with concepts is  emphasized.  New courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels  that give students more exposure to real-world experimentation in  laboratories will be designed.",
