 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510240  Whiting    This grant provides partial support for the acquisition  gamma  detector for use in research to trace fine sediment moving  through watersheds. How fine sediment moves from the landscape to  the channel and to downstream points is both a fundamental  scientific question whose answer is necessary for modeling  landscape evolution and a practical question whose answer is  critical in land management decision-making.  The PI's  will  employ the detector to measure fallout radionuclides including,  7Be, l37Cs and 2l0Pb in order to follow fine sediment as it moves  through watersheds.  These radionuclides are washed from the  atmosphere by precipitation and quickly adsorbed onto sediment,  which permits their use as tracers of sediment.  The relative  activities of these radionuclides with different half-lives  should allow the distinction between \"new\" sediment washed off  the landscape during storm events and \"old\" sediment which has  been stored in the stream bed and bank and has been resuspended  by the increased flow associated with storm runoff.  The activity  of radionuclides in sediment relative to these two end-member  components can be used to establish the relative delivery of  landscape sediment to downstream points in the drainage network,  to estimate mean travel distances and transit rates of fine  sediment, and identify sources of sediment in the watershed.  This innovative research has great potential to improve our  understanding of fine sediment and pollutant transport in  watersheds and thus is directly applicable to a variety of  environmental problems.        ***",
