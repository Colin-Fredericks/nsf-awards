 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9424446  Zak    The objective of this collaborative project is to synthesize a  number of new polymer electrolyte nanocomposites, and to apply a  variety of analytical techniques so as to probe structure and dy-  namics in the nanocomposite phases for eventual applications in the  development of new batteries. Polymer systems are particularly  affected when confined, as the local dynamic modes which contribute  strongly to bulk mechanical properties are largely determined by  interactions between neighboring polymer chains. It should be  possible to engineer these systems so as to preferentially retain  the beneficial properties while eliminating the undesirable  properties, as polymer monolayers are expected to have  substantially different properties than the same polymer in bulk.  Thus, polymer nanocomposites provide a unique opportunity to study  both theoretically challenging and technologically important  problems. The major goals of this project are: (1) to characterize  fully the microscopic of cation complexation in intercalated  polymers, and to explore the extent to which the polymer and cation  dynamics are correlated; (2) to explore the specific parameters of  the polymer which appear to most influence cation dynamics; (3) to  understand which parameters of the cation/polymer/silicate  interaction are responsible for the improved conductivity observed  for polymer nanocomposites; (4) to provide a sensitive experimental  test of available theories of ionic conductance in similar systems;  and (5) to explore chemical modifications of nanocomposite  materials, based on a systematic understanding of microscopic  energetics, which optimize for high ionic conductance.   %%%  Batteries based on polymer electrolytes are the subject of active  R&D competition worldwide. A key unsolved problem is the design and  implementation of lightweight, chemically stable and  environmentally benign electrolyte/electrode combinations.  Particular interest has focused on lithium salts dissolve d in  flexible polymers like poly(ethylene oxide), as these polymer  electrolytes combine promisingly high ionic conductances with good  chemical stability, easy disposability, and are conveniently  interfaced to high energy density Li electrodes. One drawback to  available polymer electrolytes is the precipitous drop in  conductance (from 10-4 to 10-8 S/cm) observed as the polymer is  cooled below the melt phase-generally, somewhat above room  temperature. The objective of this collaborative project is to  synthesize a number of new polymer electrolyte nanocomposites, and  to apply a variety of analytical techniques so as to probe  structure and dynamics in these nanocomposite phases for eventual  applications in the development of new batteries.",
