 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spielmann    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Katherine Spielmann  and her students will analyze large collections of ceramic  materials excavated from three late prehistoric pueblo sites in  the Salinas area of central New Mexico. Chemical analyses of  paste and included temper will be combined with detailed  examination of surface design. On this basis it will be possible  to reconstruct the system of ceramic manufacturing and exchange  across a large region and to determine how this changed over  time. The work will provide important insight into prehistoric  social organization and the processes which give rise to complex  society.    Archaeologists have noted that in many parts of the world a  correlation appears to exist between population growth,  population aggregation into regional centers and the emergence of  craft specialization. A number of models have been postulated to  explain this observation and the most popular argues that with  population growth, food can become more difficult to obtain and  therefore a number of individuals become craft specialists and  barter goods such as ceramics to obtain necessary subsistence  resources. Population growth, aggregation and craft  specialization occurred concurrently in the U.S. Southwest and as  a result of many years of fieldwork, Dr. Spielmann has developed  a data base which provides detailed documentation of this  process. Through her proposed analysis, she shall disentangle  cause and effect and gain insight into the mechanisms involved.    This research is important because it will provide data of  interest to many archaeologists as well as Native Americans. It  will shed new light on how complex societies emerge and are  maintained and will assist in the training of graduate students.",
