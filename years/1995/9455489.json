 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455489  Mead  A perusal of current introductory programming texts shows that  while the syntax of structured statements is described in formal  terms the semantics of structured statement is described in  informal verbal terms. The results is that students leave  introductory programming courses with a good understanding of the  syntactical aspects of structured programming and a poor  understanding of the semantical aspects. These programmers will  have difficulty assessing either formally of informally the  correctness of software which may control critical computer  systems. The goal of this project is to develop and assess a  programming methodology for the introductory programming sequence,  based on a blend of operational and axiomatic semantics, which  integrates semantic content (in terms of assertions) into the  programming process. A textbook will be written and assessed which  presents the methodology. The text will be language-independent and  useful either stand-alone or as a supplement to an existing  introductory programming text. The impact of this project is on  four groups. Instructors of introductory programming courses are  able to integrate the semantic-based methodology into their  existing courses without changing the primary text: the  supplementary text provides them formal support for integrating the  methodology. Students learning the methodology via the  supplementary text gain more thorough understanding of the program  semantics because the semantics are presented formally in terms of  assertions. They are better equipped to convince themselves and  others that their programs are correct because their programs carry  the evidence. Students, instructors, and computing professionals  who have not had the advantage of a semantic-based programming  methodology will be able  to use the text to familiarize themselves  with the more formal semantic side of programming. Finally, the  public will be long-term beneficiaries of the project. Developers  of computer systems whi ch the public depend on will be more  confident of the correctness of the systems when they are  programmed by students with a sound semantic background, which  should result when the methodology is learned.",
