 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550504  Diaz    The Universidad Metropolitana (UMET), one of the three  institutions of the Ana G. M ndez University System (AGMUS), will  implement the first phase of a ten-year model comprehensive  institutional development program to substantially increase the  number of quantity of minority science, mathematics and  engineering (SEM) BS degree graduates. The goal of the program is  to: a) increase the number of SEM majors and the number of  students going on to graduate school and science teaching; b)  develop the capacity to institutionalize and sustain this growth  and to continue to expand and improve well beyond NSF support;  and c) develop a well-documented, replicable model for similar  Hispanic institutions. UMET will attract talented students from  its highly successful pre-college programs, but it will focus on  increased recruitment, retention and advancement of low-income,  disadvantaged students who are traditionally excluded from SEM  careers. UMET's vision is to create an environment of high  standards and high expectations for all SEM students in which the  entire university is involved in offering an array of rigorous,  varied and exciting state-of-the-art SEM academic programs, that  places quality instruction and learning at the center of its  activities, and that provide the nurturing, extensive academic  and personal support, enrichment, and resources students need to  be highly prepared for graduate work.    The program will include a comprehensive revision and  restructuring of the entire current SEM curriculum, new  baccalaureate programs in physics, biology, chemistry, computer  science, and mathematics, and a pre-engineering transfer program.  It will also include: increases in the number and quality of SEM  faculty; a pre-freshman summer bridge program; student  scholarships; significant increases and strengthening of  undergraduate research; systematic academic performance  assessment and monitoring; enhancement of SEM facilities and  equipment; an undergraduate-t o-graduate transition program and  formal collaborations with graduate schools to provide transition  experiences and secure admission to graduate school. A Science  Support Center (SSC) will be developed as a hub for a host of  student supports and faculty development. A monitoring,  evaluation and student tracking system will be developed, along  with extensive documentation of the model program for  dissemination. The program will be developed in collaboration  with DOE National Laboratories, other universities and industry.    This initiative will require fundamental institutional changes in  academic and administrative policies and structure to overcome  traditional barriers to SEM development, as well as a  considerable investment of UMET's own resources. As a private  institution, UMET and AGMUS have the institutional flexibility  and the commitment to SEM to produce the types of institutional  changes required as well as the demonstrated commitment to  investing considerable amounts of its own resources to SEM.          6Universidad Metropolitana",
