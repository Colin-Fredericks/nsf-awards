The continued success and responsible  implementation of this technology for our future requires a public  which is knowledgeable about the technology as well as a skilled  work force. Six years ago, the College of Agriculture at the  University of Kentucky initiated an undergraduate degree program to  serve these needs and as a means of attracting and retaining  students in an exciting science degree program. The purpose of the  B.S. degree In Agricultural Biotechnology is to train students in  modern areas of cellular and molecular biology and genetic  engineering, and to prepare them either for technical job  opportunities in the public or private sectors, or for advanced  degrees programs in graduate and professional schools. Advanced  laboratory techniques courses are essential for a program that  emphasizes technology and its application to scientific questions,  and is also an important means of exposing students to a greater  range of scientific endeavors and concepts. The current application  requests support for the acquisition of equipment for such an  advanced techniques course. This course Is designed around an  Interdisciplinary approach to a contemporary issue In biological  sciences and strives to stimulate interpretive thinking skills.",
