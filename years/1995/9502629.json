 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development of efficient, reliable, and  real-time realizable coding algorithms and techniques for  compressing and transporting audio-visual signals, targeting  particularly the visual-telephone application. For a total channel  bit-rate of 64 kb/s or less, our goal is to achieve superior  grade-of-service by treating the compression of the audio (speech)  and video signals as an integrated problem. Our thrust centers  around the use of vector quantization techniques, and schemes that  jointly optimize the signal analysis and quantization functions. We  place particular emphasis on finding an efficient representation of  the displacement (\"motion\") field for motion compensated prediction  of the video signal. To facilitate personal wireless  communications, we are exploring adaptive coding schemes that  exploit the prioritized transmission of encoded data. For  compressing speech signals, we are exploring variable rate coding  schemes, and are allocating bits  between the speech and video signals to optimize the overall  grade-of-service. Achieving our goal would give significant impetus  to the development of the emergent Information Superhighway, which  can form part  of an infrastructure for supporting high performance computing.    Educational activities undertaken in conjunction with the above  research include but are not exclusive to: the development of  undergraduate digital signal processing laboratory courses; the  introduction of graduate courses in the area of audio-visual  information processing and communications; increasing the use of  computer-based multimedia instruction in the classroom; assisting  in speeding up the digitization of the library and networking of  its databases.",
