 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553426  Hammerich    The proposed project is designed to increase interest in science, engineering and mathematics  (SEM) among 60 fourth-grade, African American, Asian, and Hispanic females and to enhance  the science and mathematics curriculum at two Philadelphia elementary schools.  This project  brings together female elementary students, women who are retired from careers in SEM, and  female undergraduate science education and math education students to engage in intensive  experimental environmental projects.  This multi-generational approach enables elementary  school girls to investigate and explore urban environmental issues on a scientific level utilizing  mathematical concepts.  Through their involvement with retired scientists, engineers and  educators, as well as undergraduate students aspiring to be science and math educators, the  project introduces fourth-grade girls to career opportunities in SEM and effectively expands their  interest, enthusiasm, and concepts of math and science.    The proposed project represents a collaborative effort between Temple University, the School  District of Philadelphia, and area chemical companies.  Participants are drawn from:  (a) fourth-  grade students and teachers at Childs Elementary and Dunbar Schools; (b) retirees from area  chemical companies (including ARCO Chemical Company), the School District of Philadelphia  and Temple University; and (c) science and math education students of the College of Education  at Temple University.  The project is designed as an intensive intervention at two targeted  elementary schools, to demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-generational approach to  enhancing the science and mathematics curriculum at the elementary level.  This model project  can be replicated in other school districts.  The project activities include three components:   classroom activities; after-school activities; summer program--City Rivers Exploration.  The  project is to be coordinated by The College of Education at Temple Uni versity.  ***",
