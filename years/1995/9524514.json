 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry Division supports research by Cynthia K.   Larive of the Chemistry Department, University of Kansas, for the   development of a new method for characterizing metal ion complexation and   the aggregation of humic and fulvic acids isolated from ground and   surface waters.  The award is made in the Environmental Geochemistry and   Biogeochemistry section of the Water and Watersheds activity of the 1995   NSF/EPA Partnership for Environmental Research.  Collaborating on the   project is W. Robert Carper of the Chemistry Department, Wichita State   University.  Pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)   spectroscopy will be used to determine the aggregation state of humic and   fulvic acids and the degree of metal-ion induced aggregation.    Potentiometric titration methods will be used to measure metal ion   complexation, and NMR relaxation rates will indicate metal ion exchange   rates and formation constants.  This broad-based approach will enable   investigators to construct a model of competitive metal ion binding and   exchange rates in fulvic and humic acids.  Samples from the Suwannee and   Wakarusa Rivers will be used in initial tests of the generality of the   new method.  Humic and fulvic acids leach into ground and surface waters from soil and   plant organic matter and are inherently heterogeneous in nautre.  They   are the major constituents of dissolved organic carbon and, as a group,   interact with organic pollutants such as pesticides and herbicides,   increasing their solubility.  For this reason, they play an important   role in the transport and bioavailability of anthropogenic organic   contaminants.  This research is focused on the participation of humic and   fulvic acids in the complexation of metal ions and the development of new   methods for analysis which will simultaneously determine metal ion   concentration, complexation, and aggregation in samples from natural   systems.",
