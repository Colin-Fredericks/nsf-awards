This years conference promises to continue  this high standard while covering the subjects of interest  to the Ocean Engineering community.  In addition, the  Conference will cover subjects of interest to the other  programs in the Division.  These include computer controlled  surgery, telemedicine, environmental monitoring and control,  and teleoperations.  It is important to have participants  from the United States.    Professor Bejczy has been active in the area for many years  and has an international reputation in the field of robotic  control.  He has been invited to present a paper on \"Virtual  Reality in Telerobotics\".  This paper will contribute to the  general tone and information exchange at the Conference.  ***",
