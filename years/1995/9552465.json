To make these connections clearer we propose to develop a  library of hypertext documents that will link important  mathematical topics with contemporary interesting applications in  various fields of engineering and science. This library will cover  the mathematical areas normally studied by undergraduate students  in engineering and science, including calculus, differential  equations, mechanics and linear systems, advanced mathematical  methods, and probability and statistics. The library that is  created initially will constitute the basis for a constantly  expanding resource that will support a growing movement, at  Rensselaer and elsewhere, to move away from a lecture-dominated  mode of instruction to what we call a workshop or studio mode. The  development of these materials will involve a collaboration among  faculty at Rensselaer and at a number of other institutions,  including the University of Delaware, Siena College, Virginia  Polytechnic Institute, Central State University, Hudson Valley  Community College, and the University of Maryland. By means of  Visiting Professorships, faculty at several other institutions will  also become involved as the project develops. After careful testing  and evaluation, the library of hypertext documents will be made  available on the World Wide Web, on CDs, and in printed form. Among  the added benefits to Rensselaer and the other institutions  directly participating in the project is a much enhanced level of  cooperation among faculty who teach related courses in many  different a cademic departments.",
