 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Summary:    Cooperation, Altruism and Self-Control    P.I.  David W. Stephens  IBN- 9507668    Cooperation  is  a  key  component of  human  and  animal  social  behavior.   Scientists  who study animal behavior  have  borrowed  ideas  from  economic  game theory  to study  the  evolution  and  maintenance  of  animal cooperation.  The  simplest  category  of  games studied by game theorists is \"Two-player, 2-by-2 games\"  in  which   each of two participants must choose one of  two actions.  This  study  uses 2-by-2 games as an experimental and theoretical  tool to understand the economic and evolutionary underpinnings of  animal cooperation.    By  restricting this study to 2-by-2 games, the investigator  can  simplify  and  categorize  the range  of  possible  \"cooperative\"  situations.    Cooperation  may be either  \"selfish,\"   the  best  action  in the short-term for both participants, or \"altruistic,\"  a  good  long-term  action  that  sacrifices  short-terms  gains.  Altruism is considered a central problem in evolutionary  studies  of  behavior, because the process of natural selection is thought  to  be  fundamentally competitive. Experimental  studies  suggest  that  animals  seldom cooperate altruistically.   One  hypothesis  explaining  this  fact  is that animals  have  strong  and  well-  documented  preferences for immediate reward.   In  psychological  jargon,  they  often fail to show the required \"self-control\"  to  wait for a good but delayed reward.    This  study  is  composed a series of experiments  in  which  the  investigator  will  manipulate the costs and  benefits  of  well-  defined  actions.   One experiment will compare  the  cooperative  abilities of three specis of bird, the pinon jay, a highly social  member of the crow group, the bluejay, a non-social member of the  crow  group  ,and the european starling, an unrelated  gregarious  bird.  In  a  parallel study the investigator  will  measure  the  strength  of each species'  preferences for imediate reward.   The  investigator  will then ask whether the species differ  in  their  tendencies   to   cooperation,  and  whether  these   differences  correlate with their  measured preferences  for immediacy.    A  second  experiment  will test a basic  claim  of  mathematical  models  of  altruistic  cooperaion.  Mathematical  modelers  have  argued that the combination of repetition of a 2-by-2 game, and a  strategy   of   \"reciprocal  cooperation\"  can  make   altruistic  cooperation  a good short-term action.   A third experiment  will  test  the  investigator's hypothesis that strong preferences  for  immediacy  explain the observed failure of animals  to  cooperate  altruistically in laboratory situations.",
