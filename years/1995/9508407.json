 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT/Moore           The general objective of this research is to relate seasonal  changes in narrow-band surface reflectance to evapotranspiration in  mid-latitude deciduous forest.  The specific objectives are:       1. To detect seasonal change in surface albedo (reflectance)  in certain important wavebands, and link these changes to canopy  liquid water content,       2. To relate reflectance measurements to surface turbulent  energy fluxes, especially evapotranspiration, through the surface  resistance to water vapor transfer,       3. To compare seasonal changes in narrow-band multispectral  reflectance with satellite broadband reflectance (visible and near-  infrared) in biweekly composites.       4. To use the aerosol optical depths retrieved from the  upward-looking shadowband instrument to calculate atmospheric  corrections for satellite data, according to published schemes.         The overall goal of this study is to improve indirect  measurements of surface energy and trace gas fluxes using surface-  based remote sensing techniques.  The investigator proposes to  study seasonal changes in forest canopy reflectance and its  relationship to surface turbulent energy exchange.  Vegetation  exerts a strong influence on regional climate through control of  the surface fluxes of energy and trace gases, especially  evapotranspiration.  This proposed study is a logical development  form a unique, ongoing long-term measurement program at Harvard  Forest in Massachusetts;  that study has yielded results indicating  that certain seasonal changes in canopy radiative properties (near-  infrared reflectance, thermal response) can be related to  evapotranspiration.  The investigator proposes to complement the  ongoing turbulent energy flux and radiation measurement program at  Harvard Forest with both upward-looking and downward-looking  Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometers.",
