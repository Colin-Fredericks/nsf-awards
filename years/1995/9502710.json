 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary emphasis of this Career Development Plan is   the  coordinated  development  of research and education programs in   high-performance computing  for computational science and  engineering.  Research Plan: The main goals of  high-performance computing are high-performance,    scalability, and portability.  To attain these objectives for modern scientific and   engineering  applications,  new hardware paradigms, new software methodologies, and new   numerical algorithms  are  needed.  Moreover, the interdependencies between   hardware, software,  algorithm, and application have  an essential bearing on   performance,  scalability, and portability and must also be well   understood.  This work is an  inclusive effort to create a substantial, unified base of   understanding about  high-performance computing for scientific and engineering   applications that  can be broadly applied. The  specific objectives of this work   are to: (1) Develop  and analyze high-performance, portable,  computational     kernels and numerical  libraries that are capable of exploiting   modern computing    architectures and  operating systems, such as   symmetric multiprocessors,   operating  systems,  and gigabit networks; (2) Develop and   analyze prototype  object-based and object-oriented   scalable software   libraries for  high-performance computing and  for computational  scientific   and engineering  applications; (3) Develop and analyze new algorithms for   maximizing the  scalability of stationary and time-dependent problems; (4)   Apply the new  algorithms and software  libraries to real,   substantial,   computational science  and engineering   applications.  Education  Plan:  Because of the increasing  importance of computational science and engineering, it is   important  that  computer scientists (and indeed, scientists and engineers in   general) understand  the intricacies  and inter-relationships inherent to   high-performance computing.  A graduate course in numerical  computing has already  been developed and incorporated into   the graduate core  curriculum in the  Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of   Notre Dame.  Building  on this course, new graduate-level  courses in high-performance computing  will continue to be   introduced.  At the  undergraduate level, a senior elective in high-performance    computing is being  introduced, and there will be continued effort to support and   direct undergraduate  research.",
