Developments in these areas permit the planning and execution of large scale scientific programs.  Such programs, in turn, frequently require sophisticated data handling and processing techniques.  In view of the multilateral character of many large scale scientific programs, the handling, processing, and transmission of scientific data has become a major international enterprise in its own right, one that is vital to those scientific programs.  The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) is a non-governmental, multilateral body affiliated with the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The principal objective of CODATA is to facilitate worldwide communication on problems relevant to scientific data.  Like other members of the ICSU family, CODATA is comprised of non-governmental National Member Organizations.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) fulfill s that function in the United States.  This award will provide partial support to the NAS to continue to manage U.S. participation in CODATA, including partial payment of dues to CODATA and partial support of the activities of the U.S. National Committee.  Additional support is also being sought from several other federal agencies:  DOE, NASA, NIH, and NIST.  ***                         ;                                                              Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                             S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       ***                                 Elena R.
