 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509290  Chen  The long range objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the fundamental principles that govern the differential and selective mRNA degradation in mammalian cells. The focus of the research is on the molecular mechanism by which p64, a polyribosome-associated RNA binding protein, participates in the turnover of labile c-fos proto-oncogene mRNA through its interaction with the cognate RNA target, an RNA determinant of instability present in the c-fos protein coding region. In this application four specific aims are proposed: 1. To purify the p64 RNA-binding protein and raise antibodies to it, 2. To clone a full-length cDNA for p64, 3. To determine the RNA binding specificity of the p64 RNA-binding protein, and 4. To characterize the properties and functions of p64. The studies in this application will provide significant insight into general biochemical and molecular principles governing the differential decay of mRNAs in mammalian cells.  %%%  The identification of diverse biological systems in which messengerRNA stability regulates gene expression has demonstrated the importance and generality of this type of control. In mammalian cells, the half-lifes of some mRNAs span several hours or even days, while other mRNAs decay within minutes of their initial synthesis. The molecular mechanisms by which mRNAs are differentially targeted for degradation remain relatively poorly understood. The long range objective of this research is to elucidate the fundamental principles that govern the differential and selective mRNA degradation in mammalian cells which will, in turn, further our understanding of basic mechanisms controlling cell growth and differentiation.  ***",
