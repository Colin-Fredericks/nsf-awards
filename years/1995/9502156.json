 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for network services is growing at an exceptional  rate.  This growing demand requires that the necessary  infrastructure be  developed to facilitate rapid and easy  access to vast, distributed information  stores. The focus of  this research is the essential base technologies required  to  make distributed information systems  generally useful.  Specifically, this  research includes:         high performance file system design and analysis,  rotationally optimal disk scheduling, and         distributed caching data.  The research will result in a high-performance, distributed  information server,  utilizing new file system techniques,  advanced disk scheduling algorithms, and  caching based upon  network topological location (geographical push-caching).  The file system design borrows the essential characteristics  of today's  log-structured and journaling file systems,  combining them with adaptive,  rotationally optimized disk  scheduling techniques. New caching techniques  designed for  scalability enhance the file system's feasibility by  reducing  user-perceived latency for distributed requests.          The teaching component  emphasizes curriculum development for  both computer science concentrators and  non-concentrators  and training programs for undergraduate and graduate  teaching assistants.  For concentrators, the focus on  undergraduate curriculum  complements Harvard's commitment to  the establishment of a strong computer  systems research  group.  Undergraduate courses have been and will continue to  be modified to incorporate the fundamental concepts in an  area, the classic  literature, and research activities. This  combination of class activities is  the cornerstone for  producing undergraduates who can fully participate in  ongoing research projects.  For non-concentrators, the  introductory computer  science sequence has been modified to  emphasize design and problem solving  skills over programming  mechanics.  Future developments will extend this  idea  still  further with the development of an introductory design  course.  The  course is intended to serve both as a common  ground for computer science and  engineering concentrators as  well as a broad introduction for  non-concentrators.          The focus of the graduate curriculum development is  on the  application of the scientific method to systems research.  Students are  asked to critique published work, design  experimental evaluation platforms,  analyze and critique data  sets, and produce quality research.          The last  aspect of the teaching proposal is the development  of teaching assistant  training seminars.  Professor Seltzer  has been working closely with the Derek  Bok Center for  Teaching and Learning, participating in their workshops and  presenting panels and seminars with her teaching assistants.  The orientation  procedure she has developed will be enhanced  so that it will be suitable for  teaching assistants in all  compute science classes, and potentially other  fields.",
