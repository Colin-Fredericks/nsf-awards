 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510063   Miller    Our concepts concerning the stability of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and its role in the global climate systems have been revised dramatically in the past five years, as high-resolution records have been compiled from the sea floor, ice cores, and from deposits around the margin of the former ice sheet.  Collectively, these records document rapid reorganization of oceanic and atmospheric circulation on time scales of a few years to a few decades, and rapid fluctuations of the ice margin that resulted in massive transfers of ice into oceans on time scales of decades to centuries.  The rapid delivery of large volumes of ice from the land to the ocean may have altered thermohaline circulation with subsequent reduction in high-latitude precipitation, effectively coupling the three systems.  The INSTAAR research effort of the last decade has focused on the glacial history at the mouth of Hudson Strait, the most direct connection of the ice sheet to the ocean.  We have provided field evidence for rapid advance and retreat of the ice margin in Hudson Strait (sustained advances in excess of 100 km/century), and for ice movement independent of topography, with major advances sourced in Labrador/Ungava rather than Hudson Bay.  A consequence of these advances was a major flux of icebergs into the Labrador Sea and subsequently the North Atlantic, providing the first direct glacial geologic evidence of a mechanism to produce Heinrich layers observed in the North Atlantic.  In this proposal funding is requested to test three questions: 1) Are observed rapid icestream advances triggered by inherent instabilities at the bed of the LIS, or are they climatically driven? 2) Did an ice stream in Cumberland Sound contribute substantial sediment/meltwater/icebergs to the Labrador Sea.  If so, were fluctuations in phase with the Hudson Strait advances? and 3) Are the reconstructions interpreted from the field evidence compatible with glaciological theory?  We proposed to address these questions  by field observations of the glacial geology at the mouth of Cumberland Sound and by applying a 3-D glaciological model to the Labrador/Baffin region using our field-based boundary conditions.  The Cumberland Sound region should preserve evidence that will clarify the timing and magnitude of a Foxe Basin ice stream, and to the north, provide an independent record of local glacier activity.  Comparing the timing of advances for these ice masses with that in Hudson Strait will indicate whether forcing is primarily climate or ice sheet instability.  Modeling our field-base glacier reconstructions will test whether they are compatible with ice physics and provide additional insights into ice sheet dynamics.",
