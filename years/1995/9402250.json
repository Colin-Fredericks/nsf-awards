The response of these geotechnical  structures to dynamic or seismic loading is not being adequately  addressed in design or in research.  Recognizing the potential  seismic vulnerability of landfills, the 0. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) has established guidelines, effective  October 1993, requiring seismic safety evaluations of all new  landfills.  Hence there is an urgent need for improved  understanding of the earthquake response of geosynthetic/soil  systems used for seepage control in landfills.    This project focuses on the seismic safety of waste containment  and landfills structures.  The objectives are to:    1. Understand the dynamic interface shear behavior of  geosynthetic/geosynthetic and, more importantly,  geosynthetic/soil interfaces.    2. Develop a mathematical model for predicting the dynamic  response of simple geosynthetic/soil systems.    3. Validate the analytical model by using shaking table test  results.    This research program will provide an understanding of the  dynamic response of geosynthetic/soil systems; knowledge that is  essential for a rational evaluation of the seismic safety of a  geotechnical or a geoenvironmental facility that incorporates  geosynthetics, such as a waste containment or a landfill.  ***",
