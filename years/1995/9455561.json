 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three related activity-based introductory physics curricula have  been developed with major support from the US Department of  Education and the National Science Foundation. These are Workshop  Physics, Tools for  Scientific Thinking, and RealTime Physics.  All three curricula use the findings of physics education  research, are activity-based, and have involved the design of  computer hardware and software for investigation, data analysis,  and dynamic modeling. This three-year collaboration between  principal investigatops at Dickinson College, University of  Maryland, University of Oregon, Tufts University, and  Millersville State University will extend, enhance, evaluate and  disseminate activity-based curricular materials, apparatus, and  computer tools for teaching introductory physics based on this  previous work.  The ultimate goals of this program are to  continue full scale efforts to improve the scientific literacy of  introductory physics students through the mastery of physics  concepts, investigative skills, and mathematical modeling  techniques and to motivate students to learn more science.  Throughout the three year period a comprehensive dissemination  program will be conducted to reach introductory physics  instructors at high school and college levels through workshops,  public talks, on-site visits to institutions, and journal  publications. These dissemination efforts will be supported by  the commercial distribution of products through J.C. Wiley &  Sons, PASCO Scientific, Vernier Software, and Physics   Academic Software.  Particular attention will be given to  developing physics activities suitable for courses designed for  future technicians at two year colleges and preteachers.",
