 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510033  Dettman  The Asian Monsoon is one of the largest and most important weather systems on Earth.  The development of a strong monsoon climate has been identified as a possible cause of the expansion of C4   grasslands and an oxygen isotope shift in soil carbonates in Pakistan and Nepal.  This study will examine the development of the modern monsoon, one dominated by the high Tibetan Plateau which today virtually precludes any dry-season precipitation.  The isotopic composition of aragonitic molluscs will be used to reconstruct the seasonal isotopic variation of rivers in the foothills of the Himalayas between 12 and 1 Ma (million years before present). By combining the  18O of micro-sampled weekly or monthly shell growth increments with temperature estimates based on fossil floral  assemblages, the seasonal change  in the  18O of river water can be calculated.  The goal of these measurements is to examine the isotopic composition of river waters on a seasonal basis in order to estimate the aridity of the dry season and the seasonal variability of rainfall.  Strong seasonal aridity is indicated by positive  18O values of surface water in the dry season.  The seasonal amount of precipitation can be roughly estimated because the isotopic composition of rainfall is a function of the amount of rainfall at low latitudes.  Shell carbonates 13C of carbon in the rivers.  This allows changes in the 18O record to be directly related to changes in the plant biomass of the region (C3 versus C4).  Nepal will be the primary focus of this study because of the useful stratigraphic distribution of well preserved molluscs, but some shell beds in Pakistan will also be studied to allow comparison of different regions under the influence of the Asian Monsoon.",
