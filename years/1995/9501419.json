 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501419  Goodrich  In  this project, measurements of Landau quantum oscillations are made  on  high  temperature  superconductors in  both  the  normal  and  the  superconducting mixed states. Both epitaxial films of  yttrium  barium  copper  oxide and bismuth strontium rare-earth copper oxide, and  bulk  single  crystals  of  other superconductors are studied.  The  physics  investigated includes Fermi surface topologies, effective masses,  and  scattering rates for electrons in the normal state; the interaction of  normal  electrons  with  flux vortices in the  mixed  state;  and  the  behavior   of   superconducting   properties   of   high   temperature  superconducting  materials  in  the presence  of  a  strongly  Landau-  quantized  normal-state background. The Fermi surface measurements  in  the  normal state will give values for parameters that are crucial  to  theories of the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials. The  mixed  state  results  will  lead to a much  improved  description  of  electron-electron and electron-flux vortex interactions.  %%%  One of the problems limiting the development of materials that exhibit  truly  high-temperature superconductivity  (above the  temperature  of  liquid  nitrogen, -196 deg C) is that the basic mechanism  responsible  for  high-temperature superconductivity remains unknown.  The  present  work is directed toward gaining information about this mechanism in  a  variety  of  high-temperature superconductors by measuring fundamental  properties of the electrons that participate in superconductivity,  in  both  the super-conducting and normal (resistive) condition. By  using  strong  magnetic fields and measuring the quantized magnetism  of  the  electrons, precise values are obtained for parameters that are crucial  to theories of superconductivity. This information can then be used to  evaluate and test quantitatively these theories.  The measurements are  made  using specialized facilities at the National High Magnetic Field  Labo ratory,  at Louisiana State University, and at Oak Ridge  National  Laboratory.  ***",
