 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520361  Ward     The peace dividend is an attractive, yet, elusive subject.  The  search for security benefits led Israel and Egypt to sign the  Camp David peace agreements in 1979.  In addition to immediate  benefits accruing from the recognition of borders and its right  to exist, Israel should receive longer-term benefits from  decreases in defense spending; as money better invested in other  parts of the economy pays off.  As well, in addition to benefits  accruing from Israel's final withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula,  Egypt may receive similar longer-term benefits, now that it has  agreed on peace with a former enemy.  In the years since the Camp  David agreements, peace, however lukewarm, has been achieved,  major security concerns have been addressed, and Egypt has been  accepted back into the Arab fold, perhaps leading to additional  bilateral peace treaties with Israel.  When do the longer-term  welfare benefits, the peace dividends, become obvious.    Whether one looks at the global, developing countries, or  regional samples, Israel and Egypt have witnessed better than  average growth rates and bigger cuts in defense spending.  Should  these trends have arrived so quickly, or are they part of a  larger time frame which includes earlier years?  There are  clearly connections between peace and economic prosperity in  Israel and Egypt.  This research will uncover and describe these  links, show how they have been achieved, project what the future  holds, and suggest how lessons learned in Israel and Egypt might  be applied in warring dyads elsewhere.  ***",
