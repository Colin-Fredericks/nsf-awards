 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of dynamical systems arising in connection with optimization  problems will be analyzed.  Special attention will be paid to optimization problems with inequality constraints.  Among problems to be considered are: semidefinite programming, nonconvex problems on  polytopes, general nonlinear convex mathematical programming problems, and linear-quadratic control problems with quadratic constraints.  The Hamiltonian structure of corresponding dynamical systems and its relation to the problems of constraint mechanics will be studied. The dependence of qualitative properties of dynamical systems on the choice of barrier functions will also be considered.  Various approaches to the construction of algorithms based on dynamical systems are compared.  New approaches to semidefinite problems, optimization problems in spaces of measures, and infinite-dimensional quadratic problems will be suggested.  As a result of the project, it is expected that substantial progress will be made toward construction of interior-point algorithms for the above mentioned classes of problems. More im portantly, the combination of interior-point techniques and sequential quadratic programming approaches will lead to efficient algorithms for solving broad classes of optimal control problems with both state space and control inequality constraints.  Control theory has numerous applications to practical problems ranging from missile guidance to laser CD tuning.  It is quite natural to expect that the choice of control  strategy is  determined by the available resources and the performance index.  This is the main  paradigm of so-called optimal control theory. Until very recently only few optimal control problems  could be solved in real time. The very fast development of so-called interior-point algorithms  completely changes the situation. It is now quite possible to address optimal control and other  infinite-dimensional problems involving inequality constraints. Robotics (including  motion planning,  dexterous grasping force optimization) and control of quantum processes (important for the development  of new materials) are good examples of problems where such techniques can be used. The exciting aspect  of interior-point algorithms is that their efficiency grows with the size of the problem.  In this  proposal, a program of development interior-point algorithms is suggested which would unable one to  apply this methodology to a broad class of optimal control problems.  Ways are outlined to generalize  interior-point algorithms while keeping their efficiency (measured by complexity estimates).  Dynamical system theory provides an important theoretical tool for the realization of the project. As  a result, it is expected that the efficient interior-point  algorithms suitable for optimal control  applications will be developed.  Complexity  estimates will be obtained fot these algorithms.",
