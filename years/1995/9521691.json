 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521691  Trueb  This research involves resolution of relationships of fossil and Recent frogs in several basal lineages.  In addition, there are several ancient frog fossils that have been discovered recently and that are undescribed. It is probable that these fossils will provide insights on the broader problem of basal frog relationships and biogeographic history. Recent attempts to resolve frog systematics using living taxa have been unsatisfactory and inclusion of data from the fossil record has been thwarted by poor descriptions and lack of coordinated collaborative efforts between neontologists and paleontologists. This project will address this problem and involve the collaborative research efforts of the PI, a South American collaborator and three students.   %%%  The significance of the research on basal frog lineages is that it will provide the framework necessary for unraveling relationships among later diverging frogs and allow a more comprehensive understanding of frog taxonomy, relationships and biogeography.   ***",
