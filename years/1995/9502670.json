 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502670  Erdogan           Glass optical components based on ultraviolet photosensitivity have tremendous technological potential.  In particular, ultraviolet-induced fiber gratings have charged the fields of optical communications and fiber-based sensors.  A significant component of the research proposed here will impact the fiber-granting field.  Novel devices based on asymmetric gratings will be investigated to provide new functionality to fiber-optic systems.  Along the way certain f fundamental fabrication issues that should impact feasibility of manufacturing this technology will be explored.  The research will tackle issues pertaining to sources based on fiber gratings, including hybrid semiconductor-fiber lasers, in which stability of these sources is a limiting problem, and all-fiber grating-based lasers for which polarization problems presently limit applicability.  The intention of the proposed research program is to significantly increase the domestic research effort on this important technology, as the majority or work in this area is currently conducted outside of the U.S.   Another major component of the research program will emphasize translating the technology of glass ultraviolet photosensitivity to non-fiber applications. Certain optical components will be investigated toward this end, including diffractive optics, tailored mirrors, and ultra-narrowband filters.   The education aspect of  the proposed project will be directed both toward teaching and academic enrichment.  Both graduate and undergraduate teaching in the area of optics are planned.  A new graduate-level course is already being developed that covers optoelectronic device technologies.  The course is directed toward graduate students conducting research in this area, an is intended to strengthen more applied research efforts at The Institute of Optics.  A significant portion of the educational effort will be expended  on the improvement of the undergraduate degree program in optics at the University of Rochester.",
