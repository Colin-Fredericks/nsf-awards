 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422208  Hallock  This proposal has four major points of emphasis: (1)  To  continue  nuclear magnetic resonance and  third  sound  studies  of  the  helium3-  helium4 mixture  film  system,  specifically  to study the strong effect on the helium3 of  the  helium4  film thickness with analogy with metal  insulator transitions in 2D electron systems, and to search  for transitions to new superfluid helium3 behavior which  have  been predicted. (2) To continue experiments with  helium films  on  alkali metal surfaces in order to study  wetting  phenomena. (3)  To  study  in  more detail  capillary condensation  and  avalanche phenomena  with  helium in porous materials. (4) To continue  to  study  helium  films patterned substrates in one and two  dimensions.  (5)  To study  linear  and  nonlinear  behavior  of  third  sound  pulses   in collision. The techniques used  will include nuclear magnetic resonance, bolometric and  quartz resonance  and capacitance   measurements.  These  experiments   will develop  our  understanding of the helium  film system and have  impact more widely in Condensed Matter  Physics.  %%%  This  program   will  undertake a fundamental investigations  of  thin films  of  liquid  helium  which form on  surfaces  at  extremely  low temperatures.  These  films, which can be  a  few  atoms  thick,  have remarkable properties and allow  the study of physics in two dimensions which have  implications for physics in other areas of Condensed Matter  Physics. The emphasis will be on studies of mixtures of the  two  types of  helium in which new types of superfluid  behavior will be  searched for.  Analogies  with metal  insulator transitions  will  be  explored. Peculiar  wetting  behavior between helium and certain unusual surfaces will be  investigated. Capillary condensation and other phenomena in  porous materials flooded with helium will be studied. The  program will also  investigate the interaction between  microscopic waves on  helium films and between such waves  and th e surface on which they reside.  ***",
