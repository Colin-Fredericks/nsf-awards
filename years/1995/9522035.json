 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522035  Botez  Phase-locked arrays of antiguided diode lasers (so called ROW arrays) have demonstrated 1-1.5W of diffraction-limited power, the highest coherent powers for all-monolithic oscillators.  However, the devices do not have a single-frequency output, which prevents their  use in many applications.  Furthermore, all the present time, their number of elements is limited to 20 ,which in turn limits the amount of coherent power.     It is proposed here to: 1) develop ROW arrays with a distributed feedback (DFB) built-in structure for longitudinal-mode control; and 2) implement novel concepts for increasing the number of array elements from 20 to 40-80, while maintaining a single spatial mode.  For ROW-DFB arrays the proposed material system is InGaAs/InGaP/GaAs, an A1-free structure that assures defect-free regrowths, high efficiency, reliability, and low linewidth enhancement factor.  As a result 20-element ROW-DFB devices are expected to provide single-frequency, diffraction-limited-beam operation to 1W with linewidths of = 50kHz.    In order to increase the intermodel discrimination, and thus allow for single-spatial mode array operation of devices with more than 20 elements, two novel concepts are proposed: 1) array-(lateral)-mode selection via selective feedback from a buried diffraction grating, and 2) laterally restricted reflector (LRR).  Both concepts rely on the single-frequency nature of ROW-DFB devices.  High-order array modes are discriminated against by preferential feedback.     The devices will be made by using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition for crystal growth; e-beam and/or X-ray lithography and chemical etching for grating fabrications; and e-beam lithography and preferential etching for array pattern generation.  Theoretical analysis and design will be performed employing the matrix formulation for antiquated arrays, the beam propagation method, and the Block-function formalism for 1-D and 2-D finite periodic structures.     ROW-DFB devices are in effect 2-D pho tonic lattices.  Their will shed new light on how such lasers work, and will spur interest in other classes of devices based on  photonic lattices.  The realization of watt-range, single-frequency, diffraction-limited-beam stable sources will have significant impact on parallel optical-signal processing, the generation of blue light via harmonic conversion, the generation of mid-IR coherent light for environmental monitoring, and free-space optical communications.     This research program is strongly coupled to collaborative with optoelectronic research and development groups at various major US companies and laboratories, including AT&T Bell Labs, Uniphase, New Focus, TRW, and David Sarnoff Research Center.  A key feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in this significant area of optoelectronic device research.  ***",
