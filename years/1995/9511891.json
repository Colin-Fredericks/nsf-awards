 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of Optimality Theory (OT) lies in these ideas:       Constraints are universal.       Constraints can be violated.       Grammars are rankings of constraints.       The optimal form from among the set of competing candidates       is grammatical, all non-optimal candidates are       ungrammatical.  An optimal output form for a given input is selected from among  the class of competitors in the following way: A form which, for  every pairwise competition involving it, best satisfies the  highest-ranking constraint on which the competitors conflict, is  \"optimal\".  OT, while originally developed for phonological analysis, is a  general theory of constraint interaction, and several recent  pieces of research suggest that it extends in interesting ways to  the domain of syntax. The research described in this proposal  builds upon this earlier work, and addresses two fundamental  questions concerning syntactic theory which can be addressed  under OT assumptions in ways which differ significantly from  prior approaches.       The first question concerns the relationship between the  syntax of a language and its lexicon. The position is often taken  that the lexicon of a language determines its syntax. Indeed it  has been asserted that all grammatical variation among languages  is reducible to lexical differences. The current project takes a  different line, and aims to show that many grammatically  significant lexical properties of languages (perhaps all?) can be  derived from their grammars, i.e. from the ranking of universal  constraints which constitutes their grammars.       The second question concerns the universality of  constraints, a question that is clearly tied in a central way to  the idea of constraint violability. The core hypothesis of OT is  that every constraint is present in the grammar of every  language. This contrasts sharply with the view that constraints  vary \"parametrically\"; a view in which the form a constraint  takes in one language need not be the same in all. The  project  research focuses strongly on the predictions and problems raised  by this hypothesis about universal grammar",
