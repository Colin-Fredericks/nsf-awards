In particular, we are planning to use the technique  of supergeometry to prove new theorems giving conditions   of exactness of semiclassical approximation. The methods  of quantum field theory will be used to construct invariants   of some geometric structures. Almost all projects are related  to string theory, which is now considered as having a chance to   describe all interactions existing in Nature. We will  try to construct the hypothetical \"universal string theory\"  and reach a deeper understanding of the dimensionality of the space   in string theory, using methods of axiomatic quantum field theory.       Quantum field theory is a subject which overlaps central areas of research  in both mathematics and physics.  In physics it is at the heart of the   attempt to understand the fundamental particles from which all matter is   formed.  In mathematics it is a body of techniques which have wide   applications in areas such as geometry, analysis and probability.   The   underlying goal behind this research is to make progress towards the aim   of uncovering the fundamental theory which unifies the forces of nature.  ***",
