 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Cohen - 9424553    This is a Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award to enable the PIs, working with industrial partners, to extend the knowledge and science base available for the molding of thermosets.  They will perform detailed comparisons between numerical predictions based on computer simulations and molding experiments, including pressure-versus-time traces at various locations in the cavity as obtained with flush-mounted pressure transducers.  They will focus on thermosetting materials of industrial interest which are frequently highly filled.  In addition, recently developed fast-reacting thermosets commercially available for the plastic packaging of microelectronics devices will also be investigated.  A large fraction of the work will be devoted to the kinetic, rheological, and thermal characterization of the materials in order to determine the critical parameters that govern the moldability of a thermosetting compound.  The numerical-simulation work will elucidate the physics of the process and will allow for the optimization of process conditions.    The project involves Motorola, The Ford Motor Company, and Advanced CAE Technology.  Motorola technical staff will perform instrumented spiral-flow experiments in a manufacturing transfer-molding machine using specialty epoxies developed for encapsulation.  Ford's engineers will perform controlled injection molding of bumpers and instrument panels using a variety of thermosets such as polyesters, phenolics and ureas.  The results will be compared with numerical simulations.  Advanced CAE Technology will collaborate with Cornell on several aspects of the characterization of the materials.",
