 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310693  Caron         Pico-sized organisms (organisms 0.2 - 2.0um) constitute  a very significant portion of the production and living  biomass of oceanic plankton communities.  Primary production  by photosynthetic microorganisms in these size classes  (cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes, some small eukaryotic  algae) are major contributors to total primary production in  the plankton.  Likewise, recent evidence suggests that  bacteria may be the largest single repository of living  biomass in many pelagic ecosystems.  Collectively, the  activities and fates of these assemblages strongly influence  the flow of energy and biologically reactive elements in the  ocean.  Because these assemblages are generally smaller than  the particles captured efficiently by metazoan zooplankton,  the repackaging of these microorganisms into larger  consumers is a fundamental step for their incorporation into  pelagic food webs.  Protistan consumers in the nanoplankton  size range (largely flagellated protozoa ~20 um in size)  play a pivotal role in plankton communities as the primary  consumers of picoplankton assemblages (both bacteria and  phototrophs).  Yet, there is still little information on the  rates of consumption of bacteria and small phytoplankton in  oceanic environments, or on the growth and production rates  of protistan consumers.  As a part of the U.S. Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study in the Arabian Sea, Dr. Caron will perform  experiments to investigate the grazing rates and production  of nanoplanktonic consumers from the surface waters and O2  minimum layer of this oceanic environment.  The overall goal  in this work is to quantify carbon flow through the first  trophic interaction in the microbial plankton.",
