The award will  provide participant costs for   eight U.S. graduate students at the `Advanced Research Workshop on the   Preparation of Nanoparticles in Solution and in Solids` to be held in   Szeged, Hungary, March 8-13, 1996. Participation will be by competitive   application and each successful applicant will present a poster talk on   his or her research in nanostructures or nanoparticles. Proceedings of   the Workshop will be published.  Nanostructures and  nanoparticles find application in a variety of   advanced materials, including electronic, optical, magnetic and   biomolecular materials. This Workshop will bring together and integrate   existing solid-state, physical and wet colloid-chemical methodologies, as   well as lay the foundation for future synergistic endeavors among   chemists, physicists and biologists.",
