 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems with only partial or contaminated information   arise in  many disciplines: computer science, physics and chemistry,    control theory,  statistics, prediction and estimation, scientific  and   engineering computation,  geophysics, decision theory, and  finance.  Furthermore, this   information is  often expensive to  obtain.  The goal of information-based   complexity is to  create a  computational complexity theory for problems with   partial,  contaminated, and priced information, and to apply the   results to  solving  specific problems in varied disciplines.  The prime foci  of   this project are  the following:    (1) Breaking Intractability:  Many problems   in science,  engineering,  and even finance, deal with functions that have   a large number,  d, of variables.  However, typical multivariate problems are    intractable in the  worst case deterministic setting.  The only  way to break   intractability is to  weaken the assurance by  switching to another setting.    Randomized, average  case, and  probabilistic settings continue to be studied.  In    particular,  it has been proven that multivariate integration and    approximation are both  strongly tractable on the average.  The  proof is non-  constructive; the problem  of how to sample in d  dimensions to achieve strong   tractability is being addressed.   (2) Software Development and Testing:  Theoretical   investigations  have  led to algorithms for important problems such as high    dimensional integration.  To make these methods widely available,  software is being   developed and tested.  Since these methods  contain a large amount of inherent   parallelism, the  implementation is being done on a workstation network.    Testing  is also planned  on parallel computers.  Real-world  problems are used for   testing.  (3) Probabilistic Complexity of Piece-Wise Smooth Functions:    Piece-wise smooth  functions arise in diverse areas of science and  technology   such as computer  vision, image and signal processing,  scientific computation,   meteorology,  seismology, and to mography.  Because of negative results of   the worst-case  setting these  problems are being studied in the   probabilistic setting.  New  algorithms for integration, approximation, and detection of    singular points  are being studied and implemented.",
