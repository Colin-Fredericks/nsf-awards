 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project modifies the existing biochemistry laboratory with  the improvement and addition of experiments in enzymology that  provide students with a laboratory experience similar to one they  might experience in a research environment.   The addition of two  instruments, a kinetic plate reader and a UV-visible  spectrophotometer, to the biochemistry laboratory is allowing the  students to perform three complete enzyme isolations in which  they can collect kinetic and protein concentration data rapidly  at every step to determine the extent of purification.   They can  also determine the kinetic properties of three different enzymes  using rapid analytical techniques so they can collect a  significant amount of useful data and also have time to adjust  experimental conditions and to correct mistakes.   In particular,  the addition of the kinetic plate reader provides the means to  use a unique two-dimensional method of enzyme and protein  analysis in the teaching laboratory.   This new two-dimensional  method not only greatly decreases time required for data  collection but also provides rapid and clear visualization of  experimental results.    The time savings provides the additional  advantage of having the instructor available to help the students  with data interpretation prior to leaving laboratory.   This  equipment enables the students to perform a number of meaningful  experiments so that they can become acquainted with the  techniques and use of modern, computer controlled  instrumentation.",
