 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525803  Franks  This project will investigate how spatial and temporal  variability in physical-biological features affects the  development, condition and survival of Antarctic krill larvae  (Euphausia superba).  It is believed that adult spawning behavior  and regional differences in primary productivity and temperature  are significant forces controlling krill mortality, population  demography and recruitment.  Using a modified stage-structured  larval population model, the effects of spawning behavior and  variations in stage durations and mortalities on demography and  recruitment will be examined.  The model results will be compared  with observed larval distributions to determine which processes  best account for the observed population structures.    Using a detailed metabolic model with stage structure and  realistic external forcing, we will determine how much of the  variability in stage durations and mortalities can be explained  by the effects of food availability and temperature.  Larval  lipid metabolism will be incorporated into the model for  elucidating the influences of physical and biological variability  on larval krill condition.  Models will integrate the effects of  multiple parameters and will intimately coupled to field  observations and laboratory experiments.  This study will  provided a valuable contribution to the understanding of  interactions between marine populations and physical processes in  the Southern Ocean ecosystem.    The results from this study will be applicable to concurrent  research investigating the physical-biological interactions  affecting Euphausia superba in the Southern Ocean, and Euphausia  pacifica in the California current.  The ultimate intent is to  quantify the impact of physical-biological patchiness associated  with physical features and phenomena on larval condition,  demography and recruitment in euphausiid populations.   Understanding species' responses to physical perturbations will  elucidate how environments have evolutionarily  constrained life-  history patterns to maximize survival in inherently patchy and  variable systems.  Through this understanding, this study will  provide insights into the potential effects of climatic change on  euphausiid populations and their ecosystems.",
