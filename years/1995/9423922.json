The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA), which is  composed of the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), East Tennessee  State University (ETSU), Florida International University (FIU), the  University of Georgia (UGA), and Valdosta State University (VSU), has  an emphasis on undergraduate education and on one-on-one student  involvement in faculty research projects.  SARA is a cohesive and  collegial consortium which spans the geography and culture of the  southeastern United States.    The SARA Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site emphasis  will be on the preparation of students for careers in science and  engineering through active interaction with faculty professionals who  have a shared vision about the importance of independent undergraduate  student research.  The range of research projects available within the  SARA REU Site program spans observational, theoreticaL and instrumental  areas of astronomy.  Each of the faculty who is involved in this  project has previously demonstrated a high interest in undergraduate  student research activities.    SARA's primary astronomy facility, and current focal point for research  activity, is a 0.9-meter telescope located at the Kitt Peak National  Observatory (KPNO).  Each of the participating SARA institutions has a  substantial array of additional instructional astronomy equipment,  facilities, and instructional expertise which will be available for the  students.  The REU Site program will serve to further develop astronomy  education and research within the southeastern United States.   Participating students will come into contact with the broad  educational and research resources of the five SARA institutions.  Each  of the SARA institutions has a recruiting policy which strongly  encourages minority applicants, gender  equality, and student diversity.",
