 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RPG in the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor Brazdil of John   Carroll University will address the dynamics of aromatic iodination   reactions. This is a new variation on the traditional methodology which   is both more efficient and more environmentally friendly in that it   generates less toxic waste. The mechanism for this new process is unknown   and the PI plans to bring as many modern techniques as possible to bear   on the problem of understanding the pathway. If successful, the   methdology that the PI establishes may well be applicable to other   electrophilic reactions.  Electophilic substitution of iodine for hydrogen on an aromatic nucleus   is an important step in the synthesis of organic compounds which are of   interest and use in the medical field. Iodination is the preferred   pathway as chlorination and bromination are more harsh which results in   degradation of substrate. This study will help understand the reaction   parameters which govern the efficiency of the process. Thus, this   investigation should provide scientists with the knowledge to use the   procedure more efficiently and in doing so, reduce the amount of toxic   waste products.",
