 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9510099       This effort is directed to the understanding and design of  novel photoluminescent chemical sensors based upon adsorption onto a compound semiconductor surface.  Previous work has established the feasibility of this approach.  Changes in the near-surface region of  the semiconductor due to reversible chemisorption form the basis of the sensor;  modulation of the depletion width of  the surface region of the semiconductor leads to changes in the photoluminescence intensity observed from these structures.  The thrust of this project is concerned with sensing materials and materials structures with high sensitivity and high detectivity.  The use of modern epitaxial  techniques such as metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) allows production of engineered materials structures tailored to enhance the response of the semiconductor to the specific adsorbed species.  New chemical approaches to sensing a wide variety of technologically important substrates, including silanes and group III and group V CVD precursors, are explored.  New sensing devices in which electron transport as well as photoluminescence is used as the sensor signal are developed and modeled.  Causes of long-term degradation of the sensor structures and means to inhibit such changes are also explored.    New approaches to sensor design and implementation are badly needed; in some cases, such as semiconductor processing, sensors may be the limiting factor in improving quality and advancing design implementation.  This effort applies semiconductor device technology to the production of small, inexpensive, robust sensors without mechanical components.  The specific systems under study are applicable to the production of compound semiconductors and solid-state devices.  The basic approach has a much broader applicability.  ***",
