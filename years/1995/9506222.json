 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological rhythms are an important way in which living organisms interact with the environment, and a variety of mechanisms have been found for \"biological clocks.\"  This conference is the first major conference in many years to provide a comprehensive overview of chronobiology, the study of the mechanisms underlying daily (circadian) and other cyclically timed functions and behavior of living organisms.  Speakers represent a full range of approaches from molecular biology and genetics of invertebrates and bacteria to comparative physiology and human behavior.  Diversity of chronobiological systems is a central theme, as the conference evaluates the current status of the field and directions for the future.  The conference organizers have encouraged participation by men and women who are from several nations and different kinds of institutions, representing a range of research opportunities for the attending younger investigators and students.  The final publication will be a lasting reference source as well as an authoritative overview on the current knowledge about biological clocks.  The book along with the interactions at the conference will have a significant impact on the field.  Results are likely to extend beyond simply biological rhythms, to sensory neuroscience, sensorimotor control, neuroendocrine and behavior studies in general.  Results also are likely to have an impact on improving areas of human performance in the workplace where features such as shift-work can affect daily rhythms.",
