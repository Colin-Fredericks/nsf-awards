 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512275  Plummer    A low energy, high resolution photoemission beam line will be  developed at the synchrotron at the Center for Advanced  Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) of Louisiana State University.  This is a joint effort of scientists and educators from the  University of Michigan, the University of Nebraska, the  University of Texas, Southern University, the University of  Tennessee, and Louisiana State University.  The high momentum and  energy resolution will be utilized to uncover new physical and  chemical phenomena at the surface or in thin films, such as the  existence of charge density wave distortions at the surface,  Fermi surface instabilities, and metal-nonmetal transitions in  thin films.  The low photon energy will be used to investigate  the development of collective excitations in thin films and to  probe the bulk properties of correlated electron systems  containing transition elements or rare earths.  The high momentum  resolution will facilitate dispersion measurements for molecular  solids and reconstructed semiconductor surfaces.  The low photon  energy variable wavelength capabilities are essential for  investigating molecular photochemical processes.  %%%  Synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission is the only  experimental technique capable of directly mapping the energy  bands of a solid over an extended energy range.  The challenge  and the opportunity for the future is to push the energy  resolution of angle-resolved photoemission to limits where the  energies involved are significantly less than thermal energies.  The experience of this group of researchers in the design of  synchrotron radiation analysis instrumentation can lead to  significant improvements over existing high-resolution beam  lines.  ***",
