 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  950323  Long    The Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Laser Diagnostics in Combustion has been held biennially since 1981.  The 1995 meeting will be held in July, 1995 at Plymouth State College in New Hampshire.  The purpose of this conference is to examine closely and to discuss freely the chemical and physical foundations of the various laser diagnostic techniques, including issues such as quenching, energy transfer, quantitative species concentration measurements, line spacings, line shapes, widths and convolutions, and measurement biases.  New themes of the 1995 Gordon Conference will include laser diagnostics of resonant wave-mixing techniques, the interaction between modeling of chemical flame structure and laser diagnostics, and the metrology of particle diagnostics.  The emphasis of the conference is directed toward the science of the measurement approaches, not upon the meaning of the measurements to combustion per se.  The invited speakers and discussion leaders include both researchers specializing in the development and application of laser diagnostics in combustion as well as investigators from basic areas not directly involved in laser diagnostics.    The major products of this conference will be the exchange of information between researchers on the cutting edge of this technology area, hopefully leading to synergism which will result in further advances, and a final report which will summarize the activities of the conference.",
