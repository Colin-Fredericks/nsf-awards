For example, they are directly involved in kinase involved in  kinase reactions, they participate in dehydrogenase reactions as  part of the coenzyme molecule, they function as regulators of many  allosteric enzymes, they are involved (through the effects  of cyclic AMP) in the action of several hormones, and they  contribute to the aggregation of platelets. The aim of this study  is to develop the tools which will allow a systematic exploration  of the amino acid residues in the nucleotide sites of proteins. The  general approach of affinity labeling will be used based on  reagents previously synthesized in this laboratory as well as on  new reagents which incorporate, at various positions of the purine  or ribose ring alkylating agents capable of reacting covalently  with the protein; the nucleotide moiety will thus provide the  specificity for chemical modification of the proteins within the  binding sites. The effects of these nucleotide alkylating agents on  adenylosuccinate synthetase, as well as on adenylosuccinate lyase,  will be examined. Further, the reactions of cAMP derivatives with  platelet cAMP phosphodiesterases will be explored. The aggregation  of blood platelets is induced by ADP, presumably by binding to  receptor sites on the platelet surface membrane. Affinity labeling  with the purine nucleotide analogues will be used to characterize  the ADP receptor protein of platelet membranes.  For each protein, the kinetics of the affinity labeling reaction  will be examined, the extent of reagent incorporation will be  determined and radioactive peptides will be isolated from  proteolytic digests of labeled enzyme to identify the modified  residue. The catalytic and ligand binding properties as well as  the conformational characteristics of the modified enzyme will be  evaluated. The first class of nucleotide analogues which we  described, the fluorosulfonylbenzoyl nucleosides, has already been  used  to react at specific sites of more than 50 proteins; it is  likely that the newer compounds which we develop will similarly  have broad applicability in the labeling of nucleotide sites  in proteins and that these studies will serve as prototypes for the  use of these compounds to probe other enzymes. In addition, these  nucleotide analogues will have applications in the biotechnology  industry where they can be used to detect expression of cloned  nucleotide binding proteins, and to provide the knowledge base for  rational design of drugs functioning as specific inhibitors  targeted to particular nucleotide-requiring enzymes.  %%%  Nucleotides have a multifunctional role in cellular metabolism.   For example, nucleotides participate directly in numerous enzymatic  reactions, they function as activatos or inhibitors of many  regulatory enzymes, and the\"second messenger\" cyclic AMP carries  out the action of several hormones.  The aim of this study is to  develop the tools which will allow a systematic exploration of the  region of an enzyme which binds nucleotides.  The general approach  of \"affinity labeling\" will be used in which we attach to a natural  nucleotide a reactive portion (called an alkylating agent) which is  capable of forming a permanent link to a protein.  The nucleotide  moiety of the new reagent will direct the compound to a specific  binding site on the protein, and the reactive portion will make the  binding irreversible so that the binding site can be isolated and  characterized.  We will now study the effects of these nucleotide  alkylating agents ontwo enzymes ctitical for purine nucleotide  biiosynthesis and on an enzyme important in the degradation of the  regulatory nucleotide cyclic AMP.  The first class of nucleotide  analogues which we described, the fluorosulfonylbenzoyl  nucleosides, has aleady been used to react at specific sites of  more than 50 proteins; it is likely that the newer compounds which  we develop will similarly have b road applicability in the lab eling  of nucleotide sites in proteins and that these studies will serve  as prototypes for the use of these compounds to probe other  enzymes.
