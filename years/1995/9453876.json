 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453876    \"Algebra by Design\"  is a three year project in which researchers  and teachers will create design activities for middle school  students introducing them to functions and algebraic thinking.   Researchers will study students engaged in open-ended design  challenges requiring them to use their creativity to build  structures, design devices and create vidual displays form the  fields of mechanical engineering,physics, art geometry and  environmental sciences.  these design challenges will present  middle school students with a problem, a purpose, constraints,  materials and means of evaluation.  Interactive technological tools  such as function Probe, Shape Shifter, Macmotion, Interactive  Physics and Geometer's Sketchpad will be available for students to  analyze their projects.  Review panels of peers and experts will  provide feedback on the projects.  projects will be selected for  their appeal to success in assisting students in learning to work  effectively in algebra.  Small group interactions among groups of  students and teachers will be studied first as researchers find  ways to bridge from design activities to algebraic thinking and  back.  A set of selected projects will then be used in a year long  teaching experiment in a combined technology and algebra class with  heterogeneous grouping.  Research will be conducted on effective  policies for implementing reform, necessary teacher development and  improving student outcomes.",
