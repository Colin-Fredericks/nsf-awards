It has long been recognized that chromatin fibers can exist at varying levels of compaction and that the level has a controlling influence on gene expression.  In the last few years, evidence has accumulated that chromatin is organized into topologically constrained domains that are transcriptionally inert or transcriptionally active.  The domains consist of loops which are attached at their bases to a proteinaceous nuclear scaffold or matrix by DNA sequences called Scaffold Attachment Regions (SARs).  When cloned strong SARs from tobacco are used to flank a reporter gene construct, the SARs cause a 70-fold increase in expression of the reporter gene.  What causes this increase?  One hypothesis is that the flanking SARs allow the incorporated DNA to form its own independent loop domain--a domain free from the influence of the domain into which it was incorporated.  What then determines if such an artificial domain has an active chromatin structure?  The principal investigator will investigate these questions and related phenomena.  He will isolate a number of plant SARs and characterize and scaffold binding properties.  This will allow him to investigate what determines if a DNA sequence will bind to the nuclear scaffold.  His preliminary work has resulted in the discovery of a number of tobacco SARs with varying affinities for the nuclear scaffold.  These SARs will be used to test the hypothesis that SARs with greater affinity for the nuclear scaffold have a greater effect on transcription.  He will also isolate and characterize the specific proteins of the scaffold that are responsible for the binding.  He will investigate properties of the loop domains that may have an effect on the transcriptional activity of the domain.  These experiments are expected to yield valuable information about the chromatin structure of loop domains in plants and to have a practical applicati on in the control of gene expression in transgenic plants.  %%%  In eukaryotic organisms, DNA is organized into a complex nucleic acid-protein structure called chromatin.  IN the last few years, evidence has accumulated that chromatin is organized into loops or domains that vary in their degree of genetic expression.  The loops are attached at their bases to a proteinaceous nuclear scaffold by DNA sequences called Scaffold Attachment Regions (SAR's).  The investigator on this project will attempt to determine the defining characteristics of SAR's and the effects of various features of the SAR's on the degree of expression of the genes within their loops.  These experiments will be carried out in plants and are expected to broaden our understanding of basic plant genetics and to have a practical application in the control of gene expression in transgenic plants.  ***",
