Shyamasundar, Theoretical Computer Science  Group, Tata Institute  of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay, India.   The focus of this  project is the study and analysis of logic  programs with emphasis  on termination of sequential and concurrent  programs.  The  initial theoretical investigations will  concentrate on proving  termination of a logic program for a query,  developing semantic-  preserving transformations to improve  efficiency of logic  programs, and identifying conditions under  which the occur-check  can be omitted in a logic programming language  interpreter.   Software tools will be developed to implement  theoretical results  and are expected to promote the design of  elegant and efficient  logic programs.   Scope:  The P.I.s are well-known senior  scientists with  complimentary research interests.  Kapur and  his group are  accomplished in the area of automated deduction  and term  rewriting systems and have developed an  extremely powerful  theorem prover, Rewrite Rule Laboratory.   Shyamasundar is well-  known for his research in theoretical computer  science,  particularly in the area of logic programming  and semantics of  real-time and concurrent programming.  Computer  science is an  area of exceptional strength in India and many  mutual benefits can be expected to result from  this collaboration.    ***",
