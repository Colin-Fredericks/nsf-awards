Three proteins  are involved in this system, MADH, amicyanin and cytochrome c551i.   MADH is an H2L2 dimer of 124 kDa and contains the unusual cofactor  tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ).  Amicyanin is a blue copper  protein of 12.5 kDa which interacts specifically with MADH.   Cytochrome c551i is a 17.5 kDa protein which can accept electrons  from amicyanin and transfer them via another cytochrome to a  terminal oxidase.  The structures of MADH, amicyanin, the binary  complex of MADH with amicyanin and the ternary complex of MADH,  amicyanin and cytochrome c551i have been determined.  Refinement of  the present complexes will be extended to higher resolution by  cryo-cooling and use of synchrotron radiation.  Mutants of  amicyanin will be studied both alone and in the complexes.  Studies  of MADH and its electron transfer complexes will also be carried  out after reaction with substrates and inhibitors and in different  redox states.  The structure of MADH from Methylophilus W3A1, which  uses a cytochrome rather than amicyanin as the primary electron  acceptor, will be completed and compared with the Paracoccus  enzyme.  Finally, attempts will be made to co-crystallize the W3A1  enzyme with a cytochrome electron acceptor from the same organism.  %%%  Electron transfer is fundamental to many biological processes, but  is difficult to study structurally since the components are usually  insoluble and cannot be crystallized.  The proposed studies of the  MADH enzyme system will provide valuable information about this  process.  The interaction of the three components of this soluble  electron transport system define molecular features important for  recognition and control of electron transfer and define likely  pathways for electron flow.  The proposed mutational and ligand-  induced perturbati ons of the system will further probe this complex  precess.  In addition, the molecular details of substrate oxidation  by the TTQ cofactor will shed light on how this cofactor functions  in vivo and how it differs from other, more common redox cofactors.  TTQ is unusual because it is obtained directly from the fusion of  two amino acid side chains coded by genomic DNA rather than from a  separate biosynthetic pathway.  The MADH system is well suited to  provide an understanding of these important processes at the  molecular level.  ***",
