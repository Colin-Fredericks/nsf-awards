 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supported by the Inorganic Bioinorganic and Organometallic  Chemistry Program will support the continuation of studies of transition  metal, homogeneous catalysis by Professor A. Sen of the Pennsylvania   State  University.  Professor Sen will perform in-depth investigations of two   new  catalytic systems that offer promise for selective, metal catalyzed,  oxidative functionalization of organic molecules.  The first of these  systems is the platinum(II) mediated hydroxylation of remote C-H bonds in  certain functionalized organic compounds.  The second is the rhodium  catalyzed hydroxylation and hydroxycarbonylation of C-H and C-C bonds of  alkanes, including methane and ethane, using molecular oxygen as the  oxidant.  The catalyst precursors contain no oxidizable ligands so that  there is the possibility that catalyst degradation will not occur.  To be  addressed in both cases are the structure and reactivity of the  organometallic intermediates, the nature of the C-H (C-C) activation   step,  and the mechanistic origins of the observed selectivities.  This research is concerned with the development of homogeneous catalysts  based upon transition metals that may allow for the selective  functionalization of saturated hydrocarbons.   Homogeneously catalyzed  reactions typically offer much greater selectivity than heterogeneous  reactions, when they can be used.  However, only the latter types of  catalysts are used industrially to promote reactions of saturated  hydrocarbons because known homogeneous catalysts normally are not  sufficiently reactive, if they even react.  The initial discoveries upon  which this research is based suggest that homogeneous catalysts may  ultimately be used for the selective functionalization of such molecules.   If the catalytic activities are great enough, there is a high   probability  that commercially viable processes will result.",
