 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development of highly selective and sensitive fiber optic  biosensors that employ genetically designed bacteria as the sensing  element.  During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant,  Professor Daunert and her students at the University of Kentucky  will develop recombinant bacteria that luminesce in the presence of  toxic heavy metals such as chromium, arsenic, and nickel,  incorporate these bacteria as the active elements in fiber optic  sensors, and optimize the resulting devices.  Specific targets  include (a) coupling the mechanism of resistance of bacteria to  chromate, arsenic, or nickel with the luciferase bioluminescence  system; (b) preparing bacterial systems that will bioluminesce in  the presence of the targeted metal; and (c) developing biosensors  using these engineered bacteria and validating their performance  with real samples.  Also during this grant period, Professor  Daunert will pursue an educational development plan that includes  broad involvement of undergraduates in research, increased public  appreciation of chemistry, and the attraction, mentoring, and  retention of undergraduate students from underrepresented  demographic groups.    The development of more rapid and accurate techniques for  monitoring low-level concentrations of toxic chemicals is important  to progress in environmental protection.  By combining the tools of  modern molecular biology with fiber optic sensor technology, this  CAREER research project should lead to new highly selective and  sensitive probes for low concentrations of toxic heavy metals.  The  educational aspects of this CAREER project will expand the role of  research in the training of undergraduates at the University of  Kentucky and should increase the participation of women and  underrepresented minorities in science at that institution.",
