 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the construction of a data base of the cross cultural results of placebo studies of medicinal and surgical treatments of diseases.  There are tantalizing hints of consistent cultural differences in the strength of placebos (inert substances used  in place of  pharmacologically active substances in the treatment of disease).  The proposal demonstrates that in Germany, for example, placebo studies show far higher rates of effectiveness than in other similar European countries.  The project involves a professor of Cultural anthropology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn who will construct a data-base of such studies to analyze the cross cultural differences, and attempt to derive hypotheses about the cultural influences on placebo effectiveness from this information.     This information will be important because the treatment of illness has always had two aspects: the physical-pharmacological and the social-cultural-emotional.  US culture over-values the former and tends to ignore the latter, yet the goal of relieving illness symptoms and improving health status requires both.  This project is a first step towards a potentially significant advance in our understanding of why people react differently to medical treatment.",
