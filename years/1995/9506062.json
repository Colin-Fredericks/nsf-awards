Fieldwork (November 1995 through October 1996) will involve primary ethnographic data  collection in two villages in Ghana's Central Region, via a survey of 100 women of varying  family and socio-economic backgrounds, involved in two different entrepreneurial activities,  as well as participant observation in women's associations and life-history development for  ten women.  The ethnographic research will be complemented by archival data gathering and  interviews with development-project administrators.  The project's potential theoretical and  practical contributions lie in its focus on the role of women outside the household and the  role of women in development activities that rely on social networks.",
