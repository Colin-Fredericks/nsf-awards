 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411504  Herman    This research is concemed with the development of optical  diagnostic techniques for obtaining a detailed view of the  chemistry that occurs on and near the surface during thin  film processing. These in situ techniques are used to  identify the chemical steps in representative materials  processes, specifically plasma-assisted chemical etching. The  proposed work consist of two related phases. The first is the  development and use of laser-induced thermal desorption  (LITD) to study the steady-state surface layer that is formed  during etching in a high charge density plasma, specifically  an ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) plasma. The chemistry  of the formation and desorption of this layer, which is often  only a monolayer thick, is key to understanding the etching  process. Plasma-induced optical emission and laser induced  fluorescence (LIF) will be used to examine the desorbed  products. Laser-induced thermal desorption and other optical  probes will be used to investigate the ECR etching of  important prototype alloy materials in real time. The second  phase of the proposed investigation is the development of  high-spatial resolution optical probes of pattemed thin film  processing, such as the etching of films with a pattemed mask  on the surface. Understanding the details of the chemistry  that occurs on and immediately above the surface of the  exposed film and mask, and near the sidewalls of the mask, is  complex. The proposed approach is to probe the gas near the  surface with LIF and the surface itself wih Raman microprobe  spectroscopy, at times simultaneously, both with 1 micron  lateral resolution. This will be done in situ and usually in  real-time.  %%%  The processing of materials often depends critically on the  chemistry that occurs on and near the surface. This is true  for applications in microelectronics and optoelectronics,  which includes patterned etching and the atomic  layer-controlled growth of heterostructures, monolayers and  films, in nanoma nufacturing, and in the manufacture of  optical films and protective coatings.  However, a  fundamental understanding of the chemical steps that occur is  often lacking in such materials processing. This occurs, in  part, because of the complex nature of the processes which  may include the interplay between events on the surface and  in the overlying gas phase, and, in part, because of a lack  of diagnostics to identify species and to measure their  concentrations with sufficient spatial resolution. The linked  goals of this proposal are to develop in situ, real time  optical diagnostics that are necessary to obtain a detailed  view of these chemical processes, and to use them to identify  the chemical steps involved in the processes of several key,  yet representative, materials processes.",
