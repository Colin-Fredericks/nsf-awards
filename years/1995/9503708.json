This processing  extension will permit regrowth of modulation-doping,  contacting and isolating layers on patterned  heterostructures prepared with in-situ etched and clearned  regrowth surfaces.  The processing extension will have the  following capabilities:  low-damage electron-cyclotron  resonance (ECR) plasma reactive ion etching of III-V  semiconductors; ECR hydrogen plasma cleaning of etched  substrates; surface cleanliness monitoring by Auger  spectroscopy; and invacuum transfer of patterned substrates  into the MBE growth chamber.  The properties of strained and  unstained uniform quantum wires fabricated by etching  through quantum wells and regrowth with modulation-doping  layers on the sidewalls will be studied.  A heavily-doped  gate electrode layer in the regrowth sequence will permit  carrier density modulation in these wires independent of the  confining potentials determined by the original  heterostructure.  Analogously, by pregrowing the appropriate  barrier potentials, gated 2-dimensional tunneling structures  and superlattices in III-V heterostructures will be  fabricated and their transport and optical properties will  be investigated down to the quantum dot limit.    %  This equipment will be used by a group of investigators  having complimentary expertise ranging from semiconductor  epitaxial growth to nanofabrication and fro transport and  optical characterization to device physics and engineering.  It represents fundamental materials research important for  understanding processing of semiconductor materials, and is  ultimately relevant for manufacturing.",
