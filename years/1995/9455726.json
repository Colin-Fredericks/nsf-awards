 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Northwest Environmental Studies Program (PNESP) is an  undergraduate curricular collaboration among four Pacific  Northwest higher education institutions. The program addresses  the need to prepare students to enter one of the region's  principal growth industries, environmental technology. This  academic partnership allows the participating schools to pool  their resources, field work opportunities and expertise to  deliver a fully-transferable two-year curriculum in more depth  and with broader scope than is possible without the  collaboration.  The curriculum development process includes both  academic year meetings and summer faculty development programs  that engages faculty from all participating campuses and involves  professionals from the environmental industry.  Thus, the program  fosters the concept of an environmental teaching, learning, and  service community among the faculty, students and industry  professionals.  The PNESP opens an avenue of seamless transition  for students from precollege programs to upper division  coursework.  The PNESP core courses also serve to prepare  students to enter teacher education programs that are aligned  with Oregon's K-12 Natural Resource Systems Certificate of  Advanced Mastery.  The PNESP curriculum of introductory courses  and field experiences will become the core element in  environmental baccalaureate, associate and certificate degree  programs encompassing science, policy, technology, and  engineering on the participating campuses.",
