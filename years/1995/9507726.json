This fellowship will make it possible for Dr. Cable to  collaborate with Prof. Yutaka Uchida of the Science University of  Tokyo and the University of Tokyo.   They will use three  dimensional magnetohydrodynamic computer modeling to test  alternative theories of the origins of solar flares.  New  theories of flare origin are needed because many of the  traditional ideas in this field have met with serious, perhaps  insurmountable, difficulties in light of the data from the  Japanese \"Yohkoh\" satellite.    This project fulfills the Program's objective of exchange of  scientific knowledge through international collaboration.  As a  postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Cable will be able to familiarize  himself with the Yohkoh data (unquestionably the best data on  solar flares available to date)  and with new theories regarding solar flares developed by the  Yohkoh research staff.  He will also contribute to the  development and testing of these theories.  ***",
