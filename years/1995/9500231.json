 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500231  Kertzman    Gamma ray astronomy encompasses a very broad range of energies, from a  few MeV to over one hundred TeV.  Currently, the critical energy region  from 20 GeV to 200 GeV is inaccessible to observation.  At lower  energies, gamma rays are observed with satellite borne detectors.  At  higher energies ground based detectors indirectly observe gamma rays,  from astrophysical sources, by detecting the Cherenkov light emitted  from the electromagnetic cascade which results from the passage of a  gamma ray through the Earth's atmosphere.  Satellite borne detectors  observe an abundance of sources up to approximately 20 GeV.   Groundbased detectors, with energy thresholds of 200 GeV see very few  gamma ray sources.  The intermediate region is therefore of extreme  interest, and the goal of the next generation of ground based air  Cherenkov detectors is to lower the energy threshold into this region.  Essential to the process of designing a low energy threshold air  Cherenkov detector is the ability to model the detectors sensitivity to  gamma ray induced air showers.  The KASCADE simulation system is a  series of computer programs developed to model air Cherenkov detector  systems.  The KASCADE system simulates the air showers due to both  incident gamma rays and incident protons, generates a model of the  associated Cherenkov light, and tests the response of a specific  telescope design to these air showers.  The system can be used to study  the energy threshold, flux sensitivity, and gamma ray versus proton  discrimination power, of a telescope.    The long term goal of the research program is to develop a design for a  low energy threshold air Cherenkov detector.  The research program will  also make improvements to the KASCADE system, including developing a  more \"user friendly\" form of the system to distribute to interested  users, undertake several small scale studies of the properties of  Cherenkov images related to the detection and discrimination of gamma  rays, and model cur rently existing and proposed air Cherenkov systems.    A low energy threshold ground based air Cherenkov telescope for  detecting gamma rays in the region from 20 GeV to 200 GeV will open a  new window to the universe.  If it is possible to develop this  technique, a low energy ground based telescope could be designed, built  and operating in less than a decade.  In contrast, the next generation  of satellite borne detectors has a longer development timescale, and  detection of gamma rays is unlikely to reach energies higher than 50  GeV.",
