By working as a consortium, members of the  Alliance hope to effect change in the culture of American  education.  The Alliance intends to address the problem of  institutional barriers that inhibit access to the crucial  educational resources that determine success and leadership in  academia.    The purpose of this symposium is to provide 200 Leadership Alliance  undergraduate and graduate students with a forum of encouragement  that will reinforce their aspirations to complete advanced studies  in mathematics, science, engineering and the social sciences--as  well as gather the tools to prepare for and enter careers in these  areas.  There will be poster sessions, several nationally and  internationally recognized speakers, workshops, a reception and at  least one major social activity.    The symposium will also serve as an opportunity to provide detailed  information on the current climate of academia and industry, with  emphasis on scientific/technical specialties; practical information  on how undergraduate science/engineering studies differ from  graduate studies and how science/engineering career paths can be  varied, and pointers on how to survive and succeed, especially in  predominately non-minority settings.    Most importantly, the symposia will provide the students with a  sense of community and a feeling psychological optimism that comes  out of being part of a \"critical mass\" of serious students and  mentors--where everyone understands the struggles to be faced as we  approach the 21st century and can offer moving personal  testimonials and advice on how barriers have and can continue to be  overcome.  ***",
