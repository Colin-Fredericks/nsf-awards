In recent years, the concept of Inertial Manifold has emerged as  an important tool for the study of the long-term behavior of  dynamical systems.  In parallel to the study of Inertial  Manifolds, extensive research has also been conducted on  Approximate Inertial Manifolds and related numerical algorithms.   These multi-resolution algorithms, taking into account the  interaction law between small-scale and large-scale components of  the underlying flow, are especially attractive for long-term  integrations of dissipative evolution equations.  The aim of this  workshop is to bring together active researchers with different  backgrounds to discuss recent and prospective advances in this  area.      Funds are granted for travel expenses of ten participants from  the United States and for partial support of the publication cost  for the workshop proceedings.",
