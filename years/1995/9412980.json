 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop denotational semantics for a  variety of programming languages, tailored to support  compositional reasoning  about various important forms of  program behavior. It studies a typical  functional programming  language, and two typical parallel imperative languages:  a  language for shared-variable parallelism, and a language of  communicating  processes related to Hoare's CSP and Milner's  CCS. Notions of behavior  considered for the parallel languages  include safety and liveness properties,  and partial and total  correctness, assuming various forms of fairness  properties  that correspond to natural assumptions about the runtime  execution  of concurrent processes. This should permit  reasoning about parallel programs  to be carried out without  knowledge of or reference to details concerning  scheduling.  There also is a research focus on intensional properties  concerning runtime and efficient use of resources.  Technically, the project  aims to develop fully abstract  semantics, with respect to a variety of  important notions of  program behavior. A semantics is fully abstract if it  gives  the same meaning to two program phrases precisely when they  induce  identical behavior in all program contexts. This  provides a rigorous criterion  for judging the utility of a  semantics in supporting compositional or modular  reasoning  about program behavior. The long term goal is the development  of a  unifying framework suitable for establishing and  exploiting relationships  between languages, models, and proof  methods for reasoning about programs. In  particular, the  research seeks to establish a mathematically tractable theory  and use it to develop practical techniques for modular design  and analysis of  parallel programs.",
