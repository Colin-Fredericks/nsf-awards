In recent years, however, air pollution research  has shifted to include the indoor enviornment.  An enormous  proportion of the world's population lives in rural  households that rely on unprocessed biomass fuels (wood,  crop residues, and animal dung) as their major or only  source of domestic energy for cooking and sometimes space  heating. There is often an extremely high level of pollution  that results.  The few studies that have measured  concentrations of particulate matter from biomass fuel  burning in developing countries have shown levels that are  10 to 20 times higher than the EPA 24-hour standard, and one  study in India showed levels reaching 80 times this  standard.   To date, the extent and severity of health  effects associated with the burning of biomass fuels have  not been well established in spite of the large population  at risk.  The few studies that have addressed this issue are  at times inconsistent with one another and many have serious  methodological flaws.    In order to examine the relationship between the elevated  levels of air pollution and health, this dissertation study  will, in a rural area of Bolivia with high levels of  respiratory disease and biomass burning: a) determine total  human exposure to indoor particulate pollution in a high  altitude community and in a mid-altitude community whcih  will be used as a control, and b) explore potential  relationships between this pollution and respiratory  diesease in children and adults.",
