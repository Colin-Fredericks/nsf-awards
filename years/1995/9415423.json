 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taam  9415423    The Principal Investigator will model numerically the common envelope evolution of binary   stars.  It is believed that most, if not all, short-period binary stars (periods of hours to days) start   out as long-period binaries (periods of years), but then they pass through a common envelope   phase during which friction slows their orbital motions and converts them into short-period   systems.    This research is to investigate the effect of transfer of orbital angular momentum from the stars   to a common envelope, which subsequently is ejected by frictional processes or gravitational   interactions.  The research applies to both the common envelope phases of massive stars   (precursors to binary radio pulsars and X-ray binaries) and low-to-intermediate mass stars   (precursors to cataclysmic variable systems).    The objective is to determine the parameters for which long orbital period binary systems are   transformed into short period systems, and the parameters for which two stars merge.  The   ultimate goal is to lay the foundation for understanding the nature, origin, and evolution of close   binary star systems.  ***",
