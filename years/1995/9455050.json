 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel processing is a new and fast growing field of computer  science. It is a comprehensive discipline, covering fundamental  concepts and techniques of parallel architecture, programming, and  algorithms.  The rapid development of parallel processing in recent  years has been incurring a significant impact on college education.   This project is a nine-day workshop on Parallel Processing:   Architecture and Programming,  bringing together 35 college and  university faculty members from all over the country to learn the  basic theory and practice in this new field of Computer Science and  discuss the issues of enhancing the undergraduate curriculum by  Parallel Processing.  The workshop  introduces the participants to  topics that can be used to enhance undergraduate courses in  computer organization, computer architecture, computer systems,  parallel processing, programming languages, concurrent programming,  design and analysis of algorithms, and theory of computation.  The  workshop emphasizes practical programming activities in Applied  Parallel Processing and Graphics Laboratory at California State  University-Fresno, the establishment of which has been supported by  NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program.  The workshop offers six two-hour tutorial lectures by Lan Jin,  Shigeko Seki, and Lan Yang.  Each lecture is followed by a one-hour  discussion and three-hour laboratory work.  The lectures address  fundamentals of parallel processing, shared-variable and message-  passing programming, parallel algorithms, and major parallel  architectures.  Three panel discussions are organized on the topics  such as curriculum design and teaching methodologies, laboratory  development, and trends of development of parallel processing.  The  workshop pays great attention to follow-up activities including an  active electronic forum throughout the academic year after the  workshop.",
