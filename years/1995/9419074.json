 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Program supports research by Dr. James N. Demas of the Department  of Chemistry, University of Virginia, on interaction of  luminescent Ru(II), Os(II), Ir(III), and Re(I) photosensitizers  with various environments.  The work will be carried out with  collaborator Dr. Benjamin A. DeGraaf of the Chemistry Department,  James Madison University.  The long-term goal is to understand  the effect that attachment to biopolymers, vesicles, organic  polymers, cyclodextrin, DNA, and other organized media has on the  luminescent properties of these complexes.  Of particular  interest is testing the suitability of these complexes with long-  lived excited state lifetimes for detecting processes such as  association and folding of proteins.  Long alkyl chains will be  attached to the metal complexes in order to modify the behavior  of the luminescent portion of the molecule as a consequence of  placing hydrophobic interactions in the vicinity of the metal.   Factors such as temperature and media dynamics would be  considered.  The project will require synthesis of a number of  new complexes and use of advanced luminescence methods, such as  dynamic polarization and phase fluorimetry measurements. This  research could be aid in the design of highly sensitive  luminescent materials to selectively identify certain structural  features or to serve as sensors or detectors.    Selective and sensitive probes for molecular-level structural  features and changes in macromolecules are needed for biological,  environmental, and industrial applications.  For example,  reactions of enzymes, catalysts, and gas molecules at surfaces  are known be very sensitive to structural and solvent  environment.  In this research, the luminescent property of  certain metal complexes will be tested as a probe for structural  changes in proteins, in order to obtain information necessary for  the design of effective molecular probes.",
