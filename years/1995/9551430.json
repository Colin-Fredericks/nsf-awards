The proposed project will implement a laboratory  component in each of four core courses within experimental  psychology.  Development of laboratory courses is underway, and  inauguration of the new courses will coincide with the department's  acquisition of a newly renovated building.  NSF support is  requested for equipping a shared computer laboratory,with  appropriate instructional software,and acquiring some of the basic  equipment for establishing these teaching laboratories.  This  equipment includes one rack of cage housing for laboratory rats, an  operant conditioning apparatus, and a general purpose video  tracking system.  The shared computer laboratory would consist of  25 student workstations and an instructor's station (which will act  as file server for a peer-to-peer local network within the  laboratory), capable of projecting video or computer images for  viewing by the entire class.  Group data collection, data analysis,  and tutorials are facilitated by the video projection system.  The  shared computer laboratory would also serve as a re.source for  independent student research and other courses, including  statistics, research design, and cognitive psychology.",
