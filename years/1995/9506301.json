The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis, based on previous work, that su(s) functions to aid the splicing machinery in discriminating between authentic and cryptic 5' splice donor sites. The following are specific objectives of this proposal. (1) Since purified, recombinant su(s) protein,expressed in a baculovirus system, binds to RNA, several biochemical techniques will be employed to determine whether su(s) binding affects the ability of a given pre-mRNA to be spliced.  The sites of su(s) protein binding on RNAs will be mapped. If su(s) binds specifically to donor site regions, a splicing complex assembly assay will be used to determine if su(s) binding to these sites interferes with Ul snRNP binding. Other experiments will examine the RNA binding specificity of endogenous su(s) protein and define the basis for poor splicing activity of su(s) mutant nuclear extracts. (2) To determine if the region of su(s) required for in vitro RNA binding activity is required for su(s) function in vivo, deletions will be introduced into RNA binding domain, and transformants carrying these deletion derivatives will be analyzed. If the deletions affect su(s) function in vivo, an effort will be made to identify specific amino acid residues required for the RNA binding activity. As a first step toward the identification of other functional dmains, the Musca domeslica su(s) homolog will be cloned and its sequence compared to the available D. melanogaster and D. virilis sequences. (3) To determine whether the intracellular distributions of splicing components and inefficiently spliced pre-mRNAs are altered in su(sJ mutants, larval salivary gland cells will be immunostained or in situ hybridized with appropriate probes and examined by con focal microscopy. (4) Natural RNA targets of su(s) regulation will be identified.   Antibodies that recognize su(s) strongly stain a relatively small number of polytene chromosomes bands in salivary gland nuclei. The strong sites of su(s) staining, which are likely to contain genes regulated by su(s), will be mapped on polytene chromosomes. Subsequently, an effort will be made to identify and analyze specific transcripts that are subject to regulation by su(s). This analysis of su(s) function has the potential to advance the understanding of mechanisms that regulate splice site selection in higher eukaryotes.  %%%  Eukaryotic genes contain varying numbers of regions of sequence which are named \"introns\". They are spliced out of the mRNA transcript and, in some cases, have alternative end points and so can result in a gene at the DNA level encoding more than one protein as a final product.  Thus it becomes important to understand how the splice sites in a transcript are identified and utilized. During the tenure of the previous award, experimental evidence suggested that the nuclear protein encoded by the gene from Drosophila,  suppressor of sable  su(s)  functions to aid the splicing machinery to discriminate between authentic and cryptic 5' splice donor sites. Further work will be undertaken to provide data to support this hypothesis. This analysis of su(s) function has the potential to advance the understanding of mechanisms that regulate splice site selection in higher eukaryotes.  ***",
