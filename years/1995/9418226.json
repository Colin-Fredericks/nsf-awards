 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental study investigates coupled processes of flow and reactive mass in  porous media.  Of interest are reactive transport processes that involve coupling both through density  effects and heterogeneous chemical reactions that may alter the hydraulic  character of the medium.  The goal of this study is to contribute fundamental knowledge concerning reaction-coupled mass  transport.   Two and Three-dimensional experiments with flow tanks will be used to elucidate the  time-space evolution of reaction fronts and fluid chemistry in porous media, and to interpret the  nature of the feedbacks that exist between density-driven flow, and reactive mass transport.  The  experiments will involve pumping a dilute Fe(CIO4) 3 solution through a mixture of quartz sand and a  small quantity of crushed calcite.  The initial acidity of the solution will promote calcite  dissolution and lead to the precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide.  The resultant pore plugging will  result in patterning in hydraulic conductivity and reroute fluid flow through the tanks.  These  patterns can be documented photog raphically in two-dimensional experiments.  The three-dimensional  experiments are technically more challenging and require that reaction fronts be described with both  in situ hydraulic conductivity measurements and electrical measurements with a permanently installed  electrode array.  This research builds on our studies of instabilities in variable density flows, and  will contribute new knowledge in the emerging area of coupled processes and practical problems of  contaminant support.",
