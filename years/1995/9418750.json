 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418750  Braam  The cell wall is a fundamental structure in plant cells that  controls cellular shape and integrity and plays a role in  signal transduction.  Yet the involvement of cell wall  modifications in plant morphogenesis remains largely  unknown.  Proteins that modify cell wall polysaccharides  would be expected to regulate cell wall structure and thus  likely play critical roles in plant morphogenesis. Recently,  an Arabidopsis gene, TCH4, has been shown to be  significantly related to xyloglucan endotransglycosylase  (XET) enzymes.  Because the TCH4 gene is strongly and  rapidly upregulated in expression in response to  environmental stimuli, the possibility exists that the  physilogical relevance of this regulation of gene expression  is to elicit cell wall modifications and thus the  developmental changes that occur following environmental  stimulation.    The focus of the work supported is to investigate the  function(s) of the TCH4 gene product and to ascertain the  roles of this protein in cell wall modifications and plant  development.  Purified TCH4 protein will be assayed for XET  and related enzyme activities.  Because it has been proposed  that XET may cause cell wall loosening and cell expansion,  TCH4 will be tested for the ability to cause extension of  isolated plant hypocotyl segments.  Transgenic plants that  over-express or under-express the TCH4 gene will be  generated to determine the physiological and developmental  effects of altering TCH4 expression in vivo.  Antibodies  specific for the TCH4 gene product will be used to localize  the protein in plant tissues during development, and to  determine its subcellular location.  Finally, because TCH4  is a member of a closely related gene family, similar  detailed analyses of the functions and regulation of the  other family members will be initiated.",
