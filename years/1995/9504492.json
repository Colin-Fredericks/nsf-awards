 "awd_abstract_narration": "Walkington       The investigator studies physical problems involving phase  changes and their numerical approximation.  In general these  problems exhibit one of two distinct traits; either the solutions  take on the character of a free boundary problem where the unknown  boundary separates the phases, or the phases are finely  interspersed.  The former are modeled by degenerate parabolic  equations.  While the theory for these equations is well developed,  this is not the case with the discrete theory for their numerical  approximation.  For example, the investigator in collaboration with  J. Rulla has only recently established optimal rates of  convergence of the classical Stefan problem in a dual Sobolev  space; however, rates of convergence of the energy in the space of  integrable functions is still an open question.  Even less is known  about approximations of the mean curvature equation that arises,  for example, when the interface between the phases has more  structure.  The investigator also studies the approximation of  problems that exhibit fine phase mixtures.  Because these problems  involve structures that are much finer than any feasible mesh, the  investigator utilizes the recent theory of Young measures to  characterize the fine scale behavior.  This theory shows that the  fine scale behavior is far from random and in many cases can be  characterized by a the (macroscopic) Young measure.  The  investigator studies and analyzes algorithms that approximate the  Young measure.       In this project, the investigator develops efficient ways to  computationally model problems arising in the environmental and  material sciences.  One interesting feature of these problems is  that they often exhibit interfaces where different materials meet.  For example, when modeling the spread of pollutants, the single  most important quantity is the location and motion of the  interface between the pollutant and the clean environment.  Problems in the material sciences often involve very fine scal e  phenomena involving interfaces between different phases of the  same material.  This phenomenon is ubiquitous, being observable,  for example, in most metals.  However, the fine scales also present  many obstacles when analyzing such materials.  The investigator  develops the computational tools to circumvent these problems,  providing another step towards the automation of the design and  development of modern (and traditional) materials.",
