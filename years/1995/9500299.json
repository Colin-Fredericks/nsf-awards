Jacobs and Brian Malloy of Clemson University and Torsten Ekedahl of Stockholm University.   The purpose of the workshop is to discuss the use of world wide web and other networks for sharing mathematical software systems with the scientific and educational community.  The workshop addresses issues concerning the development of common standards and codes, multimedia approaches, and appropriate software development tools for building interfaces.  Many specialized mathematical software systems are emerging to perform such diverse computations as solving systems of equations, constructing algebraic structures, examining properties of geometric objects, and visualizing abstract mathematical systems.  These systems are not easily transported because of different formats and varied conventions for the interchange of data.   The emergence of world wide web now offers an opportunity for sharing different systems through remote access to software programs.  The workshop takes advantage of interaction with Swedish computer algebra specialists and other Europeans through POSSO (Polynomial Systems Solver) group.",
