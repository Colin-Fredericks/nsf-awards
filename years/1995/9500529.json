 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500529  Ding   In this research, the problem of developing methods and rules to sequence and balance mixed-model assembly lines is addressed.  The objective of the research is to develop methods for sequencing parts in a mixed-model assembly line so as to minimize part usage variation.  The methods proposed in this research will account for both the variations in finished-part level production and part usage.  The effect of mix model changes on the effectiveness of an existing balance will be analyzed.  Furthermore, rules for determining the necessity of re-balancing a mixed model assembly line will also be developed.  Industrial models in mixed-model assembly lines to incorporate industrial concerns will also be performed.  This will be supported through industrial data to be collected as part of the research.  Finally, computer simulation for testing the effectiveness of the techniques developed will be undertaken using both industrial and randomly generated data.    Product assembly is a critical part of manufacturing.  Most products are made of several parts which are assembled together.  Given the pressure for quick order turnaround time and small lot size manufacture, the need for efficient management and control of mixed-model assembly lines are all the more important.  Significant economic gains will be realized through improvement in mixed-model assembly line management.  The outcome of this research will contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of mixed-model assembly lines.",
