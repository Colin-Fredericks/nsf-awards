 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research proposal concerns the development of a new process for destroying unwanted byproducts and environmental pollutants in water using ozone and hydrogen peroxide. There is continuing and increasing interest in the use of these chemical oxidants in industrial and environmental practices. The proposed research involves the paired electrochemical synthesis of both ozone and hydrogen peroxide in a single electrochemical reactor. The benefits of combining these two reactions are: (1) lower operating costs, as two oxidizing agents can be obtained for the price of one; (2) the elimination of the need for transportation and storage of hydrogen peroxide which can be generated on demand; (3) both oxidants together provide enhanced oxidation capabilities over the use of either oxidant alone; (4) aqueous phase ozone concentrations that can be generated electrochemically significantly exceed those obtainable by conventional methods of ozone generation; (5) electrochemical ozone generation requires simplified equipment compared to the conventional method of ozone generation allowing compact modular design for easier on-site installation and transportation between treatment sites. Synthesizing ozone and hydrogen peroxide in a single reactor is a considerable challenge because each requires fundamentally distinct reaction conditions. The proposed research addresses these difficulties through the development of a new type of electrochemical cell.",
