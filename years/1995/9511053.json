 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511053  Rasler    This project focuses on the Intifada (1987-1993) in order to  extend the theoretical and empirical work on the relationships  between social movements, political revolts and protest cycles.   There are three major theoretical themes that guide the  hypothesis formation and testing stages:  1) the evolution of  protest waves; 2) regime-challenger interactions; and, 3) the  dynamics of ethnic competition.    The first section of the study examines the factors that  influence the shape of the protest wave, e.g., policies of  repression/concession, organizational structure and competition,  the role of external parties, inter-organizational strife and the  contraction of organizational resources.  The second section  investigates the short and long term effects of  repression/concessions on bandwagon and spatial diffusion  prmcesses.  The third section investigates the rise of ethnic  violence and its impact on collective action patterns.    The temporal domain of the study covers the 1981-1993 period in  both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  Data on the occurrence,  participation and duration of collective action events will be  collected from two Palestinian newspapers - al-Ouds (Arabic) and  al-Fajr (weekly, English) - one Israeli newspaper - Jerusalem  Post - and one regional news source - The Foreign Broadcast  Information Service.      The research design is longitudinal and the temporal unit is  weekly.  Event-history methods will be applied to the analysis.   This research promises to substantially enhance our understanding  of this topic.  ***",
