 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424075  Hodges   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will support undergraduates to participate in research projects in the areas of computer graphics, virtual environments and visualization.  The goal is to involve junior and senior students in a long term research experience (1-2 years) in which they make real contributions to the research, present papers at academic conferences, and author or co-author papers submitted to journals.  The research project will focus on software and algorithm development, experimental quantification, and application development for virtual reality and real-time visualization systems.  The student participants will be split into two groups of four each.  One group will focus on the development of design tools for 3-D environments, image display techniques and algorithms, and application of virtual reality to exposure therapy.  The other group will develop methods and tools for highly-interactive visualization and analysis in scientific applications.  The methods and tools will be both for workstation-based and virtual environments and will be based on a common set of principles.  Undergraduate participants will work in a state-of-the-art visualization laboratory and will meet weekly with faculty members and graduate students who are also involved in these projects.  ***",
