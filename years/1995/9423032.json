Four decisions by the court (two civil-  liberties and two economic/property rights cases) will be  studied.  The two-wave panel research design will measure  opinions on the issue both before and after the Supreme Court  decision.  Each panel will consist of two geographic samples of  residents of the immediate town where the case originate and  residents of the surrounding towns.  This research will  investigate the levels of awareness of the case, levels of  opinion change, and citizens' evaluation of the Court after it  has decided the case.  This study will contribute to our  understanding of the impact Supreme Court rulings have on the  opinions of residents of the community in which the case  originates, how rulings affect their evaluation of the Court,  and their perception of the impact of the Court on their lives.    ***",
