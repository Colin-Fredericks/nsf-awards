 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453034  Deigl    LightPower is one of twelve permanent exhibits being developed for  the new Orlando Science Center (OSC) in Orlando, Florida.  A 4,000  square foot exhibit, LightPower places lasers in their broad  scientific context by focusing on light, the electromagnetic  spectrum, and on lasers and their applications.  Because of the  large number of laser-optics research facilities and corporations  in the Central Florida region, the exhibit also includes The Optics  Workbench, a career-themed activity center which emphasizes careers  in optics and in scientific and technical fields that utilize  lasers.    LightPower is being developed by a partnership that includes the  Orlando Science Center, the Orange County Public Schools, and the  Center for Research and Education in Electro-Optics and Lasers at  the University of Central Florida.  The partnership will develop,  prototype, and evaluate interactive exhibit components and  associated text and labels in English and Spanish; and will  develop, evaluate, and distribute hands-on career-related  activities in English and Spanish for students and teachers.    The goal of the LightPower exhibit is to contribute to the  educational infrastructure of the Central Florida region by:         -    Developing an interactive exhibit that facilitates            learning by a diverse public, including African Americans            and Latinos, and successfully communicating with both            English and Spanish-speaking audiences.         -    Supporting middle school, junior high, and high school            science curricula, and producing and distributing printed            materials that detail the relationship between exhibit            components and specific curriculum performance standards.         -    Developing successful hands-on career-related activities            for students and teachers in both English and Spanish.",
