 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422010  Goel  Recent earthquakes have  demonstrated the life safety  hazard posed by unreinforced  masonry (URM) wall structures.  It is proposed to strengthen  the URM walls by fiber  composites. The flexibility,  light weight and high tensile  strength of composites makes  them an ideal material for  strengthening masonry  structures.  A recent study  has demonstrated that  significant increases in  strength and ductility could  be achieved for static  loading.  The primary  objective of this research  project will be to study the  in-plane cyclic behavior of  unreinforced masonry (URM)  walls strengthened with fiber  composites and to develop  analysis and design procedures  or seismic strengthening of  existing URM structures.  Six  wall specimens,each  approximately 8 ft wide and 10  ft tall, will be tested. Two  different height to thickness  ratios (h/t = 14 and 28)  constructed of one or two  wythes of bricks will be  examined. Composite fabrics  epoxied to the wall will  either fully cover both faces  of the wall, or will be  applied as vertical strips  spaced apart and staggered on  the opposite faces of the  wall.  Test results will be  used to develop design  guidelines for retrofitting of  URM structures. The proposed  research will be closely  coordinated with a parallel  research investigating the out  of plane cyclic behavior of  fiber reinforced URM wall at  the University of Arizona.  ***",
