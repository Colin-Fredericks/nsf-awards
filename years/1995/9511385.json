 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program of research extends the PIs' Self-Evaluation Maintenance (SEM) model to intimate relationships.  More specifically, it examines the way in which self-evaluation threat and self-evaluation benefit in close relationships lead to changes in cognition and cognitive processes that are associated with the destructive processes of envy in marital relationships as well as with such positive emotions as felt attachment and commitment. The PIs will investigate the role of SEM cognitive processes in: 1)  precipitating defensive, negative judgments about the partner;  2)  increasing the availability of positive and negative memories of the partner; 3) facilitating constructive or destructive interpretations of prior interactive behavior;  and 4) influencing definitiion of the self and the emergence of complimentary 'selves' in intimate relationships.  The automaticity of SEM processes will also be examined.  Taken together, these studies will provide a foundation for understanding defensive reactions in dyadic relationships and their destructive interpersonal and intrapersonal consequences.           Marriage is a fundamental building block of civilization. Well functioning marriages provide the basis for effective emotional support in times of difficulty, thereby preventing potentially serious declines in worker health and productivity, and they also are a foundation upon which successful child rearing can occur.  Because parents who are able to nurture each other are also in the best position to enable their children to develop into competent and productive adults, successful marriages are the foundation of the nation's future productive capacity. Yet, fully half of first marriages are destined to end in divorce at great cost both to the individuals involved, their families, and to society as a whole.  This program of research will elucidate cognitive processes in the service of self-evaluation maintenance that can contribute to marital discord.  As such, it is highly relevant to the \"Famili es\" component of the Human Capital Research agenda.  One of the perplexing problems in understanding marital discord is how to account for the shift that may occur from giving a partner the benefit of the doubt to assuming the worst when negative things happen.  It is clear that automatic cognitive processes are involved and that these processes are often not amenable to conscious introspection.  However, the exact nature of these automatic cognitive processes has been elusive. This program of research will illuminate some of these processes.  Moreover, the project focuses on processes that are particularly relevant to the changing nature of American families.  In particular, the theoretical model that guides the work is highly relevant to the \"new\" marital problems that may emerge as traditional gendered divisions of labor give way to more egalitarian marital relationships. As such, the knowledge generated by this program of research will be highly useful in developing  improved methods for preventing and ameliorating marital difficulties.",
