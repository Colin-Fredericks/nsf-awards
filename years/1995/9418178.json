 "awd_abstract_narration": "In flowering plants, the process of fertilization underlies  production of seeds and fruits.  Although structural events  of double fertilization have been described, little is  known about molecular mechanisms of fertilization.  Plant  sperm are embedded in pollen grains and move down growing  pollen tubes.  Near the egg, a pollen tube releases two  sperm:  one fuses with the egg to form the embryo, the  other fuses with the central cell, adjacent to the egg, to  form endosperm that supports growth of the developing  embryo.  A major unanswered question in plant reproduction  is how sperm recognize eggs and central cells, adhere, and  fuse. Recognition molecules may be located in or on gamete  membranes.  The goals of this project are to:  (1) identify  sperm membrane epitopes by screening antibodies to isolated  plant sperm cells; (2) investigate sperm cell dimorphism by  differential antibody binding; (3) determine the species  specificity of sperm antigens; (4) determine whether sperm  antigens change during sperm development; and (5) involve  undergraduates in a pioneering research project.  The  results will further understanding of basic developmental  mechanisms that function in plant reproduction.  Antibodies  will be raised to sperm of Brassica and will be tested on  sperm of Gerbera and Lilium.  The results will lead to a  basic understanding of fertility and sterility: producing  hybrids from incompatible species and preventing  fertilization where male sterility is needed to prevent  selfcrossing.  The identity of sperm-specific membrane  molecules will be valuable for future genetic engineering  studies. Undergraduate students will gain valuable insight  into active research.  By solving problems and assisting in  attainment of goals, they will gain research experience  which will facilitate their development as scientists.",
