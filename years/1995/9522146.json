Many of today's environmental concerns are a consequence of past manufacturing decisions--decisions that were often made with statistical insight.  It is surely fair to suggest that in order to mitigate tomorrow's environmental problems we must begin by understanding today's manufacturing processes.  Here the combination of statistics, computing science, manufacturing, and the environment becomes particularly compelling.  The Interface conference provides a unique opportunity for professionals in statistics, computing science, and various application areas to interact on issues at the interface of these disciplines. The Symposium fills a critical gap between the activities of our large professional societies. The 1995 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and Statistics will be held June 21-24, 1995 at the Vista Hotel in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.",
