 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Richard D. Broene, Chemistry Department, Bowdoin College, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career   Advancement Award for research into the synthesis of chiral   cyclopentadienyl complexes of lanthanide metals and for restructuring   Bowdoin College's chemistry laboratory courses in order to provide   cross-boundary training for chemistry students. The research concentrates   on a series of C-2 symmetric lanthanocene complexes, which will be   prepared by selectively varying the substituents on tethered   cyclopentadiene ligands. The ability of these compound to   stereoselectively catalyze cyclizations and polymerizations of   ketimine-olefin substrates will be evaluated. Within the educational   portion of the project the introductory organic chemistry laboratory will   be redesigned and a junior level comprehensive laboratory will be   instituted in order to incorporate more active student participation and   to provide students with a more realistic outlook on modern chemistry. An   outreach program will be instituted in order to develop an interest in   chemistry among precollege students.   A goal in modern industrial and laboratory chemistry is the design of   compounds which will effect very efficient, very specific chemical   transformations. In this project a new series of complexes will be   prepared. The shape of these compounds will be carefully designed so that   they will induce the coupling or polymerization of small organic   molecules in a fashion where one possible `mirror image` product is   formed to the exclusion of the other. The educational portion of the   project aims at providing a more realistic and visual introduction to   various chemical concepts at the precollege, the lower, and the upper   undergraduate levels.",
