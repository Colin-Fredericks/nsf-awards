 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports a project to study the Jurassic volcanic  rocks which overlie the Permian to Triassic Gondwana sequence in  Antarctica.  These rocks constitute the Antarctic part of the  magmatic record of the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana.  These Jurassic rocks, which occur along the length of the  Transantarctic Mountains, include both silicic and tholeiitic  compositions.  The most complete stratigraphic record of the time  interval from the Late Triassic termination of deposition in the  Beacon foreland basin to the Middle Jurassic eruption of the  flood basalts of the Ferrar Group is located in the central  Transantarctic Mountains.  In that region, the upper Falla  Formation is dominated by volcanogenic rocks including plinian  airfall tuffs and phreatomagmatic deposits.  The overlying  Prebble Formation is dominated by fine to coarse grained  phreatomagmatic deposits, including accretionary lapilli tuffs  and breccias.  Compositionally the rocks are bimodal with silicic  activity initiating volcanism and continuing into the flood  basalt eruptive episode, whereas the basaltic activity begins  with explosive eruptions in the Prebble and changes to quiet  effusion of lava.  The basaltic pyroclastic rocks are comagmatic  with the lavas, having the same geochemical characteristics.  The  silicic rocks are probably anatectic.  Coarse quartzose  sandstones with large angular clasts and the presence of  monoclinal structures active late in the magmatic activity,  indicate contemporaneous basement block faulting.  Stratigraphic,  structural, petrologic and paleovolcanologic data indicate that  these igneous rocks accumulated in a tectono-magmatic rift  setting.  In south Victoria Land, the correlative strata include  flood lavas, basaltic pyroclastic deposits and some recently  reported silicic pyroclastic rocks.  At one locality a major  disconformity separates the basaltic pyroclastic rocks from the  underlying Beacon.  The relations of the silicic tuffs to the  basalt ic pyroclastic rocks and to the disconformity are unclear.  The silicic tuffs are reported to include an ignimbrite.  The  objectives of this project are to gather data to test the tectono-  magmatic model proposed for the Jurassic magmatism in Antarctica.  Specifically, the objectives are to: 1) establish a detailed  stratigraphic framework for the Jurassic pyroclastic rocks in  order to assess syndepositional extensional normal faulting, 2)  investigate the paleovolcanology of the rocks, in particular the  rocks formed by phreatomagmatic processes, in order to understand  the physical environment, 3) further characterize the  geochemistry of the rocks in order to better define time  dependent changes in magma compositions, relations between  silicic and basaltic rocks, and source region characteristics of  the silicic magmas, and 4) establish the age  of onset of the  silicic volcanism.  These data will be used to validate or modify  the proposed model and to assess the model's applicability to  continental flood basalt magmatism in general.",
