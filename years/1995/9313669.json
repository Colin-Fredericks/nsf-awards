 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313671  Beardsley    Present evidence indicates that the recruitment and survival of  commercially important fish larvae within the Georges Bank region  depends critically on the development of stratification during the  spring and summer period.  Predicted climate change scenarios are  likely to significantly influence the evolution of stratification  and thus impact larval survival over Georges Bank.  As part of U.S.  GLOBEC Georges Bank Study, Dr. Beardsley and collaborators will  conduct an intensive field project during January-August, 1995  aimed at better understanding the development of stratification  over Georges Bank and its influence of larval fish survival.   Preliminary studies will be initiated in 1994.  The project will  have a moored instrument component will involve deploying  meteorological sensors and instruments throughout the water column,  with a heavy concentration in the surface and bottom boundary  layers.  The data acquired will be used to resolve the  stratification field and examine factors controlling its  development.  The shipboard measurement component will consist of  five cruises following a concentration (patch) of the target  species: cod and haddock larvae and their copepod prey, Calanus and  Pseudocalanus.  Using a variety of sampling systems,including  drifters, MOCNESS, the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), plankton  pump, and multiple- high-frequency acoustical samplers,  measurements will be made of: (1) hydrography, microturbulence, and  currents, (2) the vertical and horizontal distributions of the  target species in relation to water column stratification, (3)  passive particle motions and the tree-dimensional swimming  behaviors of individual zooplankton, and (4) the feeding and growth  of larval cod and haddock in relation to water column  stratification and prey distribution.  The data will be used  together with information from collaborative field and modeling  studies to gain insights into the impact of stratification and  turbulent mixing on gro wth and survival of zooplankton and fish  populations.",
