 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eastman  9416870  This research centers on the evaluation of organismal  diversification in Antarctic fishes of the perciform suborder  Notothenioidei.  Notothenioids are the dominant fishes by number  and biomass in all inner shelf areas of the Southern Ocean.  They  are an evolutionary novelty - the only known example of a fish  species flock in a marine habitat.  Although derived from a  benthic stock lacking swim bladders, notothenioids have  diversified into most water column habitats.  Nototheniods  display the wide scope of organismal diversification in an  ecosystem historically underutilized by non-notothenioid fishes,  and they are a striking example of the nature of Antarctic marine  biodiversity.  Primary objectives of this study are:  (1) to  evaluate organismal diversification with emphasis on neutral  buoyancy, reduced density (compared to the pleisomorphic benthic  condition) and the associated morphology in members of the  families Nototheniidae, Channichthyidae and Bathydraconidae; (2)  to explore the evolution of neutral buoyancy and reduced density  by mapping these and other morphological features on cladograms  independently derived from other information; (3) to determine  whether the diversification of buoyancy (life history) types and  the associated morphology are reflective of the phylogenetic  history of various notothenioid clades or are related to  environmental adaptation and (4) to add new buoyancy and  morphological information to the existing suites of characters  available for phylogenetic analysis of notothenioids.  In  addition to elucidating the morphological basis for evolutionary  changes in buoyancy, this study will provide insight into how  notothenioids diversified to occupy a variety of water column  habitats in the Southern Ocean.",
