 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Engineering and Mines (SEM) in a partnership with  industry in 1988 established three distance-learning  undergraduate engineering programs, offered in parallel with  corresponding traditional on-campus degrees. This initiative gave  access to an engineering education to students who, because of  locations and schedules, otherwise could not pursue an  engineering education. The distance-learning students, by virtue  of their paraprofessional experience, have needs, expectations,  motivations, knowledge bases, and skills that differ from those  of traditional students. Thus, the curricula must be modified to  meet students' needs efficiently, incorporating their  experiential knowledge base and skills inventory, while  simultaneously ensuring validated compliance with ABET  accreditation standards. It is also critical that faculty develop  strategies for attaining maximum teaching effectiveness in the  distance-learning environment.    The stakeholders for the \"Enhanced Curriculum for Undergraduate  Engineering Adult Learners in Industry\"  include engineering  educators, industry, and undergraduate adult learners. Program  objectives include: (a) completing a comparison of a broad range  of cognitive and performance based competencies of  distance-education students and traditional students; (b)  enhancing curricula to meet the unique needs of adult learners  while adhering to ABET standards, (c) developing faculty members'  competencies needed to enhance teaching of non-traditional  learners; (d) evaluating program outcomes using summative and  formative techniques; e) disseminating results which document the  evolution of an ABET accredited, undergraduate distance-learning  program in engineering.",
