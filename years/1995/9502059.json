 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almgren  9502059  This work is supported by a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Award.  The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participating of those traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic careers that include both research and education.  The research will focus on the development of computational techniques for dendritic solidification in three dimensions using two methods.  The first method is implementation of adaptive mesh refinement to simulate the phase field model of dendritic growth, which models the solid/liquid interface by a  thinviscous layer.  In addition to the coding complexity, the central issues are construction of stable and accurate time discretization formulas, specification of accurate criteria to guide the automatic refinement strategy, and possible permiting the interface thickness to depend on local velocity.  The second, more speculative, method is a lattice-based variational method, using an Ising-type model and simulated annealing to minimize a combination of bulk and surface energy at each time step.  The first approach is expected to be effective at large undercoolings or supersaturations, where kinetic effects are important; the second approach will be more efficient at small undercoolings, near local equilibrium.    The overall purpose of this project is to develop effective computational tools for predicting and controlling the microstructure  which develops almost every time a metal or other substance solidifies  from its melt, that is, in almost every casting process from horseshoes to jet turbine blades.  The details of this microstructure have a tremendous influence on the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the resulting material piece; if the processes which produce them could be understood and controlled, then dramatic improvements might be possible.  The teaching side of this project is construction of an applied mathematics component for the University of Chicago's SESAME program, which teaches mathematics to elementary teachers from the Chicago Public Schools.  The investigator will develop classroom and computer material focusing on the questions of how and why objects in Nature assume the shapes they do in response to their physical environment; he will consider trees and tree leaves, soap films, crystals, seashells, and square-cube scaling laws.",
