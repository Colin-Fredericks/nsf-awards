 "awd_abstract_narration": "NCR-9502614  Leandros Tassiulas      Wireless will be a method of choice for accessing the future  broadband integrated services network.  In wireless access the main  problem is to utilize efficiently the limited spectrum capacity in  order to accommodate the large traffic demands that will be  generated by Personal Communication Services (PCS).  In the digital  network there will be enhanced flexibility in signaling and control  to support sophisticated schemes.  Dynamic resource allocation  methods should be employed for network control in order  to achieve maximum utilization of the system.  The fundamental  problem of joint base-station assignment, power control and channel  allocation will be investigated here.  Such a problem arises during  hand-off, when the configuration of the system changes, as well as  at the time of a new connection.  Furthermore it should be solved  in a dynamic fashion during the operation of the system and for  system configurations that change randomly.  The problem is  formulated as an optimization problem that involves continuous and  discrete components.  The traffic capacity is defined as a quantity  that reflects the maximum number of mobiles per channel if the  optimal allocation algorithm is employed.  Preliminary results for  two base stations are reported.  The study of the general  problem with multiple base stations is proposed.  Several  approaches are briefly discussed including deterministic models for  the limiting traffic capacity, randomized search algorithms  including simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, and reuse  partitioning.        *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking and Communications Research Program    (703) 306-1949  (703) 306-0621 (FAX)",
