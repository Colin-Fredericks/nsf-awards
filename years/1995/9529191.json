 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529191  Jensen   The National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense and nine other Federal agencies sponsor several National conferences on the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program each year.  One such conference will held in Salt Lake City on October 30-November 1, 1995.  The purpose of the conference is to introduce small high technology firms to the SBIR program and provide a mechanism for face-to-face interactions with government policy makers and program managers.  Under this grant, the Utah Engineering Experiment Station (UEES) will help plan and undertake the conference.  UEES will assist NSF in designing the conference agenda, identifying and contacting speakers, and identifying and contacting past and  current SBIR grantees from Utah.  UEES will also mail conference brochures to appropriate organizations within the region and will initiate press releases and other media contacts for the meeting.   The conference is the most important outreach activity for the SBIR program because it introduces the program to many smaller high technology firms and provides basic information on how to successfully participate in the program.  This grant should significantly increase both the size and effectiveness of the Salt Lake City meeting.",
