 "awd_abstract_narration": "The positive impact of computer-based technology varies in part as a function of interface design and  the individual abilities of users.  The primary cognitive factor driving differences in performance  using computer-based technology is spatial visualization ability.  Four techniques for mitigating the  negative impact of low spatial visualization are discussed.  The use of spatial metaphors and  graphical user interfaces have been promising, but interface apparency, revealing hidden relationships  and showing contingencies, and interface manipulatability, allowing users to directly manipulate  objects and see intermediate steps, are most likely to benefit individuals with low spatial  visualization ability.  The current project explores the interface apparency and interface  manipulatability.  Two studies will be undertaken in which the hidden contingencies of a hierarchical  control structure are revealed through a dynamic graphical screen display.  Two additional studies  will be undertaken which allow users to manipulate objects through intermediate steps rather than  having to infer or visualize those s teps. The results of these experiments and the design concepts  that are subsequently suggested by them will help to provide interface designers with graphical user  interface techniques that will provide gateways through the spatial visualization ability barrier.",
