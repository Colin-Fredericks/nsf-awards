 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is centered on the elucidation of the mechanisms  involved in the recently discovered strong synergistic effect  between ultrasound irradiation and antibiotic therapy on bacterial  cell killing in-vitro.  Preliminary results have been published   Pitt et al. 1994  and a US patent application was filed by Dr.  W.G. Pitt (University of Utah) for the Antimicrobial Delivery to  Bacterial Biofilms.  However, the mechanism producing this  important and promising phenomenon is unclear.      In the present project EPR technology is being applied to monitor  the effect of ultrasound on 1) biofilm permeability and 2) trans-  membrane transport into cells of two paramagnetic compounds  (Tempone and 16-doxylstearate) and a spin-labeled antibiotic  carboxy-proxyl-gentamicin.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa are used as a  model bacterium.  The effect of ultrasonic irradiation of various  frequencies and intensities on the permeability of bacterial  biofilms will be monitored using a specially designed permeation  cell.  The possible disruption of bacterial cell membranes, changes  in lipid bilayer structure, permeability of cell membranes to  paramagnetic probes and antibiotic as well as their partitioning  between the membranes and cytoplasm will be monitored by EPR as a  function of the ultrasound frequently and intensity.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a junior level course in  materials science, and a graduate course entitled \"Environmental  Issues in Polymer Technology\"; lecturing in the departments of  Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics; serving as an ad hoc  member of the committee that administers Brigham Young University's  Women in Science Center; and speaking on past and present life in  Russia and about her friend and colleague, Audrey Sakharov.",
