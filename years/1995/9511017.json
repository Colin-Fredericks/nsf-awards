 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9511017  Buckley, Kathleen M.      The formation of vesicles containing product secreted by cells of  the brain, and other tissues, occurs by two mechanisms.  First,  vesicles may be formed from newly produced proteins as occurs  during neural development, and second, neurons recycle vesicles  following the secretion of included products by the cells.  The  proteins involved in vesicle recycling contain targeting sequences  that direct their recovery by the cell.  In the proposed studies,  Dr. Buckley will investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in  vesicle recycling with particular attention to the molecules  involved in targeting the recovery of the proteins by the cell.   Dr. Buckley will examine the role of a synapse-specific, vesicle  associated protein called AP-3.  The effect of overexpression of  this protein on vesicle recycling will be examined, and several  novel approaches will be used to identify proteins associated with  AP-3 that may also participate in the reuptake of membrane into  vesicles.  The proposed studies will provide fundamental  information on the mechanisms cells in the brain, and throughout  the body for that matter, use to communicate with one another.   These studies have great potential for providing novel information  related to human physiology and pathophysiology.",
