The project will be located on the University of Scranton campus and will begin during the summer of 1995. These newly trained teachers then become important parts of the resource for the nine centers for economic education at various colleges and universities across Pennsylvania. The newly enhanced teachers will in turn provide at least 100 hours of inservice work for an additional 500 teachers during the second and third year of the project in conjunction with the Centers.  The newly enhanced teachers will assist in teaching using a video course called \"Economics USE\" produced by the Annenberg Foundation.  An additional traditional course will fill out the requisite minimum of 100 hours of training.  The outreach activity will begin during the second year of the project and will extend through the third year. The participants will meet at a regional meeting at least once each year to discuss  their courses and share their experiences.",
