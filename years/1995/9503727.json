 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503727  Lavernia    This data analysis system will be dedicated to support materials  research in engineering at the University of California, Irvine,  in the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, and  Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.  The purchase  of this state-of-the-art equipment will be used to support  several ongoing research programs of spray forming processing and  controlled droplet deposition manufacturing.  This equipment will  demonstrate that the advanced studies made possible by the  proposed data analysis system are novel and useful for enhancing  our understanding of the processing microstructure mechanical  properties synergism in spray forming and controlled droplet  deposition processing of materials.  This is an important area  for future advances in spray deposition.  %%%  This droplet analysis equipment will be used in required junior  level laboratory courses for mechanical and civil engineering  students.  This will allow the students to visualize the complex  dynamics associated with deforming droplets during manufacturing,  and will directly impact the research activities of approximately  fifteen graduate students.  Students will utilize the requested  data analysis system to study a variety of important fundamental  phenomena described as follows.  First, the interactions that  occur between atomized droplets and ceramic particles during the  manufacture of metal matrix composites using spray atomization  and deposition.  Of particular interest will be the study of the  impingement of the composite droplets with the substrate.  Also,  the data generated will provide very useful insight into the  mechanisms of porosity generation in discrete droplet processes,  and will be used to conduct parametric studies of droplet  solidification and spreading during net form manufacturing using  controlled droplet deposition.    The details of droplet deformation and impingement are  experimentally unknown.  The experimental data obtained will be   extremely useful il validating existing theoretical models.  The  information generated will impact a number of discrete droplet  manufacturing processes, including but not limited to:  plasma  spraying, spray atomization and deposition, controlled droplet  processes arc spraying, and others.  We wil gain insight in to  the mechanisms that govern the evolution of porosity during the  manufacturing of structural materials using discrete droplet  processes. Porosity represents one of the most critical phenomena  hindering the commercial exploitation of manufacturing processes  that involve discrete droplets.  ***",
