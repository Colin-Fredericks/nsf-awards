 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the design of systematic techniques to  adapt the internal interface and component structure of programs  of moderate  size or larger. Programming tools based on these  techniques could have the  effect of increasing the extent to  which the internal interface structure of  systems can be made  more fluid, that is, evolvable and adaptable. One potential  application is to reorganizing abstraction boundaries in  programs: It is clear  in practice that software structural  architectures are rarely optimal, but the  costs and risks of  adapting them are high. Another potential application is to  the  tailoring of general purpose frameworks and components to  specific  constrained uses, improving performance.    Four questions are addressed: (1)  What semantics-based program  manipulation techniques are needed to support  manipulation of  internal software interfaces represented, for example, as  encapsulation boundaries in programs?  (2) How can soundness and  other  properties of the program manipulation techniques be  established?  (3) What are  the design considerations for the  development of tools that can operate on  programs of increasing  complexity and size?  (4) How can the utility of the  techniques  be assessed for development and re-engineering of internal  software  interfaces and associated components?",
