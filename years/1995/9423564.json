Approximately 500 scientists and students from around the world will attend.  The conference is focused on the molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi.  The meeting consists of six plenary sessions, three poster sessions, informal discussions, and a day devoted to concurrent workshops in specialized areas.  Topics covered are signal transduction, gene expression and genome structure, sexual and asexual reproduction, cell biology and morphogenesis, and plant and animal fungal pathogenesis.  Strong emphasis is placed on the participation of scientists and students from underrepresented groups.  %%%  Fungal genetics is important to a number of areas of biotechnology, such as bioremediation and plant pathology.  The semiannual Fungal Genetics Conference provides a means for scientists studying a number of different fungi to exchange ideas and information.  For example, there has been an extraordinary increase in sophistication of the research approaches used by plant pathologists due, in part, to their exchanges with the basic research community at these conferences.  ***",
