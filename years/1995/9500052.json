 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500052  Ramirez  The objective of this proposal is the purchase of a Beckman DU-  7500 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer with complete programming, data  reduction, and multicomponent analysis capabilities for use on  NSF funded projects.  This instrument will  support three  research areas, 1) amino acid-containing polyanhydrides for  peptide and protein release, 2) the design of an artificial  pancreas for insulin-dependent diabetics, and 3) the inoculation  of microorganisms to enhance the biodegradation of methylene  chloride, toluene, phenol, and trichloroethane.  The department  currently owns two 15 year old spectrophotometers.  The newer  machine will allow faster throughput and more detailed analysis  of results.  This capability will facilitate planned expansion of  research activities in the department.    The equipment could help the researchers achieve new discoveries  in several interesting research area, and have a substantial  impact on biodegradable drug release polymers and the design of  the artificial pancreas.  Moreover, the proposed research area  may serve as a basis for improving the technology for several  areas of implantable materials.  The requested equipment would  enhance a research laboratory substantially, and would provide  more extensive exposure and training for students.  ***",
