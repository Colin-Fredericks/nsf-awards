 "awd_abstract_narration": "This supports the work of Professor Fedor Bogomolov to work on  the geometry of algebraic varieties and related problems in  birational geometry. He proposes to work on constructing minimal  dominant classes of algebraic varieties, asymptotic formulas for  cohomology of lines bundles and a counter-example to Lang's  conjecture in higher dimensions. He also wants to work on the  Sylow subgroups of Galois Groups of certain function fields.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to one of the greatest advances made in the  solution of equations--Galois theory. Algebraic geometry itself  is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which  has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In  its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane  by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and  topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields  as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and  robotics.",
