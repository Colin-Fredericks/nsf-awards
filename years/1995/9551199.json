 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular modeling has evolved from a narrow research interest to  a broad-based tool useful to the bench chemist.   Its use has  become routine in industrial settings, such as the pharmaceutical  industry, where modeling a system prior to conventional  laboratory studies can save thousands of dollars in research and  development costs.   Computer modeling is a tool that many  students will use throughout their professional careers, and  colleges must prepare them for what lies ahead.  This project  integrates computer modeling into its curriculum through the  establishment of a Molecular Modeling Laboratory.   The  university collects, develops, introduces, and disseminates  experiments demonstrating the capabilities of computational  chemistry at various levels of sophistication.   Freshmen use  this technique to demonstrate structural and spectral features of  molecules.   In organic chemistry, students predict reactivity by  calculating charge densities.   Biochemistry students determine  interaction energies for inhibitors of HIV protease, a target  enzyme in AIDS therapy.   In physical chemistry, students  demonstrate the principle of mutual exclusion in vibrational  spectroscopy by combining molecular modeling with IR and Raman  spectroscopy.   Finally, students apply their experiences to  research problems in their senior years.",
