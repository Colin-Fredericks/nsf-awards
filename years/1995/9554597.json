 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554597  Bopp  This proposal requests support for  three (3) Graduate Traineeships in  Hydrology, to be supervised in a  collaborative effort by the  Departments of Earth and  Environmental Science at Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute and  Geological Sciences at Columbia  University.  Faculty from the  Schools of Engineering at both RPI  and CU would also participate as  potential dissertation advisors.  The strengths of the two  institutions related to hydrology  are generally quite distinct, with  RPI emphasizing local and regional  surface and groundwater field  areas, including a considerable  water management component imparted  by Engineering School faculty  participation, with CU, though  Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory  and the Goddard Institute of Space  Studies (NASA), emphasizes  interdisciplinary elements of  number of fields, including  paleoclimatology, atmospheric  science, oceanography,  dendrochronology and tracer  geochemistry applications to the  past several years that offer  important new tools for  investigations of surface and  groundwaters through measurements  of natural tracer substances  including radionuclides, stable  isotopes and chemicals such as  freons.  Students would matriculate  at one of the tow institutions, and  meet PhD requirements applicable  there.  Integration would be  accomplished by having each student  spend at least one semester in  residence at the collaborating  department, attending courses or  doing field and laboratory work  during their first three years.  One member of the academic advisor  team for each student would also be  derived from the collaborating  institution.  Several ongoing joint  research efforts between the two  institutions on surface and  groundwaters in the NYC and Hudson  River valley areas would be  expanded.",
