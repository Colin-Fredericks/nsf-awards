 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent improvements in speech recognition technology has made spoken natural language dialog a viable  means of human-computer interaction.  An important unresolved issue is the handling of  miscommunication.  By studying previously recorded human-human and human-computer dialogs, the  following strategies for reducing miscommunication in natural language dialog will be investigated: (  1) extending an expectation-driven model for input understanding; (2) developing a context-based model  for selective verification of user inputs; and (3) developing methods for engaging in subdialogs for  resolving miscommunications.  These theories will be implemented and evaluated under both simulated  and experimental conditions.  The results from this project will provide a new benchmark in evaluating  the adequacy of current dialog theory as well as provide further data on the characteristics of spoken  human-machine dialog.  The project will also develop several enrichment educational programs in  support of the predominantly rural and less economically developed eastern part of North Carolina.",
