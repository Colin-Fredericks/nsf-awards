 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the problem of selenium contaminated waters. Selenium is presently the primary water treatment challenge for many West Coast petroleum refineries and irrigated farm lands. Selenium can be found in refinery process streams at levels up to 5 mg/L with flowrates reaching 1000 gallons per minute. Similarly, in the Westlands Water District alone, there is a current need for the disposal of 2 million gallons per day of agricultural drainage water with selenium concentrations reaching 0.5 mg/L. Because of its known toxicity and suspected carcinogenicity, the discharge limits as set by the Clean Water Act are very low (0.260 mg/L maximum, 0.035 mg/L continuous for selenium). The California discharge standards allow effluents to contain no more than 0.05 mg/L selenium. Processes developed for selenium removal from drinking water (anion exchange and activated alumina) are too expensive for the treatment of industrial wastewaters. In particular, these processes are appropriate for small volumes of water with low levels of dissolved and suspended solids. These processes are only feasible when competing anions such as sulfates or carbonates are absent. Therefore, TDA Research proposes to develop a new specialty extractant to remove selenium from contaminated water streams. In Phase I we will synthesize novel metal-chelating ligands capable of selectively extracting heavy metal anions, like selenium, in the presence of common but non-hazardous anions such as sulfate, carbonate, and chloride. We will then conduct experiments to demonstrate their ability to selectively extract selenium over competing anions like sulfates.",
