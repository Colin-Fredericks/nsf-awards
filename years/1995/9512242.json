 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Cryogenic Elementary-Particle Detector will be acquired by  a consortium of institutions including Stanford University  (principal institution), UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara.  The instrumentation will be used primarily in the Stanford  Underground Facility (SUF).  The three Principal  Investigators are Blas Cabrera, Professor of Physics at  Stanford and Director of SUF; Bernard Sadoulet, Professor of  Physics at UC Berkeley and Director of the NSF-funded Center  for Particle Astrophysics (CfPA); and David Caldwell,  Emeritus Professor at UC Santa Barbara.  The Cabreras and  Caldwell groups are supported by the DOE High Energy Physics  program.  This unique low temperature facility will be built  to operate large-mass cryogenic particle detectors for  research on dark matter and neutrino physics experiments,  and for investigating industrial applications. Under the  coordination of CfPA, the groups from these three  institutions, along with research personnel from Lawrence  Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), Santa Clara University and the  Institute for Nuclear Research (INR) in Baksan, Russia are  performing a search for the dark matter that makes up at  least 90% of the mass of the universe.  This problem is one  of the most important in cosmology and science today and is  the central theme of the CfPA.  Our team is looking for  weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) such as  supersymmetric particles, which may constitute this dark  matter.  We are expecting to improve the sensitivity of the  previous searches by more than a hundred times within a few  years using novel detectors which operate at very low  temperature.  By simultaneously measuring the ionization and  lattice vibrations created by particle interactions within  crystals, we obtain an unparalleled rejection tool against  ubiquitous radioactive backgrounds which have limited  previous experiments.  The proposed instrument will be operated in the Stanford  Underground Facility (SUF).  It offers about one cubic foot  of space at  a temperature of 10mK and an ultra-low  radioactive background environment.",
