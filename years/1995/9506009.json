 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506009  Forney  This project will investigate the molecular mechanism that controls the expression of variable surface proteins in Paramecium.  A single cell line of Paramecium tetraurelia, stock 51 can express at least 11 different surface proteins, yet only a single type is found on the surface at any one time. We will perform a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that the coding regions of surface protein genes are involved in the regulation of this mutually exclusive expression. Portions of the 51A and 51B genes will be joined using recombinant DNA techniques to form chimeras which will then be transformed into mutants that have deletions of the A and B genes. Normally, the A and B proteins exhibit mutual exclusion from the cell surface, therefore the chimeric proteins will be assayed to determine if they can be coexpressed with the normal A surface protein, the B protein, both or neither. Our preliminary studies have shown that the 51A and 51B genes are regulated at the level of transcription, yet the sequences upstream of the A gene are not sufficient to control the regulation of this transcription. An important preliminary experiment has shown that substitution of -1649 to +885 of the B gene into the A gene results in coexpression of the chimeric gene with the wild type B gene. This remarkable result is the first evidence that a portion of the coding region is important in controlling mutual exclusion. Additional experiments will define the region required for coexpression and investigate its mode of action.  Evidence for post-transcriptional mechanisms that control mutual exclusion will be examined by simultaneously transcribing both the A and B genes using the calmodulin gene promoter. Sequence specific antibodies will be produced against the A and B proteins and used as tools to analyze both the structure and expression of surface proteins.  %%%  This project will investigate the molecular mechanism(s) that control the expression of variable surface proteins in Paramecium.  A  single line of  Paramecium tetraurelia stock 51 can express at least 11 different surface proteins, yet only a single type is found on the surface at any one time.  Using recombinant DNA techniques, chimeras of appropriate genes will be formed and inserted into the organism in order to identify relevant sequences.  Preliminary evidence indicates that a portion of the coding region is important in controlling mutual exclusion.  Additional experiments will define the region required for coexpression and investigate its mode of action.  It is possible that information resulting from this work could have implications for understanding such genetic phenomenon in higher organisms.  ***",
