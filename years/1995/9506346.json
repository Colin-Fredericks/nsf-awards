 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506346  Venuti    Studies on the MyoD family of muscle specific gene regulatory  factors have provided enormous insight into the mechanisms that  regulate myoblast determination and differentiation. But a  fundamental question that remains in muscle developmental biology  is: what activates the myogenic transcription factors? The prime  objective of this proposed research is to identify the earliest  molecular events that commit a pluripotent mesodermal stem cell to  a myogenic fate. These experiments are designed to identify factors  that influence early embryonic muscle cell determination and  explore the capacity of embryonic cells which are not part of the  myogenic program to differentiate as muscle cells. The sea urchin  embryo, whose development is extremely well understood and whose  embryos are particularly amenable to micromanipulation during early  development, will be the experimental organism. Dr. Venuti has  developed an in vitro assay that will enable her to ask if and when  extracellular signaling is required for the determination and  differentiation of muscle precursors or if they develop cell  autonomouqly. These experiments should identify the signals or cues  that initiate the decision to follow a muscle fate and determine  when muscle progenitors first become committed. Dr. Venuti has  cloned and characterized the muscle specific basic helix-loop-helix  (b-HLH) transcription factor, SUM-1, from the sea urchin embryo and  shown that it is activated very early in the muscle differentiation  program. She has shown that SUM-1 can activate muscle specific  reporter elements in vertebrate tissue culture cells and in  microinjected sea urchin embryos. She will examine the consequences  of expressing SUM-1 at premature times and at ectopic locations in  the embryo either alone or in combination with interacting factors.  To identify factors that act directly to regulate the transcription  of SUM-1, the cis regulatory elements and trans acting factors of  the SUM-1 promoter wil l be characterized. Once important temporal  and spatial regulatory elements of the SUM-1 promoter are  identified, she will test the effects of the extracellular signals  identified in in vitro assays on these elements. The combination of  these experiments will help direct long term investigations into  muscle cell fate determination and the role of extracellular  signals in the decision of embryonic cells to commit to a myogenic  fate. They will also provide a better understanding of the role of  the myogenic transcription factor, SUM-1, and other regulatory  molecules in these determination events.  ***",
