 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the   Chemistry Division, Peter Felker of UCLA will continue his spectroscopic   studies of the structures and intermolecular potential energy surfaces of   large neutral molecular clusters.  This work relies on the technique of   rotational coherence spectroscopy (RCS) which Felker helped develop in   his lab at UCLA.  The new studies include the addition of mass selection   and ionization-detected Raman spectroscopy, fully quantum   multidimensional calculations of potential energy surface via a   collaboration with Prof. Zlatko Bacic of NYU, and examining very large   cluster sizes (in some cases, greater than 20 moieties).  Information   will be obtained on geometries, potential energy surfaces, and the   vibrational dynamics of the large clusters.  %%%  By exposing molecules in the gas phase to short, sharp pulses of laser   light at the proper frequency, Prof. Felker can obtain information about   the geometric structures of a relatively small, controlled number of   interacting molecules. This information is very useful for understanding   how molecules behave in the initial stages of a wide variety of chemical   reactions.  In addition, molecular clusters also exist in nature, such as   in the atmosphere as well as in combustion flames. These experiments will   thus provide information relevant to atmospheric as well as combustive   processes and will also permit tests of various theories of   intermolecular interaction.  Ultimately a more detailed understanding of   chemically significant systems will emerge which is relevant to areas   such as the environment or biology.",
