Commercially  obtained software programs is being used to study, record and  analyze electrocardiograms, lung function, somatic reflexes,  electroencephalograms, and simulated muscle physiology.  Students  are able to save data to disc and analyze their own readings and  class data as well.  They are gaining knowledge of basic physiology  and also becoming more computer literate at the same time.  These  exercises are being incorporated into the laboratory schedule and  becoming a part of the standard curriculum for the Human Physiology,  General Biology and Anatomy/Physiology courses at Merritt College,  a two-year community college in Oakland, California.  Other colleges  in the Peralta Community College District, of which Merritt College  is a part, are being introduced to the software.  Laboratory  experiences with the computers and programs are being shared with  these colleges at joint staff development meetings.  Demonstration  sessions are also be held for Merritt College instructors so that  this equipment can be incorporated into most of the biology classes  offered at Merritt College.  As a result of this new technological  capability in our undergraduate laboratories, our students have a  better understanding of basic physiological and biological  principles, as well as an increased level of computer skill and  confidence.",
