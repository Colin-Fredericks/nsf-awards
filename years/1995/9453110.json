This program, however, reflects the environments in which it is  implemented, and is unique in addressing three major gaps in the present knowledge base:  the  effectiveness of support systems in increasing girls' persistence in science, mathematics, and  technology (SMT); the contrasts in effects of interventions in an urban and a rural setting; and  the effectiveness of materials reflecting rural environments in teaching SMT content.  This  program juxtaposes two environments--one urban, the other rural--in an intervention designed  to recruit and retain middle school girls in SMT.  Together, the two sites provide fertile ground  for examining the effect of \"place\" on girls' lives and their relationships with SMT.  The  program has three goals:  (1) to have an impact on the infrastructure of SMT curriculum design  by providing examples of materials and methods indigenous to rural environments and useful in  SMT education; (2) to create advocates for the inclusion of girls in SMT education; and (3) to  add to the knowledge base about rural and urban SMT education with respect to ethnicity and  culture.    The reach the goals, there are four thrusts:  (1) to develop and test a strategy for constructing  a social network made up of community members, family, and peers who advocate for and  support girls' involvement in SMT; (2) to design materials and strategies that recruit and retain  girls in SMT; (3) to conduct an ethnographic study that examines how girls, guardians, and  teachers perceive the role of girls in SMT; and (4) to produce one or more documentaries to  demonstrate (a) the social contexts in which rural and urban girls interact with SMT education,  (b) barriers to their full participation, and (c) changes over time when systems exist to support  and validat e their worth and competency in SMT.  An examination of the intersection of girls  and culture is critical to understanding the participation of girls in SMT.  To effectively  communicate these dynamics, we must give vision and voice to the girls in the project.   Although the project is being implemented in only two sites, the resulting documentary,  ethnographic study, and materials will greatly magnify its impact.  As we examine the support  mechanisms that must be in place and the types of materials and strategies that engage these  communities, we will increase our understanding of how to systematically acculturate girls in  SMT.  ***",
