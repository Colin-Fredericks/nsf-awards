This transition plays a  fundamental role in a very wide variety of physical, biological,  chemical, etc. problems (turbulence in incompressible fluids,  scattering of atoms from metal surfaces, host - parasitoid models  in population dynamics, complex formation in atom-diatom collisions,  etc.). It is also crucial in understanding the nature of numerical  instabilities (numerical chaos) in computational problems. The  proposed approach to the problem combines classical analytic  and modern asymptotic technique (exponential asymptotics).  In our initial studies the model example shows an excellent  agreement between the \"theoretical\" results and numerical simulations.  %%%  The objective of the project is to study the transition from  integrable to nonintegrable (chaotic) dynamics  in singularly perturbed nonlinear systems. This transition  plays a fundamental role in a very wide variety of physical,  biological, chemical, etc. problems. It is also crucial in  understanding the nature of numerical instabilities (numerical  chaos) il computational problems. Of our particular interest  are  situations when the effect of perturbation is exponentially  small in the small parameter of the problem. We propose to apply  the technique of exponential asymptotics to the study of the  analytical mechanism of the onset of chaos in perturbed integrable  systems and to  approximate the dynamics of perturbed systems.  This approach has proven fruitful in our initial investigation.  ***",
