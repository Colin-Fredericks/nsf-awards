 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds acquired for the addition of academic research  instrumentation for multi-user purposes have become  extremely valuable  during these times of expanding collaborative research  efforts and  times of tight funding. Equipment for academic research  which is  accessible to investigators from various disciplines is a  beneficial  and realistic approach to obtaining funds for large pieces  of equipment  that would normally be out of the realm of possibilities for  individual  laboratories.        Mississippi State University is a Land-Grant  Institution and as  such, research is an integral part of the mission of the  university.  There is an electron microscope core facility on campus that  has been a  valuable service to the University's research community for  20 years.  One of the scanning and one the transmission electron  microscopes in  the facility have been upgraded in the previous five years.  Despite the  many established and productive collaborations resulting  from this  resource, we feel it is important to take advantage of  recent  developments in optical microscopy to take us to an even  higher level  of sophistication. We have taken a team approach and  strategically  planned to enhance particular areas across campus and  demonstrated  strength and excellence in these specific areas of research  and  instruction. The university is building the research  infrastructure by  bringing together groups of researchers with different  specific aims  and scientific expertise and enhancing interaction across  the  disciplines. We believe that this cross-disciplinary  approach to  research has proven successful as evidenced by the success  of the  common facilities already in place and are confident that  the  multi-user instrumentation requested in this proposal will  be as  successful.        This proposal requests funds to purchase a Molecular  Dynamics  CLSM 2010 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. This  instrument will  serve the research needs of a number of faculty from var ious  Colleges  throughout Mississippi State University. We have a critical  mass of  investigators whose work involves microscopy of viruses and   iving  cells extending from the molecular level to interactions  between  pathogens, cells and tissues. Dr. Thibaudeau, investigates  processes of  embryonic development, particularly the neural crest, using  the axolotl  and zebrafish as model organisms, Dr. Wise, microtubule  dynamics and  microtubule motors during mitosis, Dr. Hanson, biochemical  characteristics of channel catfish viruses, Dr. Baker, the  functional  morphology of cuticular sensory receptors and identifies  patterns of  sensory neurons and muscles of insect legs, antennae and  palps, and  studies patterning of neurons within the insect CNS, and Dr.  Bumgardner, aspects of cell/material interaction. These  investigators  at Mississippi State are conversant with the advantages and  limitations  of digital imaging fluorescence and reflectance microscopy.  The  diversity in expertise is apparent from the above list and  includes  light, electron and optical microscopy, molecular biology,  spectroscopy, image graphics and structural and  computational biology.  Researchers in other departments across campus have also  expressed an  interest in the availability and use of the confocal  microscope should  purchasing funds become available.        The benefits of a laser confocal microscope are  severalfold; (1)  superior spatial resolution of the often subjective  interpretation of  cellular phenomena is provided by multiwavelength confocal  microscopy,  (2) information as to the three-dimensional organization of  cellular  and subcellular structures and the time dependent change in  their  organization during development and in response to specific  perturbations can be obtained, (3) quantification of  cellular features  and/or processes (e.g. dimensions, frequency of occurrence,  rate of  uptake, organelle movement) and representation of this data  in number  form is possible. These a re only a few applications of the  technology  envisioned by the applicants. Investigations from the  molecular level  to cell/cell and cell/tissue interactions have reached the  limits  imposed by the subjectivity of less modern microscopic  methods and by  the difficulty and labor-intensiveness of manually  processing  sufficient information to create 3-D images and databases  for  statistical analysis. Collectively this group of researchers  at  Mississippi State University have the experience and  collaborations  established to utilize state-of-the-art multiwavelength  confocal  instrumentation to collect and analyze new kinds of  qualitative and  quantitative information, thus increasing the productivity  and value of  our ongoing research. The acquisition of a confocal  microscope would  help insure that Mississippi State maintains state-of-the-  art  microscopy equipment and would be directly useful to  research efforts  in several laboratories across campus and eventually to  neighboring  institutions in the state of Mississippi.",
