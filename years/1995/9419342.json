 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the purchase and development of  several pieces of instrument which will be used to significantly  advance a current research effort supported by the National Institutes  of Health in the area of novel three-dimensional (3-D) microscopy.  Specifically, the 3-D microscopy system currently being investigated  will be developed into a high-resolution fluorescence microscopy system  with real-time reconstruction capability by acquiring an Argon laser,  an x-y computer-controlled scanning system, and a workstation. The  Argon laser at 470 nm extends the microscopy system to be able to  operate in a fluorescent mode, thereby potentially making the system a  very useful and powerful tool in many branches of biology and the life  sciences. The x-y scanning system allows the microscopy system to  perform specimen-scanning instead of optical beam-scanning, thereby  ensuring that the resolution and contrast are identical across the  entire field of view. The workstation will improve the speed of the  analysis of the 3-D data obtained from the microscopy system by an  order of magnitude, thereby making it possible for real-time 3-D data  manipulation and image presentation. The results of the proposed  instrumentation development activity could lead to better 3-D  information processing in areas such as real-time image processing,  microscopy, and data storage and acquisition in the life sciences.",
