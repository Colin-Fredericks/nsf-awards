 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553609  Houde-Walter  The University of Rochester has a  long record of producing  outstanding PhDs in Optical Science and Engineering.  Students know  this, so there is an ample supply  of highly qualified U.S. citizens  that apply for graduate study at Rochester each year.  Student  support is in short supply,  however, and this severely limits  the number of doctorates in Optics produced by Rochester.  Should additional support become available through the NSF  GRT program, we can guarantee the admission of  additional U.S. citizens without in any way compromising the  academic excellence of the doctoral program. Three academic  departments, The Institute of Optics, The Department  of Physics and Astronomy, and the Department of Mechanical  Engineering, have joined forces to attract the GRT program  to  Rochester. Together we propose  several enhancements to our already strong programs. These  include  Optics training in technical communication, training  opportunities for GRT students as future mentors, and  international research opportunities for GRT students. We  have also developed several new approaches to  recruiting underrepresented  minorities and women. These enhancements will benefit the  GRT students and will improve the  quality of doctoral education in  Optics overall.",
