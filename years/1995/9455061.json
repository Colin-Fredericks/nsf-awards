 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geometry of Multivariable Calculus strengthens the  multidimensional geometric intuition that students need, but  usually lack, to understand multivariable calculus. To motivate  students to learn the material, the project includes live  demonstrations by mathematicians from industry on the use of  multidimensional applied and computational geometry, for example,  in the design of automobiles, aircraft, and spacecraft. Many such  applications involve five dimensions: three for space, one for  time, and one coded by color to plot stress, pressure, or other  parameters.    To this end, community college and university instructors may  participate in annual week-long workshops and follow-up activities.  In the workshops, held at community colleges, participants will  spend most of the time researching and designing geometric  material--exercises, worksheets, test problems, and projects--ready  for use in their existing courses in elementary to advanced multi  variable calculus, and in such related courses as linear algebra  and advanced calculus. Follow-up weekends will enable participants  to polish their material in a form suitable for publication, and  follow-up days will allow participants to prepare their material  for presentations at a regional or national conference.  Participants who wish to publish substantial projects may also  request a summer stipend.    Past workshops have resulted in publications and videos on 3-D  graphics, splines, and differentials with several variables. Future  workshops will focus on Computed Tomography, Geometric Modeling,  and Fractal Geometry. Each workshop will take place in June in  Spokane and in September in Seattle. Guest speakers from industry  come from Applied Geometry Corp., The Boeing Company, and the Ford  Motor Company.",
