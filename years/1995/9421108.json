 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-day symposium on the topic `Chemical and   Biological Controls on Mineral Growth and Dissolution Kinetics` and is   made jointly by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Earth   Sciences.  The symposium will be held in April 1995 in Anaheim,   California, in conjunction with an annual meeting of the American   Chemical Society.  Participants from geology, chemistry, biology, and   physics will discuss the factors which control the rates at which   minerals dissolve and reform in the environment.  The presence of   microorganisms in geologic environments has only recently been understood   as an important factor.  One example of mineral dissolution is weathering   of rocks, and the process generally plays a major role in atmospheric   carbon dioxide release, transport of chemicals in waters, acidity of   lakes, and soil formation and fertility.  The conference is intended to   encourage collaboration among scientists in many disciplines and to focus   attention on an issue that is important both in obtaining accurate   climate models and in remediation of contaminated surface- and   groundwaters, soils, and sediments.  The symposium organizer is Dr. Lisa   L. Stillings, Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of   Wyoming.   Proceedings of the symposium will be published.",
