The series is unique to science educational television because it breaks the science gender barrier, showcases both education and science, and, through the use of animation which enables the series to transport children to places they literally could not go, presents content in a unique way.  Season III topics include:  spiders, the Arctic, light, color, the moon, structures, and sound.  Outreach activities will include and expand upon those offered for Seasons I and II.  During Season III, special emphasis will be placed on reaching families.  The project also will use America On-line to promote the series and to communicate the value in and the methods for encouraging children's interest in science.     The same basic administrative, content, and production staff will continue with the project.  Management and editorial control will be the responsibility of Jane Startz, Executive Vice President of Scholastic Productions.  Cheryl Gotthelf, Executive Director of Special Projects for Scholastic Productions will oversee series distribution and utilization, print, research, public relations, promotion, and community and museum outreach.  Science content will continue to be supervised by Michael Templeton with the assistance of an Associate Science Content Director, Fran Nankin.  Kristin Martin will remain in charge of series production.",
