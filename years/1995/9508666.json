 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Bert   Holmes of Lyon College is funded by a Research in Undergraduate   Institutions award to measure unimolecular and bimolecular rate constants   for a series of gas-phase reactions involving halocarbons using chemical   activation.  Studies will include the 1,2-dehydrohalogenation of   haloalkanes for which for which the nature of the transition states will   be determined, and 1,2-dehydration of chemically activated haloalcohols   for which rate constants and threshold energy barriers will be   determined.  The results from these studies will be used to test recent   theories concerning transitions states for bimolecular reactions of   haloalkyl radicals.  This work will provide an improved understanding of   some of the reaction resulting in ozone depletion.  Additionally, the   work will provide strong motivation for undergraduate students to pursue   careers in chemistry.  Ozone depletion is a complex problem involving gas-phase, liquid-phase,   and interfacial reactions.  In order to understand the problem, typical   unimolecular and bimolecular reactions of molecules known to contribute   to ozone depletion must be measured and understood.  Professor Holmes'   work will address some of the issues involved in this serious problem,   while at the same time giving undergraduate students the opportunity to   perform experiments in a timely and important area.",
