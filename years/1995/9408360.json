Bird song is one of the most spectacular cases  on this type of behavior, and much of what has been learned  about the development and evolution of animal communication  has been the result of studies of bird song.  In this  research project, Dr. Searcy will investigate several  aspects of a common characteristic of bird song, different  song types.       In many songbirds, the males sing variable songs which  can be classified into a small number of song types.  For  example, male song sparrows sing five to thirteen different  song types each.  This pattern is found in many species but  little is known about either how such variability in song  develops in the individual or about how it functions in an  evolutionary sense.  A series of experiments conducted in  both the laboratory and the field will investigate:  (1) the  abilities of song sparrows to discriminate variation both  within and between song types;  (2) the ways in which such  variation contributes toward either attracting a mate or  discouraging other territorial males:  (3) the extent to  which song sparrows differ in the amount of variability in  their songs in different regions of the country; and (4) the  role of learning and cultural transmission in the  development of song type variability.  Taken together, the  results of these studies will advance the understanding of  the evolution and development of animal communication.",
