 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in chemical engineering between John F. Brady of the California Institute of Technology and Georges Bossis of the University of Nice.  The objectives of their research are to demonstrate that short-term range repulsion does not change the rheological behavior of hard-sphere suspensions, and to determine the minimum size of a particle which can be used in electrorheological fluids without melting the chemical chains.  The research involves the use of Stokesian dynamics.  The will work on a third, but related project, a monograph on suspension of dynamics.  The U.S. and French investigators have a long-standing collaboration and are co-inventors of Stokesian dynamics.  The U.S. investigator and his group will carry out the electrorheological fluid simulations.  This will be complemented by French investigators work on the simulations of short-term range repulsions.  The project will advance our understanding of the physics of suspensions and their role in the engineering of new materials.",
