The first attempts to resolve problems within high  dimensional geometric topology by studying the algebraic K-theory  of group rings, generally the group rings of fundamental groups of  the manifolds involved.  K-theory turns out to be useful in  studying the homeomorphism classification within a given homotopy  type.  The second will use an analogue of the techniques used in  these geometric problems to study the algebraic K-theory of fields,  specifically the descent problem for fields with topologically  cyclic absolute Galois group.       Topology concerns itself with properties of spaces (curves,  surfaces, and higher dimensional analogues) which do not change  under deformations.  Informally, one thinks of stretching or  shrinking part or all of the space.  For instance, if one thinks of  the capital letter \"A\" as a space, one could print it with  different fonts, and although the results would change (the size,  as well as the slant of the character, or the height of the  horizontal line within the character), it would not change  topologically, since the one figure could be stretched or bent into  the other.  Humans are able to recognize visually the fact that  these figures are topologically the same, since we are easily able  to read text written in either font.  This notion of equivalence is  referred to as \"homeomorphism.\"  There is an even stronger notion  of equivalence referred to as \"homotopy equivalence,\" which, for  instance, allows arcs not only to be stretched but to be compressed  into points.  Thus the capital letter \"H\" is homotopy equivalent  but not homeomorphic to the capital letter \"X,\" since one can  obtain \"X\" from \"H\" by compressing the horizontal line to a point.   However, capital \"O\" is not homotopy equivalent to \"I,\" since the  \"O\" contains a loop while the \"I\" does not.  Homotopy equivalence  is typically an easier relation to determine than homeomorphism.   This proje ct concerns itself with the problem of classifying up to  homeomorphism spaces which are already homotopy equivalent, for a  certain family of \"homotopy types.\"  Surprisingly, although this  problem seems entirely geometric, the techniques required use  heavily abstract algebra.  This interplay between algebra and  geometry is one of the most exciting areas in mathematics today.  ***",
