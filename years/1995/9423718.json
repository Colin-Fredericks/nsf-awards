The practical benefits of rapid growth in domestic animals is obvious in terms of dairy, egg, and meat production.  Nonetheless, few organisms in their natural environment grow as fast as they are capable, suggesting there are negative effects.  Although the positive effects of rapid growth are very well known, almost nothing is known about the negative effects.  This study will examine the benefits of rapid growth and possible constraints on growth rate in a common sport fish, the pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus).  Some populations of pumpkinseed show a rapid juvenile growth rate in response to competition with bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus).  Fish from these populations will be compared with fish from lakes without bluegill competitors (and known to grow more slowly) to determine what effects rapid growth has had on:  a) risk-taking to obtain food,  b) slowed or compromised skeletal development,  c) decreased ability to store lipids for the first winter of life, and  d) decreased immune response to both bacterial and parasitic infection.",
