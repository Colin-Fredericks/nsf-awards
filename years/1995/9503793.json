 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this continuing research project is to  develop more  systematic theorems and methods for analyzing difficult  algorithms.  These methods are briefly characterized as follows: (1)  Perturbation theory for recurrence equations in  computer science.    Perturbation theory is a  mathematical technique which was developed   for analyzing difficult differential equation problems in mathematical physics.    The research objective is to  develop a tool kit of theorems that can apply to  recurrences ranging from advanced issues in hashing  to the elementary concerns  of basic irregular divide-and-conquer algorithms; (2) Replacing operator   methods in performance analysis.  Operator methods also arise  in the analysis of  physical methods, and have been used to establish  conservation laws, and compute the time evolution of    fundamental quantities such as energy in complicated physical processes.    A variation on these methods has  been used to analyze several   complicated processes in computer science, including coalesced hashing.    However, recently it has been shown that coalesced  hashing can be   analyzed more completely and more easily by standard analytic methods.    The goal in  this part is to capture  algebraic properties of  operator methods, to translate them into analytic  formulations, and to use these translated    formulations to analyze difficult algorithms; (3) Probabilistic estimates.    A growing number of computer science results use large deviation bounds,    including fault tolerance analysis, the analysis of throughput   in probabilistic situations, and the analysis of probabilistic algorithms.    Many computer  science applications introduce varieties of extra    constraints, which render the standard theorems inapplicable.    The final goal is to continue research on probabilistic  estimation methods.",
