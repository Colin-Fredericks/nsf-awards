 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550038  Sandler    Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) in collaboration with  Inverness Reqearch Associates and Horizon Research, Inc., will  form a collaborative with education and community leaders who are  currently involved in long-term efforts to reform science  education.  Over five years, the Center will support the  initiation, implementation, and institutionalization of district-  wide, K-8 science education reform efforts in school districts  nationwide.    The primarily activities of the Center will be Site-specific  consultation and support, and Institutes and Seminars focusing on  critical issues, common interests and role-specific challenges.  These institutes will provide opportunities for participants to  capitalize on cross-district sharing and collaboration.    Specifically the Center will:    1) Provide assistance, consultation and professional development  activities for at least 15 large school districts who are  beginning the science education reform process.  The Center will  help them to develop and effectively implement a strategic plan  for district-wide science reform focusing on building leadership  capacity to sustain and institutionalize quality science  instruction.  2) Provide professional development activities for districts with  reform programs already in progress.  These cities will  participate in the Center as leaders, as well as, participants in  professional development opportunities.  3) Develop and support a cadre of education leaders from the  districts participating in Center activities.  These specialists  will become leaders for others implementing science education  reform nationwide.  4)Establish a coalition among all participating districts who are  engaged in district-wide reform of science so that by the end of  the five years, there will be a self-sustaining permanent network  of district communicating with one another and working together  with the capacity to provide continuing assistance to additional  districts attempting to reform th eir science education programs.    The cost sharing for the project will be 34% of the NSF portion.  ***",
