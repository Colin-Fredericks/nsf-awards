 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511504  HUMMEL    This research will develop a computer system to model how people  learn schemas from examples.  Schemas are knowledge structures  that describe general situations, events, rules, or  relationships.  For example, a Restaurant Schema might specify  the kinds of events that take place in restaurants, and the  relationships between the actors in those events (e.g., chefs,  waiters, and customers, etc.); a Family Relation Schema might  specify the kinds of relationships that define various family  members, such as sisters, brothers, parents, uncles, etc.  A  schema is very general, in that it refers to many specific  situations, and also highly structured, in that it specifies the  relationships between objects, events, or even between other  relationships.  Psychologists and computer scientists have long  recognized the utility of schemas as a basis for reasoning:  If  one can recognize an object or situation as an instance of a  general schema, then one can use the schema to reason about the  specific object or situation.  For example, the Family Relation  Schema tells us to expect that Mom's brother, Bob, is our uncle,  and that if Bob has children, then they will be our cousins.  Due  to the schema, it is not necessary to learn the family relations  for every individual separately.  Although the generality and  structured nature of schemas make them extremely useful forms of  knowledge, they also make them very difficult to model:  Traditional symbolic approaches to computer modeling are good at  representing structured information, but they have difficulty  flexibly matching specific instances to general facts; by  contrast, connectionist models are good at flexibly matching  instances to general categories, but they have great difficulty  representing structured information (such as rules and  relationships).  Perhaps for this reason, no one has ever  developed a formal and general model of schema-based learning and  reasoning.  Hummel and Holyoak have developed a computer mo del of  analogy that combines a connectionist architecture with the  capacity to represent and learn relational structures.  The  model's capacity to represent structured information in a  flexible, general manner makes it an ideal vehicle for simulating  human schema learning and use.  The research will apply the  model's approach to the representation of structure to the  problems of representing, learning, and using schemas.  The  result will be a model that can (a) learn general schemas from  specific examples, (b) match new instances to learned schemas,  and (c) use the schemas to make inductive inferences about the  new examples.  The model will be the first formal theory of human  schema-based reasoning, and will contribute substantially to our  understanding or human reasoning is a wide variety of domains.   It will also be the first working computer system to use schemas  to reason flexibly about general knowledge domains.    ***",
