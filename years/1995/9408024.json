A central theoretical and practical  concern in the study of animal behavior, therefore, is how  and why cooperative groups of animals are formed.  Many of  our insights into the biology of cooperation have come from  the study of social insects such as paper wasps, which also  can provide a  model system  in which experimental studies  of cooperation are possible at relatively low cost.  Two of  the factors which affect cooperation in many species are the  degree of relatedness among individuals and ecological  pressures (especially restricted resources) that favor  cooperation.       In this research, Dr. Nonacs will examine the decision  that female paper wasps make to either be cooperative or not  to be cooperative when founding their colonies.  A  combination of DNA fingerprinting and behavioral observation  will be used to determine how genetic relatedness determines  the formation of cooperative units, affects the levels of  aggressive conflicts between female wasps founding new  colonies and influences the decisions of the wasps to feed  different young within the nest.  The resulting data will  allow the measurement of the relative importance of genetic  relatedness and ecological pressures in the formation of  cooperative groups.       This research will also increase our understanding of  where and how wasp colonies are started.  While wasps in the  right places are important control agents of pest insects,  wasps nesting near humans are a nuisance and a danger.  Therefore, this research has the potential applied benefit  of giving us more information about how to encourage wasps  to nest where needed and not where they are unwanted.",
