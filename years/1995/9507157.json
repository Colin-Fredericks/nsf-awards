 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507157  Gasser    The ovules of higher plants play a central role in plant  reproduction. In addition, because ovules are the precursors to  seeds, ovule development is a critical component of crop  productivity. Ovule development includes processes which typify  development in all multicellular organisms and can be used as a  model for studying fundamental mechanisms regulating morphogenesis  and tissue differentiation in all organisms. Dr. Gasser will use  Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism for elucidation of the  genetic pathway regulating ovule development. The primary tool in  this analysis will be a set of mutants with defects in genes which  regulate this process. He has already isolated five such mutants  with specific lesions in ovule development and will continue to add  to this set through ongoing mutant screens. He will determine the  specific phenotypic effects of these mutations and will  characterize their interactions through epistatic analyses. The  results of these studies will allow identification of critical  regulatory steps in ovule morphogenesis and will enable the  construction of models of the regulatory pathway governing ovule  development. Completion of the proposed research will significantly  contribute to our knowledge of regulation of reproductive  development in higher plants and to a general understanding of  genetic control of morphogenesis and histogenesis that can be  applicable to all organisms.  ***",
