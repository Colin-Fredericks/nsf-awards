 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at  California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), is embarking  on a major new initiative to develop a Center for Molecular  Structure which will serve the largest four-year and  Masters' degree- granting public university system (CSU) in  the United States. We have recently been designated as the  site for a core facility for research and training in this  area by the California State University Program for  Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB). Our  campus, the University system and industry enthusiastically  support this project and have committed well over 50% of the  costs of developing this core facility.  The x-ray  laboratory of the Center will be housed in renovated  facilities specifically designed for this Center, to be  located in McCarthy Hall adjacent to our new 60,000 square  foot Science Laboratory Center (SLC).        Critical to the efficient and timely establishment of  this core facility are NSF funds which we are requesting  here to acquire a modern, high-powered crystallographic  system and computer workstations for small molecule and  macromolecular applications. The Siemens instrumentation we  have selected is a completely integrated multiwire area  detector/rotating anode crystallography system for  macromolecules that can also be used as a small molecule  diffractometer. The configuration of the Silicon Graphics  workstations and software library, the first of its kind in  the CSU system, is ideally suited to meeting the needs of  our students and faculty in a variety of structural studies.  These include 1 ) structural studies on bacterial toxins,  bovine ceruloplasmin, horse spleen and serum ferritins, gly-  and phe-tRNA synthetases from E. coli, and model complexes  of heme proteins; 2) structural studies of novel  organometallic compounds, di- and trinuclear platinum  compounds, and lithium salts of dianions; 3) molecular  modeling studies of hemoproteins and organotin-based polymer  systems; 5) comput ational studies on oxyallyl cation  chemistry; 6) lipid bilayer simulations. The Director of the  Center is Dr. Katherine Kantardjieff, who joined the CSUF  faculty in 1989 from the Molecular Biology Institute and  Department of Chemistry at UCLA, where she worked in David  Eisenberg's group studying the structure of diphtheria  toxin.        The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at CSUF  is committed to high-quality  research programs as an integral part of both our  undergraduate and graduate education programs.  The 20 full-  time faculty in the Department have established an exemplary  record of external funding and consistently publish in the  top peer-reviewed journals in their field. This project,  however, will advance not only the research and training  capabilities of our Department, but also those of the entire  20 campus CSU system. Facilities within the Center will  complement, not duplicate, existing NMR, EPR and electron  microscope facilities at CSUF and within the CSU.  Facilities within the Center will provide molecular modeling  capabilities and computational power to the entire CSU by  means of the existing high-speed fiber optic network. The  Center for Molecular Structure will promote the advancement  of knowledge at the mainstream of scientific endeavor and  make a significant contribution to the training and  development of the next generation of scientists.",
