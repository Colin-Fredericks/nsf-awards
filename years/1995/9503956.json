 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503956  Triantafyllidis  The proposed study is a combined experimental and modeling effort  to provide a consistent, time-efficient general purpose formulation  for the design against springback, due to external load removal and  trimming, of stamped aluminum panels with arbitrary geometries.   The basic idea in this work is the efficient use of the membrane  solution of the sheet at the end of the punching phase in order to  predict its final elastically relaxed shape.  An initial  experimental/analytical feasibility study which used the proposed  idea has been completed for axisymmetric stampings.  In the present  investigation the plan is to generalize the results of the  axisymmetric study to stampings with arbitrary geometry.  A general  asymptotic modeling technique is proposed to formulate the problem  in question and a set of automotive production dies is also  planned.  The results of the modeling work will be incorporated  into a general purpose FEM code which will be used for design  purposes by GM and ALCOA as part of an Industry-University  Collaborative Project under the GOALI Initiative.  ***",
