 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:   This project supports the participation of a delegation of US scientists and engineers in `The Nathiaghali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs/Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development` planned for June 22 to July 13, 1995 in Nathiaghali, Pakistan.  The Program is for three weeks:  The first week is for discussions on `frontiers of physics` including fundamental structure of matter, astrophysics and cosmology, and advances in condensed matter physics; the second week is for `energy, environment and sustainable development` including energy sources, demand and supply, energy technology innovations, and energy and the environment; and the third week is for `energy safety systems` including risk benefit assessment in energy systems, reactor safety and the environment, and reliability enhancements in power reactors.  The participants include speakers from the United States, Europe, and Pakistan, and attendees from China, India, Central Asia, the Middle East, as well as from Pakistan.  The participants will include university faculty members and graduate students.  Proceedings will be published, covering the presentations and the important results of discussions.  Scope:  This project supports US scientists' participation in one of the most successful regional meetings that attract strong participation from most of the developing countries in Asia, especially South and Central Asia, and also from China, South East Asia and Africa, and some participation from Latin America.   The speakers from the US and from the European countries contribute to the extensive exchange of information, and gain from interacting with the scientists from the various developing countries represented.  Partial support for the meeting comes from a number of sources including the Government of Pakistan, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Islamic Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization.  The meeting is likely to contribute to advancing science in the developing countries, and to help US scientists by increasing their interaction with these developing countries and their abilities to advance US scientific interests.",
