 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452988  McCully  The Fresno community and the School District, led by new superintendent, Charles McCully came together to elevate the quality of education for the children a year before responding to USI. However, it is clear that the development of the Fresno Urban Systemic Initiative , guided by the goals and framework  of the national USI, has enabled the City and District to give concrete form in mathematics, science and technology to their original vision.   Evidence of this vision made concrete includes:  the alignment of mathematics and science content with recently raised state and national standards; pedagogy selected to facilitate children's exposure to the thinking skills needed to access the new more complex curriculum; and changing policies that will advance USI reforms. The Fresno USI team has recognized and begun to develop innovative solutions to  one of its greatest challenges that is to ensure that students with limited English proficiency have equitable access to all of the reform efforts, especially curricular and instructional improvements. Two important strengths essential to reform of the Fresno Unified School District are revealed by these two accomplishments: they can  move rapidly from a vision to concrete achievements, and they can respond to deficiencies such as attention to the needs of the Limited English Proficient (LEP) students pointed out by the first review panel. Also,it,s important to note that  Fresno's many other strengths greatly heighten the probability that they will achieve their goals.These are:  clear strategies for accomplishing goals; strategies and programs to provide  access to mathematics and science reforms for students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP); an outstanding technology plan; commitment to the USI plan from the Teachers Union; the project director's broad knowledge and awareness of the importance of finding and observing successful models; an effort to seek out more cost effective methods; and broad-based and committed community  support. Finally,their reforms demonstrate the belief that all children can learn when provided with appropriate support as delineated in their USI plan                   ??",
