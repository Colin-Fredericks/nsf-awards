 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year fellowship for postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Botelho, whose doctoral training is in political science, the opportunity to obtain training in the conceptual and methodological foundations of historical research in the area of science, technology, and society at Johns Hopkins University.  The creation in the mid-forties of the Aeronautics Technological Institute, with the assistance of MIT and the American government, was a watershed in Brazil's postwar modernization.  Dr. Botelho will explore the international and domestic factors in the transfer of a technological model, the MIT model, from the United States to Brazil, and will assess the consequences for Brazil's technology development.  Johns Hopkins is an ideal institution for the postdoctoral study given that similar historical studies are being carried out for other developing countries there.  This research will contribute to the ongoing comparative and theoretical re-assessment of the role of engineering communities and their values in national development in the history of technology and, critically, to the historical knowledge of technological change in developing countries.  In addition, it contributes to our understanding of the evolution of hybrid technical professions and institutions--in aeronautics, electronics, and computer science--critical to postwar development in developed and developing countries.  Finally, the research will shed new light on the complex interplay of political, technological, and cultural elements contributing to a conceptual framework for analyzing technology transfer between nations and for assessing the role of the translation of foreign ideas, values, and institutions in the international diffusion of engineering disciplines and practices.  Given the current scientific and technological dilemmas facing the majority of developing countries, such a framework could assist in the design of more effective and sound policies.",
