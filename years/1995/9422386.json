The project involves searching all editions of  the chosen newspapers for any articles, editorials, columns, or  letters that mention the selected representatives, coding the  7,500 to 8,000 items for their content, analyzing the coded data  with quantitative methods, and analyzing all individual items  with qualitative methods.    The project is designed to determine whether local newspapers  report the kinds of information that citizens would need to hold  representatives accountable for their actions in office.  The  basic assumption is that unbiased and readily\\y available  information enhances the prospects for accountability, while  incomplete or biased information serves to thwart it.  The study  will explore the regularity with which local newspapers report  roll-call votes, the amount of information newspapers provide  about the issues under consideration and why representatives  voted as they did, the extent to which newspapers cover  representatives' other activities, including introducing bills,  holding hearings, and building coalitions, and the types of  policy issues that attract journalists' attention.  The research  will also investigate whether newspapers recount representatives'  policy-related activities during subsequent electoral campaigns.  ***",
