This meeting will cover advances in quantum-confined structures as in the past meetings, but the emphasis for the 1995 meeting will be on new materials and new approaches for quantum confinement, and novel  light emitters.  Further new themes for 1995 will be photon confinement in microcavity and related structures, and new measurement techniques combing ultra-high spatial resolution wit ultrashort time resolution.    Topic Areas Include:    *Fundamental and device aspects of lower dimensional material structures  *New materials for quantum confinement  *Physics of novel light emitting structures such as QED effects in microcavities, detectors and modulators.  *Optical and optoelectronic phenomena derived from quantum confinement  *Techniques for synthesis and nanofabriation of ultrasmall structures  *New measurement techniques based on STM, NSOM an dAFM for studying quantum-scale phenomena    Funding for this meeting is requested to ensure an international and domestic representation by the best people in this specific community. In order to accomplish this goal, we feel there is a need to offer students, junior university faculty and other faculty partial travel support.",
