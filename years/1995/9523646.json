 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the biggest roadblocks preventing people from using natural language to interact with computers is that understanding language perfectly is difficult, even for people.  Recently, theories have been proposed explaining how interactors can behave appropriately---even if they differ about the meaning of some part of the discourse.  This project aims to extend these ideas so that their effectiveness can be tested and their insights put to use.  Extending earlier work comprises four tasks: elicitation and collection of examples; theoretical extensions; evaluation of the extended model within its logical framework; and the construction of applications supporting a user study. The planning activities are to include a review of the relevant literature; preliminary experimentation with candidate methods of data collection and validation;  discussions with researchers whose expertise bears on these issues; and the construction of two  prototype applications that discuss medical information with doctors and patients, respectively.  Upon  completion of these activities, a detailed plan for extending prior a pproaches to misunderstanding  will be developed.  If computers can be enabled to address misunderstanding, they will be better able  to understand natural language reliably and robustly, which is essential if they are to help those who  need them most, non-computer-experts.",
