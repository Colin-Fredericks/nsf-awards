More specifically, the funds help students to attend the meeting.  A conference mailing will announce a Graduate Student Competition for Best Student Paper Award.  The ten best abstracts submitted by graduate students will be awarded a check for $250 each to help their contributors attend the meeting.  Additionally, during the meeting, a $500 award will be given for the best student presentation independent of the first contest.  A total of three awards for  $500 each will be given.  The audience will be asked to rate each of the talks presented by graduate students.  We believe that this competition will increase the attendance at the meeting and will also favor a strong  interaction between  graduate students and the scientists attending the symposium.  The additional $500 is requested for preparation of awards certificate and announcement mailing to encourage student participation.    The symposium is dedicated to recent research in transport in mesoscopic structures (both semiconducting and superconducting).   The symposium will address all aspects of fabrication, characterization and modeling of  both semiconductor and superconductor mesoscopic structures and coupled systems.   This symposium is a follow-up of the Second International Symposium on Quantum Confinement which was organized as part of the 185th meeting of the electrochemical society in San Francisco (May 22-27, 1994).  ***",
