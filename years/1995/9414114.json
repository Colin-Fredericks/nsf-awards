A model is considered in which binding  agreements can, in principle, be written among any group of  agents.  The project rigorously analyzes the agreements that  occur in an equilibrium of free and unrestricted negotiation.  At  the most fundamental level, the investigators address the issue  of how to conceptualize the series of negotiations that  ultimately lead to the signing of an agreement.  This will make  an important contribution to bargaining theory because the  literature on bargaining over actions of games is nonexistent.   The principal focus of the research is on the question of  efficiency in binding agreements.  This project challenges the  consensus among economists that if binding agreements can be  written in the absence of informational asymmetries, then the  gains from cooperation will be fully exploited.  The  investigators will generalize examples from their previous work  of binding agreements in the presence of external effects that do  not correspond to an efficient or cooperative outcome.  These  results arise only when there are three or more agents.  The  emergence of inefficiency is closely related to the assignment of  property rights.    This line of basic research is relevant to the Human Dimensions  of Global Change because it will provide new insights and better  tools for analyzing negotiations needed to reach binding  environmental agreements.  For example, the famous Coase Theorem  was used to show that competitive markets will produce efficient  agreements in the presence of pollution.  The investigators'  research shows that there is a breakdown of efficiency when the  right to pollute is the assigned status quo.",
