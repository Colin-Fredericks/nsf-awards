Glauser, Department of Mechanical and  Aeronautical Engineering, Clarkson University, to pursue with Dr. Hyung Jin Sung,  Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and  Technology, for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on control of separated  turbulent flows.  The turbulent flow of a fluid over a bluff body (block) will be studied.  For  this flow, the collaborators will (1) study the influence of control on the spatial structure of  the Proper Orthogonal decomposition (POD) eigenfunctions and (2) assess whether a POD  based low dimensional dynamical systems model is feasible in this flow.    Fundamental separated flows are encountered in many practical fluid engineering situations  such as ducts and heat exchangers.  The separated, reattached, and recirculating flow  downstream of the separation point greatly enhance the amount of heat, mass, and  momentum that are transferred, when compared to flows without separation at similar  Reynolds number.  Thus, this research is of practical as well as theoretical interest.  The  collaborators have extensive experience with separated flows and the application of the POD  to various flows.  Their strengths complement one another so that their cooperative effort  should be truly beneficial in furthering understanding of the control of separated flows.  This  project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers  through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported  by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
