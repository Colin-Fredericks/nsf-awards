 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to acquaint faculty, general chemistry  coordinators, and lab directors with the theory and practice of  cooperative learning in the general chemistry laboratory.   Participants are invited from all institutional settings including  two-year and four-year public and private colleges and  universities.  Cooperative modes of instruction that have proven to  produce remarkable improvements in student attitudes toward  chemistry, persistence, and success in learning have been developed  at Clemson University.  The method uses a new set of laboratory  software, SuperChemLab, for the project-style laboratory exercises,  which will be available to participants for their own applications.   The workshop assumes that participants will adapt and adopt the  cooperative learning mode for their own laboratories, and several  features of the program including hands-on experience are aimed at  facilitating this process.  Instructor's manuals, texts, and  background materials will be provided and considered in small  groups during the workshop.",
