 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on multielectron oxidation-reduction processes   by Daniel G. Nocera of the Chemistry Department, Michigan State   University.   The long-term goal  is to develop detailed understanding of   the mechanism of multielectron processes in order to enable rational   design of reactions such as atom transfer and reductive elimination.     Reactions of metal-localized excited states of quadruply bonded   metal-metal complexes will be investigated.  Tungsten and molybdenum   complexes and mixed-valence binuclear rhodium fluorophosphine complexes   will be synthesized for use in the studies.  The photoexcited   intermediates generated  will be characterized by picosecond and   nanosecond time-resolved excited state spectroscopy.    Solar photoconversion has great potential as an efficient means of   promoting complex chemical transformations which require movement of more   than one electron.  Such reactions occur in natural systems during   nitrogen fixation, but chemists have yet to understand the reaction   details well enough to be able to design reactions in which sunlight   rather than heat is used beneficially.  Much of what is known involves   one-electron processes.  This project will provide additional information   on reactions involving bond breaking and bond making, which are   fundamental to chemical transformations and generally involve multiple   electrons.",
