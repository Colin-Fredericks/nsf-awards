The program will have an emphasis on marine  related remote sensing in accordance with the needs of the  local region.  The PI's research plan will focus on  developing advanced signal processing techniques for  extracting information from remotely sensed data from the  ocean. With this goal in mind, it is proposed to develop a  technique based on artificial neural networks to extract  ocean surface wave information from synthetic aperture radar  images of the ocean and to improve wind speed and  directional estimates from radar scatterometers.  The two  tier approach is expected to test the applicability of this  technique to both imaging and non-imaging applications.  Through a grant from the Engineering Foundation the PI is  currently supporting a graduate student for a year to study  the properties of artificial neural networks and how they  may be utilized for nonlinear mapping applications such as  the two proposed projects.  It is planned to continue this  effort as a part of the proposed research program.  The  ultimate research objective is to use remotely sensed field  data along with in-situ measurements to test the inversion  schemes.  If successfully completed, the technique is  expected to provide greater insights into the physics of the  measurement processes.  There is also the potential for  using similar techniques in other areas of ocean remote  sensing such as marine pollution monitoring.  ***",
