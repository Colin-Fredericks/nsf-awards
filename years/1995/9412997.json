The Black Rock Forest Consortium, a group of fourteen New  York-area academic institutions, will install environmental  monitoring facility at its field station, the 1500 hectare  Black Rock Forest.  The Black Rock Forest is located in the  Hudson Highlands, 80 km north of New York City, and  possesses a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic habitats  for study.  It has carefully protected and managed for  nearly a century, and has been utilized by the Black Rock  Forest Consortium since 1989.  The forest has become a focal  point for scientific field studies and education for  thousands of faculty and students from Consortium  institutions.    Despite many natural features that make it a logical  location for scientific field work, the Black Rock Forest  lacks a meteorological facility.  An increasing trend in use  of the station for biological and environmental science  studies that created a need for such a facility.  The  facility will continuously record a range of important  meteorological variables at two locations within the Forest,  and will include precipitation sampling equipment.  Data  will be downloaded, and entered into a widely-available  database, and equipment will be maintained on a regular,  weekly basis by Black Rock Forest staff.  The facility will  be one component of a regional network of monitoring  stations spanning 330 km along the Hudson River.  The  resulting data will significantly improve the quality of  ongoing studies in plant ecology, aquatic ecology,  dendrochronology, and biogeochemistry, and will stimulate  the expansion of scientific and educational use of the Black  Rock Forest.",
