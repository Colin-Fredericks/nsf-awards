 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9512001  Katherine Terrell      This project will extend previous NSF-funded work on the transition to a market economy and its effect on the labor market.  The project will take advantage of a \"natural experiment\" involving the Czech and Slovak Republics.  The two countries began with common institutions, laws, policies, regulations, currency, prices, wages and labor productivity, yet have followed very different paths away from communism.  The Slovak Republic has seen its unemployment rate soar while the Czech Republic has experienced among the lowest unemployment rates in Europe.  Finding the causes of these very different experiences is an important policy question since chronic high unemployment has begun to threaten the viability of the newly democratic governments in the former Soviet bloc.  This project will build on previous work that focused on unemployment duration and the flow out of unemployment by looking also at the flows between unemployment, employment, and out-of-the labor force as well as job-to-job flows.  The project will also look at wage adjustment and its effects on the labor flows.    An important part of this project is the creation of new data sets on labor market experiences of workers in the two countries.  A follow-up questionnaire on a randomly selected set of 6,000 newly unemployed workers will look at their destination after unemployment.  In addition, a retrospective questionnaire will be administered to 5,000 individuals in both republics.  Those sampled will be asked for a retrospective employment history going back to 1991.  This will allow the P.I.s to distinguish employment in jobs held under communism from employment in new jobs created since the transition to democracy and free markets.",
