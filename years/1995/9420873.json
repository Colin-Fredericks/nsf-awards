The workshop has four  objectives. First it will allow scholars trained as linguists who  also are fluent in a sign language to come together in order to  address a well-defined set of empirical questions about sign  language structure and its linguistic representation. The answers  to these questions will take us a step further in distinguishing  what is language-particular about sign structure from what is  common to all sign languages. The group of sign languages  targeted in this workshop are: Italian Sign Language, Norwegian  Sign Language, Langue des signes quebecoises, Sign Language of  the Netherlands, Japanese Sign Language, Hong Kong Sign Language,  British Sign Language, and American Sign Language. The second  objective of the workshop is to facilitate the formation of new  cross-linguistic sign language research based on a common set of  theoretical tools, to be presented in the lectures and readings  of the workshop. The third objective of the workshop is to lay  the groundwork for an edited volume on the topic of  cross-linguistic issues in sign language phonology and  morphology. Finally, by conducting this workshop at the LSA  Summer Linguistic Institute we expect to open the discussion of  cross-linguistic issues in sign languages to interested groups of  students and scholars and to facilitate interdisciplinary work  concerning the analysis of gesture and sign.",
