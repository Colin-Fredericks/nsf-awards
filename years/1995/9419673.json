 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a group proposal to acquire an automated DNA  sequencing machine for shared use by investigators at  the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution. The equipment to be purchased  includes a DNA sequencing machine and an auxiliary  workstation for analyzing data produced by the  sequencing machine.    Comparative molecular biology has transformed studies of  evolution, ecology, biogeography and biodiversity into  experimental sciences. Using measures of similarity for  ribosomal RNAs, microbiologists can measure genetic  differences between members of the same species or  reconstruct phylogenies for organisms that span the  largest evolutionary distances. Mitochondrial gene  sequences provide quantitative genetic tools for  biogeography studies in both microbial and multicellular  systems. With the advent of polymerase chain reaction  techniques, almost any gene family can be incorporated  into biodiversity investigations. For any one of these  enterprises, the major expense in terms of financial and  human resources is that required to determine DNA  sequences. Numerous research projects in the Molecular  Evolution Program, the Ecosystems Center at the Marine  Biological Laboratory and the Biology Department at the  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution rely upon  comparative analyses of ribosomal RNA sequences,  mitochondrial genes or other nuclear coding regions.  Despite excellent computational facilities for  integrating results of these studies, no automated  equipment is available for sequencing DNA in the Woods  Hole Scientific Community. If laboratories at the Marine  Biological Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution are to remain competitive in studies of  molecular evolution/systematics, molecular ecology and  emerging programs in biodiversity, they must have access  to shared instrumentation for rapid, automated DNA  sequence determinations. The principal benefit will be a  dramatic reduction in human resources required for DNA   sequence analyses. In addition, this multi-user  instrument will further encourage interdisciplinary  approaches to studies of molecular ecology, biodiversity  and molecular systematics/evolution.    Five of the laboratory's represented in this application  will form a consortium to sequence ribosomal RNAs from  prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Their research objectives  include studies of molecular systematics, molecular  ecology, biodiversity, and biogeography. Through the  common administration and use of this instrumentation,  it will be possible to share many costly reagents  including a library of primers for rapidly sequencing  rRNA coding regions from both prokaryotes and  eukaryotes. Other groups will use the machine to study  structure and functional constraints in coding regions  such as cytochrome P450, actins, and receptors. Most of  these projects represent existing collaborations within  the Woods Hole Scientific Community. The automated  sequencer will also be available to visiting scientists  in the Woods Hole Scientific Community including summer  investigators at the Marine Biological Laboratory and  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
