 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423920  Raymond  Freezing resistance in polar fishes is usually attributed to  noncolligative peptide antifreezes.  In 1991, it was found that  some arctic fishes increase the freezing point depression of their  body fluids by producing high concentrations of glycerol in  winter.  Subsequent studies of this phenomenon have led to a  realization that other inorganic ions and organic osmolytes have  important roles in freezing resistance in many polar fishes, and  possibly other roles as well.  Prominent among these solutes are  trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) and urea, which are more widely  distributed in polar fishes than glycerol.  These studies have  lead to several unusual findings concerning the synthesis, roles,   conservation and distribution of these osmolytes. Therefope, the  overall objective of this study is to better understand the  biochemistry and physiology of glycerol, TMAO and urea in arctic  fishes. Previous studies have shown that significant glycerol  losses occur in smelt and that these losses are compensated for by  a synthetic pathway (via pyruvate) that appears to differ from  that in other cold-hardy, glycerol-producing animals.  New studies  will focus on various amino acid substrates that may be involved  in this pathway, and the seasonal variation in activity of three  key enzymes that are also thought to be involved. The unexpected  occurrence of high serum TMAO levels in many arctic fishes also  raises several questions.  TMAO is usually acquired by teleosts  through the diet, but in the smelt family, it appears to be  synthesized in response to cold.  TMAO synthesis will be tested by  an assay for TMAO oxidase in warm and cold-acclimated fishes.   Inorganic ion concentrations in polar fishes are high enough to  interfere with intracellular processes, such as enzyme activities.   The possibility that TMAO may partially counteract this salt  inhibition--for which there is some preliminary evidence--will be  investigated.  A possible role of TMAO in reducing epithelial   membrane permeabilities to low molecular weight osmolytes will  also be investigated.  Preliminary evidence that TMAO itself is  conserved, rather than excreted as it is in most fishes, will be  further tested in smelt and other arctic species.  Conservation of  TMAO would provide further evidence that it has a physiological  role. Urea synthesis in teleosts is normally accomplished through  the purine pathway, but in fishes with high urea levels (including  a few teleosts), it can occur by the ornithine cycle.  Both  pathways will be assayed in the smelt to determine if their high  urea levels are also the result of an ornithine cycle.",
