 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503069  Hain       Hain intends to continue his study of the topology of moduli  spaces of curves using Hodge theory.  In particular, he is very  interested in computing the second homology of the Torelli group,  and understanding the subgroup of the Torelli group, which is the  kernel of the Johnson homomorphism.  With Jun Yang, he intends to  try to construct a locally integrable cocycle on GL_4(C), using the  fourth classical polylogarithm, which represents the fourth Borel  regulator.  Finally, he intends to extend certain constructions in  the theory of Vassiliev invariants from genus 0 to positive genus.       Symmetry is an important and central theme in twentieth  century mathematics.  One of the most natural sets of symmetries is  the set of symmeteries of the surface of a donut with g holes.  Although such groups of symmeteries have been studied for almost  100 years, there are a large number of central unresolved problems.  Hain intends to work on several of these during the next three  years.  His results have potential applications to modern particle  physics and to certain branches of number theory and algebraic  geometry, the study of solutions of polynomial equations.  Hain has  a second major project.  This is the study of classical  polylogarithms.  These functions were defined 200 years ago by  Spence, an English mathematician, and are generalizations of the  well-known logarithm function so important throughout the sciences  and economics.  Polylogarithms have started to appear recently in  physics and number theory. It is important to establish their basic  properties.  ***",
