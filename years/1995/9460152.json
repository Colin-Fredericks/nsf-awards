 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a design and prototype for innovative CD-ROM educational materials entitled Beginning Explorations in Social Science (BESS) aimed at introducing social science contributions, elementary statistics, and data analysis to high school juniors and seniors and to college freshman students. Adults who desire to develop or rediscover elementary data analysis and interpretation skills will likewise be able to profit from using the materials. Social science data sets have grown exponentially in size, number, and quality over the last ten years. However, easy access to these data sets by social scientists has lagged considerably, so that much of the data's potential for informing science, policy, and practice has not been met. Sociometrics Corporation has pioneered in making this wealth of data resources readily available, easy to use, and widely disseminated through the establishment of indexed data archives in a number of important health and social science areas. The proposed project will complement these ongoing corporate efforts with new work focused on enlarging and training the potential user base for such data by combining important research findings with state of-the-art social science data in the Sociometrics archives and state-of-the-art multimedia computer technology.",
