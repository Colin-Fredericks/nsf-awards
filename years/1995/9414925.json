 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gustavus Adolphus College is the recipient of funds from the National Science Foundation's Academic Research Infrastructure Program to renovated research space in the Nobel Hall of Science in support of the departments of chemistry and biology. This project is one element of a multi-phase effort to fortify the research-based science education at the College. NSF funding will contribute to the upgrade of mechanical, electrical and life-safety systems, and modernizing and reconfiguring of 5,226 square feet (578 square meters) of research space. The facility has never has been renovated since the building opened in 1963.  The deteriorating condition of Nobel Hall compromises Gustavus' ability to maintain and expand research programs.  Improved space chemistry will encompass laboratories in analytical, inorganic, organic and quantitative chemistry and materials science, as well as support facilities.  Modernized facilities in biology will include laboratories in freshwater and cell biology, supporting instrumentation and animal rooms, and a glasshouse with growth chambers for plant physiology and ecology.",
