 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509742  Hilbish        The dynamics of hybrid zones consist of two major elements; the dispersal of parent species and their hybrids into and out of the zone, and their differential survival and reproduction. Strong selection operates within hybrid populations of marine mussels species capable of large-scale dispersal. The objectives of the work proposed here is two-fold.  First, the hypothesis that selection in the hybrid zone is determined by the environment will be tested and potential selective agents identified.  Second, the patterns of larval dispersal across a portion of the hybrid zone will be described.  This will serve to identify the geographic and genetic origin of larvae that immigrate to hybrid populations and are subsequently subjected to selection.   Four hypotheses will be examined to understand the role of specific environmental factors in selection among hybrid genotypes.  These studies will determine the coincidence of each environmental stress with onset and duration of natural selection.  These studies will provide the basis for specific laboratory and field-experimental tests of potential selective agents in future studies.  Second, molecular genetic techniques, developed with previous NSF support, will be used to determine the origin of larval populations that recruit into hybrid populations.  This information will provide a foundation upon which to interpret the patterns of selection observed within hybrid populations and potentially the fate of hybrid larvae once they disperse out of the hybrid zone back into one of the parental populations.",
