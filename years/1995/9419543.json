 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose to collect long-term data on the rates of damage to young leaves by  herbivores and pathogens for 35 species of plants in a tropical rainforest.  For tropical shade-  tolerant species, over 70% of the lifetime damage to a leaf occurs during the short window of  leaf  expansion.  To understand plant defenses in the tropics, they must therefore focus on the young  leaves.  Few studies have quantified herbivore damage to young leaves, and none have followed damage  for more than 1 year.  Even fewer studies have included pathogens, despite the fact that, in the humid  tropics, they may be almost as destructive as herbivores.  Long-term, multi-species studies are  critical for understanding the leaf defenses.  Plant defenses depend on whether a given plant species  is attacked by many species or only a few, by specialists or generalists, by pathogens or by  herbivores.   How much variation is there in damage from year to year?  Do the few bad years account  for most of the damage?  Are the major players the same each year, or is there annual variation in the  damage attributed to each spe cies of pathogen or herbivore?  To answer these questions, they will  monitor damage rates and identify the culprits.  Much of the damage can be attributed to individual  species of herbivores or pathogens, we will also quantify plant phenology to obtain a measure of  synchrony and to identify when major periods of leaf production occur for each species.  The work will  be carried out in a lowland rainforest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), in Panama.  Their extensive  research experience on BCI coupled with several long-term studies enhance the value of their proposed  project.  The 35 study species represent 20 different families to ensure that they sample the  diversity of damage patterns.  As the rate of expansion of young leaves is the best correlate with  damage, they will include species with both fast- and slow-expanding young leaves.   And finally, so  that their data are as useful as possible to other investigators, they will include the 14 most common  species in the Forest Dynamics Plot on BCI.",
