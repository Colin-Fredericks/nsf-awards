University of Illinois Chicage    It is proposed for the NSF to help support a Symposium on Multiphase Flow, Microstructure Media, Diffusion and Biological Transport being organized for the 26th Annual Meeting of the Fine Particle Society (Chicago, 22-25 August 1995).  Beyond furnishing a forum for exposition of the most recent advances in transport phenomena, the Symposium has two key objectives.  First, the program has been carefully designed to bring researchers in fluid mechanics and transport phenomena together with specialists in the fields of pore and surface diffusion, microstructure media (liquid crystals, zeolites, membranes, etc.) and cell biology (gap junction channels, exocytotic fusion pores, etc.).  This amalgamation will promote interdisciplinary contact to an uncommonly broad and comprehensive extent.  Second, the Symposium will serve as a focal point for contact between researchers in fluid mechanics/fluid-particle systems and the sizable industrial constituency of the Fine Particle Society, representing nanoparticle and magneto-particle technology, particle characterization and separation, filtration, powder technology, clean room technology, and pharmaceuticals.  Novel features of the Symposium include (I) subsidized graduate student participation and a poster session dedicated to graduate research; and (ii) a round-table discussion for the identification of key open problems at the interface between transport and biology, and between transport and microstructure materials.  Results of the Symposium and the round-table discussion will be disseminated in a dedicated issue of the journal Particulate and Processing Science and Technology.",
