The students will most likely be computer science or computer engineering majors although this is not required.    In addition, the pi's have been funded to conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the two projects over the years 1994-1998.  The evaluation will measure how well the projects have met the goal on increasing the number of women in CISE disciplines entering graduate school.  The most useful aspect of the mentoring/research will also be assessed on an annual basis in order to provide feedback for improving the remaining years of the project.    The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research.  The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research community and to support and promote its interests.  Dr. Weingarten is the Executive Director of CRA. Dr. Anne Condon, the academic leader of this project, is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin.  ***",
