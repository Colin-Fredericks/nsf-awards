 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, a state-of-the-art laboratory in Automatic  Data Collection and Identification (ADCI) is developed and  provides training in capabilities, function, and integration of  these technologies into industrial systems.   The demand for  trained engineers and technologists to implement such ADCI  technologies as Bar Code, Radio Frequency Identification,  Magnetic Stripe, Machine Vision, and Voice Recognition has  exploded in recent years.    Familiarity with bar code standards,  symbologies, printing methods, print quality verification  analysis, the design of ADCI databases, the integration of  systems using ADCI to track work-in-process and inventory, and  evaluation procedures for selecting different ADCI technologies  will be essential to the graduating students at the baccalaureate  of science level within the next 10 years, since the usage of  these technologies is universal in industry today.  Initially,  this laboratory is being utilized to support courses in  Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Problems, Automated  Manufacturing, Polymer Process, Statistical Quality Control, and  Manufacturing Planning.  Three other courses in Facility  Planning, Automatic Data Collection and Identification, and  Senior Project are planned for addition into the undergraduate  technology curriculum.",
