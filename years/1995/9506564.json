Mason University of Wisconsin at Madison  Dissertation Improvement  Research: Effects of Glacial-Interglacial Climate Change on Mass Wasting, Southeastern Minnesota  This  project will investigate the effects of glacial-interglacial climate change on processes of hillslope  erosion in a part of southeastern Minnesota that was near the ice margin during the last glacial  period.  Study results should be applicable to a larger area of the Upper Mississippi Valley that is  physiographically similar.  The project will test the hypothesis that extensive slope erosion by mass  wasting was triggered by permafrost formation during the last glacial period, but that mass wasting  has been inactive under subsequent interglacial climatic conditions.  Radiocarbon dating and other  methods will be used to determine the chronology of past mass wasting episodes.  The results of the  study should enhance interpretation of large-scale changes in sediment movement and storage in the  Upper Mississippi basin over the past 25,000 years.     )",
