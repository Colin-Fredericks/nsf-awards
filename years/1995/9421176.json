 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry  Division, Prof. Michael T. Bowers of the Chemistry Department of the  University of California at Santa Barbara will engage in a continuing  series of investigations in the field of gas phase ion chemistry,  specifically ion chromatography of transition metal ions, and will start  new work  on the  determination of the shape of bio-molecules in the  gaseous phase.  Earlier work on the ion chemistry of first row species  will now be extended to the second row, these involving iron, cobalt, and  nickel ions reacting with propane; the clustering of transition metal  ions to hydrogen; cluster assisted sigma-bond activation; and studies of  carbon based clusters and of transition metal composites.  The chemistry of transition metal ions is one of the forefront areas of  contemporary physical chemistry.  Fundamental work in this field is of  great importance owing to the critical role played by transition metals  in catalysis.  Related to this are questions of the mechanism of the  formation and structure of transition metal carbon composites owing to  their possible technological usefuleness.  The function and the  degree  of activity of many biological molecules are believed to be intimately  related to their structure.  The determination of the structure of  bio-molecules in the gas phase, i.e., free molecules unperturbed by  effects of an environment, is therefore of importance for providing bench  mark data for the development of quantum mechanical models that relate  their structures and activities.  The research done in this project will  contribute to a better understanding of these issues and thereby assist  in the application of this knowledge to technological problems.",
