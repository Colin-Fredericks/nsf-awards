 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are molecules, consisting of a large number of amino acids.  The order in which the amino acids occur is called \"sequence\". Analysis  of protein sequence is an integral part of basic health and life  sciences. Availability of this information is a first step towards  understanding protein function at the molecular level; it also serves  as a protein fingerprint, allowing identification. An important role of  the protein chemist has been to provide partial amino acid sequences to  facilitate cloning of the corresponding geles. However, the focus of  protein sequence analysis may shift to more function oriented  questions, such as formation of complexes in the cell during  signalling, cell cycle and differentiation. As many of those proteins  are only available in minute quantities, it is imperative that  analytical studies be carried out at the highest attainable levels of  sensitivity. Traditionally, sequence analysis is done by stepwise  removal of amino acids from the N-teminal end of the polypeptide, one  residue at a time. The leaving residue is then converted to a more  stable PTH-amino acid for identification by an analytical technique,  usually HPLC. The entire process has been automated. Optimized  commercial \"sequencers\" require 2-5 picomoles starting amount of  peptide for analysis, almost one order of magnitude more than what can  be isolated. Improvements will therefore be required. As existing  sequencers have already been optimized to the limit, it is difficult to  picture how this could be done without extensive modifications, i.e.  miniaturization. Commercial instruments are not easily modified as they  are 'boxed up' and inflexible, both in terms of hardware and software.  A novel instrument must therefore be built. Our short-term objective is  the development of an automated peptide sequencer for the \"mid  femtomole\" range. We propose to do this by miniaturization of reaction  vessels and analytical techniques, all in a very proximate arrangement.  We foresee that the  construction of a flexible, modularity built  \"micro-microsequencer\" will also serve as a platform for long-term  improvements / modifications to hardware and chemistry, leading to  another 5-fold increase in sensitivity (20-100 femtomoles). One (two)  order(s) of magnitude gained in polypeptide sequencing sensitivity will  allow identification of proteins hitherto known only as 'activities' or  'spots on a 2DE-gel', and move the health and life sciences into new  areas of inquiry. Specifically, we propose to construct an automated  chemical sequencer, containing a miniaturized reaction cartridge,  conversion flask and reagent/solvent flow path. Cyclically removed  amino acids will be identified, initially, by microbore RP-HPLC and,  later, by capillary LC. We propose to develop and/or optimize PTHamino  acid separations on micro/capillary columns and couple them to the  sequencer in close proximity and automated fashion. UV-detection will  be used first and serve, in the medium-turn, as a bridge to even better  sensitivities by utilizing amino acid derivatives of higher  detectability. We propose therefore, to implement fluorescent-amino  acid generating chemistries and accomplish micro/capillary-column  chromatographic separation. The proposed instrument will also provide a  unique tool for micro-delivery of reaction products and degradation  products, from either cartridge or flask to non-chromatographic  analytical instruments with sample volume restrictions (e.g. mass  spectrometers, CZE,...). In turn, analytical versatility will create  opportunities for further sequencing improvements, both in terms of  sensitivity and speed. The significance of achieving the objectives  will be our ability to analyze low abundant proteins, isolated with the  most powerful fractionation techniques. Applications are ongoing in the  areas of i) vesicle targetting and membrane fusion, and understanding  the controlling machinery of synaptic transmission, and ii)  interactions of negative cell cycle regulator s and their role as  antiproliferative devices that, when disrupted, contribute to cancer.  Technology transfer will be effected through publications, postdocs,  graduate students, visitor trainees, and through the use in sequencing  core facilities.",
