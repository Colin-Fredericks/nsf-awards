 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal establishes new traditions in the chemistry  curriculum that optimize opportunities for all students to learn  chemical facts and concepts, develop and pursue interests in  chemistry and chemistry-related disciplines, and appreciate how an  understanding of chemistry is important to life and living.  We are  changing fundamentally the ways students, faculty, and  administrators view their roles, creating a student-centered,  active-learning emphasis.  We have a broad range of reforms, each  of which is developed, tested, modified, thoroughly evaluated, and  widely disseminated.  We address five main areas that apply to all  levels of the curriculum: student-focused active learning; inquiry-  based/open-ended laboratories; interdisciplinary course clusters to  create learning communities; a topic-oriented curriculum; and  information technology/computer tools.  Each development in each  area is carefully evaluated, and only the best survive.  Evaluation  provides important information about the process of transfer of  innovations among institutions of different types.  To insure that  our reforms are useful for all students, our consortium includes  industry, public and private four-year institutions, minority  institutions, and two-year colleges.  The project gives special  emphasis to students who choose teaching as a career option by  main-streaming these students in courses which benefit them in both  content and pedagogy. Students, including those in Science  Education, are fully integrated in the development and  implementation of the project, working on both research topics and  evaluation.  The project also gives special emphasis to community  college students in Advanced Technological Education programs to  ensure that they are given the newly developed curriculum.  The  students in the ATE program will clearly benefit by being provided  the five main areas of thrust that this coalition is developing.   All the Students emerge with greater comprehension and better  re tention of chemical knowledge, improved ability to apply chemical  concepts to new problems, enhanced appreciation of the relation  between chemistry and other disciplines, and skills that enable  them to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams.",
