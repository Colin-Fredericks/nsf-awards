Participation will be 200-250 scientists (including speakers and moderators), selected on the basis of their expertise and interest in this area, and their expected contribution to the success of this scientific program.  The meeting will begin with broad discussion of each of the two major pathways of transcriptional activation in response to extracellular signals: the ras-MAPK pathway and the JAK-STAT pathway.  understanding transcriptional signaling is vital to understanding processes such as cell growth control, the functioning of the immune system and development and so has a central place in modern biology.  The pace of progress in this area has been very rapid in recent years, and it is important to bring scientists working on diverse systems together so that the interrelationships of these systems can be fully appreciated and so that new clues about the mechanisms and functions from one system can be applied in others. The meeting is designed to be highly interactive and to give ample time for discussion and for presentations by younger scientists. This meeting will serve as a catalyst to stimulate the interest of scientists who may have novel tools in hand to approach these problems, with a focus on those younger scientists, who have yet to initiate a major program of independent research.  %%%  The Symposium on \"Activation of Transcription in Response to Extracellular Signaling Proteins\"  to be held under the auspices of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) October 6-9, 1995, in Keystone, Colorado.
