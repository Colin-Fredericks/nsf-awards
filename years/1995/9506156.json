 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506156  Gossler    Somitogenesis is a fundamental pattern forming process in  vertebrates that subdivides the paraxial mesoderm along the  anterior-posterior body axis into a series of homologous subunits  called somites. The somites acquire distinct identities according  to their axial position and during subsequent differentiation, they  give rise to specific anatomical structures along the anterior  posterior body axis. The molecular mechanisms that control the  formation of somites from the presomitic (unsegmented) mesoderm  remain to be elucidated. Mouse mutations that specifically perturb  normal somite formation and consequently lead to severe  malformations of the axial skeleton indicate that different genetic  elements control distinct aspects of somitogenesis, such as the  formation of individual somites, or their size and shape. To  understand the molecular mechanisms underlying somitogenesis and  thus controlling the generation of the segmented mesodermal body  parts, the isolation and functional characterization of genes  involved in the regulation of these processes are essential. In  this proposal Dr. Gossler will focus on the functional analysis in  vivo of a recently isolated mouse gene Dll1 (delta like gene 1).  Dll1 is closely related to the Drosophila Delta gene which is  required for various cell fate decisions during fly development.  Dll1 is transiently expressed during embryogenesis and expression  is closely correlated with somitogenesis. The expression pattern  and homology to Drosophila Delta strongly suggest a role for Dll1  in cell to cell interactions underling somitogenesis. To test this  hypothesis Dr. Gossler will generate a null allele of Dll1 by  homologous recombination in ES cells and study the consequences of  this mutation during embryogenesis. To address the consequences of  a mutation in Dll1 on the cellular level he will assess the  developmental potential of cells carrying this mutation in chimeric  embryos. Finally, he will determine the expressio n of the Dll1 gene  and the distribution of its product in embryos that carry mutations  affecting somitogenesis in comparison with wild type embryos.  ***",
