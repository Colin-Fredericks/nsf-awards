 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in applied mathematics and marine environment.  The investigators are Fabio Milner of Purdue University, Michel Langlais of the University of Bordeaux, and Patrick Silan of the University of Montpellier.  The objective of their research is to develop host-parasite models in a marine environment.  Initially they will model the dynamics of host-parasite systems with hologenic cycle and study their qualitative and quantitative mathematical properties and their biological and ecological consequences.  They will perform simulations to validate these models by comparing their results with experimental data.  The biological model serving as the basis for this work is the sea bass.   The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration considerable mathematical skills and computational resources.  These are complemented by the multidisciplinary expertise of the French investigators (biology and mathematics) and access to marine facilities and real-life data offered by the French. The proposed model will advance research on  other models for interacting populations both in land and marine environments.",
