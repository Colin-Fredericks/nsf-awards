 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Advanced   Materials Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Ellen R. Fisher of   Colorado State University will investigate plasma-enhanced chemical vapor   deposition of thin films of silicon dioxide and hydrogenated amorphous   silicon nitride films (alpha-SiNx:H).  Critical reactions between   gas-phase radical species and the surface being processed by an rf plasma   will be studied using a modified IRIS (Imaging of Radicals Interacting   with Surfaces) method which combines spatially-resolved laser-induced   fluorescence (LIF) detection with molecular beam techniques.  Radical   reactivities will be measured in real time during thin film deposition.    IRIS will enable radicals to be studied which desorb from a surface but   are not in the incident molecular beam, yielding information about   volatile products produced by surface reactions.  Alkoxysilane plasma   systems as well as SiX4/NH3 and SiX4/N2 plasmas will be examined.  The   reactivity of intermediates will be measured as a function of rf input   power, radical rotational state, and substrate temperature.  Silicon dioxide and silicon nitride films are widely used as gate oxides,   passivation layers, and interlevel dielectrics for integrated circuits.    Since the mechanisms for plasma deposition of these films is still   unknown, further progress to improve film quality will be enhanced by   understanding the underlying chemical processes involved, such as   provided in this project.",
