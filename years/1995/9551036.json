 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the cryogenic facilities of upper- division  teaching laboratories.   In these laboratories, students are  given the opportunity to work with research-class instruments  that they may encounter in their future careers in university,  industrial, or government research laboratories.   Cryogenics, an  important part of the physics curriculum, it is a source of new  concepts such as the macroscopic quantum states encountered in  superconductivity and superfluidity.   It is a region where the  absence of thermal motion permits the clear recognition of many  physical properties.   Furthermore, it has important applications  such as those associated with high-temperature superconductivity,  Josephson junctions, etc.  The heart of our new research standard  cryogenic system is a RMC Cryosystems 4He insertable dewar.    This is a low-cost all-purpose cryostat that provides a  temperature range from 1.2-300K, and, with a 50 T superconducting  solenoid, it becomes a very versatile piece of equipment.   It  has low operating costs and the fast turnaround time that is  essential for the efficient running of a teaching laboratory  where the students are present for limited periods.",
