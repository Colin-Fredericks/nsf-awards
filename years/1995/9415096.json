 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California State University, Fresno (CSUF), is the only state-supported university serving the rapidly growing central San Joaquin Valley with a metropolitan population that includes a significant proportion of minorities.  To begin to meet the needs of a scientifically skilled workforce for the next millennium, CSUF has implemented an interdisciplinary  program in biotechnology, with a research training component to provide students, educators, and community scientists with additional opportunities to learn advanced technology for academic and industrial pursuits.  The desire for laboratory research experiences, coupled with increasing interest in exploring the realms of biochemistry and molecular biology among students for Master-s and undergraduate degrees, has strained the research space limitations of the architectural design of the original building.  This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will augment and reorganize a small portion of current space in the Biology and Chemistry Departments into viable biotechnology research space.   In conjunction to remodeling space, renovations will include reconfiguring work benches, upgrading a coldroom and environmental room, and consolidating space for a sterilization and washroom facility.  The renovated areas will increase the quality of space for students to conduct biotechnology experiments and analysis, and provide better access to research equipment throughout the year.  CSUF serves as a research resource for the central California region, and the Biotechnology Program in addition to developing strong academic research programs, incorporates community outreach efforts as an important component to its research activities.  This project will not only enhance the Biotechnology Program, but will also stimulate minority students to pursue careers in this scientific discipline.",
