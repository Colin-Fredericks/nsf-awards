The series presents positive images of children involved in, and succeeding at, a variety of areas.  The Wisconsin-based stories are field-produced; and kids are involved on-screen and off as hosts, reporters, subjects of stories, as interns during production, and as sources of story ideas.  The series is broadcast on both public and commercial stations in Wisconsin and receives multiple repeats.      The science and technology strand:    . connects science concepts to children's known experiences and activities and tells stories about kids involved in science-related activities;    . models and reinforces positive attitudes towards, and involvement in science and technology and affirms the value of children's ideas, and the importance of asking why?; and    . reinforces viewers' active connection to the science content by making suggestions for projects to get involved with, and by encouraging children to discuss and question their knowledge of science and the world around them.    The series is an important element integrated into both informal and formal education throughout Wisconsin.  It is supported by teacher materials and science video segments that are sent to every elementary school in Wisconsin.  In season two, material also will be created for parents and children to use at home.  A \"Get Real!\" kids club helps kids feel ownership of the series.  Members receive a newsletter that includes suggested at-home science activities, book lists related to the series, features about the show, places for families to visit, and behind-the-scenes articles about kids in the series.  Every elementary school library and public library in the state also received \"Get Real!\" materials including a poster and display items.     James Steinback, the creator, original producer, and executive producer of \"Newton's Apple,\" will be the  co-PI with overall responsibility for the project.  Kathy Bissen will be executive producer of \"Get Real!\" and David Wallach will be series producer.  The series is produced in the three Wisconsin Public Television studios -- in Madison, Green Bay, and Menomonie -- and, therefore, can find and produce statewide stories.",
