In the past two years rapid changes have occurred in  technology in the field of food systems.  Technology changes  involving biotechnology, chemical usage, GPS/GIS satellites, and  computer/telecommunication networks will continue into the next  century.  For farmers to remain competitive in the food industry,  they and the food systems sales and service people supporting them,  must be trained in this new technology.  \"There will be fewer and  larger farm operations, still individually owned and operated by  families, but more businesslike...And to be profitable, the farmer  will have to use technology\" (KSU AE REPORT, Fall 1994).  Hawkeye  Community College proposes to plan and test an innovative 63 credit  hour curriculum which would link the agricultural and business  experience with technology.  The curriculum and all support  materials would then be used in expanding articulation agreements  with the secondary schools and four year institutions including a  land grant university who are interested in updating agricultural  curriculum into food systems.  The materials would also be  disseminated through national education associations, journals, and  telecommunication system.",
