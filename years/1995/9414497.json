Patricia Fernandez-Kelly of  Johns Hopkins University. The project intends to develop a  decision framework for improving environmental protection in  an economically optimal manner. Their study will investigate  the practice of regulatory enforcement of industrial air  pollution in Mexico City and determine the informational,  political and social context.  The framework is based on  decision variables of the two agents considered most  responsible for retarding or advancing environmental  protection:  a profit-maximizing polluter and an  environmental enforcement agency. Insight on their  interaction, their decision variables and the context in  which such interaction is embedded is gained from theory  addressing: (1) investment, (2) law enforcement, (3) game  theory and (4) economic sociology.        This research will provide insights and conclusions  important to improved environmental quality in Mexico, which  is pertinent to the economic security of the U.S.  The  differences in environmental standards between the two  countries provide a competitive advantage to those  industries located in areas that have weak enforcement.  Regulatory enforcement thus becomes an important issue that  affects the competitive balance between the two countries.        ***",
