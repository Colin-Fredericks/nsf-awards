 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mischaikow       Most numerical methods for studying ordinary differential  equations are based on one of the following two ideas: (1)  tracking individual trajectories via an approximation of the  differential equation, or (2) searching for orbits with  predetermined properties, e.g. a periodic orbit or an invariant  torus, by solving an associated boundary value problem.  While  these techniques are obviously successful, they have shortcomings;  one can only approximate orbits over finite time intervals and  these methods have difficulty detecting orbits which are unstable  in the sense of dynamics.  These unstable orbits can be extremely  important since they define the boundaries of basins of  attraction, and hence, determine the global dynamics of the  system.  In addition, there are many problems where the objects of  interest are precisely the unstable bounded orbits, e.g. traveling  waves.  In the second case, one needs to know a priori what types  of solutions should be looked for and in what regions of phase  space one should look for the solutions.  The investigator develops  complimentary methods for studying the global dynamics of ordinary  differential equations.  The theoretical basis for the project is  Conley's theory of dynamical systems.  The work is separated into  four tasks. (1) Given as an input an ordinary differential  equation and a region in phase space, develop efficient numerical  schemes to determine isolating neighborhoods and compute their  Conley indices. (2) Given a potential isolating neighborhood,  develop more efficient mechanisms for obtaining computer assisted  proofs to verify that the neighborhood is an isolating  neighborhood and to rigorously compute the Conley index of the  associated isolated invariant set. (3) Extend the abstract Conley  index theory, which allows one to draw conclusions concerning the  structure of the dynamics from knowledge of the index and the  isolating neighborhood. (4) Apply these techniques to ordinary  differential equations  for which the global dynamics is poorly  understood.  It should be emphasized that the end goal of these  four steps is to obtain a rough understanding of the global  dynamics of the ordinary differential equation.  In particular,  these procedures provide information about both the type and  structure of dynamics that occur, and the region of phase space in  which these dynamics take place.  A finer understanding of these  dynamics can then be more efficiently investigated using the more  classical methods mentioned at the beginning.       It is clear that most phenomena, whether physical, chemical  or biological in nature, need to be described by nonlinear models.  Thus, to describe the dynamics of these phenomena one is required  to solve problems in global analysis.  In practice, this usually  requires numerical computations, since our theoretical analytic  techniques are not yet adequate.  With the advent of high  performance computing considerable progress has been made in  understanding the behavior of a wide variety of nonlinear  dynamical systems.  However, there are many drawbacks to most  current numerical and computational techniques at our disposal.  This project is aimed at two of them.  The first arises from the  fact that the classical numerical techniques often provide bad  approximations over long time intervals (i.e. they are unreliable  for long range predictions) and also they have difficulty  detecting unstable dynamic structures (these unstable structures  determine the path by which the object being modelled reaches its  asymptotic state).  The second problem involves difficulty in  understanding the tremendous amounts of numerical data which the  computers are capable of generating.  Typically this problem is  overcome by graphically displaying the data.  Unfortunately, most  models involve more than three variables, and hence visualizing  the numerical results becomes a difficult task.  This project  develops theoretical techniques and efficient numerical methods  for  describing the global dynamics arising from nonlinear ordinary  differential equations, and then applies these techniques to a  wide range of biological and physical problems.  The theoretical  aspect involves translating algebraic information into dynamics  and the numerical side involves computing these algebraic  invariants by approximating the differential equations.  The  algebraic information works equally well for stable or unstable  dynamics and, of course, being algebraic, does not need to be  visualized in order to be understood.",
