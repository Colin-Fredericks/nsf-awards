 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of new approaches to the synthesis of  phosphonopeptides that can be adapted to solid state synthesis for application to combinatorial  chemistry.  The key building blocks will be protected phosphorus(III) amino acids.  Specific  studies will include the synthesis of model phosphonate and phosphonamidate dipeptides in  solution using dichlorotriphenylphosphorane for activiating the phosphorus(III) amino acids; the  evaluation of benzyl protection of phosphonates and phosphonamides; applications of these  methods to solid-phase synthesis of phosphonopeptides and their thio derivatives; enantioselective  synthesis of H-phosphinate amino acids; ald measurement of enzyme inhibition for these newly  synthesized compounds.    With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities  are supporting the research of Dr. Robert P. Hammer of the Department of Chemistry at  Louisiana State University.  Professor Hammer will focus his work on the development of new,  general and high-yielding methods for the preparation of phosphono-substituted peptides that can  be applied to solid state procedures for the production of combinatorial libraries.  This approach  will provide thousands of compounds simultaneously which can be screened for a variety of  biological activities, such as protease inhibition.",
