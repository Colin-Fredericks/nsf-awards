Trainees will  enroll in either Physics Education  (Physics), Science Education  (Mathematics and Science  Education), or Spatial Information  Systems (Forestry) and complete new  interdisciplinary seminars focusing  on research n the frontiers of  instructional technology in science  education. Internationally  recognized faculty from other  departments who have conducted  extensive research on electronic  delivery of instruction will also  participate in these seminars as  well as teach other graduate  courses in instructional  technology. Trainees will attend  professional research conferences  and participate in NCSU's multiple  regional and national service  activities in science education,  including the American Physics  Association's Physics Academic  Software Project, housed at NCSU;  the NSF-and industry-funded Science  House, which sponsors outreach  projects to rural and African  American K-12 students and NC's  science and math teachers; and the  GIS Literacy Project. Traineeships  will assist NCSU in focusing its  multiple research programs in the  Colleges of Physical and  Mathematical Sciences, Agricultural  and Life Science, Engineering,  Education and Psychology,  Humanities and Social Sciences, and  the School of Design that are  integrating instructional  technologies with cognitive science  to develop truly innovative models  of science education.",
