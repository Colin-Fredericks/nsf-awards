 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509954  Pazzaglia    NSF funding will supplement matching funds from the University of  New Mexico to build and implement a UNIX-based computational  facility within the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.  Specifically, a Sun SPARCstation 20 workstation with 64 MB of  memory, 10 GB of mass storage, a large-format color monitor with  a graphics accelerator card, a CD-ROM and software including, Sun  Solaris operating system, FORTRAN-90 and C compilers, ARC/INFO  and S-PLUS will be acquired. An extant department-wide network  serviced by DEC-PATHWORKS will enable all faculty, research  staff, and students to access the new facility with the option to  have their PC or Macintosh run X-applications through the  SPARCstation 20 workstation.  The facility will be designed  primarily to meet the research needs of the Quaternary Studies  Group in acquiring, processing, analyzing, and displaying large  digital data sets, but will also have an interdisciplinary focus  in enhancing UNIX-based resources and applications for the  Department.  Research to be performed by Quaternary Studies Group  at this facility will include manipulation of high-resolution (30  and 90 m) USGS digital elevation data to perform (1) regional  quantitative morphometric analysis, (2) investigate the  fundamental relationship between uplift, relief, mean elevation,  and erosion, (3) perform computationally-intensive Fourier  analyses on topography to extract the tectonic component in  landscape development, (4) provide a framework for the  preparation and compilation of surficial geologic maps, and (5)  use topographic data and surficial geologic data in concert with  GIS-based applications in landscape evolution analyses.    ***",
