 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baker  9417011    This research program, involving researchers from Indiana, Duke and  Columbia Universities, proposes to investigate in detail the  processes involved in circulation of hydrothermal fluids in a  heavily sedimented setting adjacent to active hot springs on Juan  de Fuca Ridge, a mid-ocean ridge spreading center located off  Oregon, Washington and western Canada.  The specific programs  proposed for the one-month field effort include studies of heat,  chemical and fluid transport within the sedimentary section and the  physical properties of those sediments.  The objective in acquiring  this detailed, multicomponent data set is to use these three  interdependent components to constrain and define models of the  fluid pathways and chemical reactions, including the deposition of  sulfide minerals within the mud and rock overlying the thermal  vents.  The detailed program is possible in part because it uses  cutting edge technology for heat flow and pore water measurement,  which this group of investigators has been instrumental in  fostering and bringing to use.  Previous study at the two proposed  sites includes drilling by the NSF-sponsored Ocean Drilling Program  vessel JOIDES Resolution, and the new data allows extrapolation of  results both areally (with new measurements from the upper 20  meters of the sediments) and with depth (with existing drilling  data and planned future drill data, which is expected in the 1996-  97 time frame) to define the 3-dimensional architecture of  circulation and mineralization.  In addition to providing the first  study at this level of detail over sedimented hot springs known to  produce large mineralized deposits, the program will provide  valuable data for precise selection of sites for future drilling.",
