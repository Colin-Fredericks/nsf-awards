At  the heart of the institute is a program of individual students  research projects carried out in the laboratories and under the  mentorship of CWRU faculty researchers in various science and  engineering departments.   Several instructional days emphasizing  science content , guided laboratory work and research methodology  will precede the assignment to research projects.  Career  exploration activities include field trips to private research  labs, a hospital medical physics department, and a nuclear power  plant.; guest presentations by academic and industrial science  and engineering professionals will offer further opportunities  for students to hear career perspectives.  Several sessions are  scheduled for consideration of ethical issues confronting  scientists and engineers.  Follow-up activities and projects are  required.  ***",
