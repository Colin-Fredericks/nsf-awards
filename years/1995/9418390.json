In  this research project state-of-the-art ultrafast spectroscopic  techniques will be uqed to study the primary electron transfer  processes in photosystem II.  Several types of experiments will be  performed to try to elucidate the time-scale and mechanism for  primary charge separation in PSII.  These include the following:   The ultrafast kinetics will be measured using various reaction  center preparations to determine whether the method of preparation  can affect either the energy relaxation kinetics or the rate of  primary charge separation.  Larger PSII complexes will be prepared  in order to study the electron transfer rate in active centers and  set to rest any speculation as to whether or not the D1-D2-Cyt b559  complex retains the native reaction center structure and dynamics.   Transient absorption measurements will be made with ultrashort (<50  fs) pulses to explore the possible involvement of coherent protein  motion in the initial dynamics of PSII.  Resonance Raman  measurements will be attempted to probe the production of the  initial charge separated state directly, overcoming the limitation  of highly overlapping electronic absorption features. Combining the  slight differences in the electronic spectra with the selectivity  introduced by resonance enhancement and the differences in the  vibrational spectra of the charged and neutral pigments, it should  be possible to detect the charge separated state with much less  ambiguity.  %%%  A rigorous understanding of the primary electron transfer reactions  in biological photosynthetic systems is one of the keys to a  complete understanding of natural solar energy conversion.  The  protein complex referred to as photosystem II (PSII) is responsible  for the ability of green plants to utilize light energy to fuel the  pr oduction of oxygen from water.  The PSII protein complex works in  conjunction with a second complex, photosystem I (PSI), to form  carbohydrates from carbon dioxide.  In this research project,  state-of-the-art laser technology will be used to study the light  initiated electron transfer reactions of photosystem II (PSII).   The overall goal of this investigation is to obtain a detailed  understanding of the factors that control the efficiency and  robustness of photosynthesis in green plants.  ***",
