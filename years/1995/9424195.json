 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424195  Guckenheimer   Under this three-year program, undergraduate students will investigate problems in a variety of areas of computational science research under the joint guidance of Cornell University faculty member and members of the Corand technical staff. While working on their research projects, students will not only participate in scientific research but will also learn about computational methods and receive training in high performance computing techniques.  The research projects will take advantage of the advanced computational resources of the Theory Center including scaleable parallel processing and visualization tools.    The research experience will be enhanced by the interaction among students from diverse institutions with multi-disciplinary backgrounds and research projects.  Building on long-standing relationships, the project will aggressively recruit from historically black colleges and women's colleges; it will also target those institutions which lack a strong research orientation.  Students at colleges and universities with otherwise limited computational research resources will thus have the opportunity to undertake significant reseapch projects as part of their undergraduate education.  ***",
