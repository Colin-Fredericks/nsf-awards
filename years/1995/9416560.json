Photochemical and  microbiological studies have shown that CO is mainly produced by  the oxidation of natural dissolved organic matter.  At present,  however, little is known about the major molecular components  responsible for the photochemical production of CO, the main  environmental factors which affect the CO formation and  consumption, and the role of microorganisms in the regeneration of  organic source of CO in the ocean.  As a continuation of past  research this effort will further study the basic mechanisms for  the photochemical and microbial cycling of CO in marine and fresh  water systems.  The main objectives of this research are to:  (1)  identify possible molecular components for the photochemical  production of CO with basic photochemical theory and available  information about the identified components of natural dissolved  organic matter and possible structures of parent humic substances,  (2) examine the influences of dissolved oxygen, transition metals  and low molecular weight organic compounds which do not appre-  ciably absorb sunlight at sea surface on the formation and con-  sumption of CO, and (3) examine the role of microorganisms in the  transformation of aquatic humic substances including in the photo-  production of CO.",
