 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419413     Priscu  The permanent ice cover of antarctic lakes within the McMurdo dry  valleys provides a habitat for viable microbial consortia  consisting of cyanobacteria and eubacteria.  This microbial  assemblage, which is concentrated in a liquid water lens  associate with a layer of rock debris at mid-ice depth,  presumably grows only during a period when the ice cover in not  completely frozen ( 190 d y-1).  Despite the potential importance  this assemblage may have with regards to overall ecosystem  dynamics, it has never been studied with respect to its origin,  distribution and ecological significance.  It is hypothesized  that (1) viable microbial consortia exist in the ice covers of  all dry valley lakes, (2) the microorganisms originate from  terrestrial mat communities, (3) the rock debris and associated  microbial layer persists at mid-ice depths owing to a balance  between solar energy absorption and upward advection from surface  ablation and bottom ice freezing, (4) primary production by ice  cyanobacteria contributes a significant amount of new production  to the lake ecosystem, (5) microbial growth rates are low but are  higher than rates of ice turnover, (6) the nitrogen pool  associated with the microbial assemblage results from N2 fixation  and (7) bacterial and cyanobacterial interactions within the  assemblage are commensualistic.  These hypotheses will be  addressed through a combination of geographical sampling,  physical ice modeling, molecular identification using probes for  16S rRNA and nitrogenase, and physiological assays.  A majority  of this work will focus on the assemblage found in the east lobe  of Lake Bonney which has been tentatively characterized.  This  project, which will be the first to examine the antarctic lake  ice microbial assemblage, will yield important new information on  carbon and nitrogen dynamics within the McMurdo dry valleys and  will complement numerous studies of sea ice microbial  communities.",
