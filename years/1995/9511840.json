 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental challenge of democracy is to make public decisions in a manner that protects the rights of individuals, but is responsive to the shared needs of all.  This requires participation of affected parties.  However, many important environmental policy issues have become increasingly disputatious and difficult to resolve by traditional methods.  Recently, governmental agencies have been experimenting with new forms of participation, but too little attention has been paid to careful examination of how well participation opportunities meet the process related needs of decision makers and affected parties.  This project will refine and test a process evaluation methodology, and use it to improve understanding of peoples' expectations for public decision making processes.  The methodology integrates perspectives of planners, participants, and normative theory, using a `real world` case, based on recently completed activities of the Northern Forest Lands council (NFLC).  The method consists of four steps:  characterization of the public participation process as it occurred; interviews of planners and participants and construction of value-trees to represent how they evaluate the process;  evaluation of the process using a normative framework for public participation developed in prior research; and comparison of the evaluations made by the various parties and derived from the framework.  The focus is on how promising this methodology for systematic process evaluation is in understanding how particular processes incorporate and integrate values.  Concise descriptions of differences among parties who participated in the NFLC process can link the differences to specific design attributes of the process and enable the investigators to draw conclusions about designs that can incorporate and integrate values from multiple perspectives.  Tools from this research will be applicable to the study of other experiments in participation and the results will contribute to ongoing work in the development of normative theory for public participation in environmental decision making.  The investigators will make presentations at conferences and  prepare articles for submission to professional and practitioner journals.  Copies of their reports will be available to federal and New England natural resource policy agencies and regional community development organizations.",
