 "awd_abstract_narration": "STERMAN  Accumulating evidence suggests that for many firms, including winners of the Baldrige award, successful quality improvement programs have not led to greater business success.  The researchers hypothesize that productivity gains from successful quality programs can interact unfavorably with existing routines and structures.  Unrecognized interdepencies may cause unanticipated side effects that cause firms to take actions that ultimately lead to the demise of otherwise successful programs.  The researchers will study five organizations to identify the nature of such interactions and assess the circumstances in which they feed back to undercut the benefits of successful quality initiatives.  Hypotheses were generated and research methods developed based on a preliminary study of the unanticipated side effects of quality improvements at Analog Devices, Inc.  This research will begin with development of case histories of the quality program in five firms (AT&T, Bose, Ford, Harley-Davidson, National Semi-Conductor) then develop formal models of the systematic impacts of quality programs on firm dynamics.  A `Management Flight Simulator` will be developed based on results to allow managers and students to understand challenges facing organizations as they implement quality programs.",
