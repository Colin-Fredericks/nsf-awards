 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Catherine J. Murphy, of the University of South Carolina, is  supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic  Chemistry Program under a Faculty Early Career Advancement Award  for the study of uses of luminescence as a probe of surface  structure.  Three areas are targeted:  (1) Trisdiimine  ruthenium(II) complexes will be designed such that luminescence  will be observed only when one of the diimine ligands is of the  appropriate length to fit a cavity in a large molecule such as DNA  that is formed as a result of tertiary structure.  (2) The known  sensitivity of the luminescence of \"quantum dots\" of cadmium  sulfide to the nature and amount of surface adsorbate will be  investigated as a means of determining the nature of the  interaction of DNA with these particles.  It is hypothesized that  DNA that can bend will adsorb to particles that are of the  appropriate diameter and that this adsorption can be monitored by  changes in the luminescence of the particles.  Distances between  the ends of DNA molecules wrapped about suitably sized particles  may be further investigated by the extent to which energy transfer  between molecular tags on the two ends of the duplex (fluorescein  and rhodamine) occurs.  (3)  Synthesis of hollow \"quantum dot\"  cadmium sulfide particles will be attempted in an effort to model  the luminescence reported for porous semiconductor particles.   Optical/structure relationships for these particles will be used to  develop a model for the electronic structure of porous  semiconductors.  The teaching plan outlines several ways in which  materials chemistry will be introduced into the undergraduate and  graduate curricula through formal course work and  through both  undergraduate and graduate research.  Also detailed are plans to  foster the development of female scientists through interactions  with women's organizations on campus and in local high schools and  middle schools.    Luminescence is a unique property of certain classes of molecules  in whic h the absorption of light results in emission of light,  usually of a longer wavelength.  The wavelength and intensity of  such luminescence is generally very sensitive to the environment  about the absorbing molecule.  This research aims to utilize the  luminescence of several materials to probe the structures of their  environments.  These applications may provide unique information  about the structure of certain types of DNA that is not readily  determined by other techniques.  The teaching program is designed  to increase the exposure of undergraduate and graduate students to  materials chemistry and to foster the development of female  scientists.",
