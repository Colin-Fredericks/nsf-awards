 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423903  The Worcester Foundation Summer Training Program is a ten  week immersion in biological research for undergraduate  students.  It consists of intensive \"hands-on\" laboratory  research experience individualized for each student and  performed under the guidance of working scientists expert in  many of the modern areas of biological science.  The Program  is designed to provide students with their first exposure to  the actual practical of scientific research in the hopes  that the excitement, challenge and creativity of the  enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in  the sciences as a viable career choice.  In the spring, each  student is matched with a basic research project, initially  proposed by a preceptor with an active research program in  the students stated area mf interest.  Upon acceptance, each  student is provided with a reading list of current  publications in the selected area to provide the background  required for the proposed summer research project .  During  the Program we: 1) instruct each student in safe laboratory,  and appropriate ethical practice; 2) acquaint them with  current issues in biology: 3) teach them scientific  techniques and skills, many of which can be utilized in  their future endeavors; 4) guide them in shaping the  specific research questions to be asked; 5) require that  they work independently toward the agreed upon research  goals; 6) encourage cross disciplinary approaches by  providing opportunities for interaction with other students,  our research staff, and our visiting scientists; and 7)  maintain an educational setting which is maximally  challenging and thus, fosters each student's exploration of  future  career choices in science.  In addition to the  required written report detailing the progress made in their  individual research projects, each student presents a short  oral report to the Faculty and public summarizing the  results of their efforts at a closing mini-symposium and  award ceremony.",
