 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550083  Adams    This five year program enables 54 Arkansas high school physics teachers to build and test self-contained modules for demonstrating and exploring basic physics principles.  Development and testing of the modules would be done during 4-week summer workshops and follow-up academic year working sessions.  Teachers will make a 3-year commitment to participate in each summer's work enabling building on previous summers.  Each summer participating teachers may earn 3-semester hours of graduate credit in physics.  The University of Arkansas-Little Rock (ALR) will establish and operate module loan program for at least five years following the grant's expiration, at which time the modules will be transferred to the Arkansas Regional Educational Cooperatives.  Each module set contains 15 separate and distinct laboratory units, three for each of the five areas:  Mechanics, Waves and Optics, Electricity and Magnetism, Heat and Modern Physics.    Two or three member teams from the same Arkansas Education Cooperative will participate each year.  Over the three year period all 18 regional cooperatives will be represented Teams within a region and across regions will be connected through  INTERNET and distance learning technologies.  Further networking will be done as each participant mentors another physics teacher as they use these modules.",
