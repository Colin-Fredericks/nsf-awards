This award enables the Operation SMART project  to significantly expand its efforts to include an additional  600-700 students and 22 elementary teachers, largely in rural  areas, a population not previously targeted, and to focus on  project evaluation.      This training and technical project is designed:  (1) to improve  the performance and persistence of girls in science, math and  relevant technology, while influencing all students' positive  performance in these disciplines, and (2) to increase teachers'  use of hands-on inquiry, and problem solving approaches while  building confidence in their teaching skills, which involves  increasing their awareness of and skills in addressing gender  equity as a cultural issue.  An evaluation of the project will  include:  a quantitative analysis of the project impact on  students and teachers; a qualitative analysis of the project  impact on teacher attitudes, perceptions and implementation of  project activities; and an analysis of the process of developing  and implementing the project--ascertaining key elements, methods,  and players--the \"who, what, why, and how.\"  ***",
