 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523120   Anand  Continuous improvement of the quality and reliability of manufactured parts requires clear methods and guidelines for accurate, fast and consistent inspection of parts and interpretation   of inspection data.  This research aims to develop a technique for calculating size tolerances and the minimum zones for flatness and straightness based on  the Hough Transform method.  This technique for evaluating geometric tolerances of manufactured parts, unlike the methods currently used, is exact and is thus more appropriate for precision applications.  Data will be collected from actual industrial parts from three different manufacturers who will collaborate to compare the new technique with the methods they currently use for size, flatness, straightness, and orientation tolerances.  Most manufacturers currently us approximate methods to verify geometric tolerances.  This can result in errors that degrade product quality, especially for precision machining.  The results of this research could result in more accurate and efficient inspection of geometric tolerances.  Since the method is exact rather than approximate, it should be particularly  useful for precision manufacturing.    The proposed method has application to a broad range of manufacturing industries, if successful.",
