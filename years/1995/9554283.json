 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gorman  95-54283    Full time access to appropriate computing power for every student, in class as well as at home, has not been economically possible despite its generally recognized benefits. Nor has it been possible to seek the potential for parental involvement in their child's studies if provided with outreach from the school to the home.' This proposal for a planning grant describes organizational and research activities pre-requisite to developing a computing/communication structure that would provide those benefits.    Interdisciplinary discussions including professionals from the fields of cognitive psychology, educational technology and digital engineering have envisaged an approach that serves the unique requirements of a computer-enriched educational environment. Those requirements are:      realistic cost    significantly lower tolerance to complexity of use, and    an absolute demand for ubiquity and equality in access.    The projected approach calls for a hierarchical local network infrastructure which includes the classroom and the home, and which expedites access to remote information resources. The envisaged infrastructure meets education's unique requirements by simplifying and relocating the requisite technical facilities and, at the same time making innovative use of new communication and multisensory input/output technologies.    This planning grant proposal would survey existing and developmental high quality educational software and operating protocols, in K-12 mathematics and science. This would include evaluation criteria from current and experimental school programs, curriculum developers and test-bed operations. The software and the operating protocols will be conceptually superimposed on the envisaged infrastructure. As a result, a scenario of design, testing and evaluation will be derived to serve in guiding the development of a follow-on project to implement the envisaged infrastructure in a succession of test environments.",
