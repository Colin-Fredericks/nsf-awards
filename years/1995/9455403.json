 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455403  Shaffer  The GeoSim Interface Library (GIL) provides a common set of  Graphical User Interface functions for programs running under the  MS-DOS,Macintosh and X Windows programming environments.  Application program software is written to access GIL. In this way,  programs need only be written once to run under these three  programming environments. GIL handles most typical GUI tasks, such  as window display; backing store management for overlapping  windows; mouse interaction with buttons, drag regions, lists and  sliders. GIL supports help screens and alert boxes. GIL also  includes additional support for non-typical applications  development features such as log files, data file processing, and  time-driven functions independent of user interface objects and  actions (used for discrete event simulations).  Existing GUI  development systems do not provide the multi-platform capability  necessary for our diverse student population. Fortunately, GIL has  proven to be easy to use by students and researchers alike, and can  easily be adapted to class use. This proposal seeks to obtain the  modest manpower resources necessary to make GIL a tool that can be  used by undergraduates in introductory programming courses. GIL   provides a GUI library for use in writing class programming  assignments. Use of a GUI in introductory programming classes  allows students to begin early practice in writing applications  programs more like what they will do in their jobs. Enhancements to  the GIL system include a Graphical Interface Developer that allows  students to interactively place user interface elements on the  screen, better support for fonts and window backing store, and  classroom ready documentation and examples. GIL, including source  code and documentation, will be freely distributed via  tabsInternet.",
