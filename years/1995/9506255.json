This allosteric enzyme reversibly utilizes the energy of a transmembrane proton gradient to synthesize ATP.  The long term goal of the research is to contribute toward an understanding of the mechanism of the energy transduction process and to understand how this enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions in plants and animals.  Prior NSF funding has led to: 1) Cloning and over-expression of all five subunits of the catalytic F1 portion of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1); 2) Recovery of the subunits from bacterial inclusion bodies and refolding them into their native, active forms;  and 3) Reconstituting them into a functional F1 complex.  Further studies will utilize this system to genetically engineer CF1 subunits for analyzing regions of functional importance, and to examine functional dynamics of subunits during the catalytic process using biochemical and biophysical techniques.  This proposal describes a collaborative multidiciplinary approach focusing on the structure and function of the three smaller CF1 subunits, ( ( and (.  Genetic engineering experiments will involve: 1) Site-directed mutagenesis studies to probe the functional and structural importance of different regions of the polypeptide chains via replacement or deletion of specific amino acids or sequences of amino acids; 2) Studies of subunit dynamics through attachment of intrinsic (tryptophans) and extrinsic (via cysteine residues) fluorescent probes to specific sites on the ( ( and ( subunits.  Labeled subunits will be reconstituted with CF1 deficient in these subunits for fluorescence studies aimed at (a) structural mapping of subunits within  the CF1 complex using fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements and (b) monitoring subunit dynamics during catalytic turnover by the enzyme by monitoring the time-dependent anisotropy of intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescent probes; 3) Chemical crosslinking studies involving attachment of bifunctional  chemical crosslinking agents at various engineered sites within the ( and ( subunits.  Mutant subunits will be reconstituted with the other CF1 subunits and with the membrane-bound proton channel portion (CF0) of the enzyme for chemical crosslinking studies aimed at identifying the sites of interaction between CF1 and CF0 subunits. %%% This research addresses the relationship between the chemical structure and biological function of the ATP synthase enzyme of plant chloroplast membranes.  This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of the energy from sunlight into the chemical storage form.  ATP (adenosine triphosphate).  ATP in turn supplies the energy  for the conversion of carbon dioxide into sugar in plants.  Analogous enzymes supply more than 90% of the ATP required for energy-dependent metabolic processes in animals and bacteria.  The long term goal of the research described in this proposal is to identify, at the molecular level, how the ATP synthase enzymes capture energy and convert it into ATP.  We intend to approach this goal by genetically engineering the ATP synthase so as to probe the importance of specific sites within the enzyme for the energy conversion (catalytic) process.  Some of the genetically engineered sites will provide sites for attachment of chemical probes which will be used to identify specific events involving changes in the structure of the enzyme which occur during the catalytic process.  Attachment of other chemical probes to genetically engineered sites will allow us to cross-link (tether) pieces of the enzyme together so that we can identify specific sites of protein-protein interaction which occur within the enzyme and which are important for catalysis.  A thorough understanding of this very efficient natural energy conserving process will potentially lead to the design and implementation of vastly improved energy storage and utilization processes  or human use. ***                           ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (",
