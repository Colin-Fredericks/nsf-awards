 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453023  Taylor    The American Museum of Natural History is developing a 10,000 sq.  ft. Hall of Life's Diversity that will interpret biodiversity, what  it is, why it matters to humans, why it is under threat, and what  can be done to mitigate the current pattern of extinctions.  The  hall will have the following sections: a) the Crisis Center that  will serve as the orientation place for the exhibit and where the  core principles of the exhibit will be interpreted, b) four  interactive habitat models that depict major ecosystems, c) the  Spectrum of Life, in which specimens, models, photographs, and  interactive multimedia will be juxtaposed and will serve as a field  guide to the array of animal and plant life on the planet, d) a  Resource Center that is devoted to educational activities, and e)  a theater/classroom space.  The intended audience for the exhibit  is people of all ages and learning styles.  The exhibit will  illuminate the crucial role that science plays in our everyday  lives and will promote science literacy among adults and children.   In addition to the main exhibit, there will be a broad menu of  complementary programming including traveling versions of the  exhibit, a teacher resource guide, and a teacher-training  institute.  The exhibit and complementary activities are to be  coordinated with New York State's State Systemic Initiative  program.",
