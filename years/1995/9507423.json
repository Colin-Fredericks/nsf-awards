 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507423    This project will use genetic analysis to determine the  patterns of paternity and male reproductive success in the  chimpanzees and baboons of Gombe National Park, Tanzania.  These populations have been studied under the direction of  Dr. Jane Goodall for 35 and 28 years, respectively.  In both  species, females mate with many males, and males show a  variety of mating strategies including mating at high  frequencies, aggressive competition for access to females,  possessive behavior, the formation of consortships, and the  cultivation of special relationships with females.  However,  little is known of the relative effectiveness of these  strategies in achieving paternity because genetic analysis  has not been possible.  This project will use a non-invasive  procedure, the extraction of DNA from feces, to obtain  genetic material for analysis.  Samples from 250 baboons in  five troops, and 20 chimpanzees in one community, have  already been collected, and techniques for DNA extraction  have been perfected.  Samples will be collected from  additional infants and unsampled potential parents in six  baboon troops and two chimpanzee communities to yield total  sample sizes of 150 infant baboons and 20 infant  chimpanzees.  Approximately 8 hypervariable regions of the  nuclear DNA will be amplified by the polymerase chain  reaction (PCR), and paternity will be determined by  comparing the genotypes of infants, their mothers, and  potential fathers.  In combination with the detailed  behavioral records, knowledge of paternity will allow  assessment of the effectiveness of different mating  strategies.  The study will provide new information about  patterns mf relatedness within groups and will provide new  insights into the evolution of competitive behavior and  affiliative relationships in these species.",
