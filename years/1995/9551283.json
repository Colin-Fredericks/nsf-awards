 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary  undergraduate laboratory component for an existing three-credit  course, \"Design and Manufacture of Printed Circuit Assemblies.\"   Previously, student hands-on experiences had been limited to  simulations with APTOS software, without a more meaningful  laboratory experience needed for students to be better prepared  for careers in this area.   The course, with its new lab  component, is intended for seniors in electrical engineering and  mechanical engineering, and design projects are formulated so  that students are able to focus on aspects that are commensurate  with their major.   Students fabricate their designs immediately  at the Electronic Manufacturing Productivity Facility and test  and evaluate their products in the new laboratory.  Major  equipment purchased for this laboratory includes six Sun  SPARCstations, a networkable PADS-PERFORM CAD system for  UNIX-based workstations, and a color plotter.   This equipment is  used for the layout design and analysis of surface mount printed  circuit assemblies.   Additional equipment includes two function  generators, two digital storage oscilloscopes, and two logic  analyzers used for testing the final products.  This project is  significant because it brings the theoretical study, laboratory  design, and real product manufacturing of surface-mount printed  circuit assemblies as a whole to undergraduate education.   In  addition, it provides a model for the cooperation of educational  institutions and manufacturing companies to provide  state-of-the-art technical training for senior students, and  emphasizes interdisciplinary group work for students from  different disciplines.",
