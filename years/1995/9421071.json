 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detection of external chemical signals is important for  whole organisms, in the senses of taste and smell, as well  as being important for individual cells.  Calcium ions have  been implicated in responses of cells to external signals,  including chemical signals.  Bacteria have been developed as  a model system for conveniently studying the ways in which  chemical signals affect the cellular machinery of  responsiveness.  Bacteria in a liquid medium swim with a  flagella; when it rotates clockwise they \"run\", but when it  rotates counterclockwise the show extensive tumbling and  reorientation.  While swimming, they show behavior called  chemotaxis; swimming toward sources of chemical attractant  compounds is a positive response, and tumbling away from  repellents is a negative response.  This project  investigates the role of calcium ions in these opposite  responses, and the mechanisms involved in the calcium ion  actions.  A simple assay of bacteria swimming into capillary  tubes provides behavioral data,  fluorescence calcium-  sensitive dyes measure calcium ion concentrations, and  labeled phosphate compounds that are taken up by proteins  allow measuring the effect of calcium ions on metabolic  reactions related to chemotaxis.  This work will have  important impact on chemosensory science and bacterial  biology, but also will have an impact on understanding  cellular mechanisms of behavior in other organisms because  calcium ions play key roles in the action of nerves and  muscles.",
