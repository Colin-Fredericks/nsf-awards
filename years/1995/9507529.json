 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507488  Dumont      The  organization  of  enamel in mammalian  teeth  can  vary  between   simple   parallel   arrangement   of   crystallite  (nonprismatic    enamel)    to   complicated    non-parallel  arrangements (prismatic enamel).  Prismatic enamel increases  the  strength  of  the tooth, but we know relatively  little  about the function of non-prismatic enamel.  In humans, non-  prismatic enamel is more resistant to erosive destruction by  dietary  acids  and  sugar by-products  than  is  underlying  prismatic  enamel. This research examines  tooth  structure,  diet diversity, and salivary chemistry in an array of mammal  species.   It  will  test  the hypothesis  that  exaggerated  superficial  layers  of nonprismatic tooth  are  adaptations  that  permit  dietary  emphases on  acidic  or  sugary  food  sources.  For each species, food hardness, sugar content and  acidity  of  natural  diets  are  measured,  together   with  salivary  pH  and  buffering capacity.   The  proportion  of  nonprismatic  enamel  in  molar  teeth  is  measured   using  scanning electron microscopy.  Mammals with high proportions  of  nonprismatic enamel are predicted to consume foods  that  are  more  sugary, acidic, and softer than  those  eaten  by  species  that exhibit relatively little nonprismatic enamel.  Salivary  pH  and  buffering capacity are  predicted  to  be  relatively   lower   among  species   that   exhibit   large  proportions of nonprismatic enamel. This study will  provide  evidence   of   the   interactions  between   tooth   enamel  morphology, oral physiology and feeding behavior that  limit  the diversity of foods that mammals select.  It will lead to  better  understanding of the relationships between  anatomy,  physiology  and behavior that influence the  ways  in  which  animals share food plant resources.  It will provide insight  into  the  diets  of extinct or poorly known  species.   The  results of this study may also yield insights into the  role  of human nonprismatic e namel in resisting dental erosion and  the initiation of tooth decay.",
