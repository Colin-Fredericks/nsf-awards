The Danau Sentarum area is, under Indonesian law, a wildlife reserve that officially contains no legal human settlement.  In fact, however, best estimates number the permanent residents of the region at 3,000-4,000, and this number is growing.  These residents depend upon fish, forest products, and game, the very resources the internationally-funded wildlife reserve project is intended to protect.  In addition, the area is important nationally for timber and fish production and for maintaining hydrologic processes, especially the buffering of downstream flooding.  Thus the region is at the intersection of the interests of numerous local, regional, national, and international groups.  In this setting, the research will focus on (1) how rules for allocation and management of fish resources have been developed, (2) why villages with similar cultural traditions and in similar ecological contexts differ in the resource management rules they develop, (3) how the increased pressure on the resources has affected the dynamics of the region's social networks, (4) what new resources management practices have emerged under conditions of increased resource scarcity and incongruent rule systems, and (5) what effect have these new practices had.  %%%%  This research examines the local consequences of extralocal resource management agendas and the historical roots of conflict between local user groups in the Danau Sentarum wildlife reserve in West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo.
