 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320253  Chin  This project explores the application of ocean surface  current radar (OSCR) systems to the identification of  outfall mixing zones.  A single deployment of an OSCR system  is typically equivalent to deploying over 1,000 current  meters, with spacings between current meters on the order of  a few hundred meters.  Clearly, OSCR systems have the  capability to define ambient surface currents in far greater  spatial and temporal detail than is currently feasible using  any other method of measurement.  This study will  investigate whether data derived from short-term OSCR  deployments can be effectively incorporated in a (far-field)  mixing model that describes the dispersion of contaminants  discharged from sewage outfalls.  This project is composed  of three tasks: (1) Verify the stationarity of spatial  current patterns measured by short-term (on the order of a  month) OSCR deployments; (2) Develop an algorithm to utilize  OSCR measurements to simulate mixing of contaminants  discharged from ocean outfalls; and (3) Utilize the  developed algorithm to predict dispersion at a site where  OSCR measurements are available, and validate the algorithm  by comparing the predicted and measured dilutions.  ***",
