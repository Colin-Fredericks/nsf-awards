 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414241  Chicone       The purpose of the conference is to provide a forum for  an important series of lectures to be presented by Professor  George Sell, University of Minnesota.  He is a leading  expert in the theory and application of dynamical systems,  especially that part of the theory related to the dynamic  processes of natural phenomena.  Advances in the  mathematical modeling, analysis and application of these  processes are fundamental to our understanding of such  diverse physical phenomena as weather, pollution of  groundwater and rivers, aircraft flight, or the motion of  blood through the human heart.  The topic of the conference  is central to current research in the area of dynamical  systems and its practical applications.       Professor Sell's lectures will range over the basis for  a specific approach to understanding the long time behavior  of dynamical systems (the approach being approximation by  nearby systems that are amenable to analysis).  He will also  discuss the use of this approach for the design and  implementation of computer software to solve some important  physical problems.       In accordance with the program description for the  regional NSF/CBMS conferences, the organizers will invite  participants primarily from the Mid-West.  The funded  participants will be chosen from the ranks of professional  mathematicians and graduate students.  The research programs  of the professional participants should benefit in several  ways from the conference.  They will be able to learn an  important new approach to solving problems that they may  already be studying.  Also, they will enhance the teaching  mission of their home institutions by incorporating the  subject matter of the conference into their graduate  courses.  Graduate students will be presented with cutting  edge tool that will be a very useful component of their  graduate education.  In addition, some of them may well be  influenced to enter an important area of research where many  problems of enormous  import remain unsolved.",
