Significance  The  Northridge earthquake and its aftershocks have produced  the  most comprehensive set of strong motion data ever recorded for  a  single earthquake sequence. These data allow for a wide range  of  research  involving  the  analysis  and  modeling  of  earthquake  source, path and site effects within the Los Angeles region.  One  important  area of concern is to understand the effect  that  the  deep  sedimentary basins which underlie the San Fernando and  Los  Angeles  regions  had  on  the  amplification  and  focusing   of  long-period  (1-10  sec) seismic energy during  this  earthquake.  Previous work has shown that wave propagation effects related  to  the geologic structure of the Los Angeles and San Fernando basins  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  observed  ground  motions,  particularly  for periods longer than about 1 sec.  and  in  many  cases, these basin-induced effects dominate the ground motions in  the  period  range  1-10  sec. During the Northridge  earthquake,  localized  areas of intense ground shaking and associated  damage  were   observed   that  cannot  be  explained   by   conventional  attenuation   relations  (e.g.,  Santa   Monica,   I-10   freeway  collapse).  It  is  important to understand the  cause  of  these  phenomena and address their implications for engineering  design,  particularly for large structures (e.g., tall buildings,  freeway  bridges,  base-isolated structures), which are most sensitive  to  long-period energy.    Method and Anticipated Results  This   investigation  involves  the  analysis  of  ground  motion  recordings  of  the  Northridge earthquake and its aftershocks  in  order to systematically map out the observed basin effects within  the  San Fernando and Los Angeles regions. A key element of  this  analysis  is  the  numerical modeling of these data  using  a  3D  elastic   finite-difference  technique.   The   finite-difference  approach   is   attractive  because  it  allows  flexibility   in  incorporating strongly heterogeneous velocity models, as well  as  using a finite, variable-slip source model.                                    The goal of this project is to: (1) produce long-period (1-10  sec) time histories calculated on a fine spatial mesh throughout  the San Fernando and Los Angeles regions; (2) display the results  in map format, which will illustrate the spatial distribution of  generated ground motions (e.g., wave field timeslices,  distribution of peak velocity and duration of shaking) and the  correlation of these motions with the subsurface geology; and (3)  compare these results with those obtained using existing  empirical attenuation relations, as well as the results  calculated for 1D velocity models, in order to quantify the  effects of the basin response for use in future seismic hazard  analyses.  ***",
