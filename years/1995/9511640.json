 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprehensively assesses at age 30 the participants in a longitudinal study of personality and cognitive development begun in their early childhood.  Participants have already been intensively assessed during their nursery school years, in middle childhood, preadolescence, early and late adolescence, and young adulthood.  Appreciable information also exists regarding their parents and parent-child interactions.  Many theoretically important and useful findings concerning the determinants of personality and cognitive development have been reported during the course of this study.  However, the ultimate import of various childhood and adolescent behaviors and experiences can only be recognized in adulthood.  By age 30 life paths and opportunity structures are appreciably set for most individuals.   A multifaceted assessment of subjects when they are entering their fourth decade is unusually consequential.because at this age, unlike the last assessment at age 23,  the developmental requirement  of accommodating to issues of work and interpersonal connection has been seriously confronted.  The age 30 assessment will focus upon the participants' life courses to date and their current life circumstances (e.g., work and career patterns, self perceptions, experienced life stresses, physical and mental health, cognitive and moral development, personal philosophies, pattern of leisure time usage, interpersonal and attachment relationships).  Procedures will involve detailed, intimate, and systematic interviews videotaped for subsequent coding; various experimental information-processing procedures deemed relevant to personality, cognitve, and moral development; measures of psychobiologic reactivity; inventory items which follow up and extend knowledge derived from previously administered questionnaires.  These data wiill consolidate understanding of the implications of various  processes during the formative childhood, adolescent, and youth years for successful developmental outcomes in adult hood.  This project provides follow-up assessment at age 30 of participants in a well-established longitudinal study who have been intensively studied from ages 3 to 23.  Unlike most longitudinal data sets,  this project is notable for the large amount of data available for each participant and on the comparability of the data across time periods.  Because of its longitudinal -- fully prospective -- nature,  many theoretically important and useful findings have been reported during the course of this study that could not be gleaned from other data sets.  For example, one notable contribution has been to revise the understanding of the impact of divorce on children:  by studying families prior to divorce, it was shown that pre-divorce family discord appears to account for much of what earlier had been viewed as an effect of divorce.  Other contributions to knowledge include:  the nursery school and familial antecedents of drug use in adolescence and young adulthood;  the early childhood personality and parental antecedents of depression in adolescence and young adulthood; early antecedents of creativity, ego-resilience, and ego-control;  personality continuities in self-esteem and resiliency.  By extending assessments to age 30, when life attainments and relatively established life patterns can be identified, this project addresses crucial developmental issues that cannot be addressed with data collected at earlier ages. More specifically, a multifaceted assessment of subjects when they are entering their fourth decade is unusually consequential because at this age, unlike the last assessment at age 23,  the developmental requirement of accommodating to issues of work and interpersonal connection has been seriously confronted. The  prospective assessement of the antecedents of successful adaptations in the domains of work and marriage which this project will provide is highly relevant to the Human Capital research agenda on 'workplace' and 'families'. These data wiill consolidate understanding of  the implications of various  processes during the formative childhood, adolescent, and youth years for successful developmental outcomes in adulthood that are of great societal consequence..",
