 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407724  Gurol  This is an award to support research on a potential water  treatment process using hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron  oxide catalysts to oxidize organic substances of hazardous  significance that may be present in water or produced during its  disinfection by use of chlorine.  The research involves  determination of the mechanisms and rates of oxidation of the  target compounds, trichloroethylene and monochlorobenzene in  continuous flow and in batch processing modes of operating slurry  reactors in which the reactions take place.  A conceptual model  of the process will be experimentally evaluated for its  predictive capability.  The investigator also plans on exploring  the potential use of the concept in a filtration process where  the iron catalyst is present as a coating on the water filter  media.     Presence of organic substances in surface and groundwaters may  result in the production of potentially hazardous compounds when  chlorine is used to disinfect the water.  The research being  conducted in this project is expected to result in determination  of parameters for use in engineering design of water treatment  processes to destroy these compounds.  Results may also be  applicable in engineering design of systems for remediation of  groundwater that has been contaminated by chlorinated organic  compounds.  ***",
