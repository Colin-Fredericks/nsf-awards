The main objective of the research related to the singular   continuous spectrum is to study the relation between the spectral   properties and longtime behavior of the generalized eigenfunctions, in   particular between certain growth properties of generalized   eigenfunctions, the Hausdorff dimension of the spectral measure, and   stability or instability of singular continuous spectrum with respect to   rank one perturbations. Another goal of the proposed research is to study   singular continuous spectrum for models where singular spectrum may appear   for the critical values (intervals) of the parameters, serving as a   transition from absolutely continuous to pure point spectrum. The main   objective of the research related to localization is to develop methods of   proving localization for ergodic families of operators (disordered   systems) with deterministic disorder. Also general uniformity properties   of localization and relation to quantum dynamics will be studied.        The proposed research is centered around the fundamental properties of   disordered and singular systems that are used in modeling of many micro   and macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquake theory. The   proposed topics include studying properties of highly disordered systems   of Quantum ald Statistical Mechanics and of systems at critical levels of   disorder, that demonstrate highly unstable behavior.   ***",
