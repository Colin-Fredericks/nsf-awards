The Seminar is hosted by several midwest universities, and are of particular value to graduate students and young post-doctorals.  They have the opportunity to the meet research mathematicians from other campuses and discover new facets of their field which are not represented at their own institutions.      Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuraay of these approximations.",
