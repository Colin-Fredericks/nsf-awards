 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503200  Villaverde  To augment the damping of a  structure significantly through a  tuned-mass damper one has to use a  damper with a large mass.  A  possible way to avoid the use of an  additional mass is to use the  building roof as the damper's mass.  For this, one has to isolate the  roof from the rest of the building,  connect it to a spring and a  dashpot, and then connect these to  the rest of the building.  More  conveniently, however, one can take  advantage of the progress made in  base isolation technology and use  elastomeric bearings instead of  springs.  The purpose of the  proposed research is to conduct a  numerical study with an actual  building and an experimental study  with two small-scale five-story  steel building models to  demonstrate that such a  configuration is a viable way to  construct a damper, to augment the  damping in a building, and to  increase its resistance to  earthquake excitations.  The  numerical study will be carried out  to investigate the bearing  dimensions needed to attain the  desired effect in a real building,  the order of magnitude of the  displacements experienced by its  bearings, the behavior of the  building-damper system when the  structure is stressed beyond its  elastic limit, and the design  difficulties in implementing a real  building with such a technique.  The experimental study will be  performed by testing on a shaking  table the two building models.  One  of the models will be built with a  conventional configuration and the  other according to the proposed  one.  This study will serve to  verify the findings from the  numerical one without the  assumptions and uncertainties  involved in the analytical  modelling of the building and its  elastomeric bearings.  The results  of the studies are expected to  demonstrate numerically and  experimentally the viability and  effectiveness of the proposed  technique, will clarify some of the  questions posed by its use, and, if  proven effective, will furnish  incentives, the justification,  and  the needed information for the  planning of a large-scale  experimental program.  ***",
