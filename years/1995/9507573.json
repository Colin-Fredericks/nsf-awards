 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal area of activity will be on the study of  electron dynamics in the halogen atoms, both the core and  the valence electrons.  The halogen atom, with one missing  electron in the outer p-shell, is a prototype open-shell  element, and an understanding of the electron dynamics in  these atoms is fundamental to the characterization of  electron motion at the multiplet level.  The experiments  which will be carried out are made possible through  advances in synchrotron radiation sources and atomic target  sources which allow for the elucidation of the details of  electron dynamics at an unprecedented degree of  differentiation. Isolation of decay processes at the LS  multiplet level are a routine feature of the experiments,  and isolation at the J fine-structure level, where  experiments reveal the presence of significant effects due  to spin-orbit coupling, will be stressed.    This research program has the general theme of studying the  details of electron correlation as it is manifest in the  dynamics of electron motion in open-shell and doubly  excited atoms.  The main thrust of the program is toward  the study of those elements in which the influence of the  anisotropic potential on the motion of the electrons has  yet to be probed at the detailed level appropriate to an  open-shell structure.  The proposed experiments constitute  the first indepth examination of the predictions of  existing theories for these complex many-body systems and  are aimed at giving impetus to the development of more  advanced theoretical models.  An accompanying set of  measurements on the double excitations in helium, the  prototype three-body system, will supplement the principal  effort, and the detailed examination of dynamics of excited-  state metastable atoms will set the stage for the future  direction for the research.",
