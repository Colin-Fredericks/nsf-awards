 "awd_abstract_narration": "ESI-9453205    This national project brings together the American Meteorological  Society in cooperation with the National Weather Service, The  Weather Channel and members of the AMS professional society.  During five years, 4,100 teachers from grades K-12 will be trained  directly, in an intensive course offered twice yearly, on  atmospheric and related Earth environments. The course is based on  electronically transmitted  data streams and learning materials  delivered in real time. It will emphasize the teaching of  integrated science through problem-focused or event driven  investigations of the natural environment. Leader teachers, those  who have completed the twenty two days of training, will act as  resource persons within their schools, reaching a second tier of at  least 41,000 teachers. At the same time, they will work towards  raising the awareness administrators, parents and school board  members  of the educational potential of electronically-delivered  data streams in their schools.  The course will be implemented  through 50 Local Implementation Teams composed of experienced  teachers, college faculty and professional meteorologists. The KEY  to the this aspect of the project is it will be its delivery via a  combination of group meetings, by Internet or more commonly using  the Vertical Blanking Interval of the Weather Channel.",
