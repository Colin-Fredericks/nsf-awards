 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purchase of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument   will enable undergraduate students to become familiar with state of  the art electrophoresis methodology and with computerized data  acquisition and instrument control.  Experiments using the  instrument will replace or greatly enhance experiments presently  performed in two upper level chemistry courses, Instrumental  Analysis and General Biochemistry.  The instrument will also be  used in undergraduate research.         In Instrumental Analysis, commercial products will be analyzed  for organic acid composition, demonstrating the usefulness of CE in  the analysis of small molecules.  This experiment will replace one  in which ion chromatography is used to determine the inorganic ion  composition of tapwater.         In General Biochemistry, CE will initially be used to add two  new experiments to the laboratory course:  1) enzymatic and  chemical digestion of a protein followed by separation and  quantitation by free zone CE and 2) a protein-substrate binding  analysis by affinity CE techniques followed by mathematical  treatment of the data by the method of Scatchard.  These   experiments will allow the students exposure to both additional  conventional and computational biotechniques.         It is likely that CE will assume increasing importance in the  undergraduate teaching laboratory.  We intend to share the results  of our experiences both through journal publication and  presentations at regional and national scientific meetings.",
