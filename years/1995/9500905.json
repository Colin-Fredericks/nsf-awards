 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hardin  DMS-9500905          Work supported by this award focuses on the mathematical  development of wavelet analysis and its applications.  This is a  branch of harmonic analysis closely allied with applications to  many areas of science.  The underlying goals of wavelet analysis  are (i) to determine functions whose integer translates and  dyadic dilates form orthogonal (or biorthogonal) bases for  square-integrable functions (ii) to ensure that the basis  elements localize both time and frequency and (iii) that they  have the requisite smoothness dictated by the problem.  Normally,  wavelets are also expected to have compact support.  This project will focus on construction of compactly supported and orthogonal wavelets in two and higher dimensions, new filter-bank constructions, and application to image processing and numerical methods for differential equations.          The theory of wavelets, as it has become known, is actually  a body of ideas which has developed dramatically over the past  decade, following several important discoveries by physicists,  computer scientists and engineers concerned with signal  processing and data compression.  It evolved into a synthesis of  many existing techniques into a framework which offers  possibilities for improved applications and challenging  mathematical ideas which will require years to reach what might  be considered a mature stage.  Many areas of science are now  adapting wavelet constructs to important problems currently under  investigation.  These included statisticians looking for patterns  in large data sets, compression of fingerprint data, edge  reconstruction of images and the generation of fractal sets with  prescribed characteristics.",
