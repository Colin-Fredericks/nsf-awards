 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414680  Sen       This research addresses the problem of multi-stage decision  making with uncertainty in a long-range planning process,  especially those that are typically undertaken by industry in  planning for the entire life cycle of a product.  The work is aimed  at developing some algorithms to extend earlier work in stochastic  decomposition models for two stage problems.  This research extends  the two-stage problem to a problem involving more than two stages.   Stochastic decomposition SD uses randomly generated observations  within Benders, decomposition of a two stage stochastic linear  program to identify an optimal solution (asymptotically).       Many key decisions aimed at improving a company's global  competitiveness involve the integration of several aspects planning  and design.  The techniques developed as part of this research will  provide the tools necessary to integrate several decision elements  of a company in designing high quality and long lasting products  while at the same time keeping cost down.  In this respect, the  developments from this research can find applications in such areas  as concurrent engineering, total quality management, and production  planning and control.  Furthermore, the results from the research  could provide some insight to help bridge the gap between  stochastic and deterministic Operations Research.",
