Plant  membrane transport is a central feature of our understanding  of plant growth, development and metabolism. Young  scientists, trained in excellent labs, are bringing new  technologies to the field, such as expression of channels in  Xenopus oocytes to study transport, patch clamping, laser  surgery of plant cells to allow patch clamping, and use of  transgenic technologies to discover transporters through  complementation of transport defects in yeast mutants. Since  the young scientists are in many ways driving the field,  they provided travel money for this international meeting in  plant membrane biology held this year in Regensburg,  Germany.  This is a seminal meeting in this area of research  and was held last time, three years ago in California.  There has been many new approaches and discoveries made  since that time and this is one of the few platforms where  these researchers can meet together as a community.  No  similar meetings have been held during the three years.  %%%  Plant membrane transport is undergoing rapid changes.
