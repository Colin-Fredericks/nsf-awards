 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520388  Vining  Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer  deaths in the United States.  As with other cancers, studies  suggest that early detection and removal of precursor polyps  and small carcinomas reduces mortality.  Visualization of  the entire colon by means of X-ray images enhanced with  barium (a barium enema) or colonoscopy (endoscope) improves  polyp detection.  Both examinations have poor patient  compliance because of associated discomfort, inconvenience,  risk and cost.  colonoscopy has an advantage over barium  enema because it serves both as a diagnostic test and a  therapeutic procedure, as polyps are removed upon their  discovery.  However, colonoscopy is an invasive examination,  does not always reveal significant lesions, fails to reach  the far end (cecum) of the colon in about 15% of patients,  sometimes requires sedation, increases the risk of bowel  perforation, and is the most expensive of all bowel  examinations.    This proposal describes research to develop a new approach  for Virtual Colonoscopy (VC) examinations as a substitute  for the costly and invasive diagnostic colonoscopy (DC).  VC  combines helical CT scanning, 3D reconstruction, and high-  performance computing to examine the entire colon rapidly  and to lessen the discomfort  for the patient.  The aims of  this project are to generate new software for evaluating VC  examinations, to create an algorithm for measuring the  colon's wall thickness to highlight areas of abnormal  thickness, to validate the accuracy of VC with the foregoing  modifications, and to determine the cost-savings potential  of VC relative to DC.  The project involves a  multidisciplinary team of investigators, the results are to  be evaluated in a clinical setting by comparing the results  of VC relative to DC in patients undergoing usual care  colonoscopy, and the work plan includes educational  activities to promote a better understanding of the cost-  reducing issue.    Successful results from this project would  yield significant  clinical and public health benefits by way of the potential  for increased acceptance among patients, and doing so at  considerably lower cost and risks.  ***",
