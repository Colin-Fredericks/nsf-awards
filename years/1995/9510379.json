 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510379  Eldering  This is an award to support preliminary research on the factors  that influence the nature of aerosol particulates in air that  negatively affect its quality.  The proposal leading to this  award was submitted in response to NSF 93-130, Research Planning  Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and  Engineers.  The investigator has selected the region surrounding  Pocatello, Idaho as the site for this planning study.  Its  objective is to utilize results of an air quality sampling  program as a step toward determining the feasibility of  formulating mathematical models that can be used in the  engineering design of pollution abatement and mitigation  measures.  The intensive sampling program will be conducted in  cooperation with the Southeastern Idaho Air Pollution Control  Office.    An understanding of the sources of air pollutants and conditions  that affect their movement is necessary in the formulation of  mathematical models that can be used in the engineering design of  abatement procedures.  This project is expected to assist in  determination of the need for and feasibility of a long-term  sampling program that would reveal annual variations in sources,  chemical composition and size distribution of aerosol  particulates in regions with significant particulate air quality  problems.  ***",
