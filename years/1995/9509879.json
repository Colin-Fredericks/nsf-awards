Roots also grow, die, and decompose, making them part of ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles. Although roots have very important ecosystem functions, their belowground location makes them difficult to study. Consequently, less data exist for roots than other parts of plants. This research project focuses on root dynamics and asks these questions:  (1) How does fine roots growth, death, and decomposition vary spatially and seasonally? (2) Do oaks and grasses coexist with limited competition or do they compete for water and nutrients, especially during annual summer drought? These questions will be answered by measuring seasonal soil water and temperature, soil respiration, and root dynamics. Oak mycorrhizae, a beneficial partnership between certain fungi and plant roots, will be studied. Because blue oaks and annual grasses have different types of mycorrhizae, the research also will examine whether mycorrhizal types affect how well the plants take up water and nutrients. This research will help further maintenance of California's blue oak woodlands and understanding how mycorrhizae alter plant competition.",
