 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420866  Cates  This proposal describes a nuclear physics program based largely  on the use of the Princeton Cyclotron.  There are three major  goals to the research: (1) the investigation of parity non-  conservation in nucleon-nucleon interactions,(2) searches for  time (T) reversal non-invariance in beta decay, and (3) studies  of reactions that are important to stellar structure and  evolution.  The firsts and second goal are based entirely on  atomic physics techniques, with particular emphasis on optical  pumping and spin exchange especially in the development of a  novel polarized 3He beam.  The proposed approach involves feeding  polarized 3He gas into the existing inonizer of the cyclotron.  Using the polarized 3He beam to study parity non-conservation in  nucleon-nucleon interactions, they proposed to use neutron pick-  up reactions to make polarized excited states in 21Ne and 19Ne.  In both cases, the excited states are members of parity doublets  comprising two closely spaced states with identical spin but  opposite parities.  By studying the asymmetries of gamma rays  that are emitted wither parallel or anti-parallel to the  polarization direction, it is possible to determine the parity  mixing within the doublets, providing information on the  effective parity non-conserving potential that exists between  nucleons.  The researchers also plan studies of T symmetry in the  beta decay of 19Ne and 35K, studying light on the origin of T  reversal non-invariance, a phenomena which thus far has only been  observed in the kaon system.  An order of magnitude improvement  in the presets limits on the D coefficient are anticipated.  Finally studies are proposed of several reactions of particular  importance to nuclear astrophysics, to help epsilon the observed  abundance's that result from explosive nucleosynthesis and  understanding stellar evolution and structure.  ***",
