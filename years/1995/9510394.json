New theoretical techniques are developed and  exploited to study projects that have an array of  applications, including fracture, earthquakes, friction,  granular flow, and biological systems.  The first topic  focuses on transport properties of both models and real  systems that the PI and others have studied in the context  of self-organized criticality.  The second topic involves  continuing work in the area of modeling earthquake dynamics,  as well as the development of new microscopic models for  friction and granular flow.  The third topic addresses the  development and testing of prediction algorithms for  spatially extended systems.  %%%  Many systems that we seek to understand in the world around  us are far from equilibrium.  Examples include fracture  (breaking of materials), earthquakes, friction, granular  flow, and biological systems.  This project will continue  the work of the Principal Investigator in addressing such  phenomena theoretically.  One topic involves studying a  particular approach called self-organized criticality that  applies to motion in many of these situations, at least some  of the time.  A second topic continues work in the area of  earthquake dynamics as well as developing new models for  friction and granular flow.  The results of the study will  be directly compared with recent experimental data.  The  third major topic involves developing and testing new  algorithms that predict the future based on past for such  systems.  ***",
