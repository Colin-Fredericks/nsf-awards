 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal in meteorite-asteroid studies is to understand  the links between meteorite classes and their asteroid parent  bodies.  This will allow effective use of detailed knowledge of  meteorite petrology to study records they preserve of solar system  formation in the asteroid regions.  This research is focused on  asteroid observations at spectroscopic resolution sufficient to  define specific mineralogies and meteoritic linkages, and these  telescopic observations will be supported with laboratory analog  measurements.  Certain asteroids have been selected on the basis of  their anomalous low-resolution IR spectral properties, recently  discovered among the results of the Seven Color Infrared Asteroid  Survey of smaller (-50 K,) main-belt objects (Clark et al. 1994).   These asteroids are targeted for further study due to their  promising affinities to some of the more elusive meteorite parent  bodies.  At project conclusion, a modified model for asteroid belt  evolution will be presented.    Interactive activities include:  1) a graduate course will be  taught on astronomy of the Solar System, 2) a seminar will be  offered on current readings on proto-planetary nebulae and star  formation regions, such as these fields have come to bear on  studies of the meteorite record, and 3) a workshop seminar will be  led for graduate and undergraduate students with the purpose of  constructing an introductory astronomy class curriculum.  On the  theory that the best student is a teacher, students will be asked  to lead the class.",
