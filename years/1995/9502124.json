 "awd_abstract_narration": "A magnetospheric substorms is the collection of processes by which  energy is extracted from the solar wind and deposited in the  magnetosphere, ionosphere and earth's atmosphere.  Substorms have  significant effects on the near-earth environment and affect many  of man's systems.  The represent a natural hazard to human  activities that is becoming more important.  Unfortunately, the  cause of substorms, particularly of the most destructive phase, the  expansion phase, is not known.  For may years the most popular  physical model explaining substorms has been the near-earth neutral  line (NENL) model.  This model has been remarkably successful in  organizing numerous observations in the near-earth plasma sheet and  successful predicted the existence and properties of the  magnetotail plasmoid, a bubble of plasma and magnetic field that  the earth releases to the solar wind during substorms.  A number of  new observations have not been incorporated in the NENL model, and  it appears difficult to do so.  It seems that the substorms  expansion begins at local midnight very close to synchronous orbit  (6.6 Re) and propagates outward into the tail.  This expansion  begins on closed, quasi-dipolar field lines at the inner edge of  the cross-tail current sheet.  Subsequently it moves tailward by  disrupting the tail current, diverting it along magnetic field  lines to the auroral ionosphere.    A new model called the current disruption (CD) model is being  developed to explain these observations.  Some versions of this  model predict dynamics of the tail plasma sheet and magnetic field  that are diametrically opposite to the predictions of the NENL  model, and the observations on which it is based.  Such a fortunate  circumstance should be easy to resolve.  The model either agrees or  disagrees with observations and we should be able to decide between  them.      It is proposed to re-examine the observations in the near-earth  plasma sheet and place them on a firmer footing so that it will be  pos sible to develop a reasonable physical model of the substorm  expansion phase.  To this end, data already at UCLA, and additional  data from other investigators will be used to study the problems of  frequency of occurrence and time delay of phenomena relative to  substorms onset.  Other ground indicators of substorm onset will be  used including brightenings in satellite auroral images,  midlatitude positive bays, Pi 2 pulsation bursts, maxima in  inclination of synchronous magnetic field, and dispersionless  plasma injection at synchronous orbit.  Features to be examined  include changes in magnetic field, particle fluxes, plasma  pressure, plasma flow and temperature.  Based on these results, the  different models and their success in explaining the observations  will be considered.",
