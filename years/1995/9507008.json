 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507008  Saunders    Recent results have indicated that spindle function in  various eukaryotes is controlled by a relative balance  between inwardly and outwardly-directed spindle motors.  The  outwardly-directed motors have recently been identified.  The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to  identify the rest of the \"inwardly-directed \" force  generating proteins and to examine the function of these  motors in chromosome segregation.  Library induced  suppression of the kar 3 ts phenotype and the identification  of mutants whose spindles do not collapse are used to  identify novel members of this group.  Mutational analysis  and genetic combinations are used to determine if these  newly identified motors act antagonistically to the known  outwardly-directed motors.  New mutants of inwardly-directed  motors will be combined with a kar3 disruption allele to  determine the \"synthetic\" phenotype of loss-of-function of  all members of this group of mitotic motors.  The goal of  these mutational analysis experiments will be to determine  the functional role of these inwardly-directed motors.  The  suggested role of these proteins as kinetochore motors an/or  inhibitors of spindle elongation is investigated by  examination of the effect of loss-of-function on chromosome  segregation and the timing and rate of spindle elongation.  For this analysis both traditional fixed cell  immunocytochemistry and newly-developing real-time analysis  of live cells with chromatin and green fluorescent protein-  labeled tubulin staining is used.  %%%  All organisms are composed of microscopic components called  cells, analogous to the bricks in a brick building.  When  the organism grows, or following injury, the mass of  organism in most cases is increased not by expansion of the  size of existing cells, but by creation of new cells.  New  cells are created by division of existing cells.  The newly  dividing cells can grow in size until a second round of  division can occur creating four cells where  one existed  originally.  In many unicellular organisms this process will  continue indefinitely until limited by availability of  nutrients and space.  In larger multicellular organisms this  process is carefully controlled to prevent the excess  proliferation associated with cancer and other growth  abnormalities.  When cells divide, it is necessary that each  daughter cell contain all the components required for  survival.  Many of the cell components are apparently  randomly partitioned, but some of the components are unique  and both of the daughter cells requires a certain number of  each type.  The most well-known example of these unique  components are the chromosomes.  Each chromosome contains  the information to produce proteins, the building blocks of  the cell.  The amount of each protein made is generally  proportional to the number of chromosomes present.  Therefore it is critical to that organism that the cells get  the right number of each type of chromosome.  To achieve  this, eukaryotic (non-bacterial) cells utilize a complex and  transitory structure called the spindle.  The spindle is  made of fibers that assemble during cell division.   The  chromosomes attach to the spindle fibers and are moved to  the daughter cells at division in an exquisitely timed and  orchestrated process.  Recently, this laboratory and others  have identified small molecular motors that act within the  cell to separate the chromosomes to the daughter cells.  The  motors are related to other motors discovered previously to  move other cellular components.  Three different types of  motors were identified that can separate the chromosomes,  and each can perform the task fairly well by itself.  Surprisingly, a second type of motor was identified that  acts in an opposite manner to pull chromosomes together.  The role of this motor is unknown but it may act to delay  the activity of the chromosome separating motors until the  appropriate time for cell division. This project identifies  and examines thes e motors which pull the chromosomes  together.  When all of the motors are identified, then their  precise role in cell division is determined.  This is done  by inactivating the motors and asking what the cell is  unable to do.  Specifically, spindle assembly and stability  and chromosome separation are carefully scrutinized.  If the  cell is unable to perform these function or performs in an  abnormal manner, it will suggest when and where the motors  work.  Understanding the timing and activity of these motors  allows a basic understanding of how the cell divides.  ***",
