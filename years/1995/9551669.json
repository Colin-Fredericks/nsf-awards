 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project relates to the development of an undergraduate  electric vehicle (EV) laboratory program.   One of the key  features of this particular program is the organization of  students and industry and faculty advisors in an industrial type  matrix organizational structure, called the Technology Team.    This structure simulates the realities of a functioning company  environment within the university.   Engineering students and  their advisors hold positions on the Technology Team.   The Team  decides on projects to pursue, specific to the development of  electric vehicle technology, and then budgets, plans, schedules,  designs, and manufactures the finished EV product, analogous to  real-world corporate operations.  The project manager positions  are filled by seniors who apply their work towards senior project  credits and cooperate with their associated undergraduate team  members within the organization to complete their projects.    Junior and sophomore students learn as they work with the  seniors, industry advisors, and faculty members, so that by the  time they reach their senior year they will be ready to take a  leading role and earn their own senior project credits.   This EV  program consists of an ongoing and evolving set of student  projects.   As the program develops, new students utilize  knowledge gained from previous projects as they move up within  the structure, to continually build a mature and evolving  knowledge base in EV technology.",
