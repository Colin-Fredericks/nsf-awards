 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this program is to develop new curricula, materials  and methods which will enhance the appreciation and learning of  science, especially chemistry, for every undergraduate student such  that all college graduates will command the knowledge and skills  necessary to permit continued learning, lead productive lives, and  make informed decisions.  To accomplish this mission, a modular  approach to teaching chemistry in the first two years of the  undergraduate curriculum is being developed and evaluated.  Modules  of one to four weeks present fundamental chemistry to students in  the context of a real-world problem or application and emphasize  the links between chemistry and other disciplines.  In  collaboration with the ChemLinks Coalition, modules are being  developed, tested and refined at the two- and four-year colleges  and research universities comprising the two consortia.  Curriculum  materials, including text, lab, and multimedia components suitable  for students from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds and  usable at a wide variety of undergraduate institutions are being  produced and distributed by an established publisher.  Teaching  methods which utilize current understanding of learning processes  and emphasize active learning and the full spectrum of modern  technologies are being supported, tested and promulgated.  A model  support infrastructure for development and assessment of new  materials and methods is being provided.  A framework for  continuous improvement of curricula should result from the work and  be institutionalized within the consortium.  Faculty workshops and  sessions at national and regional meetings will be conducted to  guarantee dissemination.  Our consortium institutions now  participate significantly in pre-service teacher training and  education of technology specialists and are developing new programs  in these areas.  Thus, our program will strongly impact the  Advanced Technological Education and Teacher Preparation Programs  by develo ping modular materials appropriate to the task of  educating future teachers and technology specialists.",
