 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416652  Feher  Various electron transfer steps in native and mutant reaction  centers will be investigated.  Two electron transfer steps will     be addressed in detail: 1) the electron transfer rate from the  primary quinone, QA to the secondary quinone, QB and ii) the charge  recombination of QA and QB with the primary donor D+. The second  problem deals with the protonation of the doubly reduced quinone.  Q2- is buried inside the reaction center and is not accessible to  protons from the outside.  It is now generally believed that  protons reach Q2- by a charge-relay mechanism involving protonatable  residues.  The problem is to identify the residues that constitute  the proton transfer chain.  This problem will be addressed by site-  directed mutagenesis.  Three residues  Glu (L212), Arg (L213) and  Ser (L223)  have already been identified as being members of the  proton transfer chain.  In addition, the mechanism of proton  transfer will be addressed by studying the coupling between  electron and proton transfer and the role of electrostatics in the  transfer.  Theoretical calculations will be performed to  complement, guide and explain the experimental results.  %%%  The goal of the research is to contribute toward an understanding  of the primary processes in photosynthesis, i.e., the mechanism of  conversion of electromagnetic energy into chemical free energy.   The research will focus on the photosynthetic processes in purple  bacteria (e.g. Rhodobacter sphaeroides).  The findings will be of  general interest and applicability to other biological systems and  mechanisms, foremost to green plant photosynthesis and to other  bioenergetic processes.  The primary process of photosynthesis  takes place in an integral membrane protein-pigment complex called  the reaction center.  Light produces a charge separation and  initiates a set of electron transfer reactions resulting in the  reduction of a terminal acceptor, which picks up two protons, and  initiates the formation of the proton gradi ent that provides the  driving force for the formation of high energy compounds.  Thus,  the main questions associated with the primary processes are  associated with electron and proton transfers.    ***",
