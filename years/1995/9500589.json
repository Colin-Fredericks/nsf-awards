 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500589  Campbell    A differential algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit ordinary  differential equation.  DAEs arise, for example, in a variety of  control problems in flight control, robotics, chemical process  control, and contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In  addition, differential algebraic equations occur in the solution  of partial differential equations by the method of lines and in  many circuit models.  DAEs are sometimes also called singular or  descriptor systems.      The last decade has seen considerable progress both in the  analytical understanding of DAEs and in the development of  numerical methods for DAEs.  Most of this work has been in  numerical analysis and has frequently involved complex nonlinear  systems.  Independently there has been considerable advancement  in the development of theoretical results and methods for the  control of nonlinear systems.  With the exception of classical  work based on time invariant linearizations most of this work in  nonlinear control has dealt with comparatively smaller nonlinear  systems.  Many of this control development has been independent  of the work on DAEs.  As noted, many computer generated models  are most naturally modeled in the form of DAEs.  The move to the  consideration of increasingly complex systems not only leads to  DAE models but systems for which the more traditional nonlinear  control methodologies are sometimes difficult to implement.           This project will study implicity modeled control systems.   The goal will not only be to extend existing techniques to the  implicit setting but also to use the DAE technology from other  areas such as numerical analysis to develop new and more  efficient algorithms for computing control theoretic information  from complex systems.    ***",
