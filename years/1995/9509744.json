 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509744  Goodwillie       This project uses several kinds of 'functorial calculus' to  investigate the homotopy types of spaces of diffeomorphisms and  spaces of smooth embeddings.  These techniques exploit  multirelative connectivity estimates to describe continuous  functors of various types in terms of special values; for example,  a functor of topological spaces might be recovered from its values  at highly connected spaces, or a functor of subspaces of a  manifold, from its values at zero-dimensional subspaces, or a  functor of real inner product spaces, from its values at  high-dimensional spaces.  The project is to refine and combine  these techniques and to apply them to various questions in  differential topology.       Each 'functorial calculus' mentioned above is so called  because of a not-entirely-fanciful resemblance to the ordinary  'functional calculus' of Newton and Leibniz.  Sometimes a fact  about numbers is best proved by placing it in a context where a  number is part of a huge family of numbers -- a numerical function.  Properties of the function then lead, by general theorems of  calculus that may seem a bit magical on first encountering them, to  a computation of the number.  So it is here: sometimes a fact about  some geometrically defined object is best proved by placing it in   a context where the object is part of a huge family of such objects  -- a functor -- and using some magic of a more modern kind.  This  analogy may convey something of the flavor of the research; the  content is harder to convey, because most of the 'geometric'  objects in question are connected to everyday reality only by  rather long chains of abstract ideas.  (Despite the intervention of  similar long chains of abstract ideas, however, one finds that the  'objects' physicists study predict real physical phenomena with  uncanny precision.)  ***",
