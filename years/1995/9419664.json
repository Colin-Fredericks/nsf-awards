Able, Principal Investigator    Non-technical Summary    The orientation and navigation performed by birds that migrate  long distances are among the most complex behaviors performed by  animals.  Their reliance on several interacting compass systems  provides the migrants with flexible orientation behavior that  enables them to cope with the variety of environmental conditions  and navigation problems that may be encountered enroute.  The  compasses used by migratory birds (magnetic, star, sun and  polarized compasses) interact during the development of  orientation abilities in young birds and also in mature,  experienced migrants.  These interactions take the form of  calibration of one system by another.  This project will use two  approaches to determine the nature of these interactions.  First,  birds will be hand-raised under conditions in which their  experience with relevant orientation cues can be controlled and  manipulated.  In this way, the interactions and calibrations that  occur during the development of compass orientation abilities in  the young animal can be explored.  Experiments with adult birds  will reveal the extent and nature of plasticity that persists  throughout the life of a migratory bird.  Migratory orientation  provides some of the most elegant examples of the interplay of  genetically-based learning predispositions with experience in the  development and control of behavior.",
