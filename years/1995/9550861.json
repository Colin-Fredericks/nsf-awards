Courses are attended by  students from both the University of Oregon and from institutions  throughout the nation. We offer students intense field oriented  courses that cover a variety of marine science disciplines.    The problem addressed in this proposal relates primarily to two of  our process oriented courses, biological oceanography and estuarine  biology. These courses should include an investigation of the open  waters of the nearshore ocean and estuary. We have neither had  boats for access to these habitats nor the appropriate equipment to  allow students to sample these areas and gain a full understanding  of the processes involved in open water habitats. The recent  acquisition of suitable boats at OIMB now enables us to take  students on to the water. This has allowed us to plan laboratory  exercises in these courses giving undergraduates the opportunity to  conduct investigations, using modern oceanographic equipment, of  these open waters.    With this proposal we seek funding for equipment to facilitate the  development of these laboratory exercises. The funds will provide  field and laboratory equipment for students to answer questions  about oceanographic and estuarine processes. We propose to expand  the biological oceanography and estuarine biology courses to  include activities that investigate the physical and biological  parameters of open water using modern instrumentation and  techniques. Students will obtain hands-on experience in the  co llection of data in the field, and will have the opportunity to  process these data in both field and lab settings. This will  provide them with a more complete picture of the biology of coastal  and estuarine habitats.",
