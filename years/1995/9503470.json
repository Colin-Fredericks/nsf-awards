 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the discovery in 1953 of the double helix by Watson  and Crick, a great deal of effort has gone into the  determination of RNA, DNA, and protein sequences.  Today,  over 150 million letters of DNA sequence have been  determined in segments averaging 1000  in length from a  large variety of organisms.  This impetus is typified by the  human genome project which has received a great deal of  press and discussion.    This information explosion is stimulating a natural  symbiosis between molecular biology and computer science.  New computational methods are required to obtain, organize,  compare and interpret the vast amounts of macromolecular  sequence information now being collected.  Efforts in this  direction are being made in many parts of the world; there  is a continuing need for a comprehensive international  conference to bring together leading researchers who use a  variety of disparate approaches and techniques.  The  Dagstuhl seminar on molecular bioinformatics is designed to  address this continuing need.  The first Dagstuhl Seminar on  molecular bioinformatics was held.  The second seminar will  be held July 10-14, 1995.",
