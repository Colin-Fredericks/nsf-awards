 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective resource management algorithms are critical to the  performance of a computer system.  This project will address open  questions related to effective resource management in parallel  computer systems, using a combination of experimental techniques,  simulation, and analytical performance models.  In particular the  project will investigate questions concerning high performance  parallel processor allocation policies, the interplay between  parallel processor allocation and memory management, the interplay  between parallel programming models and appropriate workloads for  evaluating parallel resource management algorithms, and the impact  of workload characteristics on the performance of particular  parallel system resource management algorithms.    The interactive component of this project involves:  (1) teaching  two courses, one a graduate seminar and one a core graduate or  undergraduate course, (2) hosting a Northwest Workshop on Academic  Careers for Women, modeled after the recent Computing Research  Association (CRA) workshops of the same title, (3) participation in  the mentoring and outreach efforts of the Women in Engineering  program at the University Washington, and (4) joint research with  Computer Science and Engineering faculty and students at the  University of Washington.",
