 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tools of doing geography are changing dramatically, but the  need for good, rigorous geographical thinking is a constant.    Varying levels of preparation among students and the gaps  revealed by the geographic diagnostic exam are the motivation for  changing the techniques courses.   Geographic Techniques, the new  foundations course, is the focus of this new approach.   The  objective is to introduce basic concepts and skills as students  move through the program.   This goal is not to see how many  techniques can be taught to students but to build a functional  base.   The new computer-based laboratory is a major instrument  in achieving the goals of the new introductory course as well as  an important instrument in the following techniques courses.   Sophomores and juniors intending to major in geography are  directed to Geographic Techniques after having completed a  minimum of three introductory geography courses.   This course is  the prerequisite for all of the traditional techniques courses in  the department.   As students complete this course they should be  comfortable working in the computer lab; able to use e-mail and  move about the Internet; have the beginnings of the vocabulary of  geographic techniques; have an integrated exposure to content of  the various techniques used in  geography; be aware of the nature  of geographic data and how to get such data for local questions  or global questions; and have some experience in using a word  processor, spreadsheet, and the Idrisi GIS package.   The impact  of building this foundation can be realized in all subsequent  techniques courses as well as in the preparation of the students  as they move into their internship and ultimately into the work  place or on to graduate school.",
