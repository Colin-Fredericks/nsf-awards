 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the effectiveness of laboratory exercises  in quantitative biology so that undergraduates can develop  essential analytical skills and an adaptive understanding of  dynamic statistical and biological principles.   The premise is  that the requisite laboratory instrumentation for teaching  adaptive knowledge of quantitative biology is high-speed  computers running responsive Monte Carlo simulations tailored to  exercise objectives.   The differecne with this project is that  it provides a set of focused and appealing lab exercises based on  realistic computer simulations running at spectacular speeds and  set in a playful learning environment.   The intent is not to  push, but rather to lure, students toward an adaptive working  knowledge of important principles in statistics and quantitative  biology.  Most of the simulations are Monte Carlo simulations of  random processes in biology.   Students are required to execute  and interpret appropriate hypothesis tests and to file reports  (on the server) describing the behavior of the simulated models  in a digital portfolio complete with tables and charts.    Appropriate software can be acquired externally (when available)  or developed by the PI.   The instrumentation includes computers  based on the new PowerPC processor family: 20 networked student  workstations on carts, 3 courseware development stations  dedicated to the foup PIs, 1 file/print server, 1 printer and 1  scanner, and software required to provide the necessary  functionality and maintain the network.    SWT's Aquatic Biology  program is the focus of the project, and the targeted courses  include two ecology courses (either required for all Biology and  Aquatic majors), Aquatic Biology, Biometry (all required for  Aquatic majors), and a practical statistics course in the Math  Department.",
