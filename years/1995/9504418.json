According to the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg  conjecture, a spin manifold admits a metric of positive scalar  curvature if and only if an `index' obstruction vanishes.  This  conjecture has been proved (by the principal investigator and his  coauthors) for spin manifolds whose fundamental groups have  periodic cohomology.  Moreover, a \"stable version\" of this  conjecture has been proved for manifolds with finite fundamental  groups (in the \"stable version\" one allows the manifold to be  replaced by its product with sufficiently many copies of the  \"Bott-manifold,\" an eight-dimensional spin manifold that represents  the periodicity element in real K-theory).  The principal  investigator works on proving the \"stable\" conjecture for all spin  manifolds whose fundamental groups satisfy the Baum-Connes  conjecture.  Moreover, he suspects that the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg  conjecture does not hold in general, and tries to find new  \"unstable\" obstructions to the existence of positive scalar  curvature metrics.  Concerning positive Ricci curvature, the  investigator is pursuing a proof of his conjecture that the  existence of a positive Ricci curvature metric on a spin manifold  with vanishing first Pontryagin class implies the vanishing of its  Witten genus.  This involves a \"Weitzenboeck formula \" for the  Dirac operator on the free loop space of this manifold.       These projects fit in the general framework of trying to  relate the topology of a manifold (qualitative information about  its global shape) and its geometry (quantitative information about  its local shape).  For 2-dimensional manifolds (like the surface of  a ball or a tire), a nice classification has been known for a long  time: Two such surfaces have the same topology (i.e., they can be  deformed into each other if we think of them as being made of thin  rubber) if and only  if they have the same number of \"holes\" (the  surface of a ball has no holes, the surface of a tire or a cup has  one hole, and a pretzel has two holes).  Moreover, if a surface has  \"positive curvature\" in the sense that the angle sum in each  triangle whose edges are geodesics (shortest curves) is larger than  180 degrees, then this surface has the same topology as the surface  of a ball.  It is a major goal of modern day mathematics to  generalize these results to higher dimensional manifolds (e.g., our  universe is a manifold of dimension 3, Einstein's space-time has  dimension 4, and manifolds of dimension 10, resp. 26, play a  crucial role in the theoretical physics of the attempted  unification of the four fundamental forces).  ***",
