As a CAREER awardee the investigator is  expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to his scientific  research project.      Gamma Ray Bursts are enigmatic flashes of gamma radiation which last  typically from a second to a minute in duration.  When they are bursting,  their brightness varies chaotically, and they are by far the brightest source in  the gamma ray sky.  They are seen roughly once a day, from random  directions, and at unpredictable times.  Virtually no positive facts are known  concerning the cause of gamma ray bursts, and this is traceable to the  unfortunate circumstances that the distance scale to the bursters cannot be  constrained to within 13 orders of magnitude.  The population of bursts  might be distributed among distant galaxies, in an extended halo around our  Milky Way, or in our Sun's Oort Cloud.  Until this distance scale question can  be solved, gamma ray bursts must remain one of the biggest mysteries in  modern astrophysics.  Dr. Schaefer will attack the distance scale problem  from several perspectives with the goal of finding a solution.  In his  education activities, Dr. Schaefer plans to integrate undergraduate and  graduate students into the research projects through opportunities for  undergraduate summer work, senior projects, graduate student summer  work, and graduate thesis work.  He will also continue public education  activities with amateur astronomers to strengthen professional/amateur  relationships.",
