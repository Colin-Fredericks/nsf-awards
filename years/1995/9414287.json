 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414287  Lee       Liquid composite molding processes such as resin transfer  molding (RTM) and structural reaction injection molding (SRIM) are  one of the fastest growing new manufacturing technologies in  aerospace and automotive industries.  They have been recognized by  many researchers and engineers as the most feasible approach to  mass produce light weight, high strength and low cost structural  components.  The major manufacturing technique in today's aerospace  industry for light weight components is prepreg/autoclave process.   This process is expensive, slow and labor intensive.  It can not  compete well in the cost driven business such as the civil aero-  transportation industry.  This is why many companies, particularly  in Europe, are developing RTM processes.  The major manufacturing  techniques in today's automotive industry for light weight  components are thermoplastic injection molding and SMC compression  molding.  These processes can only handle low volume short fiber  reinforcement, therefore, they can not produce high strength  products which are needed for structural applications.  SRIM and  RTM, on the other hand, are based on high volume fractions of  continuous fiber reinforcement.  They can potentially produce parts  stronger than steel made parts.       The new experimental techniques for flow analysis include  measurements of capillary forces and fiber wetting for fabric  reinforcements with different fiber architecture and the three-  dimensional microscopic flow visualization and image analysis.  The  experimental techniques for curing analysis include rheological and  kinetic analyses and reactive dilatometry of matrix resins.   Computer modelling will be carried out at two levels; a model  simple enough to be combined with existing computer codes for quick  and easy introduction to the manufacturing sector and a  sophisticated model addressing the full range of mold filling to  final product property prediction will be developing using  supercomputing capabilit ies.",
