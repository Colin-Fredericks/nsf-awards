 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. William J. Evans, Chemistry Department, University of   Califonia-Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to define and   develop new types of chemistry and chemical transformations which exploit   the special properties of organosamarium(II) and related complexes. The   project's general purpose will be to expand the limits of lanthanide   chemistry and to develop new reaction and reagents. By utilizing the   tetrahedral reaction cavity which exists in decamethylsamarocene, size   selective hydrocarbon reactions such as C-H metalations, C-C coupling and   other novel reactions will be developed. Using the reducing power of   Sm(II), main group-carbon bonds with energies as high as 215 kJ/mol  can   be cleaved. This property will be utilized to produce unusual compounds   containing main group clusters. These studies will then be extended to a   variety of additional Sm(II) species in order to systematize the   chemistry of this oxidation state.  Metal compounds are used to effect many chemical transformations. While   the importance of many metals has been well established, there is a   group, called the lanthanides, whose chemistry is not well developed,   even though tantalizing hints of important behaviors have emerged over   the past few years. In this project the ability of a series of samarium   compounds to activate hydrocarbons and to break bonds between carbon and   other elements will be assessed. This will contribute both to the overall   understanding of the lanthanide metals and to the discovery of new uses   for samarium, which is an inexpensive metal readily available in the   United States.",
