Durham  Institution:  University of  South Carolina - Columbia  Title:  STOCHASTIC MODELS FOR RELIABILITY OF SYSTEMS             WITH DEPENDENCIES AMONG COMPONENTS     Abstract:          The research involves the reliability of complex systems.  There are three main thrusts:  (1) modeling component reliability, (2)  incorporating component reliability and dependencies into the system  reliability which result in tractable data analytic models, and (3)  developing a criticality theory for such models.  Regarding (1), some  models are studied for the analysis of component reliability, including the  conditional Weibull and inverse Gaussian distributions and a  Poisson-Weibull flaw model.  The \"conditional Weibull\" distribution is  studied since it fits certain fiber strength data sets well and may be  justified due to \"censoring\" considerations in the fiber manufacturing and  testing processes.  The Poisson-Weibull flaw model with finite-state Markov  random intensity has the mixed distribution (zero intensity) and the mixed  hazard model (infinite intensity) as extremes.  A major objective of this  part of the project is the investigation of a unified mixture theory for  this flaw model which subsumes the theory of mixtures developed for the  extremes of mixed distributions and mixed hazards, respectively.  To  address (2) and (3), a general model is investigated which is hierarchical  in nature.  The hierarchy consists of (i) the micro (or component) level,  (ii) the subsystem (or \"bundle of components\") level, and (iii) the system  (or \"chain of bundles\") level.  It has long been known that in many  systems, the failure of a component changes the stress applied to the  remaining components.  Thus, incorporating component dependencies into a  reliability model in a realistic manner is highly desirable for accurate  results.  Here, component dependencies/interactions are incorporated into  the model by using \"load-sharing rules,\" m ost applicable to situations  where \"loadings\" are due to mechanical or physical considerations.  General  monotone load-sharing rules are considered for which a method of  calculating the system reliability has been developed.  The present  research includes a special class of these rules where the component load  can be calculated using absorption probabilities for random walks on a  network.  In particular, a number of the popular load-sharing rules can be  reduced to the consideration of electrical networks.  Energy considerations  give insight into the behavior of stress concentrations induced by these  rules as components fail.  Major objectives are to continue the  investigation of these electrical network rules, and other network rules  which are  appropriate for mechanical load transfer situations, especially  for composite materials, and, specifically to study the \"effective  distance\"  that a load can be transferred via matrix material and its  relationship to the \"ineffective length\" around fiber breaks for load  transfer through the matrix.  Criticality issues are also considered.  Preliminary work for k-out-of-n systems and systems with a small number of  components suggest that an exact theory may be obtainable when each  component has a Weibull failure distribution using a mixed transformed  gamma model, where the transformation depends on the Weibull distribution.  Such a model also lends itself to calculation of extreme value  approximation errors and to system identification using the mixing  distribution.    The research involves the development  of models for describing  the failure of complex systems with dependent components.    The researchers are investigating reliability models for complex systems of  components including complex materials which allow for component  dependencies and interactions. Such models have direct application to   many problems of current importance,  including failure of fibrous composite materials and electrical networks.  This has important imp lications for the design and large scale manufacture  of  complex materials where high reliability.",
