 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418466     Reed  People who live and work in Antarctica for longer than four to  five months develop a characteristic constellation of symptoms  and hormonal changes called the Polar T3 Syndrome.  These people  have previously been described as having a 40 percent increase in  energy requirement, frequent mood disorders, doubling of the  production, utilization, and tissue stores of the most active  thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), a decline in central  nervous system thyroxine (T4), and acquisition of physiologic  cold adaptation.  These apparent discordant and compartmentalized  tissue responses will be studied over a four-year period  utilizing a multidisciplinary approach carried out by experienced  polar physiologists, endocrinologists and psychologists.  The  possible cognitive and metabolic changes in performance from  declines in central nervous system T4 and elevations in skeletal  muscle T3 content will be studed.  Placebo-controlled T4  replacement directed at the central nervous system deficit will  be carried out and measured with cognitive instruments.  T3  content within the cardiovascular system will be evaluated by  utilizing submaximal exercise testing to differentiate resting  from activity mediated energy use contributions by the skeletal  muscles.  Additionally, tissue samples of skeletal muscle will  provide information regarding the genetic coding for T3  responsive proteins to help better characterize the thyroid  status of these muscles.  Moderate energy restriction will be  used along with T4 supplementation to study the dependence of T3  production, distribution and tissue stores upon both pituitary  generation of thyrotropin and energy intake.  Analysis will be  carried out using each subject's baseline determined in the  predeployment situation of California and compared with periods  and standardized measures obtained during the antarctic summer  and winter.  It is proposed that a correction of the low T4 state  in the central nervous system can be managed w ith T4  supplementation without dramatically changing energy requirements  as suggested by previous human studies using cold air chamber  experiments.  If this thesis is correct, then characteristic  declines in mood and memory during winter seasons in circumpolar  regions may be attenuated by T4 supplementation without  disadvantageous effects upon their energy metabolism.   Additionally, this project will expand information regarding the  ultimate regulation and maintenance of the increased T3  production which is a central determinant of the Polar T3  Syndrome.",
