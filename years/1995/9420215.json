 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420215  Doyle       The ability to use atmospheric nitrogen, rather than more  complex organic compounds, as a source of nitrogen is a hallmark of  the legume family (Leguminosae, the \"beans\") and a major cause of  its great economic and ecological importance.  Nitrogen fixation is  accomplished biochemically in partnership with soil bacteria  (\"rhizobia\") which are housed in complex organs termed nodules,  usually found on the roots of legumes.  Among the novel features of  nodules are a suite of proteins (\"nodulins\") produced by the plant  predominantly or exclusively in that organ.  The origins of many of  the genes encoding many of these proteins are unknown; suggestions  have included horizontal transfer, gene duplication, or simply  recruitment of existing genes for novel purposes.  Phylogenetic and  taxonomic considerations suggest that nodulation originated more  than once within the legume family of plants, yet the biochemical  and structural complexity of the nodule might argue for a single  origin followed by many independent losses of the ability to  nodulate.       Dr. Jeff Doyle of Cornell University is studying the origins  of genes encoding nodulin proteins in order to test ideas about the  number of evolutionary shifts in nitrogen fixation.  Research  focuses on glutamine synthetase, a protein with an important role  in nitrogen transport, encoded by a gene family that has been  studied in several crop legumes (soybean, alfalfa, garden bean) but  has yet to be studied in legumes more phylogenetically distant from  these.  The major taxonomic focus is on legumes of the nodulating  genus Chamaecrista and its non-nodulating close relative, Senna.   Insights into the origins of nodulation in hitherto unstudied  legumes should shed light on common mechanisms of gene evolution in  this important plant physiological process.  ??",
