 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521664  Singer  The PI proposes to demonstrate and study anomalous dispersion  optimized Cerenkov phase-matched second harmonic generation and to  investigate its effect on cascaded third-order nonlinearities.   Theories of Cerenkov phase-matched second harmonic generation in  waveguides indicate that intrinsic phase-matching when coupled with  Cerenkov phase-matching leads to large enhancements in second  harmonic generation efficiency, and more recently, have suggested  that large phase-shifts in cascaded nonlinearities can occur.   Simulations indicate large enhancements in efficiency even with  incomplete intrinsic phase-matching.  The use of Cerenkov phase-  matching in combination with an appropriate intrinsic phase-  matching scheme eliminates critical fabrication or material  properties.  Anomalous dispersion has been shown to be an effective  intrinsic phase-matching technique in organic solutions, and  recently in polymeric waveguides.  The use of anomalous dispersion  along with the Cerenkov process also overcomes the effect of  absorption in anomalous dispersion phase-matching by guiding the  second harmonic light in the cladding.  We will demonstrate this  type of phase matching and study its dependence on fabrication and  material parameters in electric-field-poled polymeric waveguides.   The structures rely on a poled nonlinear optical layer composed of  a polymer doped with a recently developed anomalous dispersion  nonlinear optical dye.  Both slab and channel waveguide structures  will be investigated.  The nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental  light will also be studied.    Anomalous dispersion may represent an important enhancement  mechanism for nonlinear optical interactions which depend on phase-  matching properties.  This would lead to more efficient photonic  devices for application in optical data storage and processing.  ***",
