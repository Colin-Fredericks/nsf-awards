 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520846    Many bird species that feed their young in the nest lay eggs  that hatch asynchronously, with the first laid eggs hatching  from  two days to two weeks before the last laid eggs.  This  study  tests  two  long-standing  hypotheses  that  seek  to  explain this phenomenon.  The first suggests that asynchrony  increases  males'  contribution  to  reproduction  and  thus  reproductive success of a pair, by prolonging the time  that  males  feed  females  and young.  The second  suggests  that  asynchrony  reduces peak energy demands,  by  spreading  the  cost  of  raising  offspring over a longer  time.   Although  these  hypotheses differ in their details, both assume  that  hatching  asynchrony evolved in response to food  limitation  during  the breeding season and that it functions to  reduce  parental  effort.   Falsifying these hypotheses  would  mean  that   breeding  is  not  invariably  constrained  by   food  availability,  which  would alter our understanding  of  the  factors   that  limit  avian  reproductive  success.    This  research  will  test  these  hypotheses  by  measuring   the  metabolic  rate of free-living green-rumped parrotlets  that  are  rearing  either  synchronous  and  asynchronous  broods  containing  either  4 or 8 chicks.  Green-rumped  parrotlets  exhibit the most extreme degree of hatching asynchrony found  in  birds,  yet  are  capable  of  rearing  synchronous  and  asynchronous  broods with equal success, making  them  ideal  subjects for this project.   Field metabolic rate of parents  feeding  young  will be determined using the doubly  labeled  water  technique, a method that employs isotopically labeled  water   to  determine  directly  metabolism  of  free-living  animals.  The results will increase our understanding of the  way  that costs of reproduction affect breeding systems, and  the extent to which energy demands have played a role in the  evolution of avian life histories.  It will also expand  our  knowledge  of  tropical parrots, on e of the most  threatened  groups  of  birds, and provide baseline data  that  may  aid  future conservation efforts.",
