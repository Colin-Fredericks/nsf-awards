 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522955  Rogers    A critical facet of the U.S. Global Change Research Program  is its explicit effort to improve communications among scientists  conducting global change research and the decision makers in both  the public and private sectors who value and use such the results  of scientific research.  One of the most important settings for  this type of exchange have been the annual global change  conferences sponsored by the Environmental Research Institute of  Michigan (ERIM).  This award provides partial support to cover  publication costs of this year's conference proceedings,  the title of which is \"Understanding Earth:  Retrospectives and  Visions.\"  As has been true of past ERIM conferences, this year's  gathering will bring together scientists and decision makers to  examine new knowledge and critical issues related to global  change.  Previous conferences have been well attended, and the  proceedings have become valuable statements of the \"current  state of understanding.\"  The conference will be held in  Washington, D.C. in early April.         Because of the valuable role that the ERIM conference plays  in fostering dialogue among scientists and decision makers in  both the private and public sectors, NSF has provided support in  the past.  Publication of the proceedings will provide a tangible  record of conference publications and discussions, thereby  enhancing the value of the conference for those in attendance and  for others.",
