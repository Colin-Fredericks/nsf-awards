 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511731  Kazerooni  The overall objective of this research project is to design  and construct electromagnetic actuators which behave as  Hill's model of human muscle predicts.  The researchers  hypothesize that, to restore function properly to motor-  impaired humans, the electromagnetic actuators of powered  orthotic and prosthetic devices should exhibit behavior  similar to that of human muscles.  With the use of emulation  computer software, the investigators will emulate Hill's  model in several experimental orthotic devices available to  them to determine how the use of such actuators will improve  the restoration function in motor-impaired humans.  Following the use of the emulation software, design  principles will be derived for an electromagnetic actuator  that inherently behaves as Hill's model predicts.    The technology to be developed from successful results of  the research can be used by a person with mild movement  disorders, such as a mid-level quadriplegic.  It is expected  that atrophy and deformity will be minimized and limb  function will improve with the development of  an  intelligent orthosis that allows the patient's arm to  maneuver in all possible directions.  This intelligent  orthosis should become a natural complement of the patient's  arm.  ***",
