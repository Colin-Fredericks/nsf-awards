Control of stomatal movements  by guard cells in response to environmental stimuli and  stress conditions is a primary factor in determining water  use efficiency and productivity of crop plants.  Guard cells  provide an ideal system to elucidate early events in higher  plant signal transduction.  Several key guard cell ion  channels have been identified which have been proposed to  function as important signal transducers and mediators of  stomatal closing.  Recent data suggest that both Ca2+-  dependent and Ca2+-independent transduction cascades may  control stomatal closing.  However, the intracellular  signaling cascades which link signal reception to ion  channel modulation during stomatal closing remain largely  unknown.  Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms have  remained unknown, by which guard cell vacuoles release ions,  which is essential for stomata closing.  The long term goal  of this research is to characterize the chain of events of  the signaling cascade which integrates physiological  stimuli, such as abscisic acid, intracellular coupling  proteins, second messengers, and ion channels to produce  stomatal closing.  To elucidate signaling mechanism in guard  cells, we propose studies using a combination of cell  biological, patch clamp, biochemical and genetic analyses.  Recent research has led to the model that slow anion  channels  and outward-recitifying K+ channels in the plasma  membrane and newly identified vacuolar K+ (VK) and Ca2+-  activated Ca2+-permeable (SV) channels in the tonoplast of  guard cells are central transducers and mediators of  stimulus-dependent stomatal closing.  The regulation and  roles of the newly identified VK channels and the proposed  Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release by SV channels in guard cell  vacuoles will be investigated in detail to test the  hypothesis that these vacuolar ion chan nels are crucial for  signal transduction and vacuolar ion release during stomatal  closure.  Furthermore, studies of these vacuolar ion  channels together with analyses of rate-limiting slow anion  channels in guard cell plasma membrane will be pursued to  determine intermediate Ca2+-dependent and putative Ca2+-  independent signaling steps which produce the integrated  response of stomatal closing.  Regulation of guard cell  vacuole channels and phosphorylation-dependent plasma  membrane slow anion channels will further be studied by  using isoforms of the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (CDPK).  In addition, cell biological characterization of guard cell  signaling mutants in Arabidopsis will be pursued to  elucidate the function of genetic loci within the cascade of  events which produced stomatal closing.  Stomatal regulation  ion abscisic acid-insensitive Arabidopsis mutants (abi1 and  abi2) and effects of the purified recombinant ABI1 protein  phsophatase on guard cell ion channels will be pursued for  enhanced ABA sensitivity and for phenotypic stomatal  responses in existing Arabidopsis mutants to identify and  characterize additional genetic loci involved in stomatal  and ABA signaling.  The proposed research will contribute  significantly to the understanding of the molecular  mechanisms of the signal transduction cascade which produces  the integrated response of stomatal closing.  These studies  may further provide important information for the design of  strategies for future engineering of improved water use  efficiency in crop plants.  %%%  Plants \"breathe\" through tiny openings or \"mouths\" called  stomata which are often found on the underside of leaves.  However, a fine balance must be achieved between respiration  and loss of water vapor through the stomata. To achieve this  balance, the plant is sensitive to a wide variety of  environmental stimuli which induce stomatal closure, such as  elevated carbon dioxide levels, darkness and the  phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA).  It is  known that stomatal  closing is, in part,  brought about by ion efflux through  ion channels in the outer cell membrane and the membrane  which surrounds the vacuole, the tonoplast of the cells  which comprise the stomate, the guard cells. This project is  concerned with the way the environment stimuli bring about  changes in the amount and rate of ion transport through  these channels.  The channels have been identified.  Potassium is released from the vacuole through the  tonoplast, into the cytoplasm where it is released into the  cell wall via an outward-rectified potassium channel.  A  rise in intracellular calcium and pH stimulates this  release.  The regulation and role of the newly-identified  vacuolar potassium transporter is explored, as is the  coordination of these channels with others at the plasma  membrane to produce an integrated response to intracellular  calcium signals.  The integration of the signaling pathways  is also explored using molecular genetics.  Mutants which  have the phenotype of an altered guard cell response to the  phytohormone, ABA, are analyzed in order to identify more  genes involved in stomatal opening and ABA signaling. The  role of one of these signaling genes, one which encodes a  protein phosphatase, is being explored by purifying the  protein and determining its direct effect on channel  physiology.  This project has biotechnical application  through the design of crop plants which have improved water  use efficiency.  ***",
