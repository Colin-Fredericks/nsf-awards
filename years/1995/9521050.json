Professor Keiiti Aki, Science Director of the Southern California  Earthquake Center, will be the special editor for this series of  papers.  The issue will appear in February, 1996.  The Northridge  earthquake is the most costly natural disaster to strike the United  States even though the size of the earthquake is not particularly  large when compared to recent earthquakes that have struck the U.S.  or other regions in the world.  However, this earthquake occurred  in a highly urbanized area.  It also occurred in an area that is  well instrumented for seismological, geodetic, geophysical and  engineering post-earthquake studies.  This issue of the BSSA will  provide the scientific and engineering communities a timely  framework for the data, analysis and conclusions regarding the  Northridge earthquake.  This project is a component of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
