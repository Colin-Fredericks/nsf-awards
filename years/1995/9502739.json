 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Pamela Shapiro, Chemistry Department, University of Idaho, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career   Advancement Award to develop the chemistry of bent-sandwich   ansa-chromocene and vanadocene complexes in order to uncover novel   reaction chemistry, discover new homogeneous catalysts, and further the   understanding of the dependence of electronic structure and reactivity on   metallocene geometry. Heteroannular bridges will permit a bent ring   configuration to be tailored in the bis-cyclopentadiene vanadium and   chromium complexes and this will allow an open site to be generated in   the equatorial plane of the complexes. The chemistry of these species   will be explored and the properties of the compounds will be tuned by   adjusting the bridging groups which join the two rings. Also part of this   project will be a restructuring of an inorganic chemistry teaching   laboratory to emphasize the use of modern techniques and the introduction   of computer generated teaching aids to several undergraduate lecture   courses.  Catalysts are used to improve the rate or efficiency of a chemical   reaction. Thus, the search for new, more effective catalysts is an   important area of contemporary chemistry. In the research portion of this   project a series of vanadium and chromium compounds, which are surrounded   by non reactive groups in  such a way as to leave a wedged shaped cavity   into which small reactants can easily fit, will be prepared. By tailoring   the size of this wedge, the ability of the compounds to effect   transformations of the molecules with which they interact can be tailored   to maximize the catalytic properties of the metals. The educational   portion will modernize and improve the chemistry curriculum at the   University of Idaho.",
