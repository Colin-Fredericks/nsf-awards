 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528606  Mishra  In recent years, vacuum microelectronic devices (VMDs) have become of great interest in the fields such as high speed, high power devices and flat panel displays, because of they combine the advantages of both vacuum tubes and modern semiconductor devices.  The key to the success of vacuum microelectronics is the fabrication of the solid-state electron emitters (SSEEs).  For applicatimn in flat panel displays, it is required that SSEEs should be stable and generate uniform electron emission with high efficiency and moderate current density.  On the other hand, for applications in medium RF power amplifiers and high power RF sources, SSEEs should be very reliable and generate electron emission with high current density.  Two types of  SSEEs, field emitters 1 and planar emitters 2,3 have been reported in the past with some success.  Field emitters, due to its intrinsic nature, have very high emission efficiency and attracted much attention in the field of flat panel displays.  Much progress has been made in recent years in the development of field emitters arrays (FEAs) 4, owing to the fast advance of modern semiconductor technologies.  In this proposal, we propose a GaN based field emitter and its arrays with an unique fabrication process based on reactive ion etching (RIE) and selective regrowth of GaN point or wedge emitters.  ***",
