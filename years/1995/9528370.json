 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528370  Kokotovic    This is a proposal for continuation of our NSF Grant #ECS-9203491  which expires on August 31, 1995.  Part one of the proposal  summarizes the results under our current grant which have been  presented in a 550-page monograph, and in over 20 refereed  journal papers and more numerous conference papers.  Among our  major accomplishments are new recursive adaptive and robust  design procedures (\"backstepping\") for nonlinear systems with  parametric and functional uncertainties.  For our adaptive  designs we  have derived performance bounds which, in the case of  linear systems, show that they outperform traditional adaptive  schemes.    Although our current results have been extremely well received by  the research community and have also stimulated interest in  applications, our critical examination of their limitations has  motivated the main topics of this proposal: first, to continue to  the development from feasible to implementable designs, and,  second, to develop new design procedures for larger classes of  systems.  We also propose to initiate an in-depth study of  structure-specific robustness properties of nonlinear feedback  loops, especially those diagnosed by our adaptive procedures.    To make our recursive procedures more attractive for  applications, we propose to develop lean backstepping designs  which avoid wasteful cancellations and reduce control effort.   For this purpose we will further develop our inverse-optimal  designs.  To extend the classes of systems, we plan to develop  new forwarding procedures as upper-triangular analogs of  backstepping.  We will extend characterizations of uncertainties  by application-motivated \"shape\" uncertainties and develop  \"shape-robust\" controllers.  Our robustness studies will quantify  performance-robustness trade-offs and develop redesigns to  enhance robustness while minimizing the loss of performance.    Our NSF-supported research provides a theoretical base for, and  is motivated by, our industrial cooperation  with United  Technologies, Ford Motor Company and Rockwell International.  ***",
