 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521341  Davison    The  study  will examine stress-tolerance in two major groups  of  perennial intertidal macroalgae, the red and brown seaweeds.  The  research  will test the hypothesis that active oxygen is involved  in  emersion stress of intertidal seaweeds.  Damage due to active  oxygen   will  be  determined  in  stress-tolerant  and   stress-  susceptible  species exposed to emersion stress by measuring  the  peroxidation  of  membrane  lipids.   Plants  will  be  grown  in  laboratory  culture under conditions that increase their  ability  to  withstand  emersion  stress.  If the research  hypothesis  is  correct, increases in stress tolerance should be associated  with  increased levels of antioxidants and/or protective enzymes.   The  proposed  research  will  also determine if  intertidal  seaweeds  express  specific stress-proteins in response to emersion stress.  The  results of the physiological studies will be used to  design  field  experiments  to measure the occurrence and  importance  of  sublethal  emersion stress in natural communities and to  compare  the  allocation of resources to stress-tolerance in low and  high  shore  species.   This  research  represents  one  of  the  first  attempts to understand the processes that confer stress tolerance  in  intertidal  seaweeds and will provide valuable insights  into  the  ecology and physiology of these plants.  Information on  the  mechanism of stress tolerance will allow ecologists to assess the  costs  of  stress  tolerance  and relate  these  to  reproductive  output, growth and competitive ability.    ***",
