 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520860  Holloway      A new multianvil press frame will be installed in the high-  pressure laboratory at Arizona State University (ASU).  This  is a joint use facility for studies in mineral physics,  geochemistry and experimental petrology, and studies in  materials synthesis and properties.  The major purpose of  this acquisition will be to augment the existing multianvil  facilities to include the force range between 300 and 1000  tons, enabling higher pressure experiments to be performed,  and allowing larger samples to be obtained.  Specifically,  the 1000 ton capability of the frame will be used both to  extend the available pressure range at ASU to approximately  27 GPa at temperatures up to 2800 C, and to increase the  sample size in experiments at lower pressures.  The extended  range of synthesis pressures will be important in  preparation of both known and novel high pressure phases,  such as garnets, perovskites and ultra-high pressure  glasses, and in pressureinduced amorphization studies in  materials synthesis and mineral physics.  The larger sample  size will be utilized for materials characterization and  properties measurements, and for design of multienclosure  capsule environments, which are important in design of  controlled redox state petrology and in materials synthesis  experiments.  For Earth sciences, the new press will allow  ultra-high pressure geological studies to the P-T range of  the transition-zone and lower mantle, with improved control  of the run environment to reproduce chemical conditions  within the Earth.  The principal focus will be on  controlling oxygen fugacity and H2O content in mantle  systems. Fabrication and installation of the press is  projected at 6 months. Scientific projects will proceed for  the remainder of the time, and the press will then be  operated as a permanent piece of equipment in the ASU high-  pressure facility.      ***",
