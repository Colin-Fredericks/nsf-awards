 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finding a good solution to the cache coherence problem is  critical to the effective use of medium and large scale  multiprocessors.  The  high cost of remote memory access in  such systems makes it important that  processes be able to  access data locally, but allowing processes to hold local  copies of shared writable data requires finding a good way  to keep the copies  consistent.  This project will  investigate a new family of cache coherence  protocols called  delta cache protocols that maintain cache coherence with  little or no synchronization.  Delta cache protocols are  directory, as opposed  to snoopy, protocols. The delta cache protocols are based on isotach  time systems,  time systems implemented by a class of networks called  isotach  networks.  Isotach networks are characterized not by  topology - they can be imp  lemented on arbitrary topologies -  but by the guarantees they provide about the  relative order  in which operations appear to be delivered.  Isotach systems  require custom switching elements, but can be built with off-  the-shelf  processors and in a variety of configurations  ranging from tightly -coupled  multiprocessors to clusters of  workstations.  A simulation study of isotach  systems shows  that they outperform comparable conventional systems under  realistic workloads, in many cases by an order of magnitude  or more.  In  extreme cases, they outperform conventional  systems by an arbitrary amount.  The project is a three year study of the cache  coherence problem with  the goals of exploring the design space for cache coherence protocols  opened by isotach networks; and           evaluating the performance of delta  cache protocols.      The exploratory work includes protocol and cache design;  extending the approach to a variety of topologies and to  other levels of the  memory hierarchy; and devising ways to  reduce the network bandwidth  requirements of the protocols  and to improve the efficiency of the protocols  through data  migration.  The  performance study will simulate isotach and  conventional  systems with caches and compare their performance under a  variety  of workloads.  The simulation will build on the  already completed simulation of  isotach systems without  caches.",
