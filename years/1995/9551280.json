 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances undergraduate education at the university  through the development of a laboratory course in techniques in  molecular cell biology and protein biochemistry, and obtains  chromatography and electrophoresis equipment to support this  course.   The course provides students with hands-on experience  in protein chromatography, electrophoresis, and analysis of the  physical and enzymatic properties of a protein by purifying and  analyzing the enzyme tyrosinase in a multiweek integrated  experiment and then writing up the data as a paper in the  standard journal format.   Students gain extensive experience in  the preparation and operation of chromatography columns,  electrophoretic analysis of proteins, spectrophotometry, enzyme  assays, and kinetic analysis and in the analytical methods and  decision-making process that are used in research laboratories.    This experience provides students with a strong background for  entering graduate studies in cell and molecular biology.   In  addition, the new equipment supports labs in existing courses in  molecular biology, microbiology and immunology, and cell biology.    Finally, this chromatography equipment enables students to  develop and perform undergraduate research projects that could  not be considered without this equipment.",
