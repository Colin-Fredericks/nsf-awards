 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502109  Sutherland   This Faculty Early Career Development award will focus on the environmental aspects of industries that build or use machine tools.  The research focus is on environmentally conscious design and manufacture (ECDM) as it pertains to machine tool systems.  Design research issues will define and develop product value models to weigh tradeoffs on materials, features, etc., that affect their reuse or re-manufacturability.  Manufacturing research issues emphasize ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of fluids in machining systems.  The research plan will integrate well with MTU's participation in the NSF/ARPA funded Machine Tool Agile Manufacturing Institute, as well as an EPA sponsored Center for Clean Industrial Treatment Technology.  The educational focus complements this with courses that emphasize the environmental issues in the design and manufacture of discrete parts.  These courses will be available at MTU, but also to industry using distance learning technology.  Sutherland brings an outstanding background as an educator, winning campus or statewide awards for his teaching and mentoring activities, which adds to the strength of this proposal's clear and achievable educational plan.   The high probability of new discovery in this fertile area, coupled with education plan for both students and practicing engineers, will have a high future impact for industry and overall competitiveness.  ***",
