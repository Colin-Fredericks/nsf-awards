 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a three year effort to  investigate the electrodynamic coupling between the solar wind, the  Earth's magnetosphere, and the ionosphere.  Investigations focus  upon the high latitude polar cap and the region around the polar  cleft.  In open models of the magnetosphere, the cleft is the  dayside boundary between open and closed geomagnetic field lines.   There is considerable evidence that, within the cleft region, the  effects of the full range of solar wind - magnetosphere -  ionosphere coupling phenomena can be observed, including: Birkeland  currents, strong electric fields and plasma drifts, rapid motions  of small scale field-aligned current structures, particle  energization within localized regions, intense ionospheric heating,  etc.  The proposed research is directed toward investigations of  the cleft and its dynamic behavior in response to variations in the  solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).  Fundamental  questions center around the identification of ionospheric  signatures of phenomena which occur at the magnetopause or  magnetospheric boundary layer and which relate to solar wind -  magnetosphere interactions.  Processes such as reconnection, the  Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, impulsive plasma penetration, the  magnetopause response to dynamic pressure variations or sudden  changes in IMF orientation all produce dynamic variations which  couple electrically to the conducting ionosphere via field-aligned  currents.  It is propose to undertake a variety of incoherent  scatter radar observations and the coordinated analysis of these  data with combinations of magnetometer array data, a variety of  satellite data, as well as data from other Greenland ground  instruments such as the imaging riometer, all sky camera, etc. to  investigate both large scale and small scale high latitude  electrodynamic phenomena which are thought to be associated with  the coupling of energy and momentum from the solar wind to the  magnetosphere and ionosph ere.",
