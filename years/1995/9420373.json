 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420373  Newman       This multidisciplinary project addresses software, equipment  and materials processes for achieving high-quality, structural  ceramic parts with complex interior and exterior geometries,  produced directly from a computer aided design description.  The  technique involves cutting and stacking laminae to form a  structural component.  By separating the materials processing steps  from the shape fabrication operations, the method promises to  achieve high dimensional accuracy while achieving monolithic  structural integrity.  By laser slicing pre-processed laminae and  robotically stacking them into laminated assemblies, it appears  possible to achieve significantly faster fabrication over direct  depositiol techniques.  Further, by utilizing surface normal  information to cut laminae at computed tangents, surface quality  can be improved.  By cutting-then-stacking, there is the  opportunity for complete material removal from intended voids, as  well as assembly of fugitive support structures.  Hardware issues  focus on the design, construction and testing of five axis laser-  cutting system.  This system will create laminae with the desired  outlines and edge tangents.  It will be integrated with a robot for  feeding stock sheet, feeding filler material, removing waste  material, and handling and assembling cut laminae.  Machine  performance issues include pragmatic cutting speed and achievable  cutting, and assembly accuracies.  Software developments will  incorporate existing knowledge and extend capabilities in two  areas.  Surface normal information contained within standard files  will be used to define laser-cutter trajectories for tapered edge  cuts, thus improving surface finish.  Second, part shrinkage due to  post-process firing will be modelled, and \"green\" parts will be  pre-distorted computationally to anticipate correct final  dimensions.           Rapid prototyping to near net shape parts offers numerous  advantages to the manufacturing sector in terms of redu cing cycle  time, reducing waste thus lowering manufacturing cost.  This  project synergetically combines well established technologies to  come up with solutions to current limitations on surface finish and  part accuracy.  While the project focusses on cast alumina, it has  the potential for much broader commercialization as opposed to the  current niche successes of rapid prototyping process.",
