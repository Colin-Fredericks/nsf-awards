 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505957  Miller         The processes of global sea-level, local tectonics, and  changes in sediment supply control passive continental margin  sedimentation.  Determining the role of each requires continuous  sampling and dating of stratigraphic sections in different tectonic  settings.  Global sea level studies are a fundamental component of  global change programs and sea level studies require drilling  transects of boreholes on passive continental margins.  These  transects will first focus on the Oligocene-Recent \"Icehouse\" with  future drilling to address sea-level changes during the Paleocene-  Eocene \"Greenhouse\" and \"Doubthouse\" when ice-volume changes were  not apparent.  The principal investigators are currently  developing, with NSF funding, a firm chronology of New Jersey  coastal plain Eocene to middle Miocene sequences, but require well-  dated sections on other passive margins to evaluate the role of  eustatic versus local effects.  Previous and ongoing studies show  that continuous cores from western Alabama and eastern Mississippi  provide fresh, unweathered material from the middle Eocene to the  \"middle\" Oligocene.           The principal investigators will conduct integrated magneto-,  bio-, and isotopic (Sr, oxygen, and carbon) studies of three  recently drilled boreholes in Mississippi.  Preliminary results  funded by ARCO show that these boreholes contain expanded upper  Eocene to lower Oligocene sections suitable for magneto-, bio-, and  Sr-isotope studies.  These sections should compare well with the  principal investigator's ongoing studies in New Jersey.  The  Alabama and Mississippi studies will provide an \"Icehouse\" transect  of the Oligocene to compare with sequences in New Jersey and other  proxies of global sea-level change and a detailed transect of the  \"Greenhouse\" early Eocene and \"Doubthouse\" middle-late Eocene.  ***",
