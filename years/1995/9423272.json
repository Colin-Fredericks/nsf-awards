 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trace-driven simulators (TDS) are widely used by processor  architects to accurately assess the expected performance of a  processor design.  While necessary and useful, TDS have some  shortcomings.  Traces of realistic  programs are usually very  large and expensive to store, and simulation of  traces can very  time consuming.  Furthermore, simulation does not yield a  characterization of the factors that determine performance, and  hence can not  recommend specific changes to enhance performance.    The two-fold objectives of  this research are (1) to investigate  alternatives to TDS for accurately  quantifying processor  performance; and (2) to seek to characterize factors that  determine superscalar processor performance.  The effort will  involve  developing an analytical model of machine behavior, based  on which processor  performance can be computed without requiring  tedious trace-driven simulation.  It is hoped that the same  analytical model, in addition to providing a useful  tool, will  also provide a characterization of superscalar processor  performance.  This characterization can potentially reveal  fundamental laws  governing processor performance that can be  mathematically formulated.    In  this research project, processor performance is modeled as a  composition of  program parallelism and machine parallelism.  Program parallelism is represented  by two distribution functions  that are derived from the execution trace of  benchmark and  captures the control and data dependencies in the program.  This  derivation is analogous to performing a type of transform on the  execution  trace from the time domain to the transformed domain.  Consequently the two  distribution functions can be viewed as  concise spectral representation of the  program parallelism.  Machine parallelism represents the resources available in  the  processor for the concurrent processing of instructions. A  machine is  modelled as a network, or circuit, of primitive  components, e.g. buffers and  scalar pipelines.  Macro models of  the components and the model for their  serial and parallel  interconnections will be developed.  With such a circuit of  model  microarchitectures, complex superscalar processors can be  effectively  and rigorously modeled.    While the research appears somewhat theoretical in  nature, a  great deal of experimentation is required and expected.  The plan  is  to work with realistic programs with extremely long traces as  well as a wide  range of state-of-the-art implementations of real  instruction set  architectures.  The Alpha 21164 and the Power PC  620 designs and the SPEC92  Shen  benchmark suites are used as the  primary experimentation vehicles.",
