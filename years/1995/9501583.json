 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453145  Lindsey    The Midland Public Schools plan to enhance all their elementary  teachers in science.  This project builds on their focusing on  elementary science beginning in 1989.  At that time they partnered  with the community and developed a centralized materials and  technical support system.  The project will take place over a three  year period, and will combine the resources of the Midland Public  Schools, private industry, universities, and the community, to  support a well-defined, inquiry-based, hands-on science teaching  methodology in each of Midland's 12 elementary schools.  The  institute will consist of a two week summer institute for an  initial group of 118 teachers.  Twenty-four (two from each of the  12 buildings) of these teaches will be prepared to become science  mentors for their schools.  A final week will occur during the  school year.  Trained along side of the teachers will be substitute  teachers.    In each of the subsequent two years, an additional 70 teachers will  participate with the core group of 24 leaders and 24 substitutes.    The project requested $713,936 from NSF with institutions/agencies  and the school district providing 229% in cost sharing.",
