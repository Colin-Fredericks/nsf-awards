 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504946  Mosher       This research project is focussed on negative curvature in the  sense of Gromov.  The principal investigator (working jointly with  U. Oertel) has proved a \"Lamination Theorem\" which says that for a  compact cell-complex X, exactly one of two alternatives holds:  either X is negatively curved in the sense of Gromov, or there is  a 2-dimensional lamination mapping to X with certain properties,  namely the lamination has a transverse measure of Euler  characteristic zero, and the map from the universal cover of a leaf  to X is least area.  The primary aim of this project is to use the  Lamination Theorem to investigate the \"weak hyperbolization  conjecture\" for a 3-manifold M, which says that M is negatively  curved in the sense of Gromov if and only if the fundamental group  of M has no Z+Z subgroup.  The strong form of this conjecture has  been one of the greatest challenges in 3-manifold theory.  The weak  conjecture should be a significant step in proving the strong  conjecture, in light of recent work of Cannon on characterizing  hyperbolic 3-manifold groups, and work of Gabai on the topological  rigidity problem for hyperbolic manifolds; if these various  projects can be completed, then the hyperbolization conjecture  would be proved.  This research project is also concerned with  several other topics, in particular: understanding properties of  automatic and biautomatic groups; the geometric group theory of  mapping class groups; constructions of and properties of  pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds.       Group theory, the mathematical study of symmetry invented by  E. Galois in the 1700's, has for much of its history been a subject  of abstract algebra, despite its geometric origins.  Starting with  work of M. Gromov, J. Cannon, W. Thurston and others in the 1970's  and 1980's, the newly emergent field of geometric group theory has  returned group theory to its origins.  The basic problem, proposed  by Gromov in his 1983 address to the International Congress of  Math ematics, is to take a \"group\" (an abstractly described  collection of symmetries) and to understand its geometry.  As a  particular case of Gromov's program, suppose that S is a  3-dimensional space, much like the space that we inhabit, and  suppose that G is a certain group of symmetries of S; in this  situation Thurston conjectured in the late 1970's that the geometry  of G should fall into a list of specific classes.  In most cases  Thurston's conjecture says that G should have \"hyperbolic\"  geometry, a type of geometry that describes how 3-dimensional space  fits into 4-dimensional space-time in relativity theory.  The main  thrust of the current research project is an attempt to prove  Thurston's \"hyperbolization conjecture.\"  Recent work of D. Gabai,  J. Cannon, and the investigator wih U. Oertel suggests a three-step  approach to proving the hyperbolization conjecture, and this  project is concerned with one step, the so-called \"weak  hyperbolization conjecture.\"  While this is an ambitious project,  the investigator expects it to be productive; if it is completely  successful, and if the other two steps are finished as the work of  Cannon and of Gabai suggests, then the hyperbolization conjecture  will be proved.  ***",
