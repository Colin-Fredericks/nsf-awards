 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507991  Gillespie       This study will examine the significance of fracture-directed  flow on recharge patterns in an arid, alluvial aquifer.  Alluvial  basin aquifers in the western U.S. are dependent on recharge  derived from adjacent mountain ranges.  A significant amount of  this recharge may be transported in the subsurface via fractures  within the bedrock aquifers and along basin-bounding faults.  We  propose to determine the extent to which fracture systems within  the southern Sierra Nevada Range and the Owens Valley Fault Zone  redistribute recharge from the Sierras into the western part of the  Indian Wells Valley alluvial aquifer.  The proposed research is a  logical extension of the investigators' interest in the  architecture and hydrogeochemistry of alluvial aquifers and  petroleum reservoirs.  It may have a broader significance in the  development of improved conceptual models of recharge patterns in  arid alluvial aquifers and lead to the discovery of ground water  resources in areas normally considered poor candidates for ground  water development.       Our methods will include remote sensing, surface and  subsurface field studies to determine the location of phreatic  divides, the orientation of fracture patterns, the hydraulic  gradient along the fractures and gradients within the alluvial  aquifer.  Chemical and isotopic analyses, including age-dating  along the major flow paths, will be used to delineate flow systems,  assess the role of fractures as barriers or conduits and constrain  the relative contribution of fracture-directed flow versus surface  recharge.  Finally, geologic and hydrologic data will be  incorporated into existing numerical flow models and the amount and  distribution of subsurface recharge to the alluvial aquifer  quantified.  The investigators will employ undergraduate and  graduate students and provide training in the qualitative and  quantitative techniques of classis field geology, hydrogeology and  hydrochemistry.  The students will play an ac tive role in the  dissemination of the information via abstracts, poster sessions,  presentations and travel to regional professional society meetings.",
