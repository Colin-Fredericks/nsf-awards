 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active noise control is the suppression of unwanted noise via  destructive interference using a digital signal processing system  with sensors and actuators.  The goal of this research is to  achieve significant performance gains and computational complexity  reductions in active noise control technology through fundamental  research in multichannel algorithm design and analysis, to enable  the wider use of this technology in industrial and consumer  markets.  These efforts include:           1.     the development of computationally-efficient, gradient-  based adaptive controllers employing simplified updating  strategies;         2.     the application of least-squares and orthogonalization  methods for robust and statistically-efficient filter adaptation;         3.     the design of multichannel subband implementations of  active noise controllers using adaptive infinite impulse-response  filters; and         4.     analysis and development of multichannel system  identification methods that require a minimum of processing  capability and that provide robust performance in time-varying  situations.    The research effort includes both system simulation and hardware  development to verify the underlying principles, performances, and  constraints of real-world active noise control systems.    To be most useful, an engineering education must forge a  relationship between the capabilities of various technologies and  the needs of the community at-large.  The goal of this effort is to  maintain the relevance of an engineering education by bringing the  industrial, societal, and academic communities closer together  through individual and group interaction.  Activities to foster  this interaction include:           1.     promoting joint university/industry technical projects  through participation in the University of Utah Engineering Clinic  Program;         2.     incorporating research activities in active noise control  within the undergraduate and graduate curriculum through individual  clas s projects;         3.     developing an integrated electrical engineering  curriculum through departmental committee work; and         4.     reaching out to the community through Engineering Career  Days and the advising of prospective transfer students.    The educational effort involves the design of new course projects,  committee work at the Department level, and extensive interaction  with students, other educators, and members of the local community.",
