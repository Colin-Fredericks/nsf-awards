 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our legal system often requires decision-making.  Judges and legislators must often resolve, address, or intelligently incorporate into policy, scientific issues that are themselves hotly debated by knowledgeable scientists.  How can we best adjudicate competing scientific claims consistently with democratic values?  An historian/philosopher of science, Jane Maienschein, a lawyer, Daniel Strouse, and a biologist, James Collins, have organized this conference in order to formulate a research agenda on questions of how conflicting scientific claims are resolved in a constitutional democracy.  Traditionally, scholars in science studies, law, and political philosophy have lacked a common perspective.  They have different conceptions of evidence and different approaches to resolution.  Nonetheless, the issues overlap all these disciplines and the scientific. legal, and political communities in which such conflict resolution currently proceeds also overlap.  Indeed, legal systems and scientific development seem to be central to establishing and stabilizing democracies.  Consequently, we need an interdisciplinary study of the adjudication of competing scientific claims in the context of such democratic systems.  This workshop promises to develop a research agenda for such interdisciplinary study by identifying researchable questions, promising approaches, and available opportunities.  Experts  from law, biology, philosophy, the social and behavioral sciences, and history will gather to be held in Phoenix Arizona March 24 and 25 to develop this research agenda.",
