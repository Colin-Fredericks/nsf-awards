This is being achieved by adopting a workshop approach  to teaching physics using enhanced microcomputer-based laboratory  (MBL) tools.  The time students traditionally spend listening  passively to lectures is replaced by direct, peer-group  collaborative enquiry in a laboratory environment.  Workshop  physics uses integrated computer tools, including MBL, in  mechanics and other areas of the curriculum.  Enhanced use is  made of dynamic spreadsheets and graphs for data analysis.  An  emphasis is placed on using these tools for modeling.  The use of  digital video analysis is also being used in the laboratory  setting.  Workshop physics provides a more supportive learning  environment for students and a more supportive atmosphere for  traditionally at-risk students such as those in Ventura's large  Hispanic population.  In addition, the MBL equipment and  techniques from Workshop Physics will be introduced into the  physical science course being developed for preservice teachers.",
