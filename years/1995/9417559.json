 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417559  Landau    This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-  Japan seminar on New Trends in Computer Simulations of Spin  Systems, to be held in Honolulu from August 29-September 1, 1995.   The co-organizers are Dr. David Landau of the University of Georgia  and Professor Masuo Suzuki of the University of Tokyo. The purpose  of this seminar is to bring together U.S. and Japanese scientists in an  environment that is conducive to informal interaction in addition to  formal presentation.  Participants are leaders in different aspects of  computational physics, who come from diverse institutions in different  geographical areas of each country and who are at different stages of  their careers.  The topics of interest include the determination of  critical exponents in different spin models, the nature of phase  transitions in complex spin systems, and the development of  algorithms for both classical and quantum models.    The seminar will foster the type of contact between Japanese and U.S.  scientists that can be expected to have significant influence on the  future course of the field.  The proposed participants and observers  have been selected for their past contributions and current activity in  the field, and the meeting can be expected to produce concrete plans  for future cooperation and exchange.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills  the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
