 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453036  Kulik    The California Academy of Science will develop \"Chinook: A National  Traveling Exhibit on Salmon.\"  The main components will be a 3500  sq. ft. and a 5000 sq. ft. version of an exhibit about salmon  ecology and biology, genetic diversity, and the science of species  preservation.  Futher, components of the exhibit will be reproduced  for a 500 sq. ft. exhibit for the new public visitors center at the  Bodega Marine Laboratory.    The exhibit will focus on the Sacramento River winter-run Chinook  salmon.  Several themes from the California Science Frameworks and  Benchmarks for Science Literacy serve as the foundation for the  interpretation.  Benchmarks theme of evolution and the Framework  theme of patterns of change are woven throughout the exhibit and  are illustrated by salmon life cycles, genetic diversity, and  physical adaptations.  Benchmarks theme of systems and interactions  as well as the Frameworks theme of scale and structure are also  incorporated in the interpretive material.    The exhibit will be developed by the ichthyologists, educators, and  exhibit designers of the California Academy of Science and genetic  researcher from the Bodega Marine Laboratory of the University of  California at Davis.  Thirteen individuals have been selected as  project advisors.  They bring a diversity of perspectives including  expert knowledge of the science concerns (salmon and habitats  issues, anthropology) to the educational interests (both formal and  informal).  The various evaluation studies will be carried by CAS  staff member Lisa Mackinney.    The complementary materials linking the exhibit with formal  education that will be developed are a Teachers Resource Kit and a  Chinook Curriculum Guide.  The Teachers Resource Kit, available to  each host site, will include a slide show, a video tracing the  story of salmon fisheries, a special issue of the CAS educator  newsletter, sample of fish scales and otoliths, a compilation of  resources from government agencies and env ironmental organizations,  and a bibliography produced by the CAS Biodiversity Resource  Center.  The Curriculum Guide will include sixteen hands-on  activities using readily available materials to reinforce the  educational objectives.  A Chinook Family Activity Guide targeted  at families with children between the ages of five and ten, will  provide parents with specific steps to facilitate discussion what  at the exhibit and to suggest follow-up activities to do at home.",
