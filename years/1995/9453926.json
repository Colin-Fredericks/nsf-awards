 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453926  Kirwan    Operation Primary Physical Science (OPPS) will enhance primary  grade teachers' understanding of the basic physical science  concepts which are first introduced in the primary grades. Using  the  NSF-funded Operation Physics (OP) model a four week-long  series of constructivist-oriented workshops will be developed and  validated for primary grade teachers. OPPS themes and topics for  these workshops will be determined through review of: state science  curriculum frameworks, recommendations from Project 2061 and  examination of several commercial elementary science curricula.  Each of the 20 individual workshops will require a full 8-hour day  to cover adequately, with each series constituting the equivalent  of one full week of instruction. Although each workshops and each  workshop series will be able to stand alone, a spiral approach will  underpin the structure of the program as major physical science  concepts are periodically revisited in varying contexts and depths.  OPPS workshops will use only everyday inexpensive materials in  activities reviewed for safety. Workshop activities will be adapted  from extant materials. OPPS workshops will be developed and field  tested by a group of 13-science educators. They will also develop  a Workshop Leaders Guide as was done in OP. Each of these  individuals will be responsible for arranging to conduct 10-field  test workshops during the development period.    Using these teacher enhancement materials thirty-six,  geographically distributed, 3-member leadership teams, each  associated with a host college/university, will be selected and  trained in the use of these materials and in workshop delivery.  Teams will attend a 16-day program in each of two consecutive  summers at the University of Maryland's Science Education Center.  Two training programs will be held each summer, with 18 teams in  each session.  Following the first year's training teams will be  expected to initiate local OPPS programs providing at least 20  grade K-5  teachers with 40-hours of OPPS workshops. During the  second and third year teams will provide 20 grade K-5 teachers with  a minimum of 120 hours of OPPS workshops. Graduate or continuing  education credit is expected to be available to participants in  these team-led workshops.",
