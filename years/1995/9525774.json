 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award to the University of Minnesota will support the   research of Professor Carl D. Frisbie.  The theme of the research is the   use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the direct measurement of the   binding forces between biological molecules.  The work will provide   quantitative and dynamic information on single biomolecular recognition   events such as occur in an antigen-antibody complex or between single   strands of complementary oligonucleotides.  The research will probe   forces between simple biomolecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides   by anchoring them to surfaces and AFM tips in oriented monolayers using   methods developed in Frisbie's postdoctoral work.  The chemically   modified AFM tips will be brought into contact with the sample surfaces   and the force needed to rupture the adhesive contact will be measured.    The studies provide a general methodology for obtaining direct   quantitative measures of the binding forces between a variety of   biomolecules.  Dynamic information such as binding force and bond rupture   length obtained in this work will enhance molecular level understanding   of biological molecular recognition and should ultimately be useful in   drug design and protein engineering.",
