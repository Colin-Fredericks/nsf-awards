Techniques to be used  in this  research are far-infrared and photothermal ionization  spectroscopy.  The aim is to gain as much understanding as  possible of the impurities' quantum nature and to establish  a possible association between impurity atoms and other  defects in the materials to be studied.    Wide-bandgap materials are potentially useful for demanding  electronic applications and as visible optical emitters.  At  present, many research groups are focusing on the growth of  wide-bandgap blue-emitting semiconductor materials that  could be used to fabricate blue light-emitting diodes and  semiconductor lasers.  The application of these materials to  light-emitting devices is hindered by several factors, among  them, the difficulties encountered in growing high quality  single crystalline epilayers.   Recently, preparation of  relatively good samples has been achieved, but very little  is known about the spectroscopic properties of dopant  impurities in these materials.  The spectroscopic techniques  to be used in the present study will provide new and highly  relevant information concerning the nature of these  impurities.  ***",
