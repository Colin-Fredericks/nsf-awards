This will be  accomplished through combination of higher   order  asymptotic  analysis,  numerical calculation,  and simulation.   The  asymptotic  analysis  requires  finding  approximations  to  the   distributions of  maxima  of random  fields,  and even the asymptotic   formulas require some numerical  calculation.  The investigators will   also study maximum likelihood estimation  for biased sampling models,   including  models  in which   subjects  self-select,  and  tests  for   unimodality    versus  multimodality.   They    will  seek  efficient   algorithms, conditions  for consistency, and asymptotic distributions   for  estimation    error  and   test   statistics.    Higher    order   approximations  to confidence  levels  for  parametric models   which   exhibit dependence are another major objective of the research.  Such   models  include   Markov chains,  semi-Markov   processes,  and  time   sequential models in sequential analysis.  A promising approach is to   use Stein's Identity on the signed  root transformation.  In addition,   the   investigators   will   study   non-parametric estimation    for   semi-Markov processes  and  expected    sample sizes and    operating   characteristics for time sequential models.           Determining the amount of confidence that may be attached to an   estimate or projection is a primary objective of the research.  To do   this   the investigators  will  place   probabilistic  bounds  on the   unobservable estimation  error.  They will  focus  their attention on   two novel  contexts both of which involve  measurements which are not   independent  but, rather,  are  related  in  a  complicated way.  For   example,    in  studies  of air   pollution,   measurements at  nearby   locations may  be related.  The research  also includes  the study of   inference from observational  studies, studies in which the inclusion   or  exclusion of subjects is  not entirely  under  the control of the   experimenter.   In such cases  inclusion may depend on other factors,   like the variables of interest.  For example, in animal studies it is   easier  to  find a large  group  of animals than  a   small one.  The   development   of methods for  correcting the  raw  data to form valid   estimates is a major objective of the research.",
