 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development and application of state-of-  the-art theoretical chemistry to effectively calculate quantum  mechanical observables for complex systems involving solvent and  ionic species.  The ability to answer questions involving complex  molecular systems that involve solvent and ionic species will  significantly enhance the fields of bioorganic and medicinal  chemistry.  Two difficulties have impeded progress towards this  goal.  The first has been the inability to calculate efficiently  systems of sufficient size to be of interest to a broad range of  fundamental biological processes.  The second has been the problem  of coupling a meaningful description of the effects of solvent to  a quantum mechanical calculation.  This research aims to 1) develop  accurate models for the inclusion of solvent effects in quantum  mechanical calculations, and 2) test such models on an  experimentally studied electron transfer reaction.    Principle areas targeted for interactive activities include:  1)  research being carried out in theoretical chemistry; 2) teaching a  graduate-level computational chemistry course. (This course will be  a new addition to the chemistry curriculum at UCSD and as such will  be an overview course to pique interest in the subject among  faculty and students.  Future goals include expansion of the course  to allow student initiated projects to be developed and  formalization of the degree requirements in harmony with the  existing chemistry curriculum.); and 3) offering a seminar course  (open forum - informal instruction) involving a weekly seminar  series for one quarter at UCSD in which women scientists in various  chemistry-related fields (academic and industrial), will be invited  to give talks.",
