 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420054  Seemann  The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's  atmosphere is projected to double by the middle to end of  the 21st century.  This change will have substantial effects  on natural and agricultural ecosystems, primarily because of  the effect of carbon dioxide on photosynthesis, the major  biological process in the global carbon cycle.  In many  plant species, long-term growth at elevated atmospheric  carbon dioxide results in the substantial change in both  absolute photosynthetic capacity and the protein composition  of the photosynthetic apparatus.  However, the molecular  mechanism(s) by which external carbon dioxide concentration  acts at the level of gene expression, are largely unknown.    The overall objective of this research is to link carbon  dioxide effects on photosynthetic physiological processes  (e.g. leaf gas exchange) and biochemical processes (e.g.  rubisco protein level and regulation of activity) to changes  in both rubisco gene expression and specific carbohydrate  levels in order to identify molecular mechanisms which  control the response of plants to elevated carbon dioxide.  Arabidopsis thaliana (wild-type and existing mutants) will  be used as the model plant system.  Specific objectives are:    (1) Determine the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide  concentration during different developmental stages on  rubisco large subunit (rbcL) and small subunit (rbcS) gene  expression, rubisco holoenzyme level, activation state, RuBP  pool size and the response of photosynthesis to  intercellular carbon dioxide partial pressure (Ci) in  Arabidopsis thaliana grown at and switched between a number  of carbon dioxide concentrations (subambient, ambient, twice  ambient, saturating).    (2) Identify the cellular signal(s) that function(s) in the  signal transduction pathway between atmospheric carbon  dioxide concentration and rubisco gene expression by  utilizing (1) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with altered  source or sink activities (altered leaf carbohydra te  metabolism, no seed production, altered root:shoot ratio,  delayed flowereing time) in studies of carbon dioxide  effects on rubisco gene expression and photosynthesis, and;  (2) transient expression studies of carbohydrate effects on  rbcS promoter-GUS constructs.",
