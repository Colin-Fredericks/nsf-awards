 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453060  Giesecke    This planning grant, submitted by the University of Nebraska and the Nebraska Library  Commission, addresses two key barriers to implementing an electronic library in Nebraska as  identified in two recent statewide conferences: compatibility of network systems and training for  end users.  The project will also identify content that should be available through the network  system.  Participants will include key stakeholders and agencies currently involved in electronic  delivery of information.  The results will be incorporated into ongoing planning efforts.    The project goal is to advance planning for the electronic library in the state by providing a  structure to identify content, training and software that will enable libraries and information  centers throughout the state, including those with special resources in law, medicine, and science  education, to contribute to the Nebraska Electronic Library.  These issues have not been  addressed in the current planning efforts in the state.  The objectives of the plan are to: (1)  develop recommendations on types of information resources that need to be available  electronically for the citizens of Nebraska; (2) identify training needs and develop model training  programs to meet citizen needs; (3) test and evaluate options for advancing network access  through ATM technology, through use of the z39.50 protocol, and through client/server  technology in the medical area, and; (4) develop implementation, assessment, and evaluation  strategies for the recommendations and facilitate transferability of these proposals to efforts by  other states.  This planning process will build on planning activities already in place in  Nebraska, and a recently funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting grant to create pilot  Community Wide Education and Information services.    Methodologies for development of recommendations and for the testing of software/hardware  pilots include: (1) electronic survey of library and information centers to  solicit input on content  and training; (2) a planning retreat of key stakeholders to formulate recommendations based on  input from the survey and from site visits to select states working on electronic library issues;  (3) testing of user acceptance of software options through user surveys and obtrusive  observation, and by evaluating predetermined search question results, and; (4) testing hardware  options through time trials and reliability tests.    By completing a statewide plan for the content of an electronic library system and for a model  training program, the libraries will ensure that future development is compatible with existing  efforts and meets the information needs of Nebraskans.  The model developed as part of this  plan will be applicable to other states.",
