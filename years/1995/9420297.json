For example, it is unclear  which male qualities are preferred by females and why.  Do  they prefer males who will feed their young; or males whose  genes will cause the offspring to be more vigorous and  competitive, or both?  A prerequisite for studying this  problem in nature is an accurate means of identification of  fathers.  The P.I. is employing new technology, namely DNA  microsatellites, for this purpose.  With accurate  information about actual genetic fathers the P.I. will then  characterize them according to their role in feeding young,  their dominance rank and other individual qualities that  might be correlated with competitiveness in their offspring.  The P.I. s studies will be among the first to provide  accurate information on the qualities of males actually  chosen by females in a complex avian social system in which  female choices are not constrained by a system in which  territories are owned exclusively by pairs.",
