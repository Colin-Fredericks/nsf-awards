 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is  a three step sequential undergraduate  biology-chemistry experience to retain science majors and to  inspire them to enter research careers. Step I occurs in a  student's first year with an integration of the second semester  laboratories of the majors' Introductory Biology and Chemistry  courses. Lectures remain separate. In order to follow the student  experience of the integrated laboratories and to retain and build  upon student interest in science research, Step II is a required  Career Seminar course in Spring of the sophomore year. Seminar  speakers from academia, medicine, and industry  serve as hosts  for students participating in Step III, a Summer Research  internship between the second and third years of college. Steps  II and III function together in the sophomore year to provide a  practical application of the integrated first year laboratories  and to reinforce research career goals. Two laboratory sections  concurrently participate in Step I to pursue a number of  nontraditional, investigative laboratory modules which integrate  concepts from cell biology, molecular genetics, and general  chemistry. Seven hours per week is divided into formal laboratory  investigation, discussion, and comeback time. Over a 12-week  period four modules are presented. These integrated, modular  laboratories will examine (1) Vitamin C Metabolism, (2) Reaction  Dynamics of Enzymes, (3) Sources of Energy for Life, and (4)  Manipulation of Macromolecule. During the final week of each  module, students analyze data, draw conclusions and in selected  modules, design their own original investigations based on  previous experimentation. Mathematic tutorials are available.  This integrated, biological-chemical modular format directly  relates to and prepares science majors for modern  research-oriented upper division courses and parallel a realistic  career research experience. One section of the integrated  biology-chemistry laboratories is comprised entirely of women for  comparison with  the other two of mixed gender and with the  traditional separate biology and chemistry laboratories for the  other students.",
