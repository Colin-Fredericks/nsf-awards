 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of a comprehensive,  cross-platform software package for morphometric analysis. The  package will provide a convenient environment for scientists to  incorporate the many recently developed methods for shape  analysis into their own research programs. These new methods,  generally termed \"geometric morphometrics\", pay particular  attention to the complete retention of geometric information,  such as is archived in sets of point, or landmark, coordinates.  Such information makes possible not only an exhaustive analysis  of shape variation, shape differences, and the covariation of  shape with external factors, but also allows for the  visualization of original and mean forms, group differences, and  hypothetical configurations based on the results of more abstract  statistical analyses.    The software will provide for the superimposition of  configurations of homologous points using edge-matching,  least-squares, and robust methods, the construction of  interpolation grids mapping a reference configuration onto a  target configuration, and the statistical analysis of single and  multiple groups of specimens in linear spaces tangent to  precisely defined, but non-Euclidean, shape spaces. Such  capabilities have previously been accessible to researchers only  through routines written for matrix language packages unable to  easily exploit the full potential of these new methods or  individual, idiosyncratic programs designed to illustrate a  specific method or concept and performing only a few of the  procedures that make up a complete analysis. The proposed package  will not only serve as a tool for learning and implementing these  new methods, but will be developed in such a way as to facilitate  the addition of new methods currently being developed, such as  the incorporation of outline information into the landmark-based  methods. It's modular, C++ coding, and use of cross-platform  interface tools will make it easy to provide versions for popular  platform s, such as the MS-Windows, OS/2, and Mac environments,  powerful Unix/XMotif workstations, and future computer systems.    In addition to these new geometric methods, the package will also  provide a complete environment for all aspects of morphometric  work. This will include data acquisition, verification, and  editing capabilities, through modules supporting popular 2- and  3-dimensional digitizers, modules for the construction and  analysis of \"traditional\" types of morphometric data such as  distance and angular measurements, analysis of outline data via  Fourier, fractal, and eigenshape methods, export capabilities to  allow for subsequent analyses using standard statistical  packages, and an extensive suite of graphical capabilities for  the visualization of the results of the above procedures.",
