 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project being developed will meet a demonstrated need to  provide an interesting, challenging entry level science course in  community colleges to improve the success rates of educationally  disadvantaged students. Many students are under prepared for  mastering concepts in college-level biological and physical  sciences because they do not understand principles which use  relationship thinking. The objective is to develop an  interdisciplinary, experiment-based FUNdamentals of Science  course with a history-of-science theme and discovery methods to  investigate measurement, density, gas laws, electric circuits,  and light, including lasers. Relationship thinking and skills to  use math as a tool will be developed by having students use a  computer program to create graphs of relationships from data.    The program will target the many new and returning students who  function at approximately the intermediate algebra level. This  group includes especially women, African-Americans, and Hispanics  who need a successful experience in their introduction to the  sciences. Three four-year college professionals in undergraduate  science education have agreed to serve as advisors for this  project. Student progress will be tracked and analyzed. Detailed  explanations for integrating experiments and computers into the  entry level course will be developed and disseminated. A workshop  (Innovations in Science Teaching) to present the methodology and  materials developed will be scheduled for science teachers,  including teachers from area secondary schools.",
