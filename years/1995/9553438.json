This  includes multimedia and animation relating computer representations  to corresponding objects and processes in nature.  GenScope, a  prototype hypermodel for investigating genetics, is currently under  development.  It supports open-ended exploration at five levels:   DNA, chromosomes, organism, pedigree and population thus having  applications in molecular biology, cellular biology, physiology,  Mendelian inheritance, and population genetics.  The GenScope  models.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate the educational  effectiveness of the hypermodel technology as a complement to the  traditional textbook and lecture approach and to implement the  tools, protocols, and standards necessary to facilitate the  creation of others by researchers, teachers, curriculum developers,  and students.  The project provides networking support to share  data, parts of models and full models.    In addition to some technical gains in multimedia and networked  models, the project will examine the impact of the multi-level  hypermodel on individual student's understanding.  The \"seamless\"  levels allow students to delve into why something happens on more  and more fundamental levels, ultimately down to the molecular.   Conversely, students can look at the impacts and generalize from  the specific to more general cases by moving up levels from the  molecular to the most general, populations.  This project will  define which content and reasoning skills are pertinent and should  be studied in the research.  It will determine which of these  \"elicit which components of understanding.\"  ***",
