Estimation, tests and confidence intervals with incomplete date are all under consideration. One objective of the research is to investigate a new resampling method, called the Leveraged Bootstrap, so that the difficulty of extending the usual estimation and testing procedures for complete data to incomplete data in certain situations or certain complicated models can be avoided. So far, the procedures developed for incomplete data are constructed on an ad hoc basis. The leveraged bootstrap does not rely on these ad hoc extensions. The research will focus on the investigation of the consistency of the leveraged bootstrap in a number of important statistical inference problems with incomplete data, such as empirical likelihood inference, nonparametric likelihood confidence bands, linear regression models, tests of independence for two random variables, tests in some semiparametric change point models, mixture models and biased sampling problems. Another objective of the research is to investigate the consistency of the m out of n bootstrap, i.e., resampling fewer than n observations, in the hypothesis testing problems using various censored data. It is known that the usual nonparametric bootstrap (the n out of n bootstrap) fails when one tries to estimate the distribution of test statistics under a semiparametric (restricted nonparametric) hypothesis and ignores the restrictions imposed by the hypothesis. Since the distributions of test statistics for censored data are often unknown and very complicated due to the unknown distributions of the censoring variables, it is of great interest to investigate possible remedies of the usual bootstrap in order to provide the critical values for the tests. Examples show that in certain situations,  there are no obvious general remedies except the m out of n bootstrap.    This research is primarily motivated by statistical inference problems using incomplete data which are frequently encountered in medical and reliability studies. In particular, doubly censored data and interval censored data occur in breast cancer research and AIDS research, respectively. The usual estimation and testing procedures for complete data are not directly applicable to such complicated incomplete data, and statistical analysis is lacking. The objective of this research is to investigate some general methods which will directly facilitate research in other fields, such as medicine.",
