 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510267  Tobin    Infrared  spectroscopy (350 - 3000 cm-1)  will  be  used  to  explore  the interactions of chemisorbed atoms and molecules  with  and  at metal surfaces. Broadband changes  in  surface  reflectance   provide   a  measure  of   conduction-electron  scattering from the adsorbates, and will be studied on  both  single  crystals  and  epitaxial thin films.  Issues  to  be  addressed    include    coverage-dependence,    temperature-  dependence,  and  the relation between  reflectance  and  dc  resistance.  Adsorption on metallic quantum  wells  will  be  studied  to  explore  the  effects of  substrate  electronic  structure  and  chemisorption behavior.  The broad  spectral  range  accessible  will  allow the  study  of  low-frequency  adsorbate-substrate vibrations.  %%%  The  interaction of gases with solid surfaces is of critical  importance  to  such  technologies  as  pollution   control,  chemical  synthesis,  and  chemical  sensing,  as  well   as  presenting   rich  and  fascinating  scientific   questions.  Infrared  light  is  used  to  explore  the  vibrations   of  molecules chemically bonded to metal surfaces, which  reveal  the  local physical and chemical environment. Through  thin-  film technology the thickness of the metal can be varied  on  the  atomic  scale,  and the resulting  changes  in  surface  chemistry  detected. The influence of the molecules  on  the  electrical  properties of the metal can  also  be  detected,  giving  new insight into surface physics, electron  dynamics  in metals, and mechanisms of chemical sensor operation.  ***",
