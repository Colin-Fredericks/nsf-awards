 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project investigates the feasibility of   using a novel catalyst to control the release of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and related compounds into the environment. The release of CFCs and related compounds is believed to play a significant role in the decline in the earth's ozone layer. Although the production of CFCs is currently being phased out, large quantities already exist and must be dealt with. Compounds intended to replace CFCs, which include HFC (hydrofluorocarbons) and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons), also possess ozone-depleting properties. As a result, the release of these compounds must also be controlled. Catalytic oxidation is a technology well suited for controlling vapor phase emissions. However, catalysts capable of oxidizing CFCs have deactivated rapidly, due primarily to materials degradation in the harsh acid gas environment. A novel catalyst was recently identified which was capable of oxidizing fluorine containing organic molecules without loss of catalytic activity. The objective of this Phase I proposal is to evaluate this novel catalyst for its ability to oxidatively destroy CFCs and related compounds in streams of air. To meet this objective, the catalyst will be evaluated for reactivity and performance stability against selected CFCs, HFCs, and HCFCs. Tests will be conducted over a wide range of process conditions so that the performance envelope of the catalyst may be established. Based on performance data obtained to date, it is anticipated that the catalyst will oxidize the above compounds without loss of catalytic activity.",
