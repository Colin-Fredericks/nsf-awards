 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is the recipient of funds, from the National Science Foundation, for the renovation of Chase Hall.  The Departments of Biological Systems Engineering and Agricultural Meteorology reside and conduct research and research training in the 75 year old facility.  Critical research needs, in the areas of global climate change, micrometeorological measurements, soil and water quality, waste management, and sensing and controls from spatial and temporal variability, necessitate the renovation of research space for the departments.  Research activities are currently  located in dispersed and inadequate facilities throughout Chase Hall, as well as in the adjacent Biological Systems Engineering Laboratories.  Funding received from the State of Nebraska  and the ARI Program will be used to consolidate and renovate space for these related research activities in one modern facility.  This effort will foster improved research interaction and facilitate the use of shared equipment for various interrelated research activities.  Five research laboratories slated to be renovated in this project include:  Climate Dynamic Research, Environmental Instrumentation Research, Sensors and Controls, Bioremediation and Pollution Prevention, and Advanced Integrated Data Management.  Seventeen faculty members, 19 support personnel, 3 post doctoral students, 106 graduate students, and 41 undergraduate students will be the direct beneficiaries of the modernized facility once completed.  In addition, collaborators from other departments including Geography, Geology, Biological Sciences, Civil Engineering, Horticulture Science and Entomology, and international colleagues will conduct research in these laboratories on specific projects.  The renovated laboratories will contribute to increase interdisciplinary research both nationally and internationally, a major goal of the university.",
