 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9507979  Nordeen, Ernest J.    Understanding how the production, specification and survival of  nerve cells  are regulated to generate variation in neuron number is an  important goal of developmental neurobiology.  In many instances,  these processes are influenced by steroid hormones such as  estrogen, which act on the developing nervous system to regulate  neuron number and growth within specific brain regions.   This  proposal concerns the biological mechanisms and cellular  populations through which these hormones exert control over brain  cell number.   Several proposed studies will test the hypothesis  that hormones prevent cell death to influence neuron number within  specific brain regions. Other studies are aimed at identifying the  cell populations actually mediating these neurotrophic effects of  steroids.  More specifically, experiments will test the notion that  some neurons transiently express estrogen receptors during their  migration, and depend on this hormone for their survival during  this period.  In addition, the work  will address how glia  contribute to the neurotrophic effects of steroid hormones during  development.   The long term aim of these studies is to use the  hormonal regulation of neuron growth and survival as a tool with  which to explore the underlying cellular and molecular changes  influencing a neuron's decision to live or die.  In so doing,  a  greater understanding of the factors contributing to neuron death  during development and in disease will be attained.",
