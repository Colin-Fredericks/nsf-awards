 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program, Inc. (CPEP) Summer Program  at Trinity College will begin the summer of 1996 until the summer  of 1998.  Each summer a five week commuter program will offer an  integrated curriculum in science, mathematics, computer and  engineering applications, guidance/career counseling and language  arts/study skills.  All subject areas will be offered in an  interdisciplinary manner enabling students to develop an  appreciation for the breadth of the educational experience.  The  overall instruction will be focused on engineering applications and  practical lab applications utilizing the knowledge and problem  solving skills taught during the sessions.    A total of 135 underrepresented minority students entering the 8th  and 9th grade from the Hartford Public School system (45 each year)  will take grade appropriate courses and participate on field trips.   The state of the art engineering facilities and the enthusiastic  Trinity faculty will provide students with an exposure to some of  the most exciting technological applications of science and  mathematics.  The program will continue to employ a \"hands-on\"  approach to mathematics and science education.  Learning  experiences are designed to actively involve students in science  inquiry and mathematics as an integral aspect of investigation.    Guidance will address the need for enrollment in advanced secondary  science and mathematics courses during the academic year.  Role  models and mentors from the science, engineering and mathematics  community will make presentations during the program.  The language  arts component is closely aligned with the science and mathematics  curricula.  Opportunities for parents and guardians to become  empowered and actively involved in their child's education will be  provided.  Follow-up activities will take place during the school  year.  Participants in the program will remain in the CPEP data  file for tracking and evaluation purposes until they graduate high  school,  CPE P seeks $225,720.  ***",
