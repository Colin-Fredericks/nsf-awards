 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500574 Dafermos  A number of projects are proposed, in the  general area of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. They  include the study of the geometric structure of the admissible  weak solutions and the investigation of the large time behavior  in the presence of dissipation induced by fading memory or  friction, in one space dimension; also the development of the  theory of hyperbolic systems of two conservation laws with  commuting Jacobians, in several space dimensions.   The proposed  research is interdisciplinary, lying on the interface between  continuum physics and the theory of partial differential  equations. The hope is that the analysis will shed some light on  the physics and, in return, the underlying physical structure  will direct and drive the analysis. Continuum physics is the  branch of classical physics which models materials, solid or  fluid, as continuous media governed by conservation laws and  constitutive assumptions. The partial differential equations  involved are first order quasilinear hyperbolic systems resulting  from the conservation laws and constitutive assumptions of  materials with elastic response.",
