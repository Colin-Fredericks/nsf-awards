The project would be  managed by a Principal Investigator  and five Co-Principal Investigators  who will work with five PhD  trainees as an interdisciplinary  team within the framework of the  Manufacturing Excellence Center  (MEC) at Colorado State University.  The MEC has operated for several  years and provides a unique setting  within which PhD trainees would  have the opportunity to interact  with small-and-medium sized  manufacturing firms as the PhD  education and research programs are  being undertaken. The research will  focus on specific advances in  environmentally conscious parts  cleaning technologies, chemical  vapor deposition reactors which  minimize waste production,  environmentally conscious design in  concurrent engineering, and low  pollution painting processes. These  areas are selected because they are  known to be relevant to the  competitive position of  manufacturers. This is known based  upon the ongoing, day-to-day  interaction with manufacturers  through the MEC. In the context of  the long-standing commitment of  Colorado State University of  diversity, a significant effort  would be made in this project to  enhance recruitment and retention  of women, minorities and persons  with disabilities in the proposed  traineeship program. In addition, a  significant contribution to the  national infrastructure which  promotes and sustains student  diversity is expected.",
