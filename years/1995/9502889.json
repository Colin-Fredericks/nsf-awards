 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel computers are difficult to program.  Often,  users have to specify the parallel execution, i.e., to specify  data  distributions to different local memory modules (as in High  Performance  Fortran), data communications between processors, and  processor  synchronizations.  The insufficient programming support  limits the  applicability and further development of parallel  systems.  The objectives of  this research are (1) to search and  find solutions (optimal or feasible) for  those fundamental  problems in programming parallel systems such as how to  distribute/replicate input data to different local memories in  the system to  minimize inter-processor communications, how to  schedule and partition the  computations to minimize the overall  running time, how many processors should  be used and how to  choose the right message size for a message vector; (2) to  develop new techniques for data alignment, scheduling  partitioning and  estimating the number of processors to be used  for optimal execution of  algorithms with nested loops; and (3) to  implement these techniques and add  them to some existing software  tools such as PVM and MPI.    Education:  The  education plans are as follows:  (1)  Undergraduate computer architecture lab at  Santa Clara University  has not been changed for six years and is obsolete.  It  is  planned to update the lab and syllabi and redesign the students'  projects to  include recent advances in computer design, technology  and debugging software  to have students more motivated and  prepared when they graduate.  (2) Develop  new parallel processing  lab projects.  One project is to have students run  parallel  programs in PVM environment so students can see and think those  fundamental problems in parallel programming.  (3)  Be involved  in mentoring  women and underrepresented undergraduates and  graduate students.  (4)  Do  research projects with several senior  undergraduate students, especially women  engineering students to  motivate them to pursue graduate studies  in computer  engineering at SCU",
