 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor George W. Flynn of Columbia University will continue   his investigations on the energy transfer and quenching in highly   vibrationally excited molecules at the microscopic, quantum   state-resolved level.  Using diode laser techniques developed by him,   Prof. Flynn will study collisional reactions on a time scale of the   duration of a single collision, these involving the vibrational and   rotational, as well as  translational degrees of freedom.  Among the   specific problems to be  attacked are the determination of the   characteristics of the donor molecules that lead to supercollisions,   i.e., collisions in which large amounts of vibrational energy are   transferred; of the changes in angular momentum which occur in these   processes; and  how the mass and other properties of the acceptor   molecules affect the energy transfer. Also to be investigated are the   quenching of electronically excited molecules, hot atom collisions and   chemical reaction processes.    Among the outstanding problems in contemporary physical chemistry are the   details of chemical reaction processes.  To this end it is necessary to   investigate how molecules excited to high vibrational and rotational   energies  behave when they undergo collisions with other molecules.    Since reacting molecules usually follow one of several possible reactions   paths that lead to different reaction products, a detailed understanding   of the transfer of vibrational, rotational, and translational energies   among the collision partners and the reaction products is desirable, and   necessary, in order to develop theoretical models that can lead to the   control of reactions so as to yield a desired product with maximum yield.     Not only do such studies yield data which can be compared conveniently   to theoretical calculations, they also provide rather definite evidence   for the mechanism or forces which control reaction processes.  In   addition, much of the experimental data to be obtained will be of   practical interest in the study and control of unimolecular and   bimolecular chemical reactions and photochemistry.  These processes are   of importance in the development of advanced materials and processing   techniques necessary for improved microelectronic devices, the   development of new, more efficient laser devices, and in the development   of an improved understanding of atmospheric chemical reactions and   environmentally important chemistry.",
