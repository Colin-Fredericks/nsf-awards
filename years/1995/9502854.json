 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coleman  9502854   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the problem of integrating high efficiency conventional power sources with renewable power sources in support of operations at remote cold regions research bases and communities.  Specific research focus is on the rigid operating requirements and environmental constraints at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station of the United States Antarctic Program for which a major infrastructure redevelopment is being planned.   The overall objective of the project is to provide a plan for renewable energy integration at the South Pole Station that serves as a model for other applications.  The project will address and document in a comprehensive manner integration issues such as intelligent power systems management and dispersed hybrid power system layout.  Wind power will be the subject renewable power source but system design will accommodate other sources such as photovoltaic arrays.  The work will include data gathering, hardware qualification, engineering , and planning activities.",
