This research will initiate a program of study on how people make awards of compensatory damages in personal injury cases.  Compensatory damages are awards to compensate accident victims for their pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, disfigurement, disability, and similar losses.  The research will seek to discover how people organize their perceptions of an accident victim's injury and translate their perceptions into compensation amounts.  It will seek to develop parallel or contrasting explanations for judges, plaintiff and defense lawyers, and ordinary citizens, who serve as civil jurors.  Its overriding goal is to more fully account for and more accurately predict compensation decisions.  The study to be conducted presents to samples of judges, attorneys, and citizens a wide variety of injuries and their consequences in an effort to map the \"injury space\" within which damage decisions are made and to identify the core injury attributes people use to organize their judgments about injuries.  It will serve as a foundation for future research elaborating the model of damage decision making that will be developed.  %%%%  Profound controversy exists about many aspects of damages in tort litigation, but there is very little systematic knowledge about the nature of decision making in litigation for damages.
