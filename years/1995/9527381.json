The basic issue involved is that of preservation of stability under  finite dimensional approximation of the system.  This is a very important  question since every computational scheme for a system of partial differential  equations or other infinite dimensional system involves a finite dimensional  approximation of one sort or another, and it is well-known that certain  approximation schemes will destroy stability or change the so-called stability  margin.  A recently developed method of approximation, called the  method of   equivalent inner products,  that is known to preserve the  stability margin of  the original infinite dimensional system, will be studied.  The method is known  to be useful for approximation of bounded operators (systems of ordinary  differential equations, for example).  In additions to establishing convergence  properties of the method in the context of the equations under consideration,  reliable computer algorithms based on the method will be developed.        The mathematical equations governing the motion of vibrating flexible   elastic structures are used to model such diverse physical systems as robot   arms, large antennae, buildings (vibrating in an earthquake, for example),  airplane wings, and so forth. Computer algorithms are often used to simulate  these equations in order to solve complex problems in these applications. With  the advent of new technologies, such as advanced actuators and materials, and  enhanced performance requirements, together with the need to better  understand and influence the motion of these systems, there is a necessity for  more sophisticated mathematical models and theoretically sound, reliable  numerical algorithms for model simulation and approximation. This project will  focus on a new approximation method which has shown significant promise for  imp acting exactly these types of problems.  Basic convergence properties of  the method will be developed, as well as associated software based on the  method.  ***",
