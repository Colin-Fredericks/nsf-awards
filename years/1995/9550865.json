 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum wells are fabricated by placing a thin layer of a smaller  band gap semiconductor (well) between two thick layers of a  larger band gap semiconductor (barrier).   The band gaps align  yielding a one-dimensional square well potential for an electron.    Through this project, reflectivity and photoluminescence  (emission from the sample following excitation) measurements are  performed on five different single quantum wells and a pair of  double quantum wells (two wells separated by a thin barrier)  which yields the energy levels of the electron and thus  demonstrates the formation of discrete states in square wells,  the dependence on barrier height and well widths, and the  formation of symmetric and antisymmetric states due to tunneling  and overlap in double quantum wells.   Lifetime measurements are  performed by time-resolved photoluminescence on doping  superlattices (semiconductor with alternate regions of n- and p-  type doping).   These experiments can modernize any undergraduate  curriculum and may be treated as experiments in modern physics  and quantum mechanics.   They are timely and relate to current  technology and research.   The semiconductor heterostructures are  applied as tunable quantum well lasers and light-emitting diodes.",
