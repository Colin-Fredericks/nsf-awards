 "awd_abstract_narration": "9524144  Current atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are more than 25%  higher than pre-industrial levels.  Projections based  upon  the  present  rate  of  carbon input  into  the  atmosphere  indicates that the atmospheric carbon dioxide content  will  double in less than a century.  Although there is debate as  to  whether this increase will result in significant global  warming, there is little doubt that this increase will have  potentially dramatic effects on plant production  and  will  possibly  result in changes in plant composition  of  major  world  ecosystems.   There  is a  need  to  understand  the  spectrum  of  responses  that will  occur  over  the  major  ecosystem  types  of the world as a consequence  of  rising  atmospheric  greenhouse  gas concentrations,  most  notably  carbon  dioxide, and it is critical that these  experiments  be  conducted  in  intact  ecosystems,  not  in  artificial  conditions such as greenhouses or growth chambers.  Deserts  account  for  the  largest percentage of the  earth's  land  surface   area,   and   through  the  process   of   global  desertification,  are showing the most  rapid  increase  in  surface area.  Deserts are also the ecosystem type that are  predicted to be the most sensitive to global change because  elevated carbon dioxide relaxes the effects of water stress  in  plants.   Elevated  carbon  dioxide  may  significantly  impact   the  productivity  and  biodiversity   of   desert  ecosystems  and  result  in  a substantial  change  in  the  function  and land-use patterns of this prevalent ecosystem  type.   However,  there  have yet  to  be  any  large-scale  studies   of  the  effects  of  global  change  on   desert  ecosystems.   The  Mojave Desert is one of  the  most  arid  deserts in North America and most resembles true deserts in  other parts of the world, giving the potential to serve  as  a  model  system  for the study of the response  of  desert  vegetation  to elevated carbon dioxide.  A Free Air  carbon  dioxide    Enrichment  (FACE)  system  is  currently   being  constructed  on  the  Nevada Test Site  within  the  Mojave  Desert  of  southern  Nevada.  This  technology  entails  a  series  of  experimental \"rings\" in which  elevated  carbon  dioxide  is  constantly  supplied to  an  intact  ecosystem  within  each ring, and does not otherwise alter the climate  of   the   site   with  artificial  enclosures.    Specific  experiments to be conducted in this study include  analysis  of  the  responses  of plant production,  reproduction  and  survival,  and  landscape water balance to elevated  carbon  dioxide.  These specific  experiments  will  be  integrated  through  a   series   of  ecosystembased  models that will be developed  specifically  for  the  Mojave  Desert site.  The  modeling  effort  will  particularly emphasize two integrating concepts: (1)  under  the  extremely dry and infertile soils of deserts,  intense  competition  between plants controls the  function  of  the  ecosystem,  and  elevated carbon  dioxide  may  change  the  competitive   balance  that  currently  exists;   and   (2)  recruitment   and  survival  of  plants  in   deserts   are  determined  by episodic conditions (droughts  and  abnormal  wet  cycles), and elevated carbon dioxide may change  plant  responses  to these episodic conditions.  Desert ecosystems  may   become  more  productive  and  will  use  water  more  efficiently  under  elevated carbon  dioxide,  but  complex  ecosystem  feedback processes may limit this response  over  the long term.  Experiments like this will provide the data  we  need  to  predict how these changes  will  affect  arid  lands.",
