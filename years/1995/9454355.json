 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454355     Bhattacharjee    The Teacher Enhancement workshop in molecular biology and  recombinant DNA technology supported by the NSF was initiated to  provide high school biology teachers with needed basic knowledge  and proficiency in recent advances of molecular biology and  recombinant DNA technology.  The objectives of the project are to  improve the teaching of biology, attract more students to careers  in biomedical sciences, and make Ohio high school graduates \"DNA  literate.\"  This summer workshop should involve two weeks of  intensive lectures (topics include structure and function of DNA,  genome size and propoerties of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes,  and the principles and applications of gene cloning and recombinant  DNA technology), discussions, special seminars (topics include  oncogene and career, human genome project, evolution and plant  biotechnology), field trip to an Ohio biotechnology company, lesson  plan development, and hands-on laboratory experiments involving  simple recombinant DNA techniques (E. coli transformation, plasmid  DNA Isolation, restriction digestion and gel electrophoretic  analysis of recombinant DNA).  Twenty teachers would be selected  for each workshop.  Through expanded outreach efforts, at least  half of the teachers will be actively recruited from the inner-city  high schools of Ohio.  Each participating teacher will be provided  with a stipend, travel, room and meal expenses as well as a  textbook, accessories, video tapes, a list of granting agencies and  research resource laboratories in Ohio, an electrophoretic gel box  and power supply, and various laboratory supplies.  The  instructional team would include the PI, one faculty associate,  other Miami faculty, graduate teaching assistants, high school  master teachers, curriculum and assessment consultants.  In order  to increase the impact of the project, the PI and the faculty  associate would conduct regional and annual summative follow-up  activities.  Second-tier teachers from the sch ools and districts of  the participating teachers will be included in the follow-up  activities.  As a result of this project, at the end of the current  grant period more than 10,000 students in more than 100 high  schools in Ohio woul be benefitted.",
