 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discipline of Computer-aided Verification attempts to  provide  software and hardware engineers with (semi) automatic formal  methods  for improving the reliability of concurrent and real-time  systems.  Over the  last decade, Computer-aided verification has  matured into a well-defined but  loose collection of various  models, theorems, algorithms, techniques, and  tools.  Indeed, to  the outsider the discipline seems to provide a shopping list  of  different formalisms and methods, with little or no assistance as  to which  model, technique, or tool may be particularly (un)  suited for a given task.  This CAREER research seeks to aid the  further advancement of the discipline and  the technology  transition by a systematic organization of the core results in a  single standardized framework that can be taught on the  undergraduate level, the reactive-system  model.  To  achieve both simplicity and generality, a system is  identified with its  reaction function, which, given a system  state and an environment move, yields  a set of possible new  system states.  Based on the reactive-system model, this  research  pursues three objectives:    (1)  Development of a uniform, clean, and  comprehensive theory of  Computer-aided Verification.  While most results were  formulated,  originally, for specific formalisms with various idiosyncrasies,  it is expected that the translation of theorems and algorithms  into a common  framework will lead to a deeper understanding of  dependencies, connections, and  applications.    (2)  Preparation of a standard textbook on Computer-aided  Verification, targeted at the advanced-undergraduate level and  the  beginning-graduate level.  It is hoped that the text will  move formal methods  into the mainstream of the Computer Science  curriculum.    (3) Development of a  course on the practice and applications of  Computer-aided Verification, a  project-oriented course is  offered to advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate  students in engineering.",
