 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504594  Knight       Knight's research program, both in her hands and in those of  her students and collaborators, involves a range of topics in  recursive model theory. In this project, she will be working on  several levels of abstraction, from seeking new metatheorems to  clarify connections between theories and their models, to  addressing problems about models of specific theories.  One part  involves finding an algorithm for constructing a mathematical  object (e.g., in the setting of reduced Abelian p-groups) whose  initial description is not effective.  Another part concerns making  precise the connections between recursion-theoretical complexity  and model-theoretical definability.       The current grant provides some essential travel and supply  needs for Knight's research group.  Their research activities  concern an area of logic whose main focus is computability, and  which has ties to methods of building models for mathematical  theories.  ***",
