 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422817  JAROSZ       Although considerable attention has been given to  globalization of manufacturing industries, dramatic changes also  have transformed agricultural enterprises.  Global food  productive systems now are characterized by vertical and  horizontal integration of multinational corporations and by  capital- and labor-intensive production, processing, and  distribution networks.  This Research Planning Grant will enable  a productive female investigator to continue development of an  international comparative research project.  This project will  explore how changing divisions of labor in the apple industries  of the U.S., France, and South Africa have evolved over recent  decades as industries in all of these regions have become  competitors for Asian and European markets.  The research will  rely on historical and archival research as well as focus groups  and interviews with owners, operators, and workers in different  facets of the industry.  This award will facilitate refinement of  research plans in South Africa and Washington state.       This award will continue the development of a research  project with great potential.  The project will compare the ways  that changing divisions of labor among different class, ethnic,  and gender groups are related to globalization of agricultural  industries in different regions.  Through these analyses, more  complete understandings will result of the opportunities and  constraints facing each of the regions as they try to develop  socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural systems  that are economically competitive in global markets.",
