 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida International University (FIU), in collaboration with Dade  County Public Schools (DCPS) proposes a three year summer science  camp for selected at risk, underrepresented middle schools from the  Dade School District.  Sixty-six students will participate during  year 1, and 88 for years 2 and 3.  The proposed project, Technology  Enhanced Achievement in Mathematics and Science (TEAMS), is a major  expansion of the Partnership of Academic Communities (PAC),  bringing substantive enrichment to this partnership between DCPS  and FIU.  PAC provides underrepresented, at risk students their  mathematics, science and technology instruction on the FIU campus,  using university faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and  resources.     TEAMS is proposed as a combined commuter and resident program, with  7th and 8th graders commuting and 9th graders in residence,  providing the more mature students a full-day scientific immersion,  with afternoon and evening research and laboratory experiences.   The five weeks, four days per week summer experience will be  supplemented by 9 academic year Saturday sessions, featuring non-  academic scientists, mathematicians, and engineers  e.g., a Bell  South mathematician, and IBM systems analysts, and a City of Miami  Planning engineer .    Dade County Public Schools' Urban Systemic Initiative leader  teachers in mathematics, science and technology, FIU faculty in  mathematics, the sciences, computer science, mathematics education,  science education, statistics, and graduate students, will all  directly provide workshops, field activities, and seminars.   Likewise, professionals from business, industry, and particularly  the technology industry will provide to the students of TEAMS  enjoyable, meaningful experiences that are non-traditional, rich  and demanding and enriching hands and minds-on, predominantly  technology integrated.  Drawing from an already proven successful   for these students in the PAC project  base, the curriculum and  instruction w ill exemplify the reform of math and science (NCTM  Standards and NSTA Standards).  It will foster mathematical and  scientific thought, build positive attitudes and solid knowledge  bases in these fields.  It will utilize NSF support  funded  and  other rich new curricula  Mathematics in Context .    The goals of TEAMS are: 1) to enrich at-risk, underrepresented  students' experiences in math, science and technology, designed to  improve their attitude toward and valuing of the sciences; 2) to  provide scientific ways of thinking and reasoning and systematic  learning/study experiences sufficient to success-oriented education  and self-concept enhancement; 3) to provide experiences paving the  way for an economically successful occupation, with at least  adequate mathematics, science and technology for this success; and  4) to build confidence sufficient that some participants may choose  to major in scientific areas.  ***",
