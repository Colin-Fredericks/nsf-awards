 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504423  Yetter       This project deals with topological quantum field theories in  dimensions 3 and 4, primarily from the point of view of their  construction and study by algebraic and combinatorial means.  In  particular, the investigators are engaged in the completion of  computational details and the construction of examples of the  \"Tornado Formula\" of Crane and Frenkel, a construction of 4D TQFT's  from initial data given by a \"Hopf category,\" and the examination  of a fully bicategorical generalization of the Crane/Yetter  invariant.  The investigators have already shown that any 3D (resp.  4D) TQFT with physically reasonable factorization properties (which  should be satisfied by the \"full  Donaldson/Floer and  Seiberg/Witten theories) has an associated monoidal category and  (internal) Hopf algebra (resp. monoidal bicategory) and formal Hopf  category object therein) and are studying how general this  phenomenon is.  It is the investigators' hope that  algebraic/combinatorial constructions for invariants sensitive to  PL (equiv. smooth) structure on 4-manifolds may be found in the  course of the project.  Several related lines of research--  constructions of \"quantum\" invariants of 2-knots and Seifert  surfaces, and the study of the HOMFLY and Kauffman skein categories  with a view to finding new initial data for the construction of  TQFT's--are also being pursued.        Topological quantum field theories are a lively new area of  research into the structure of spaces of dimensions 3 and 4.  So  named because of their topological nature and their structural  properties, which fit into Dirac's formalism for quantum mechanics,  their study has revealed surprising connections between the  structure of manifolds, classical algebraic structures, and  statistical and quantum physics.  This project will contribute to  the unfolding of the rich algebraic structures implicit in spaces  of the dimension(s) in which we live.  Although the investigators'  techniques are primarily algebraic in fl avor and foreign to most  physicists, some noted relativists have expressed the belief that  constructions of the sort studied in this project hold the key to  finding and understanding the much sought quantum theory of  gravity.  ***",
