 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526255  Jaron  The International Federation of Medical and Biological  Engineering (IFMBE) has the aims of encouraging research and  the application of knowledge, the dissemination of  information, and the promotion of collaboration between  engineers, scientists and educators within the medical and  biological engineering community.  The IFMBE Administrative  Council meets twice each year to oversee the management of  the IFMBE, to develop projects such as a new journal in  Tissue and Cellular Engineering, a dictionary of Biomedical  Engineering and the planning of specialized international  technical conferences.    This project  provides partial support of the United States  representation to the Administrative Council of the IFMBE to  attend its semi-annual meetings over a period of three  years: 1995 (Israel), 1996 (Finland and Holland), and 1997  (Hong Kong and Nice). United States representation to the  Administrative Council of the IFMBE is under the aegis of  the American Institute for Medical and Biological  Engineering (AIMBE).  The principal investigator for the  project, Dr. Dov Jaron, a member of the Board of Directors  of AIMBE, represents the U.S. on the Council.    Representation on the Council provides the United States  with the opportunity to develop new lines of communications  and collaborative projects among biomedical engineering  researchers from many countries and thereby to extend its  leadership role in medical technology research and  development.  This is particularly so in the newer areas of  investigation in cost-reducing and cost-effective health  care technologies. Information about Council deliberations  is to be disseminated by AIMBE to a wide audience through  special articles in various technical publications,  specialized workshops and seminars, and  electronically on  the Internet.  ***",
