The project deals  with a new method for parameter estimation,  especially in the environment of biological  systems.  The method, which utilizes Linear  Associative Memories (LAM) has been applied to  the estimation of electronic parameters of  nerve cells.  The initial results indicate that  parameter estimates for a neural estimation  problems obtained by LAM, always fall within  the neighborhood of the \"true\" solution.  The  objectives of this project are: to assess the  degree of immunity of the LAM methods to the  problem of local minima; to develop the method  further by first using a recursive algorithm to  improve its range; to add non-linear terms to  improve the accuracy; and finally to apply this  technique to the estimation of neuronal  parameters of granule cells in the hippocampus  using data collected in Dr. Durand laboratory.    Scope:  This project will allow a cooperative  activity between the two investigators and  their respective departments where data  collection will be done at CWRU while data  analysis will be performed at Cairo University,  and where the final examination and evaluation  of the results will be the mutual  responsibility of the two principal  investigators.  The project meets the criteria  of the Division of International Programs well.  ***",
