 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550759  Montoya  The Chemical Engineering Department at New Mexico State University  (NMSU) is proposing a program to develop the technical and  professional skills of minority students and faculty.  The focus of  the research program is development of a validated process  simulation model of the magnetic Czochralski process, the most  frequently used commercial process for growing large bulk crystals.   Magnetic fields stabilize convection and turbulent flow in the  metallic liquid phase; the Czochralski process benefits form this  increased stability by producing uniform crystals with few defects.   Coupled to the modeling task is development of reliable estimates  of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the solid-liquid  system.  Also, a complete experimental understanding of the process  (albeit, the non-magnetic process at the current time) will be  obtained to verify the model.  After full characterization of the  experimental apparatus using pure materials, this initiative will  begin investigations of materials that have been successfully grown  only by thin-film growth, such as gallium nitride, a wide-band-gap  semiconductor which, when incorporated into a diode, is capable of  emitting visible blue light.  The outcome of a successful research  program will be the introduction of new processing techniques and  novel materials into industry, as well as creating new methods to  grow large quantities of ildustrially important semiconductors and  ceramics.    Resources will be developed for minority student and faculty  training.  Minority graduate and undergraduate students will be  directly involved with the research, and collaboration with the  National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will encourage the  development of external contacts for career development.   Publication of results will strengthen the reputation of both the  RIMI program and NMSU.  Computing facilities and experimental  equipment will be added to the NMSU College of Engineering,  providing facilities that wil l aid in obtaining further grants to  sustain current and future research.  The nature of the theoretical  work employed in this proposal, the number of crystalline systems  that are of interest to industry, and the lack of research into  magnetic-field assisted materials processing will sustain this  program well into the future.  ***",
