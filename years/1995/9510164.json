 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510164  Johann  Well-founded orderings are ubiquitous in automated deduction,  being fundamental to the development of termination proofs for  computations in rewrite-based deduction systems, as well as of  deduction strategies aiming to restrict search spaces in  saturation processes.  The determination of well-founded  orderings suitable for a particular purpose, however, typically  requires a good deal of technical expertise, and because  termination of rewriting is undecidable in general the best that  can be hoped for is to have a sufficient understanding of a  sufficient variety of orderings to be able to cope with the many  kinds of termination and efficiency problems which occur in  practice.  This research planning grant undertakes to develop a  comprehensive theory of well-founded orderings based on their  logical and numerical invariants.  Two specific directions for  further research are extending known results to larger classes of  terms, and obtaining similar results for more general well-  founded orderings, such as exponential orderings. As a further,  related line of inquiry, a theory of nontotal well-founded  orderings will be explored.  Since the notion of order type makes  no sense for nontotal orderings, appropriate logical invariants  will need to be determined.  ***",
