The  objective of this research is to  determine the significance in  environmental engineering practice  of the presence and viability of  the Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV) in wastewatep and following  various stages of treatment.  The  overall objective of work during  the renewal period is to continue  investigation of the viability of  the HIV in aqueous media and to  determine the effectiveness of  disinfectants for its inactivation.  The project will involve cell-  associated HIV survivability  studies, continued development of  methods for concentration and  recovery of cell-associated HIV in  wastewater following various stages  of treatment, optimization of the  concentration and assay procedures  and improvement in the detection  limits for indigenous cell-free  HIV.    The survival characteristics of the  HIV under environmental stresses  have not been well-established.  While there is no present  indication that environmental media  into which the virus is discharged  have any role in spreading it from  infected to non-infected  individuals, the virus has been  shown to survive for significant  periods of time in environmental  media.  The results of this  research are expected to provide  the basis for any changes, if any  are found to be needed, in the  engineering design of collection  systems, treatment processes and  systems for management of wastes  containing significant amounts of  this virus in the context of its  survival characteristics and  potential infectivity.  ***",
