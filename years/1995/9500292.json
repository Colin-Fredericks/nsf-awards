 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This project supports cooperative activity by Dr. David Brumbaugh, Department of Geology at Northern Arizona University, with Dr. Cemil Gurboz, and Dr. Niyazi Turkelli, both at the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake research Institute at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.  They will conduct studies on two earthquakes that occurred in Turkey, the Erzincan earthquake of March 1992 (Ms 6.8), and the Izmir earthquake of November 1992 (Ms 6.0).  The research will include a thorough analysis of the available data to study the crustal structure, aftershock sequence, and focal parameters for both earthquakes.  This analysis is expected to result in a better understanding of the characteristics of deep, non-surface rupturing, strike-slip earthquakes.  Scope:  This research collaboration involves four trips: an initial visit by Brumbaugh to Turkey, to provide the Turkish colleagues with a crustal model (using VELEST software), and to train them in its use for subsequent crustal modeling and aftershock analysis; one visit by the two Turkish scientists to the US, to transfer to the US team the results of the crustal modeling and to discuss the results of their work; and a final visit to Turkey by Brumbaugh to transfer information, discuss results, and to synthesize the results in a manuscript for publication.  All other costs, including living expenses and other research costs during the four trips are to be covered from other sources.  This project represents a good collaboration that meets INT objectives in utilizing complementary capabilities and sharing of research costs.",
