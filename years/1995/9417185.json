The general strategy is to  dissolve the reactants in a molten salt, and precipitate the  oxide product either by adjusting the acidity, by changing  the electrochemical potential, by supersaturating the melt  by melt decomposition, or by adding a precipitating agent.  This scheme, which is an alternative to more typical  reaction routes involving solid-state reactions at  relatively high temperatures (above 800 C), offers two key  advantages. First, low-temperature processing is desirable  for many applications of oxides, especially for the  formation of thin films for devices in which high-  temperature processing would destroy other components.  Second, new materials that are not stable at elevated  temperatures can be prepared. Specifically, the proposed  research is concerned with the use of molten alkali metal  and alkaline-earth metal hydroxides and nitrates for the  preparation of transition metal oxides with the metals in  high formal oxidation states. The chemistry of these two  melts will be explored in an effort to prepare: A) copper  oxides; B) rhodium oxides; and C) early transition metal  oxides. Interest in the copper and rhodium oxides stems from  the possibility of discovering new phases, potentially ones  that exhibit superconductivity. For the early transition  metal oxides, lowtemperature synthetic routes will be  designed to known phases that are electronic ceramics, and  potentially useful as device components.  %%%  Metal oxides, including most ceramics and cuprate  superconductors, generally are prepared by solid-state  reactions of reactant mixtures (e.g., metal oxides,  carbonates, oxalates, and/or nitrates). These mixtures can  be obtained by a variety of methods, including repeated  grinding, co-precipitation, or sputtering . Upon heating,  reactions occur due to solid-state diffusion. However,  beca use of high energies of activation, relatively high  temperatures (typically above 800 C) and long reaction times  are required to enhance homogeneity and ensure complete  reaction. As an alternative to this synthetic scheme, the  proposed research will explore low-temperature solution  routes to metal oxides involving the use of molten alkali  and alkaline-earth metal hydroxides and nitrates as  solvents. The utilization of fluxes for synthesis has become  a valuable technology, especially for the preparation of  high-quality single crystals and epitaxial films. These are  essential for many measurements of structure and physical  properties, and are",
