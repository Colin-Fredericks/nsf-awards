 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417199  Yen    This award supports the participation of eleven U.S. scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on Highly Confined and Extremely Diluted  Condensed Matter Systems, to be held at Kanagawa, Japan from  September 18-22, 1995.  The co-organizers ape Dr. William Yen of  the University of Georgia and Professor Eiichi Hanamura of the  University of Tokyo. This seminar is focus on the theory,  characterization, spectroscopy of highly confined and extremely  diluted condensed matter systems.  Topics to be covered include  ultrasensitive spectroscopies, single molecule/center spectroscopy,  low dimensional systems and nanostructures, and near field  microscopies.    The seminar will foster the type of contact between Japanese and  U.S. scientists that can be expected to have significant influence on  the future course of the field.  The proposed participants and  observers have been selected for their past contributions and  current activity in the field and the meeting can be expected to  produce concrete plans for future cooperation and exchange.   Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
