 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 16-day course offers 40 instructors of undergraduate marine  sciences in two-year and four-year institutions the opportunity to  update their knowledge and skills in a technologically impacted  discipline.  Participants will engage in hands-on field exercises  designed to familiarize them with current oceanographic research  techniques, many of which are adaptable to laboratory or classroom  demonstration at their home institutions.  Participants will work  with research scientists, college and university professors, and  experts in the private sector engaged in state-of-the-art  oceanographic investigations, technologies, or teaching.  Specific  aims of the project are to provide at-sea experience in  oceanographic data collection and analysis; to conduct field  exercises in local marine habitats; to gain exposure to advanced  technologies such as satellite imaging; to interact with experts in  marine science disciplines; and to develop new instructional  materials and teaching techniques. Hands-on field experience in the  areas of biological, physical, and geological oceanography will  allow participants to add breadth or depth as necessary to their  marine science training. This project is a joint effort of the  University of San Diego, a private four-year university, and the  Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District, a public two-year  institution.",
