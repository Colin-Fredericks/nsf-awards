 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides improvement of a semiconductor  manufacturing laboratory that provides industry-specific  microelectronics education for undergraduates.   To this end, the  Electronics Technology Department is obtaining three pieces of  semiconductor wafer testing equipment and a vacuum leak detector.    While geared in the main toward Electronics Technology students  and Core Electronics students, the laboratory affords new  capabilities for crossover electives and in-depth projects for  students in advanced courses in Manufacturing Technology,  Automation, Robotics, Telecommunications, Computer Maintenance,  Drafting and Design, Information Processing, and Industrial  Management.   With high technology used to teach high technology,  the semiconductor manufacturing lab emulates current trends in  industry and provides the students with the higher skill levels  required for success in this increasingly complex field.   The  new equipment is programmable, process-critical equipment that  allows students to make wafer tests and measurements usually  exclusively limited to small numbers of engineering students at  4-year degree schools.   They produce, from the first wafer  cleaning to the final electrical test, in real time in a  controlled M 4.5 (Class 1000) environment, integrated circuits  that differ from those produced in commercial fabs only in their  geometries.",
