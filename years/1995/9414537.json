 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414537  Schadler   Thermal spray coatings, an important \"enabling\" technology,   are widely used to enhance the performance of materials in a   diverse range of applications, including space vehicles, gas   turbines, chemical reactors, mills and rolls, bridges and medical   prostheses.  Metal, cermet, and ceramic coatings provide  protection against wear, corrosion and thermal degradation.  A  major limitation in thermal spray processing is the residual  stresses which develop in coatings during processing due to rapid   solidification and coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches.    Residual stresses generally increase as a function of coating   thickness.  When the magnitude of these stresses exceeds the   adhesive or cohesive strength of the coatings, the latter fails,   either by debonding from the substrate, spalling or cracking.    There is, however, an incomplete understanding of how to control   and minimize these residual stresses.  In order to deposit  thicker coatings and improve their corrosion and wear resistance,   therefore, a fundamental understanding of the effect of key   processing parameters and constituent phases on the residual   stresses must be obtained.  The project has three goals, all of   which will result in increased knowledge and understanding of the   processing science in thermal spray technology:   1) To calibrate  a nondestructive, but relatively simple, \"Almen\" bend test to  known absolute values of stress using x-ray stress analysis and  x-ray tensile testing techniques.   2) To determile the effect of  key process parameters (such as  particle velocity) on residual  stresses in coatings.  3) To understand the role of material  system and reinforcing phases, including their composition and  volume fraction, on residual stresses.  Both High Velocity  Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) combustion spray and plasma spray coatings will  be analyzed; analysis methods will include x-ray stress analysis  for residual stress measurements; optical microscopy,  microhardness and  x-ra y diffraction for coating   characterization; and sliding wear testing of the final coatings  to attempt to relate residual stress to coating performance.   The work promises to develop a non-destructive means for   directly measuring residual stresses in thermal spray coatings   which will be an effective tool for evaluating coating quality  and performance.  The work will also expand the thermal spray   processing science base by providing a better understanding of  the roles which processing parameters and second phase particles  play in generating and/or retaining residual stresses in  coatings.  Optimizing these conditions will eventually allow  thicker coatings, with improved properties, to be deposited, thus  overcoming a major barrier to expansion of thermal spray coatings  to many more potential applications.",
