 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423202  Kennedy  The overall objective of this project is to understand and  consequently to control the mechanism of cationic olefin  polymerizations, and thus to develop useful novel advanced  materials and processes of readily available monomers and  equipment, respectively; the elucidation of  structure/property relationships of the materials is an  integral part of the project.  This overall objective  embraces four major specific objectives:  1)  To explore the  fundamentals and to expand the scope of living carbocationic  polymerizations.  Studies will mainly focus on the  elucidation of the active living species, expansion to  branched olefins (3-methyl-1-butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene,  etc.) and conjugated dienes (butadiene, isoprene, etc.), and  dollowing up the recent discovery that mixed Friedel-Crafts  coinitiators yield living polymerization at temperatures  higher than ambient.  2)  To synthesize novel multi-arm star  polymers.  Seed research has shown that multi-arm radial  star polyisobutylenes can be made by living cationic  polymerization.  This lead will be pursued to include the  preparation of polymers with various molecular weights and a  study of viscosity characteristics.  3)  To prepare novel  statistical copolymers of aliphatic/aromatic olefins,  alkenes/conjugated dienes with controlled molecular weights  and microcompositions.  The stated objective could be  reached by a new technique the so-called Continuous  Controlled Copolymer Composition method. This lead will be  pursued for the preparation of new designed copolymers.  4)  To prepare new amphiphilic networks.  Specifically, efforts  will be made to prepare membranes with controlled  permeability characteristics and new networks that respond  to environmental stimuli (nature of solvent, pH).  %%%  This research is significant for the generation of basic  knowledge  needed for the preparation of new advanced  materials with desirable combinations of properties, and for  new multipurpose polymerization processes.  A mong possible  applications are motor-oil additives, thermoplastic  elastomers, and biomaterials.  ***",
