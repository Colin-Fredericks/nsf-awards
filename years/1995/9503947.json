 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503947  Abdurrahman    A neutron imaging system (NIS) will be developed at the Nuclear  Engineering Teaching Laboratory (NETL) of The University of  Texas at Austin.  The NIS consists of three subsystems:  (1)  Thomson neutron beam image intensifier tube sensitive to cold,  thermal, and epithermal neutrons, (2) real time image  processing unit consisting of vidicon camera, high resolution  monitor, image enhancement and measurement processor, and  printer, and (3) high performance workstation for image  storage, computed tomography, and system control.  The addition  of the proposed NIS to NETL existing facilities will provide a  powerful combination of capabilities to address a wide variety  of problems important to materials research.    The NIS is the key element in the development of neutron  computed tomography (NCT) for materials characterization.  Computed tomography refers to the cross-sectional imaging of an  object interior from transmission data collected from many  different directions.  The significance of this research  emanates from the growing need for nondestructive evaluation  techniques with desirable properties that neutron-based methods  provide, including high penetrability through metallic and  highly dense materials, and the neutrons inherent sensitivity  to elemental and isotopic variations of wide range of  materials, sample sizes, and geometries.  The ability of the  NIS to provide 2-D scans will also facilitate the investigation  and development of 3-D tomography.  The combination of NCT and  real time neutron imaging will open doors for new research in  areas of materials characterization and advanced industrial  processes, and will help promote and enhance collaboration with  industry and researchers in the field.    In addition, the NIS will be used in other research projects at  NETL.  A neutron focusing system has been developed for use  with the Texas cold neutron source (TCNS).  The NIS will  facilitate the alignment of the focusing system and will allow  the  determination of detailed system performance.  A prompt  gamma activation analysis (PGAA) facility is also being  developed for the TCNS.  PGAA is a nondestructive analytical  technique which is useful for major and minor elemental  analysis of materials.  The NIS will allow optimum positioning  of individual samples for PGAA measurements and will permit the  determination of neutron attenuation factors.  The NIS will  also be used as a spatial neutron detector for the small angle  neutron scattering (SANS) instrument and reflectometer being  developed.  SANS is used for analysis of polymers, colloids,  and ceramic precursors.  Neutron reflectometry is used for  analysis in surface chemistry studies and testing of thin  films.",
