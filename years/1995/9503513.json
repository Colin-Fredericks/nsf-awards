 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503513  Matheson    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the  Promotion of Science (JSPS) postdoctoral fellowship for Dr.  Julie M. Matheson, employed at the U.S. Naval Hospital,  Yokusuka, Japan. The fellowship opportunity will enable Dr.  Matheson to initiate collaborative research with Dr.  Katsuhiko Mikoshiba at the Institute of Physical and  Chemical Research in Japan (RIKEN), NHK Science and  Technical Research Laboratories, Tsukuba.  The goal of the  proposed research is to develope a fluorescent probe for  inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) that can be used to  investigate signal transduction pathways in single cells.  Cloning and expression of IP3 binding proteins will be done  in Dr. Mikoshiba's laboratory at RIKEN and microscopic  imaging will be done through a collaboration with Dr. Roger  Tsien at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the  University of California at San Diego (UCSD).  A similar  collaboration between Drs. R. Y. Tsien and S. Taylor at UCSD  led to the development of a fluorescent indicator for a  different cellular messenger, and this proposed project  provides  a logical bridge between the laboratories of R. Y.  Tsien and K. Mikoshiba.    The postdoctoral fellowship will allow Dr. Matheson  to  become familiar with research practices in Japan as well as  to establish professional contacts internationally.  It will  also provide access to unique research facilities and will  encourage international cooperation between U.S. and  Japanese scientists.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through international collaberation.",
