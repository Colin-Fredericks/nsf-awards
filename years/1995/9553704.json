Simundza                            DUE 9553704  Wentworth Inst of Tech                      FY1995 $ 499,951  Boston, MA  02115-5998                      Advanced Technological Education                                                  Title: Mathematics for Technology - Laboratory Investigations             Mathematics faculty at Wentworth Institute of Technology have  been employing active learning strategies characteristic of the  calculus reform movement at all levels of mathematics courses for  students of engineering technology since 1989.  This student  population is motivated primarily by perceived relevance of subject  matter to specific technical problems.         We propose to develop, through joint efforts of mathematics  and technical faculty, laboratory investigations using engineering  laboratories and multi-media simulations that will illustrate and  teach mathematical concepts.  The project will begin at the  intermediate algebra/trigonometry level and continue through  calculus.  50 sections per year, containing 1500 students, will be  affected at Wentworth.         Through an existing network of Tech Prep consortia, Wentworth  will take the lead in extending the secondary level \"integrated  curriculum\" reforms of Tech Prep to the college level.   Collaboration among faculty from Wentworth and neighboring colleges  and secondary schools involved in Tech Prep, as well as selected  industry personnel, will result in a series of workshops and  minicourses to disseminate materials and methods developed at  Wentworth to mathematics teachers at New England area institutions,  affecting a potential 25,000 Tech Prep students.         The Wentworth project will serve as a national model for  colleges of engineering technology in integrating the learning of  mathematics with technical applications.  Through the American  Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and the American  Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), a potential  100,000 additional students ma y ultimately be affected.",
