 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complete oceanographic Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD)  instrument package, a winged current meter, and two computers  equip a new vessel at the consortium.   With this new  oceanographic vessel, the instruments are used for undergraduate  courses in oceanography during summer sessions and weekend field  trips.   The basic unit in the new instrument package is a CTD  logger, which is battery powered and records data in solid-state  memory.   The CTD measurements provide depth profiles to identify  density differences between the surface photic layer and bottom  layer in local coastal waters.   Biological and chemical  variables are measured simultaneously by adding sensors to the  CTD for dissolved oxygen, turbidity (by optical backscattering),  photosynthetically active light (PAR), and chlorophyll biomass  (by in vivo fluorescence).   To measure tidal water exchange  through Chincoteague Inlet and thus determine fluxes of  chlorophyll, nutrients, and zooplankton biomass, the consortium  uses a Niskin winged current meter.   One laptop computer  initializes the CTD instrument package and provides data transfer  at sea, and one desktop computer interfaces winged current meter  and data analysis.   With these instruments, students learn  state-of-the-art research techniques to prepare them for graduate  school or employment as research technicians.   This project  enhances the marine science program at the consortium, through  which students at inland institutions are able to gain first hand  field experiences in oceanography.",
