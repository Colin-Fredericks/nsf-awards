Anaerobes make up  a significant portion of terrestrial bacteria and should be  considered as potential agents of bioremediation. However,  knowledge of these organisms, their diversity, taxonomy, and  metabolic capabilities, is still at a rudimentary level.  The  purpose of this project is to design an efficient, easy-to-use, instrumented test kit system that can be used both to study  the catabolic capabilities of anaerobes and to identify different  species of anaerobes based on these capabilities.  To develop this  kit,  the catabolic potential of over 300  species of anaerobes will be surveyed and cataloged against at least 300 different organic  compounds, including some important xenobiotic chemicals.  From  computer analysis of these data, a set of 95 carbon  source utilization tests will be selected to be incorporated into a commercial  microplate test kit.  The survey will provide an overview of the  range of catabolic activities of the anaerobes in question.  If successful, the  test kit system will be marketed commercially to microbiologists  doing environmental, industrial, and medical testing and  identification of anaerobes.",
