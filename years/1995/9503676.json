The participants  include nine senior scientists, two postdoctoral associates,  and one graduate student.  Organizers are Dr. Jean A.  Larson, University of Florida and  Dr. Carlos A. de Prisco,  Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas.  The  conference will focus on combinatorial set theory and its  applications.  It is designed to stimulate existing  collaborations and to initiate new projects between  researchers in the U.S. and Venezuela.    Combinatorial Set Theory is at the heart of modern day set  theory.  The techniques and constructions developed to look  at the basic structure of the universe of sets also find  applications to other areas of mathematical logic and to  algebra, topology and analysis.  While progress in certain  areas of algebra and topology have long been closely tied to  set theory, recently the range of applications has broadened  to include such areas as harmonic analysis and the braid  group in topology.  This meeting will seek to build on those  trends and stimulate individuals who may be working in  increasingly narrow specializations.    Besides support from the NSF and the Venezuelan National  Council for Science and Technology (CONICIT), the Caribbean  Mathematics Foundation will support expenses for  participants from the European Union and from other parts of  Latin America.    ***",
