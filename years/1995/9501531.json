 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501531  BAUER    Organic carbon pools will be studied at two open ocean sites that  reflect potential differences in carbon cycling and transformations  in polar and temperate regions.  Carbon isotopic signatures   ( 14C, 13C) and concentrations of dissolved, colloidal and  particulate organic carbon (DOC,COC,POC) will be measured at  Station M in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and in the Antarctic Ocean  south of the Indian Ocean.  The following carbon pools will be  studied: ultra-violet and high-temperature catalytically-oxidizable  fractions of DOC (DOCuv and DOChtc), suspended and sinking POC  (POCsusp and POCsink), COC specific organic constituents (total  hydrolyzable amino acids  THAA , total carbohydrates  TCHO , total  lipids) of suspended and sinking POC and of COC, detrital  aggregates on the seafloor, marine snow, and dissolved inorganic  carbon (DIC).    The following questions will be addressed: 1) Do the  14C profiles  in Antarctic DOC, POCsusp, and COC support the hypothesis that deep  DOC is transported quasi-conservatively through the world's deep  ocean? 2) How does the lateral transport of shelf/slope derived  organic matter to the deep sea change with time and what is the  extent of adsorption of DOC onto POCsusp and POCsink in the water  column? 3) From what depths do specific organic constituents of the  COC,POCsink, and POCsusp, originate and how are they recycled?   4) What are the sources of carbon to detrital aggregates and marine  snow, and are the labile, surface-derived compounds utilized  exclusively during remineralization? 5) What is the overall labile  and refractory nature of DOC with respect to its heterotrophic  utilization, and what does the  14C signature of microheterotrophic  biomass reveal about the assimilation of DOC/COC/POC in the deep  ocean?",
