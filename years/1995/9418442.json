 "awd_abstract_narration": "Delong  9418442  Archaebacteria are an evolutionarily distinct group of  prokaryotes.  Until very recently, archaebacteria were thought to  thrive only in a few disparate niches, consisting of either very  hot, very salty, or strictly anaerobic environments.  Recent  studies show that pelagic marine archaebacteria can constitute a  major fraction (>30%) of Antarctic prokaryote biomass in coastal  waters off Palmer Station, Antarctica.  Since surface waters off  Palmer Station have yielded the highest biomass estimates of  pelagic archaebacteria to date, this area is uniquely suited for  studing these unusual microorganisms.  The main objective of the  proposed work is to characterize the ecological significance,  distribution and aboundance, and the metabolic and physiological  activities, of pelagic marine archaebacteria in coastal waters  off Anvers Island, Antarctica.  Molecular biological techniques  will be used to quantify the spatial and temporal abundance and  variability of Antarctic marine archaebacterial species.  Highly  sensitive, semiautomated methods will be developed to quantify  archaebacterial group and species-specific ribosomal RNA and DNA  in field samples.  To better understand their physiological  activities, methods employing \"kingdom-specific\" metabolic  inhibitors will be used to estimate the contribution of pelagic  archaebacteria to total prokaryotic heterotrophic activity.  The  project will provide information on the seasonal and  spatial variability of pelagic Antarctic archaebacteria, which  can comprise a major fraction of Antarctic coastal prokarytoic  biomass.  Finally, this project will also enhance understanding of  the biogeochemical activities and ecological roles of these  abundant \"archaeoplankton\" in coastal Antarctic waters, and may  provide clues as to their specific adaptations to the unique  Antarctic environment.",
