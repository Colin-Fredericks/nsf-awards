 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study reinforced random walk. If a fair  coin is flipped repeatedly and X(n) represents the number of  heads in the first n flips minus the number of tails in the first  n flips, the sequence of integers X(1), X(2),... is called fair  random walk. Reinforced random walk is constructed in a similar  manner except that if X(n) is the maximum price seen so far then  the coin which determines X(n+1)-X(n) has probability p<1/2 of  coming up heads, while if X(n) is a record minimum the coin has  probability 1-p, which of course exceeds 1/2, of coming up heads.  In words, this walk is fair random walk with partial reflection  back to previously assumed values at records. The fact that the  history {X(1),X(2),..X(n)} of the process is needed to determine  the probability of the next jump means that reinforced random  walk is not a Markov process, and renders the vast theory of such  processes inapplicable. The investigator has shown that X(n)  divided by the square root of n converges in distribution as n  goes to infinity. He hopes to refine this result, for example by  identifying the limiting distributions, and to prove its analog  for the related processes which have probability greater than one  half of setting new records, if they are at a record. Oddly, this  situation will require very different methods. In another  direction, the investigator will use Brownian motion to study  positive solutions of the Dirichlet heat equation in planar  domains, more specifically to find geometrical properties of the  shape of the domain which determine or ensure that the ratio of  any two solutions at any positive time is bounded throughout the  domain, above and below, by positive constants, a property which  is called intrinsic ultracontractivity of the Dirichlet heat  semigroup.  The investigator will study reinforced random walk. Suppose the  price of a stock always changes by one dollar. Track the price  after the first price change, the second, the third, and so on.  Fair random wal k models this under the assumption that each  change is equally likely to be plus one dollar or minus one,  regardless of all earlier changes. Reinforced random walk behaves  the same way except when the current price is a record high, in  which case the next change is more likely to be down, or when the  current price is a record low, in which case the next change is  more likely to be up. That is, the walk shies away from setting  records. It is a primitive model of a buy-low-sell-high market.  It is less tractable than fair random walk because the past price  fluctuations are used to determine the probabilities of the next  step being plus one or minus one. The investigator has recently  shown how the average net change in price behaves after a large  number of changes, namely he has shown that it is on the order of  the square root of the number of changes. He will try to refine  this result and to prove a companion theorem for the related  class of processes which like to set records. In another  direction, probabilistic methods will be used to study how a flat  metal plate cools, if it looses heat only out the edges, which  are held at absolute zero, more specifically how the shape of the  plate influences this cooling.",
