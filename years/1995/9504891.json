Such restrictions occur frequently in survival   analysis. For example, if a clinical trial involves administering   a drug in increasing doses to the cohorts under study, then the   survival curves computed for each group should be ordered according to  dose level. In linkage analysis, for the purpose of   mapping a quantitative genetic trait, it may be known that the trait under  study  is more prevalent for one genotype than for others.    Although appropriate estimators in these settings   are known, their distributional properties have not been studied.   Thus, order restricted methods are often not used when it would   potentially help the data analysis.  For estimation purposes it would  give estimators with higher degree of accuracy.   For testing purposes it would give higher power to be able  to consider order restricted alternatives.        The research centers on investigating statistical methods in the   presence of order restrictions. These restrictions occur often in   biotechnological problems.  For instance, in a clinical trial to  determine drug efficacy, it is often the case that the drug is   administered in increasing doses. In genetical linkage analysis    it is often known that a certain genotype lowers the time until the  onset of a disease more than do other possible genotypes. If the   interest is on determining the drug efficacy (in the first case)  or finding out where the gene is located (second case), then the   statistical methods, which separate the noise in the data from the   signal, must incorporate these known orderings. The investigators  study ways of incorporating such information. They believe that   the resulting statistical method ology will be more appropriate   than present methods for dealing  with biotechnological data   where such orderings are present.",
