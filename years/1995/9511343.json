The first part of the project employs natural  variation in cohort size within school districts to analyze the  effects of class size on student performance in this way avoiding  many criticisms of the existing literature on the productivity of  school inputs.  The second part of the project extends a  substantial literature on the effects of school finance  centralizations on average public school per-pupil spending in a   state in a new direction.  This project examines the effect of  centralization on school productivity, or student performance and  per-pupil inputs.  This new line of research is timely and  important because from 1972-92, 36 states centralized school  finance to some degree, twelve by court order. The third and  final part of the project studies how the emergence of a national  college market, with schools drawing students from across the  nation or within a several-state region, affects the  characteristics of the college attended by a given student and  the value of the student s college degree.    School-based results on the effects of alass size typically  suffer from an omitted variables problem: the student-teacher  ratio is endogenous to unobserved student characteristics.   Results based on aggregate (state-wide) data have untenable  identifying restrictions and suffer from aggregation bias.  The  first part of this project makes use of the fact that school  districts with populations under 25,000 have natural year-to-year  variation in cohort size.  Because teachers are relatively  indivisible and grade-specific, schools cannot perfectly re-  allocate resources so as to equalize class sizes between  different sized cohorts.  The strategy uses panel data on  Connecticut school districts, and instruments for the change in  class size between succeeding cohorts with the change in cohort  size.      The second part of the project analyzes sixteen recent (1977-87)   reforms th at increase school finance centralization at the state   level.  For each district, Census of Governments data are used to  categorize the change in the tax-price of marginal local school  spending as a result of the reform.  These vary from no change to  extremely large increases in the case of districts that have  reached maximum spending levels in their states.  The project  develops and tests empirically a model in which a high tax-price   of local school spending decreases school productivity (student  performance for inputs) because it weakens mechanisms by which  less productive schools are made more productive.",
