We  chose  this  topic  to  highlight  the  significance of these  materials  to  fundamental  chemistry   and  to  technology.   Although  the  chemistry   and  significance  of  oxides is well known to the chemical  community  and well represented by a plethora of ACS and other symposia,  in  general  non-oxides  such as chalcogenides,  halides,  pnictides,  borides,  carbides and intermetallics have received  very  little  attention,  especially in ACS symposia.  These  materials  impact  both  our understanding of fundamental chemical science  and  our  technological  progress in a major way.  Little  is  known  about  these materials, and an ACS symposium will help in projecting the  important  issues and problems in this area to a broad  chemistry  audience and particularly to students and young researchers.  The  proposed  symposium  is very timely given the  continuing  strong  interest in the properties of these compounds which include  non-  linear   optics   (chalcogenide,   pnictides,   superconductivity  (borides), rechargeable batteries (hydrides), oxygen storage  and  transport (cyanides) and others.  Emphasis will be given  to  new  synthetic   techniques,  measurement  and  characterization   and  processing of non-oxidic solids.  %%%  To  the  best of our knowledge, this is the first symposium  that  focuses specifically on non-oxide solid state materials.  ***",
