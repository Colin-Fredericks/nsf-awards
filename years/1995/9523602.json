 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program revolves around three different but  related projects in discrete choice modeling and estimation.  The common theme is the modeling of consumer choice  behavior, and the estimation of models of consumer behavior  on revealed preference data sets.  With the availability of  electronic scanner panel data, choice models have become  very important for understanding consumer behavior.  For  example, such models may be used to evaluate the impact of  the marketing mix on consumer purchasing behavior, and to  assess the patterns of competition in the market place.  The  three research projects in this study involve the use of  recently developed simulation estimation techniques.  In the  model of the first project, consumer choice probabilities  are high dimensional integrals over unobserved prices and  coupon values, as well as over stochastic preference shocks.  Thus, Monte-Carlo methods must be used to simulate the  likelihood function in the model.  In the second and third  projects, both solution of the dynamic programming problem  and construction of the likelihood function require high  dimensional integrations over stochastic process for prices,  preference shocks, etc.  In these projects we will use Monte-  Carlo methods both to solve consumers' dynamic programming  problems and to simulate the likelihood function.",
