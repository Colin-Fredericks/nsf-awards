 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York/College at Old Westbury's Summer  Science Camp (SSC) will systemically improve the math and science  performance of students from underrepresented and undeserved  populations.  As in the past, SSC will serve as a crucial link in  the science and mathematics \"pipeline\" by providing summer programs  for 7th and 8th graders in preparation for entry to the highly  successful Science and Technology Entry Program (STEP).  For 8  years, STEP has offered summer and academic year programs for over  one thousand two hundred minority high school students.    The four week summer camp operates at two levels for fifty middle  schools students, accommodating their various stages of academic  preparation.  They receive intensive instruction in language,  mathematics, computer science and analytical skills, especially  useful in developing research oriented science projects.  Science  career opportunities are explored through activities such as field  trips to industries, government laboratories and college research  labs, complete with pre-tour briefing, post-tour evaluations and  informal meetings with scientistq, and with mentoring by  college/role models.  Group workshop strategies for reinforced  learning, motivation through team competitions, a supportive  environment, experienced staff and carefully chosen courses  tailored to students' needs are key elements in our SSC program.   Ancillary programs are used for developing students' positive  attitudes towards science, mathematics, engineering and technology  (SMET) careers, for increasing their academic confidence and for  encouraging parent participation in education.  Follow-up  activities during the school year are maintained by the New York  state support STEP program.    SSC's past success can be measured by the overwhelming numbers of  applications, the near-perfect student participation with a  completion rate of 98 and 92 percent for the past two summers, the  high level of continuation in the summer and academic  year  programs, high level of interest and continued study of mathematics  and science, and their academic achievements in the schools.  This  proposed three-year SSC reapplication benefits from the experiences  gained from past SSC and STEP program, offered during the summer  and academic years.  ***",
