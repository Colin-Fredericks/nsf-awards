 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concepts of separations and structure are enhanced in the  chemistry curriculum at all levels by the purchase of a GC/MS.   The GC/MS allows the study of more interesting and relevant  topics (such as pesticides in the environment or drug testing),  making chemistry more accessible to a wider range of students.    Use of the GC/MS provides chemistry majors with experience in an  increasingly important technique.   These goals are achieved by  beginning with simple experiments in General Chemistry that are  designed to provide the students with training on the GC/MS while  demonstrating the power of its analytical capabilities.    Students analyze compounds extracted from candy or chewing gum  and identify the major flavorants.   The concepts of atomic  structure are reinforced by studying the natural distribution of  isotopes.   In Organic Chemistry, students use the GC/MS in a  more sophisticated manner when they obtain data to study the  linear free energy relationship in the fragmentation of  substituted benzophenones and acetophenones.   This experiment  reinforces the concepts of inductive and resonance effects that  are discussed in class.   They also use the GC/MS to obtain  kinetic data for the free radical chlorination reaction.   These  experiments underscore to the students and help them better  understand the importance of kinetics and thermodynamics in the  study of organic reaction mechanisms.   In Analytical Chemistry,  students learn the special consequences of using a hyphenated  technique to quantitatively analyze trace levels of organics.    Students continue to use the GC/MS in upper-level courses to  study the structure of compounds, to study the separation of  complex mixtures, and to obtain data for the study of reaction  mechanisms.   The instrument enhances special topics courses and  student research projects.",
