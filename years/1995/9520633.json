 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at Columbia University acquire an AC-80 NMR spectrometer that will operate as a  multiuser steady state (SS) and time resolved (TR) instrument for the detection of chemically  induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP).  The Principal Investigators will employ the  instrument to investigate, by multinuclear  (1H, 13C, 31P) SS-CIDNP and TR-CIDNP, the  mechanisms of diverse photochemical systems including (1) the reactions of organic radical  ions produced by photosensitized electron transfer; (2) the photochemistry of phosphites  and phosphine oxides; (3) the measurement of exit rates of radicals, produced by photolysis  of ketone from micelles as a function of micelle size and radical structure; (4) the  photosensitized cleavage of thymine dimers in systems that model photoinduced repair of  damaged DNA; (5) a search for CIDNP in oriented biological macromolecular solids; and  (6) time resolved CIDNP of biradicals produced by photolysis of cyclic ketones.    In addition to the research described above, the instrumentation will be used by undergraduates  in advanced organic chemistry laboratories, in physical-analytical laboratories, in research  project laboratories, in senior research and in summer undergraduate research.  The instrument  will be coupled into an \"electronic smart classroom\" containing state-of-the-art multimedia  facilities to allow students and faculty to introduce data directly from experiments into lecture,  recitation and discussion groups on demand.  Finally, the computer interface will be employed  to produce modules that will simulate important NMR experiments and will be accessible to  students on their own personal computers through ColumbiaNet.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify  unknown  substances, characterize specific arra ngements of atoms within molecules, and to  study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art  NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The  results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in  biology.",
