 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523267  Karady  Insulator contamination cases frequent flashovers near coastal  and industrial areas.  This problem occurs in transmission lines  as well as in substations.  Currently, there are no reliable  methods available for monitoring pollution build-up and  predicting imminent flashover.  The aim of this project is to  develop a sensor system that monitors pollution build-up and that  would alert operators when there is danger of flashover.    Preliminary laboratory studies were performed at ASU and  discharge current signatures were analyzed using the Fast Fourier  Transform (FFT).  Visual manifestations were recorded  simultaneously with the current signature.  It was found that  surface discharges have distinct stages of development.  Although  the amplitude of current changes continuously, the harmonic  content (signature) consistently indicated the status of  discharge.  It was observed that approaching flashover modifies  the harmonic content.  These findings suggest that flashover can  be predicted by signature analysis of the leakage current.    The concept is to select an exposed insulator in each area and  monitor the leakage current through the insulator.  The leakage  current will be digitized and signature analysis will be  performed.  A change in signature indicates approaching  flashover.    First, different signature analysis methods will be tested in a  laboratory to determine which one produces reliable flashover  indication.  After the method is identified and tested, a sensor  system will be built to perform this signature analysis  continuously.  It is foreseen that the system will include a  broad-band (20Hz-100kHz) currently sensor, a microprocessor and a  transmitter.  Leakage current will be continuously digitized and  50-100 cycles will be put in temporary storage.  The stored data  will be analyzed and if no signature change occurs, the data will  be discarded.  A signature change will trigger a transmitter that  will alert an operator.  Different levels of ala rm will be used.  ***",
