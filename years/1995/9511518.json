 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511518  Hamm    Every 20th century U.S. state legislative chamber has organized  its work and completed its tasks by assigning members to smaller  work groups--standing committees.  As one would expect, this  prominent role for committees in the legislative process has  attracted the attention of citizen, press and academic observers.    For example, writing in 1931, it was demonstrated that committee  action was the final action for more than 90 percent of bills  introduced in the Maryland Senate and House during the 1927  legislative session.    Among the themes dominating political scientists' analysis of  legislative committees from a functional perspective has been  their growth in specialization and use as a means for \"division  of labor\" in a chamber.  Based on earlier work and using  organization theory literature, several propositions regarding  specialization in legislative committees are developed in this  research investigation.  The purpose of the current research is  to allow the investigators to:  posit a model of the causes of  committee specialization; complete the collection of a data base  on specialization indicators for American state legislative  committees; analyze the data base resulting from these efforts  using regression analysis; identify study states for collecting  committee performance data from this analysis; posit a model of  the consequences of committee specialization for committee  performance in policy and program formulation; initiate the  collection of legislative performance data relevant to evaluating  the effects of committee specialization; analyze the data base  resulting from these efforts using path analysis; and, prepare  written reports and the data base for subsequent distribution.    This project promises to substantially enhance our understanding  of the topic of this research.  ***",
