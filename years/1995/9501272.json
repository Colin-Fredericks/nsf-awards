Two categories of experiments  are  planned.  The  first involves measurements of interlayer coupling  and  dynamics  of  vortex  lines  and Jospphson vortices  in  layered  high  temperature  superconductors. The second category  involves  transport  and  radio  frequency spectral response measurements of  inhomogeneous  non-linear  superconducting  media,  including  measurements  of  two-  dimensional  granular  composite films and of phase  correlations  and  fluctuations in Josephson junction arrays.  %%%  This  project is a two-part program of experimental basic research  on  the  electronic  properties of high temperature  superconductors,  and  also  on  the  properties  of microcircuit arrays  of  superconducting  tunnel junctions. In the first project, the research will explore  the  response of high temperature superconductors to magnetic fields,  with  the  ultimate  foal  of explaining the underlying physical  principles  that  determine  their  technical and  scientific  applicability.  The  second  project  will  investigate  microcircuits  of  superconducting  tunnel junctions, in part to elucidate fundamental physical principles  and  in  part  to  determine the potential usefulness  in  electronics  applications that require extreme sensitivity.  ***",
