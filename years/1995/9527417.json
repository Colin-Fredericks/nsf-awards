 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is investigating the inherent performance problems  associated with object-oriented code execution.  Traces are being  captured from a number of object-oriented programming environments.   A workload Characterization is being performed to identify the  underlying problems presented by this new programming model.   Architectural changes are then proposed to improve the execution  performance of object-oriented code.  This research is  investigating architectural changes to the hardware that will  improve performance across all programming environments.  As more  and more software is developed using object-oriented languages,  this research will have a direct impact on accelerating the  performance of future applications.    The educational part of this project is concerned with making  improvements in the Computer Engineering curriculum, student  advising tools, classroom computer aids, and undergraduate research  courses.",
