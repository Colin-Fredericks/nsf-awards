 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER research program is to determine the effects of ion beam  bombardment on the magnetic and electrical properties of evaporated Permalloy-nitrogen-iron thin  films. The electrical, magnetoresistive and magnetic properties of the films are measured as a  function of ion species, flux and energy, substrate temperature, and post-deposition annealing  treatment.  The microstructure of the films is characterized and correlated to the electrical and  magnetic properties.  This research is a collaborative project with IBM Almaden Research Center.   The  educational objectives include course and curriculum development in electronic, optical and magnetic  materials, as well as undergraduate and graduate research supervision, advising, and educational  outreach.  The curriculum development efforts are focused on an interdisciplinary course sequence for  electrical and materials engineering students in electronic materials processing in a team-based,  open-ended design laboratory setting. %%% Ion beam bombardment during electron beam evaporation of  Permalloy films is used to imp rove the magnetoresistive response of films used in magnetoresistive  read heads in magnetic disk drives.                          ;",
