 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to initiate a study of plant  resistance to aphids in a system consisting of tomato  (Lycopersicon esculentum) and the potato aphid (Macrosiphum  euphorbiae).  Dr. Williamson has recently described a tomato  gene, Meul, that confers resistance to potato aphid.  Meul  is tightly linked to Mi, a single, dominant locus that is  present in some tomato lines and mediates resistance to root-  knot nematodes.  Mi-mediated nematode resistance is  associated with a localized necrosis in the root within 24  hours of penetration by the nematode.  The mechanism of Meul-  mediated resistance to aphids has not yet been studied in  detail.  Preliminary observations, and comparison to the  nematode resistance, suggest that specific recognition of  the aphid by the plant is involved in the initial step of a  signal transduction cascade that leads to localized necrosis  and production of defense compounds.  This would represent  the first example of this mechanism of plant resistance to  an insect.  This proposal seeks to establish the groundwork  for a future proposal on characterizing the recognition  mechanism and signal transduction pathway of plant response  to aphid.",
