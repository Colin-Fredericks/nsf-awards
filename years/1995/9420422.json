 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420422  Hannah  Can transposable elements give rise to functional introns? This  laboratory has recently demonstrated that the maize transposable  element, dissociation (ds) and one copy of the duplicated host  sequence can be spliced precisely from the from the primary  transcript. In effect, the Ds element has created an intron. A  working model of the \"intron-late\" hypothesis has thus been created  and will be tested and characterized by determining the effects of  surrounding sequences on Ds splicing, determining the sequence  requirements of the 8 bp host duplication on Ds splicing,  determining whether fit to consensus of exon/intron borders is  needed for Ds splicing and determining whether the Ds-turned intron  confers any change on the gene.   %%%  A controversy exists as to whether introns, sequences which  although transcribed from the DNA of (primarily) eukaryotic cells  are spliced out to create a functional message, were created early  in evolutionary history and served the purpose of providing  flexibility in the creation of genes by providing \"movable  cassettes\" or whether they are simply sequences which have been  randomly inserted into genes late in evolutionary history and serve  no functional purpose. The characterization of a known and well  described transposable element in corn as a newly created intron  would lend support to the \"intron-late\" theory.     ***",
