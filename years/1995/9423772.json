The  project is headed on the US side by Paul  Grannis, Stony Brook with coPI, Hugh  Montgomery, Fermilab.  The cooperating Indian  scientist is Dr. Ram Shivpuri, Director of the  Centre for Detector and Related Software  Technology.  The Delhi group has extensive  experience with the study of quark and gluon  structure, with detectors, and have the  computational techniques required for particle  physics studies.  They also have a strong  capability with the design of software systems  for offline computer analysis of data.  Scope:  The collaboration brings technical  capabilities from India, as well as equipment  provided from Indian sources, to   allow participation with American scientists in  the particle physics studies carried out at  Fermilab.  This is a unique opportunity for the  Indian participants to work on high energy  experiments at one of the world's most powerful  accelerators.  On March 3, 1995, Fermilab  announced the discovery of the TOP quark by  this group of high energy physicists.      ***",
