 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Andrew L. Feig  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Feig received his doctoral degree from the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor   Stephen Lippard.  Dr. Feig will continue research at the University of   Colorado at Boulder under the sponsorship of Professor Olke Uhlenbeck.    His postdoctoral research will target understanding the interactions   between metal ions and hammerhead ribozymes.  The goal is to understand   how metal ions catalyze hydrolysis reactions while bound to small RNAs   and to develop methodologies to differentiate structural versus catalytic   metal centers.  The work underpins a long term study of the reaction   mechanism of peptide transfer based on a metallo-RNA active site.   The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
