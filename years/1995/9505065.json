The reparameterization research develops  methodology that identifies parameterizations for a wide class of  statistical models for which normal approximations to the likelihood  function and posterior density are accurate.  Parameterization  diagnostics based on measures of non-normality are used to identify  well-behaved parameterizations and to derive sample sizes sufficient  for reliable inference based on asymptotic normality for many  commonly-used parameterizations.  The hierarchical modeling component  of the research compares and unifies models for longitudinal data,  including Markov chain models, hierarchical mixed effects models, and  fully Bayesian hierarchical models.  Estimation, prediction and design  issues are addressed, and special consideration is given to the  incorporation of random changepoints in these models.       This research studies statistical models which may be uqed  for  processes such as the basis of a feed-forward controller for many of today's  complex manufacturing processes.  Because exact inference can be very  difficult in these complicated models, scientists often resort to the  simplification of summary results which are implicitly understood in   the context of normality (i.e., the bell curve).  The first component of this research   studies procedures for determining when this simplification is misleading and   presents alternative statistical models.   This research will  lead to increased numerical   efficiency in fitting these complex models, permitting more timely response to  changing processes.  The second component of this research studies models for  longitudinal data.  These models are needed when the data consist of  serial mea surements within individuals for a number of individuals.    Such data arise in a wide range of applications, from reliability studies to economic   indicators to health monitoring.  The research compares and unifies a number of  models for longitudinal data, and addresses estimation, prediction and  design issues.  Special consideration is given to the incorporation of  random changepoints in these models (i.e., points in time where the process  exhibits some serious change in behavior).  The   changepoints may represent onset of disease, critical part fatigue, or   changes in consumer behavior.  The research studies how longitudinal   models may be used in a dynamic fashion to detect these changepoints quickly.",
