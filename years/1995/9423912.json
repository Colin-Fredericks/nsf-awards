 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423912  Ramakrishna    This REU Site award provides an opportunity for twelve  undergraduate students to work with faculty members in the  Departments of Chemistry/Biochemistry,  Chemical/Bio/Materials Engineering, Electrical Engineering,  Physics/Astronomy and Mechanical Engineering on  multidisciplinary materials research projects involving the  use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) during a ten week  summer period.  ***  This program is designed to serve as a magnet to bring  together undergraduate students from different disciplines,  ethnic backgrounds and from institutions where research  programs are limited.  It will not only provide students  with an opportunity to get involved in various aspects of  SPM in material research, but also to get acquainted with  present and future needs of the high technology industry and  thus help prepare them for the imminent revolution in nano  science, engineering and technology. This program is built  on the unique strengths of Arizona State University in SPM  interdisciplinary research, commitment to excellence in  undergraduate education through federally sponsored programs  such as the interdisciplinary undergraduate program in  Materials Science, the undergraduate SPM laboratory course  initiative and Coalition to Increase Minority Degrees,  intimate contact with industry via the SPM Industrial  Associates Program and a close working relationship with the  Maricopa Community College System.  The SPM REU site program  is expected to have a positive impact on the quality of  science and engineering research experience, in particular,  and education in general at the local, regional and national  levels.",
