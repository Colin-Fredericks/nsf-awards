 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522195  Quate  The proposal by Prof. Quate addresses a fundamental issue in nanoscience and engineering, namely, the fabrication of nanostructure electronic devices with a novel anomic-force-microscopy (AFM)-based nanolithographic technique.  The proposal uses the concept of 'direct writing' with AFM tips with an innovative approach to building sub 0.1 pm devices and , thereby, open the door to exciting new devices research in the next century.  Parenthetically, if we allow the SIA roadmap, then device dimensions are predicted for 700 nm c hannel lengths by the year 2010 and the proposal by Quite leads in this direction.  The problem of manufacturing through is addressed with the use of MEMS technology to form an array of parallel proximal silicon probes (i.e.  AFM tips on cantilever beams) which are controlled by integrated piezoelectric ZnO actuators on a piezoresisitive cantilever.  The high electric field which is produced by the proximity of the AFM probe tip up to the semiconductor surface causes bound protons to be released under the tip with subsequent field-enhanced oxidation.  This subsequently serves as an etchant mask to transfer a nanolithograph pattern into the underlying semiconductor.  This work is highly revolutionary and visionary.  The basic element of and adaptively controlled 'nanowriter' is the component for this instrument research and should be well understood before moving to a large matrix array of similar elements.  ***",
