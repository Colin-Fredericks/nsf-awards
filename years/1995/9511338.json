 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511338  Phillis  The establishment of the distinct identities of individual neurons  represents a fundamental step in the development of the diverse  array of neurons that make up a mature nervous system. During this  process, individual nerve cells develop distinct properties  including characteristic anatomy, physiology, and patterns of  connectivity.  However, the mechanisms that confer neuronal  identity are just beginning to be understood. The goal of this  research is to investigate the role of a newly discovered gene in  the establishment of neuronal identity in the invertebrate  peripheral nervous system.  Mutations in this gene affect behavior  and the morphology of adult sensory organs. In addition, these  mutations have the ability to enhance the phenotype of mutations in  another gene that is a regulatory gene required to confer proper  identity to external sensory organs. If function in this gene is  lost, the mechanosensory bristles are transformed in their identity  and acquire characteristics of internal stretch receptors. When  mutations are present in both genes, there is an interaction that  results in the loss of nearly all of the mechanosensory bristles  from adults.   The effects of mutations in the gene under study on sensory organ  development will be investigated using several genetic and  immunological markers specific to certain types of sensory organs.  This analysis will determine whether mutations in the gene result  in a transformation of sensory organ identity.  The gene will also  be cloned and sequenced to determine the pattern of its expression  and the structure of its protein product.  Finally, an ectopic  expression system for the gene will constructed to determine  whether expression in specific subsets of sensory organs affects  their development. The data from these investigations will provide  fundamental insights into the genetic mechanisms that function in  the development and differentiation of the peripheral nervous  system.",
