 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, involves the continued study of the  fundamentals of enhanced fluidity liquid chromatography. Enhanced-fluid mobile phases are developed by adding  large portions of compressible fluids such as carbon dioxide to typical liquid chromatography eluants at elevated  temperatures. The result is the generation of higher efficiency and faster separations similar to those exhibited in  supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Professor Susan Olesik and her students at Ohio State University will  characterize the macroscopic and microscopic properties of enhanced fluid mixtures at various temperatures and  pressures using viscosity, density, diffusion coefficient, solvent strength, and solute partial molar volume  measurements. These solvent combinations will also be applied in reverse-phase, normal-phase, and size exclusion  chromatographies. In addition, this technology will be used in the development of a novel chromatographic technique  coined `liquid adsorption critical chromatography` (LACC), which is applied to the determination of polymer  functional group distribution.  Liquid chromatography (LC) is one the most widely used analytical methods in industry and during its advent  supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was thought capable of incorporating the power and applications of LC  and gas chromatography into one technique. However this was not found to be so, with the major disadvantage  being the poor ability of supercritical fluids to dissolve polar analytes. Prof. Olesik has conceived of a new twist  on the use of supercritical fluids to yield mobile phases capable of dissolving a much wider range of analytes with  a significant enhancement in the efficiency and speed of separations over that exhibited by the traditional liquid  chromatographic techniques.",
