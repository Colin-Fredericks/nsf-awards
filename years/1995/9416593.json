Despite this importance,  little is known about the Cenozoic history of P fluxes to and from  the ocean.  The three main objectives of this research are: (1) to  understand the controls on P accumulation rates in Cenozoic marine  sediments, and (3) to interpret these P accumulations rate  variations using mass balance models.  Measurements of P  geochemical distributions in marine sediments will use established  sequential extraction techniques which differentiate five  sedimentary P components; four of these are burial sinks for  dissolved, reactive P and the fifth is detrital P.  P accumulation  rates will be calculated from total reactive P concentration  measurements.  Total P concentration measurements will also be  applied, by shorter analytical methods, to the determination of P  accumulation rates where it has been demonstrated that  detrital P  is a negligible contribution to total P.  Sites to be studied  to  understand the controls on P accumulation rates include depth  transects of sites with similar surface water productivity ,  latitudinal transects of sites along a gradient of productivity,   and sediments of different  lithologies.  Sites for the  documentation of temporal variations in P accumulation rates in  Cenozoic marine sediments will be selected to ensure geographic  coverage of regions significant in terms of global productivity and  sediment accumulation (including the equatorial regions of the  Atlantic and Pacific, the high latitude North Pacific, and the  Southern Ocean).  Interpretation of the Cenozoic record of P  accumulation will be linked to other geochemical records of ocean   history, such as strontium and carbon isotopes.   This work will  yield substantial insights into the variations in P fluxes to and  from the oceanic reservoir over long time scales.",
