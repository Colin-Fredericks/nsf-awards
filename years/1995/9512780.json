 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512780  Xu    Modern information technology has reduced the distance between  American and Chinese colleagues in terms of scholarly  exchanges,and it is predictable that a lot more future scholarly  communication between the two parties will occur through the  international computer network or information highway.  Language  barriers present severe problems in communication because the  Chinese language is incomprehensible to the majority of American  colleagues and most Chinese people do not speak English.   Bilingual (English-Chinese) database management systems provide a  solution to overcome the language barrier because such systems  can simultaneously present the same piece of information in two  language formats, while archiving the original data without  distortion.  Co-funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation  (#INT9312146) and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation  (#39410121144), a prototype of English-Chinese botanical database  system has been developed by the investigators of this proposal,  and a sample of bilingual collection data from Sun Yatsen  University herbarium (SYS) has been made on line through the  Southeast Regional Floristic Information System (SERFIS) at the  University of Alabama since March 1995.  Users can query this  bilingual data set through the Internet computer network.  Most  American botanists are not aware of bilingual database management  systems, and the majority of Chinese colleagues are still  isolated from the modern information world.  Therefore, a joint  workshop for bilingual botanical information management between  American and Chinese colleagues is proposed at the University of  Alabama by the end of 1995.  The workshop will present to  participants the concepts and proven practices in bilingual  botanical information management, in addition to several existing  botanical information systems in the U.S., including Specimen  MAnagement System for California Herbaria (SMASCH), SERFIS, and  Biodiversity Information Management Sy stem (BIMS/INBio).  It is  expected that this workshop will promote the development of  botanical information systems in both U.S. and China, and it will  facilitate the scholarly exchanges between American and Chinese  botanists.",
