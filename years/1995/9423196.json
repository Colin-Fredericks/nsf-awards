 "awd_abstract_narration": "While science and the cold war usually brings physics to mind, the atomic age and cold war issues also influenced and reflected developments in biology.  This research investigates the influences  of genetics on popular culture, military strategy, civil defense, diplomacy and ideology, and of cold war concerns on concepts and methods in genetics.  A central issue in the research involves the extent to which geneticists in postwar America played an active role to establish and maintain their social relevance.  This relevance depended on geneticists being able to evaluate the significance of radiation-induced mutation for human individuals and populations, and to maintain the distinction between genetics and eugenics.  There were tall hurdles to overcome in order to reach the goal.  For instance, geneticists disagreed greatly about the significance of mutations.  Using archival sources, interviews, and surveys of research support and popular reports, this investigation will undertake a careful and detailed analysis of the theoretical, conceptual, methodological and empirical issues in contention, and how they were overcome.  The investigation will focus on three interelated areas of disagreement:  the `genetic load` disputes, the `classical/balance` controversy, and arguments over the interpretation of genetic research on humans vs. non-human `model` organisms.  It will consider the role of disciplinary and professional differences in these controversies.  It will consider the relationships between Federal research sponsors and their scientific clients.  It will examine how the scope and direction of scientific effort reflected scientific and social concerns and  how sponsors and clients handled socio-scientific controversies.    Results will be published in articles and a book.",
