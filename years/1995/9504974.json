 "awd_abstract_narration": "Davis    This project addresses a range of sparse matrix problems, from  data  structures, to algorithms, to applications.  The unifying theme  is the  unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method: its implementation, data  structures,  and applicability to difficult sparse matrix problems in  semiconductor device  and process simulation.  The unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal  method  encompasses both the multifrontal technique and an approximate  degree update  algorithm that is much faster (asymptotically and in practice)  than computing  the true degrees.  Although this method uses upper bounds, the  ordering quality  for both the unsymmetric (Markowitz cost) and symmetric (minimum  degree)  algorithms does not suffer.  The investigator and his colleagues  develop parallel factorization and  ordering algorithms based on these approaches.  They also develop  parallel memory allocators (a fast-fits algorithm), a dynamic  task graph  (dynamic, since the pivot ordering determines the task dag), the  development of  both pessimistic and optimistic synchronization methods for  frontal matrix  ``collision'' in the combined uni/multifrontal approach, and  other distributed  data structures (such as a distributed priority queue for finding  pivots of  low approximate degree) required for these algorithms.  The  algorithms and  data structures they develop are applied to semiconductor device  and process simulation.  This is a challenging application,  placing a burden  not only on the numerical factorization, but on the symbolic  ``overhead'' as  well.   The problems in this domain are based on irregular,  adaptive grids  (both 2D and 3D).  Both direct methods and iterative methods are  used.  The  iterative method used is a preconditioned biconjugate gradient  algorithm, with  an incomplete LU factorization as the preconditioner.  The  investigators develop and  employ an incomplete multifrontal factorization algorithm, and a  multifrontal-based approach for computing the sparse inverse for  use as a prec onditioner.    The parallel methods the investigators develop are widely  applicable to many  computationally intensive problems, in particular the modeling of  complex physical phenomena:  structural stress and fluid-flow in  and around the  space shuttle, thunderstorms and tornados, circuits and  semiconductor devices,  the mixing and combustion of complex turbulent reacting flows,  the flow of oil  in a reservoir, the optimal distillation of gas and petroleum  products, and so  on.  Parallel sparse matrix algorithms and the data structures  they require can  help to solve these problems.  Where will a tornado hit?  How  fast can you  make a CPU chip run?  How can automobile emissions be reduced and  gas  efficiency be increased at the same time?  How do we get more gas  out of the  same amount of crude oil, and how do we get more crude oil out of  an oil  reservoir?  Answering these questions accurately requires a great  deal of  computation - and much of that computation involves large, sparse  matrices.  High-speed computation is required - it does no good to predict  where a  tornado will hit after it has already passed by and done its  destruction.  Thus the need for parallel algorithms and data structures.  The  methods  the investigators develop are made widely available to  researchers in these and other  areas.  To ensure that the methods are in fact useful for ``real  world''  problems, they are incorporated into a widely-used semiconductor  simulation  package, the Florida Object-Oriented Device/Process Simulator  (FLOODS/FLOOPS).  FLOODS/FLOOPS is in use in dozens of companies and universities,  and its  methods form the basis of many commercial semiconductor  simulation packages.",
