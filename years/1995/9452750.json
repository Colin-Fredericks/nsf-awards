The program will include a one-  week orientation at Cornell's Arnot Forest, a five-week on-campus  component focusing on research, careers, community outreach,  multimedia computer presentations, science ethics, follow-up  activities in schools, after-school science clubs, 4-H clubs, and  other informal educational settings.  A six-week Mathematics and  Science Teaching Perspectives component will be included, through  which four high school science teachers will engage in composting  and environmental toxicology research  and science education  activities at Cornell.  Teachers will design research curricula  and kits that will enable them to continue their research with  students in classrooms and after-school science clubs.  ***",
