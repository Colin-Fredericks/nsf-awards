 "awd_abstract_narration": "Webb       The investigtor studies the qualitative behavior of the  linear and nonlinear partial differential equations of structured  population dynamics.  In these equations structure variables such  as age, size, maturity, or other physical attributes of members of  the population relate individual population behavior to total  population behavior.  The methods of the research employ the theory  of semigroups of linear operators in Banach spaces, the spectral  theory of linear operators in Banach spaces, and the theory of  positive linear and nonlinear operators in Banach lattices.  The  project appliies these researches to (1) models of the blood  production system and abnormalities in this system such as  aplastic anemia, (2) models of loss of telomeres in ends of  chromosomes in proliferating cell lines and the distinction of  normal and cancer cells in these loss processes, (3) qualitative  models of AZT treatment of AIDS and the development of resistant  strains of HIV as a result of treatment, (4) models of periodic  chemotherapy of tumor cell populations, and (5) models of  epidemics with infection incubation periods and geographical  dependence.       This project studies the ways in which populations may  behave, if the behavior is described by certain kinds of equations  that incorporate features of the populations.  Such features  include the age, size, or maturity of members of the population.  The mathematical results are applied to models of populations of  cells, of epidemics, and mf treatments.  In these various  applications the qualitative behaviors of physical and biological  phenomena are modelled as dynamical population processes.  The  significance of this work is in the development of mathematical  methods to analyze the qualitative behavior of solutions of the  equations that describe structured populations, and to apply these  methods to the qualitative understanding of biotechnological  processes.",
