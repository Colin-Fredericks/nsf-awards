 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith   In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. Many of the GLOBE student measurements will be spatially correlated with geographic information such as that derived from satellite imagery, aerial photography, and other terrestrial maps. Therefor accurate position determination of the measurement sites is required. The GLOBE program will use positions derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which has great accuracy ( to within less than 100 meters) employing portable receivers presently costing well under $ 1000. This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II is concerned with the GPS needs of GLOBE. GPS receivers and associated equipment will be defined, procured, and bundled into kits with documentation for loan to participating schools. The  Principal Investigator (P.I.) and assisting graduate and undergraduate students will help plan the education program and generate teaching materials. The P.I. will participate in the teacher training workshops.",
