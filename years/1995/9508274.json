While emerging  ATM networks provide communication services for supporting such  multimedia applications today's internetworked environment and  legacy make end-to-end ATM connectivity between two end hosts  unlikely in the foreseeable future.  Research in this project  represents a timely and important step in developing the network  infrastructure needed to support real-time multimedia applications.       This proposal includes a mix of theoretical and experimental  research aimed at the design and evaluation of scalable services  for supporting real-time multimedia applications in a wide-area  network or internetwork. Specifically, the researchers will:  1)  develop and evaluate receiver-oriented approaches for providing  scalable reliable multicast services. The fundamental concerns are  to understand how to allocate protocol functionality among the  sender and receivers, how to use multicast to provide reliable  multicast, and how to use application-specific semantic information  in error recovery protocols; and 2) develop and evaluate end host  mechanisms, such as playout adjustment   algorithms and  special-purpose error-recovery protocols, for enhancing the quality  of service attained by several different real-time applications.   The researchers will exploit application-specific information about  the component applications - in this case their different timing  constraints.  ***       *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking and Communications Research Program  4201 Wilson Blvd. Room 1175  Arlington Va 22230    (703) 306-1949  (703) 306-0621 (FAX)",
