 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507909  Palmer    A great deal of recent research in international relations has  focused on the relationship between democracy and foreign policy.   One strain on this literature, originating from works dealing  with issues of war and peace, has addressed the question of  whether democracies are less war prone than non-democracies.  A  second and older strain, some of it originating from the study of  comparative foreign policy has expanded our horizons into other  areas, including alliance behavior, defense expenditures and  policy, and reliance on international organizations.  These two  approaches have produced a number of empirical regularities  indicating that democracies do behave somewhat differently than  do non-democracies with the best know being that although  democracies tend to fight, and even initiate, wars as often as  other states do, they rarely, if ever, fight one another.   Explanations for these observations have centered around two main  approaches--the norms approach, holding that democratic leaders'  behaviors are guided by the norms regarding conflict behavior  that they are socialized to accept, and the structural approach,  holding that democratic institutions make it easier for a  leader's opponents to block policies (such as war) they  disapprove.  Attempts to construct critical tests for determining  the better approach have proven inconclusive, largely because  there is so much overlap between the two arguments and because  democratic norms and democratic institutions often coexist.    The above suggests that a reevaluation of the research is in  order and a new theory is needed.  This investigation articulates  and tests a general theory of foreign policy.  The theory  specifies how individual preferences, domestic political  structures, and the international environment interact to produce  foreign policies.  The theory also integrates the work on  conflict behavior with other types of foreign policy such as  alliance formation, defense spending, and events inte raction.   The theory is formalized and is used to deduce hypotheses  systematically.  The methods appropriately employed use a variety  of extant data sets to test relevant hypotheses.    This research investigation should substantially enhance our  understanding of the topic.  ***",
