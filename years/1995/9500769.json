 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports work in geometric group theory.  The principal investigator will continue to study groups as geometric objects and to extend these ideas to handle geometric questions involving pairs consisting of a group and a subgroup.  In particular, he will determine the structure of finitely presented subgroups of a hyperbolic group.  He will also study the quasi-isometry types of various groups.  A group is an algebraic object having a multiplication defined on it.  Groups can have an infinite number of elements or a finite number of elements.  In the case of infinite groups, they are often studied by associating with them finite objects of some type.  In the case of this award, the central them has been to consider a finitely generated group as a geometric object through its Cayley graph.  This work has connections to several areas of mathematics, as well as computer science.",
