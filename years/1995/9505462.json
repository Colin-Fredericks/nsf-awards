 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505462  Feldstein    This award will provide partial support for the Second  International   Conference on the Numerical Solution of Volterra and Delay  Equations to   be held at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona from May  22-25,   1996.  The subject of Volterra equations includes functional  differential   equations (delay, advanced, and neutral), Volterra integral  equations, and   Volterra integro-differential equations.  These equatiols have  found   applications as models in many areas of science and engineering  such as   biomathematics and medical science, control theory,  electrodynamics,   neutron transport, theory, oscillation theory, and  viscoelasticity.  Since the   solutions to such equations can rarely be obtained in closed  form,   computational techniques must be used; hence the focus of the  conference   will be on computational methods.  The three main themes of the   conference will be convergence and order properties, stability  analysis, and   implementation problems.  The program will include invited  presentations   and contributed talks, as well as organized mini-symposia and  panel   discussions.  The conference will bring together leading scholars  in this   field from the international community and participants will  include both   junior researchers and senior experts.",
