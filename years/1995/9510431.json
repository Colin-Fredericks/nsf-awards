At each level of analysis the observer may  gain information from a number of different sources, some  informative about distances from the observer to parts of the  scene or to parts of objects (viewer-centered) and others  informative about depth relationships within the scene or within  objects, independent of the position of the observer (object-  centered).  Three series of experiments will be conducted to  determine how information at each level, scene, layout, and  object, and information of each type, viewer-centered and object-  centered, combine to provide an integrated perception of the  three-dimensional environment.    The first series of experiments will examine the relationship  between simulated layout and perceived layout as information for  scene depth is manipulated.  The second series of experiments  will assess the effect of layout information on the perception of  object properties (relative depth, surface orientation, and  overall shape).  The third series of experiments will use  selected conditions from the first two series to examine the  combined effects of scene depth and layout on the perception of  object properties.  Within each of these series, the type of  information (viewer-centered or object-centered) for each level  under consideration will be manipulated.  Several different cues  for the specification of viewer-centered and object-centered  information will be examined including accommodation, linear  perspective, motion parallax, disparity, relative size, texture,  structure from motion, and shading.  The majority of the  experiments will involve computer-generated displays.  Some  experiments invo lving real scenes will also be conducted.    This will be the first comprehensive study of the integration of  visual information at multiple levels for the perception of the  three-dimensional environment.  An understanding of the  perception of objects in three-dimensional scenes is important in  any situation in which an observer moves through a scene or must  recognize or manipulate objects in a scene.  For this reason  there is a close relationship between basic research on human  visual perception in dynamic scenes and technological  developments involving both human and artificial visual systems,  ranging from improving visual displays for the training of pilots  in flight simulators to developing more effective robotic visual  systems.    ***",
