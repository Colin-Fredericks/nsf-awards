The goal of the research is to improve methods and concepts  of the density functional and pseudopotential theories  through the following projects: (1) The exchange-correlation  hole around an electron, describing the tendency of  electrons to stay apart, is somewhat transferable from one  system to another.  For an electron gas of uniform density,  the hole will be analyzed by spin and by interelectronic  spatial separation. (2) An Oon-top holeO explanation will be  given for the success of the local spin density and  generalized gradient approximations in OnormalO systems.  Exact or nearly exact holes in atoms and molecules will be  used to test the strengths and weaknesses of these  approximations. (3) Systematic local spin density and  genralized gradient approximation calculations will be  undertaken for the elemental solids.  Local spin density and  generalized gradient approximation energies will be analyzed  by reduced density gradients.  (4) To complete the liquid  drop model for a charged metallic cluster, the quantum  contribution to the size effect for the ionization energy  will be evaluated.  (5) A local electron-ion  pseudopotential, combining simplicity with realism, has been  constructed from solid state electron densities,  Tests and  applications will include calculation of phonon frequencies  and OuniversalO phase diagrams for simple metals under  pressure. (6) In a quest for Ochemical accuracy,O hybrid  methods will be developed by combining density functionals  for short-range correlations with wavefunction methods for  long-range. (7) The density gradient expansion of the  kinetic energy will be tested and convergently resummed,  leading to a simple Oorder-NO method of electronic structure  calculation.  %%%  Numerical and analytical techniques will be used to develop,  test and apply new methods to calculate the properties of  the electr onic structure of atoms, molecules and  particularly, solids.   The results of this work could have  a wide-ranging impact on researchers using these methods to  calculate  a wide variety of material properties related to  the electronic structure.  ***",
