 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424649  Grandhi   In this research, a novel scheme for integrated design of preform die shapes and process conditions for difficult-to-forge components will be developed.  Industry provided design goals and performance requirements will be taken in formulating the die shape design procedures.  The novelty lies in the combined use of multi-objective die shape evolution and process control design optimization procedures along with viscoplastic finite element analysis.  The design scheme makes use of the relationships of microstructure and field variables, finite element modeling, and shape optimization approaches.  The deformation energy, variance of strain-rate and temperature distributions in the workpiece are used as multiple-objectives to control the processing of high temperature materials.  This approach takes into account the nonlinear material behavior and a constantly changing boundary value problem by using an automated process parameter design at critical steps of deformation.  The optimized designs will be experimentally validated at two industrial sites, one representing aerospace and the other heavy machinery parts.  As a result of two collaborating industries, material selection will include \"exotic\" titanium aluminide as well as \"high volume\" steel.     Successful demonstration of this research is expected to have a positive impact in terms of cost and quality of forging, especially for intricate designs and hard to process materials.  With a manufacturing \"pull\" from the industrial partners, the research results are likely to be implemented rapidly.  ***",
