 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553363  Knox  The goal of this initiative is to improve the understanding of  interrelated environmental processes within surface and subsurface  aqueous ecosystems.  To work toward that goal, the Oklahoma  EPSCoR Committee will to complete an automated environmental  monitoring system and develop a detailed site characterization  database for a landfill ecosystem.  These efforts will involve  equipment acquisitions and focused research applications.   Development of the landfill site into an automated, characterized  research facility will be coordinated with the United States  Geological Survey (USGS), which recently selected the landfill as  the next field research site for its Toxic Substances Hydrology  Program.              The Automation Component of this initiative centers around the  Oklahoma Mesonetwork, an outstanding example of the application of  technology for the benefit of people and programs.  The  MESONET is a statewide network of automated environmental  monitoring stations.  Each station measures a variety of  environmental parameters (temperature, wind speed, soil moisture,  etc.) every 15 minutes and transmits the data to a receiving  location via the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunications  Network.  The data is quality assured, archived, and made available  within 15 minutes to multiple agencies around the state.  Two  MESONET towers are planned for deployment at the Norman landfill  research facility.  The objective of the Automation Component of  this initiative is to install networks of selected environmental  sensors and exploit the capabilities of MESONET for remote,  continuous, real-time, environmental monitoring.  By using the  MESONET system, the landfill research site and its associated  characterization datbase will be made available to researchers  throughout the state.    The Research Component of this initiative is focused on developing  an accurate and detailed description of the surface and subsurface  flow and contaminant transport regimes at the lan dfill.  The  research work proposed herein was developed in direct consultation  with the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS); hence, each project is  designed to complement research activities of the USGS.  The  research activities will focus on quantifying/qualifying certain  hydrologic interactions and subsurface biotic processes.  In  addition, tracer studies would be conducted and geophysical surveys  will be conducted at the research facility.  Selected sensors  associated with these research efforts will utilize the MESONET  system to transmit data.  The objective of the Research Component  of the initiative is to characterize the surface and subsurface  flow regimes of the landfill ecosystem using innovative  monitoring, measurement, and modeling techniques.",
