Although the primary audience consists of undergraduate  college students, the video tapes are also useful for high school  science students. The tapes are being prepared primarily through  the use of computer animation and SVHS video recording. Each tape  contains 5-10 minute expositions of several devices such as compact  discs, photocopier, telecommunication devices, computer chips,  computer displays and key boards, scanners, laser printers, fiber  optics, medical devices etc. These tapes will ultimately be  converted into laser disks by a commercial agency. Laser disks have  been chosen as the final product since they offer the most  flexibility and usefulness as an instructional medium.  This project helps bridge the gap between physics and technology by  bringing physics-based industrial and practical applications to the  introductory physics classroom. The teaching of such applications  in physics courses is essential in order that students understand  the value and use of physics in real life and should also make the  physics learning process more enjoyable and easier. Most physics  instructors at present do not devote much time to technological  applications primarily because of class time considerations.  However with proper audio-visual means most technological  applications can be described in short animated sequences of about  5-10 minutes each. Once completed, these disks will be very useful  for supplementing physics instruction.",
