The Board  considers questions of the relation  of engineering and technology to  coastal and offshore resource  development and operations; to  navigation and the commerce of the  sea, waterways, and ports; to  related human resources and onshore  activities; and their relation to  the establishment and  implementation of public policies.  The Board identifies opportunities  and needs for new technologies and  other developments and recommends  appropriate actions.  It stimulates  the exchange of information and  cooperative activities, and  provides a forum for the national  and international professional  community.    The activities through which the  Board accomplishes its program are:  (1) assessments of the technical  capability to undertake and manage  offshore and maritime developments  and uses, including the adequacy of  knowledge to support technology  development; (2) evaluations of  safety of personnel and of the  environment; (3) assistance in the  preparation and assessment of the  government's program directed to  ocean and maritime developments and  uses; and (4) identification of  future opportunities for the  integration of advanced technology  into marine and maritime systems  and the influence of technical  advances on the establishment and  implementation of public policy.  ***",
