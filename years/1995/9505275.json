Efficient numerical computations of 3-D incompressible flow are currently far behind the practical needs. Indeed, even some very basic issues in formulating a numerical method are unsettled whenever boundaries are present, such as the correct numerical boundary conditions for the vorticity and efficient 3-D formulation.  Some connections between different types of vorticity boundary formulations, such as local via global and the MAC scheme via Thom's formula, have already been found by this investigator and his collaborator Weinan E.  With explicit treatment of the vorticity term and high-order (essentially) compact difference approach, they recently introduced a very efficient fourth order scheme in vorticity-stream function (vector) formulation, together with a complete convergence theory. The investigator proposes to continue developing efficient and accurate numerical methods for the three dimensional computation using both the vorticity-stream function and vorticity-velocity formulations.  The investigator also plans to conduct a systematic study of statistical behavior and coherent structure of some 2-D and 3-D wall-bounded turbulence flows such as the driven cavity flow, backward-facing step flow, etc.  and carry out a detailed numerical comparison with the homogeneous isotropic turbulence simulations. Extensive work has been done on direct simulation of isotropic turbulence in wall-free flows, much less work has involved wall-bounded turbulence.  However, most turbulence is generated at the walls.    Understanding turbulent flows is a grand challenge comp arable to other prominent scientific problems such as the large-scale structure of the universe and the nature of subatomic particles. In contrast to many of the other grand challenges, progress on the basic theory of turbulence translates nearly immediately into a wide range of engineering applications and technological advances that affect many aspects of everyday life. Direct numerical simulation for Navier-Stokes equation is an effective tool that complements experimental and theoretical investigation of turbulence.  The investigator proposes to study two problems in the field: (1) Developing efficient, robust and reliable numerical methods for viscous incompressible flows in domains with solid boundaries, especially in the cases with large Reynolds number. (2) Using these methods to study statistical behavior and coherent structure of two and three dimensional wall-bounded turbulence via direct numerical simulations.",
