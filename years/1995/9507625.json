 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to maintain and further develop an  object oriented software framework to represent and access  macromolecular structure data of proteins, DNA, RNA. and  their complexes. In this context a software framework  implies a set of reusable software components that encompass  the storage, intuitive, efficient retrieval and processing  of macromolecular structure-based information leading to a  better understanding of structure-function relationships. A  continuing major design goal is the ability to quickly  combine and apply these components in hitherto unthought of  ways. An approach of particular value to the fast evolving  domain of structural biology where the amount of data, our  knowledge about that data, and presumably the new questions  that data raises, continues to grow at a near exponential  rate. The existing framework, based on PDBlib, a ~++ class  library for representing a macromolecular structure, already  interfaces to a variety of backend storage formats including  Protein Data Bank (PDB) ASCII files. Object Oriented PDB  (OOPDB - a persistent version of PDBlib) and a Derived  Features DataBase (DFDB). Query of all backend storage  formats is available through MacroMolecular Query Language  (MMQL), a domain specific non-formal query methodology. More  limited query of OOPDB and DFDB and reports generated from  these databases are available globally through the  Macromolecular Object Oriented Search Engine (MOOSE), a  World Wide Web (WWW) server. This proposal seeks to maintain  and expand all facets of the framework. The specific goals  of this proposal are as follows:         Maintain and make available through the resources of       the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) the existing       and evolving framework. This implies: providing access       to current native and derived data, database       maintenance, software maintenance, software       distribution, and limited assistance to the community       of users.         Extend the framework to:               1. Support a broader range of information on       biological macromolecules through                extensions to PDBlib. Namely, functional       classification of macromolecules,                primary sequence where no 3-D structure       exists, NMR ensemble d~ta, and                experimental data including that from sources       other than X-ray and NMR.              2. Provide new query methods (predominantly for       comparative analysis) to                effectively use existing and new data by       extensions to MMQL.              3. Provide the ability to store and subsequently       operate on the results of previous                queries as specialized databases.         Optimize the storage and query methodology used by the  framework.         Continue in-house research using the framework to       explore correlations between various structural       parameters found in protein structures.    While it is far from proven that the community will use and  further develop software frameworks such as the one proposed  here, the rationale behind it would seem sound in a time  when the falling cost of hardware has not been matched by a  significantly decreased cost in software development.",
