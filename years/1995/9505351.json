The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Carolyn D. Cook to work with Mr. Mateus  Kilmaskossu at Cenderawasih in Irian Jaya, Indonesia.    The goal of this project is to plan and do research towards  developing the potential of indigenous Pandanus agroforestry  with the Amung-me people of Irian Jaya, Indonesia.  They  will conduct background research providing the basis for  this development which will promote biodiversity while  creating a sustainable enterprise.  These people have no  sources of income but desire to enter a new market system in  their province.  They lack the skills and education to mine  at the nearby mining company.  These two elements make them  ripe to learn a new area of specialization which could raise  their self esteem, plus allow them to make a living.  This  project aims to establish a network of communication and  exchange of knowledge among faculty and students of  Cenderawasih University, the Amung-me, government officials,  non-government organizations, future researchers and beyond.  ***",
