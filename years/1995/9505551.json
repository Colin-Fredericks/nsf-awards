Research in this project will focus on three classes of problems:  1) the design of effective sequential and parallel algorithms for  certain common communication functions in networks, such as  all-to-all broadcast or \"gossiping\"; 2) the study of gossiping in  a faulty environment and its application to the problem of  automatic identification of the faulty units; and 3) the  investigation of gossiping in wireless (radio) networks and the  channel assignment problem in cellular telephone systems.   Work  will also include extending the PI's previous work on effective  information dissemination in networks with emphasis on devising  efficient approximation algorithms for known difficult problems  and extending work on distributed gossiping algorithms in a faulty  environment to make it applicable to automatic identification of  intermittently faulty units in a network.  The principal  investigator will also study problems in wireless networks and  cellular systems using generalizations of graph coloring problems.  ***",
