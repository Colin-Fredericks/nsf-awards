 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Philip P. Power, Chemistry Department, University of California -   Davis, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to investigate   element-element and related bonding in the earlier main group elements.   The main thrust of the project involves the synthesis of new classes of   compounds which may have multiple bonds between heavier group 13 elements   and the preparation of kinetically stable, metal-metal bonded main group   2 and 12 element derivatives in which the metal has a formal oxidation   state of +1. The new compounds are designed so they will contain bonding   types not previously observed for these elements. By use of a variety of   spectroscopic and structural methods the characteristics of these bonds   will be probed in order to determine the nature of element-element   interactions between the earlier main group atoms.  The most important interactions which occurs in chemical compounds are   the bonding which links the constituent atoms to one another. For carbon   and other small non-metal atoms single, double, and  triple bonds are   well known, as are many correlations between the chemical bonding in a   compound and its chemical properties. Up until only a few years ago,   heavier atoms were thought to only form single bonds. More recently that   dogma was overthrown and this study is aimed at exploring the possibility   that atoms which are not known to form multiple bonds actually may be   capable of doing so. These studies have great significance to our basic   understanding of chemical bonding and open the way to the preparation of   new chemical systems which may display entirely novel properties.",
