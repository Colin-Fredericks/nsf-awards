 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mining Engineering Department serves the local gold mines in  the Black Hills and 14 large open pit coal mines in the Powder  River Basin of Wyoming and has very sophisticated computerized  mine planning capabilities.   The department offers a mine  surveying course for all geology, mining, and geological  engineering students.   The Civil and Environmental Engineering  Department serves a large area including the SD Transportation  Board and currently offers a two-semester sequence of surveying  courses, the second elective.   The main thrust of this project  is to obtain a one-person total surveying system for both  departments to use.   The one-person total station manufactured  by Geotronics is an entirely new surveying system.  Very accurate  measurement is done from the reflector station with the surveying  instrument remaining unattended during the procedure and  controlled from the reflector station.   Data are acquired  electronically with easy transfer to any IBM computer for use in  maps, mine planning, and GIS.   The Geology/Geological  Engineering Department has recently acquired two GIS systems for  use in class and research.",
