 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indonesia exhibits great linguistic diversity, yet even the  most widely spoken of the Indonesian languages remain poorly  studied. Particularly lacking are systematic phonological studies  and instrumental phonetic investigations. The goal of this  project is a detailed phonetic and phonological analysis of  several related Indonesian languages of the Western Austronesian  language family (including Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese,  Madurese, and Batak). It will involve basic description and  documentation of these languages, while including several  specific research projects focusing on the phonotactics and  prosodic systems of these languages. Building on these basic  descriptions, an investigation of the influence of regional  languages (Javanese and Batak) on the structure of Indonesian  will also be carried out. This work will be carried out through  study of previous sources on these languages, consultations with  native speaker consultants, and acoustic analysis of recordings  of multiple speakers.       The end result of the project will include a bibliography on  recent work on the structure of Indonesian languages, a  systematic acoustic database analyzing the phonetic properties of  the consonants and vowels of each of these languages, articles on  topics such as stress and the prosodic structure of Indonesian,  the phonetics and phonology of glides, the structure of  geminate-singleton contrasts, and influences on Indonesian of  regional languages, and a monograph on the phonetics and  phonology of the languages under investigation.       The project will have the dual purpose of providing a  comprehensive understanding of several languages meriting fuller  study, while at the same time providing a new source of data for  the testing of linguistic theories, thereby broadening our  understanding of the nature of human language.",
