 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Summary, Nevin J. IBN-9507584    \"Resistance to Change, Preference, and the Law of Effect\"        One of the oldest principles of psychology is the Law of Effect,  which states that rewards strengthen the behavior that produces  them.  However, the relation between the value of a reward and  its effectiveness in strengthening behavior remains unclear.  Over the past 20 years, PI has interpreted the strength of  behavior as the resistance of well-learned behavior to change,  and has shown that resistance to change depends directly on the  frequency or amount of reward signaled by a distinctive stimulus  situation.  At the same time, methods for measuring reward value,  interpreted as preference between stimulus situations that signal  various frequencies or amounts of reward, have become  progressively more precise.  Both lines of research have led to  findings that are quite general across species and situations;  however, no research has attempted to measure preference and  resistance to change at the same time, in an individual subject,  which is necessary to determine how these measures are related to  each other.  The proposed experiments will study preference and  resistance to change in pigeons working for food rewards under a  variety of conditions designed to isolate a mathematical  expression relating them.  That relation will be a quantitative  statement of the Law of Effect.",
