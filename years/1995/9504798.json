Owing to  the intractability of the likelihood function for such kind of nonlinear  models, the existing estimation methods in the literature  are somewhat ad hoc. This research contributes to the statistical  inference for non-linear continuous-time modeling based on (possibly  irregularly sampled) discrete-time observations. This research consists of four parts.  In part I, the investigators  study  maximum likelihood estimation for the general class of  nonlinear  continuous-time  autoregressive process, abbreviated by NLCAR(p).  The investigators derive a new expression  for the likelihood function   which can be evaluated via simulation.  The investigators   implement the simulation-based maximum likelihood estimation  procedure for some classes of NLCAR(p) models.  The investigators then study the sampling properties of the maximum   likelihood estimator so obtained. In part II,  the investigators    apply the Lagrange Multiplier tests for detecting     non-linearity and also those for other diagnostic purposes, and   study their large sample properties.  In part III, the investigators   extend an approach relating ergodicity and stability  to continuous-time models.  In part IV, the investigators study delayed continuous-time non-linear  autoregressive processes whose state space is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.  They also study the  recurrence (stationarity) properties  and the   statistical inference for the delayed non-linear autoregressive   processes.      In this research,  the investigators study new statistical methods useful   for analyzing data which are taken over possibly unequal ti me intervals.    Such kind of data is known as irregularly sampled  time series, and occurs frequently in diverse areas including   business forecasting, environmental statistics, medical statistics, physical  and engineering science. The investigators study computer-intensive   methods which provide the  relevant tools for studying   and testing   for  the nonlinear structure of irregularly sampled time series data.   The investigators also develop some mathematical statistics and  probability theory fundamental to the understanding of the new methods.           LEVEL OF EFFORT STATEMENT    At the recommended level of support, the PI will make every attempt to   meet the original scope and level of effort of the project.",
