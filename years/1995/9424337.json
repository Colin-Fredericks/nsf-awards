 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical and computational research will be carried out  in support of the LIGO Project--an NSF-funded effort to  construct by 1999 a two-site gravitational wave detection  system based on laser interferometry, and soon thereafter to  detect gravitational waves and begin using them for physics  and astronomy research.    Thorne will continue his longtime role as the liaison  between LIGO and the theoretical astrophysics and relativity  communities.  In this role, he has the responsibility to  ensure that theoretical issues which need to be worked for  LIGO get dealt with by his own research group or by other  members of the relativity or astrophysical theory  communities, and that the insights and contributions of  those communities are translated into forms usable by the  LIGO Project.  Thorne's group will contribute, via  theoretical analyses, to LIGO design issues, most especially  the final design of the baffles that suppress noise from  scattered laser light in the LIGO vacuum tubes.  They will  also devote effort to the design and theoretical analysis of  advanced interferometers that could operate in LIGO in the  mid 2000s or later.    Among the issues that Thorne and his group will deal with  during the four years of this award are these:    They will develop and implement numerical algorithms for  searching for gravitational-wave signals in the LIGO data,  and for extracting information from detected signals.  The  greatest effort will go into search and analysis algorithms  for inspiraling and coalescing compact binaries (binary  systems made from neutron stars and/or black holes).  These  algorithms will be based on:  (i)  theoretical inspiral  waveforms, (ii) theoretical black-hole coalescence  waveforms, and (iii) theoretical neutron-star coalescence  waveforms.  Search and analysis algorithms will also be  developed for supernovae, periodic gravitational-wave  sources (e.g., pulsars), stochastic gravitational-wave  background (e.g., from the big bang), and unexpected types  of s ources (e.g., massive, compact objects that are not  black holes or neutron stars).",
