 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507437    Freeze   tolerance  is  an  adaptation  that  permits   some  organisms  to  tolerate ice formation within  their  bodies.  Previous studies of freeze tolerance have been conducted  in  the  laboratory,  under conditions far  removed  from  those  experienced  by  animals in nature.  This research  combines  both  field and laboratory studies to elucidate the role  of  freeze  tolerance in promoting over winter survival  in  two  freeze-tolerant   species.   Freezing   episodes   naturally  experienced  during  winter  will  be  characterized   using  computer-assisted   monitoring  systems   to   record   body  temperature,  environmental temperature, and  water  content  and  water potential of the microenvironments in which over-  wintering   occurs.   Parallel  measurement  of   protective  responses  including glucose mobilization and relocation  of  organ  water will provide understanding of the physiological  mechanisms  that protect against freezing injury  to  cells,  tissues,  and  organs, and of the ecological  importance  of  these  responses in the natural environment.   Some  studies  will   focus   on   the  energetic  costs  of   hibernation,  particularly  with regard to freezing and thawing.   Nuclear  magnetic  resonance (NMR) imaging will be used to  determine  cell energy status and show whether survival duration in the  frozen state is limited by the availability of finite energy  reserves.   These  integrated field and  laboratory  studies  will provide insights into the physiological mechanisms that  promote survival at temperatures below the freezing point of  tissue,   and  into  their  ecological  significance.    The  research  may  also  provide valuable clues  for  developing  technology  for the preservation of tissues  and  organs  by  freezing.",
