 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9415073  Wichman    The triple flame is usually found near the tip of diffusion flames where on one side there is a lean premixed flame and on the other side of the diffusion flame there is a rich premixed flame.  The PI feels that the triple flame is extremely important in practical combustion systems in that it allows the diffusion flame to be propagated into or against an opposing flow.  The PI has proposed to study the intrinsic triple-flame structure of diffusion flames in contact with conductive surfaces so that the system becomes non-isenthalpic.  The PI feels that the triple flame plays a central role  in flame spread processes especially on solid surfaces.  The PI plans to examine the dependence of quenching distance on the thermochemical parameters, the shape and variation of the triple flame structure with stoichiometry, and the heat flux signatures produced by such flames.  He also intends to examine the influences of the triple flame structure on real, measurable, physical quantities such as heat flux and excess enthalpy profiles.  The PI proposes to use an analytical approach based on asymptotic techniques and one step chemistry between fuel and oxidizer.",
