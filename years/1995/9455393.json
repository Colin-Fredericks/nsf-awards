The aim of this project is to  design and implement an integrated classroom and laboratory  experience for junior-level engineering students who can  communicate with fellow classmates and instructors using   electronic mail and file transfer software from their residence  or place of work. Computer modem access is the only necessary  student hardware. Statistical solutions to multi-disciplinary  engineering problems are created by student teams using  statistical methods discussed over the university's existing  communication network. The statistical laboratory materials  being developed by various researchers are integrated into this  virtual laboratory setting, thus making all results accessible  to a larger audience. Classroom, laboratory and course  assessments comparing this new course to a traditional  engineering statistics course  offer educators the opportunity  to evaluate the validity of this integrated course for their  technical course offerings.",
