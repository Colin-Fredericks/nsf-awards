 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414843  Anderson  Several key areas of atmospheric chemistry suffer from a lack of  data on reaction rate coefficients and reaction mechanisms,  especially in the conditions (pressure, temperature, and  composition) of the Earth's atmosphere.  These areas include (1)  many of the reactions that limit the rate at which natural and  anthropogenic free radicals in the stratosphere destroy ozone, (2)  vital reactions that couple the chemical cycles of oxygen,  nitrogen, and hydrogen throughout the troposphere and stratosphere,  and (3) the mechanisms by which dimethylsulfide is oxidized in the  remote atmosphere to form sulfate aerosols.  In addition, many  aspects of a comprehensive theory explaining the relative  reactivity of molecules with free radicals are still not well  developed.        One objective of this research is to allow investigators to  test simultaneous observations of many of the species central to  atmospheric chemistry in order to determine whether laboratory  chemistry agrees with atmospheric observations.  Tests of this sort  are currently hindered more by incomplete kinetic data than any  other cause,particularly at the pressures (10 - 200 torr) and  temperatures (185- 250 Kelvin) found in the upper troposphere and  lower stratosphere.  The investigators will employ a technique  known as high pressure flow kinetics to probe numerous key  reactions over the full range of tropospheric and lower  stratospheric temperatures, pressures, and compositions.  This  technique, simultaneously avoids complicating wall reactions and  extends the range of flow tube kinetics to atmospheric pressure.   By avoiding wall reactions, experiments can be performed at  temperatures far lower than previously obtainable.       A second objective is enhanced knowledge of the oxidation  pathways of dimethyl sulfide (DMS).  DMS, a naturally occurring  sulfur compound emitted from the ocean surface into the marine  atmosphere, is the most important naturally occurring sulfur  species in the atmosphere.   It is believed to be the source of most  of the aerosol particles in the marine atmosphere; these particles,  in turn, serve as condensation nuclei for marine clouds.  It has  been postulated that the availability of these condensation nuclei  affects the albedo of clouds, and thus that changes in DMS  production caused by global climate change could in turn lead to  further climate forcing, either ameliorating or worsening the  initial effect.  The sulfate aerosols also directly scatter a small  portion of the incoming solar radiation away from the Earth's  surface.  The investigators will focus on three key points in a  proposed DMS oxidation sequence in a effort to reconcile  atmospheric observations with laboratory measurements.       A key aspect of the work will be the observation of both  reactant and product species in the reactions being studied.   Fluorescence and absorption measurement of free radicals will be  combined with high resolution Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy, which will allow simultaneous measurement of many  species.  The addition of a mass spectrometer will allow the  detection of otherwise undetectable species at low concentrations,   particularly in the DMS system.",
