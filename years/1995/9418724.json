 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves studies on b lactamase catalysis and inhibition, using a  combination of site directed mutagenesis and structural probes, especially attenuated total  reflectance (ATR) FTIR.  b Lactamases are the major source of resistance to penicillin antibiotic  therapy, an increasingly common health problem, and are thus potential targets for the design of new  antibiotics. In spite of considerable study the mechanism of action of the b lactamases remains  somewhat of an enigma. Although the active site residues have been identified through structural,  chemical and mutagenesis studies, and several possible mechanisms have been proposed, there is no  consensus on the catalytic mechanism, and many outstanding fundamental questions remain. Through  detailed kinetic and structural characterization of selected active site mutants we hope to answer a  number of specific questions regarding the b lactamase catalytic mechanism, including which ionizing  groups are responsible for the bell shaped pH rate profiles; the role of the conserved Lys73; why some  substrates with wild type enzy me, and some mutants with all substrates, show a branched  path  mechanism (reflected in substrate induced inactivation or reversible suicide inhibition), and the  nature of the resulting inactive acyl enzyme species; and the reason why the deacylation rate is so  much faster in the Class A B lactamases compared to the penicillin target enzymes (transpept-idases  and D Ala,D Ala carboxypeptidases). We anticipate that the inform-ation learned in this investigation  will be very valuable in understanding how b lactamase catalysis works and in the design of new  inhibitors which would be potential antibiotics.  %%%   Lactamases are the major source of resistance to penicillin antibiotic therapy, an increa ingly common health problem, and are thus potential targets for the design of new antibiotics. In spite of considerable study, the mechanism of action of the b lactamases remains somewhat of an enigma. Through detailed kinetic and strutural characterization of selected active site mutants we hope to answer a number of specific questions regarding the B lactamase catalytic mechanism. The mutants will be characterized using both kinetic and stnuctural probes. We propose a novel approach to obtaining information about the structure of enzyme-substrate complexes (and enzyme-inhibitor complexes), namely the use of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy),in conjunction with immobilized  enzyme in a flow cell. Normally transient intermediates will be stabilized either with low  temperatures, or by using relatively inactive mutants. The information obtained in the proposed  studies should facilitate the development of improved b lactam antibiotics.",
