 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of new methodology for the synthesis of  organofluorine compounds.  The insertion of difluoromethylene in fluorinated organometallic  compounds gives a new technological method for the synthesis of fluorocarbon derivatives, whic  have demonstrated value as commercial surgactants.  The routes to fluorinated polyenes and  aromatics.  Polymerization of diiodofluoropolyenes will give fluorcarbon polymers with  potentially useful conduction properties.  The aromatic derivatives prepared via the synthon  chemistry will provide precursors for the synthesis of high temperature aromatic polymers with  a Teflon-like surface.  The new fluorine containing heterocycles will give new building blocks  for the incorporation of fluorine into biologically important compounds, and the new porphyrins  will be useful oxidation catalysts for the conversion of petroleum feed stocks to industrially  important organic chemicals with minimal environmental impact.    With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Donald J.  Burton of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa.  Professor Burton will focus  his work on the development of new synthetic methodology for the preparation of organofluorine  compounds.  These methods will provide useful routes to molecules of both academic and  industrial importance spanning the spectrum from materials to biologically important systems.",
