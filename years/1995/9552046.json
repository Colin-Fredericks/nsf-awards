 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project reflects the importance of Digital Signal Processing  (DSP) in the analysis of important engineering problems and  developing effective solutions with DSP hardware and software  tools.   This project is modifying the overall curriculum to  ensure that DSP methods are introduced in the junior year for  electrical engineering students.   The ECE curriculum had placed  a primary emphasis on analog signal processing, including  communications, control systems, electronic circuits, and analog  filter design.   Due to the limited availability of DSP  facilities, ad hoc DSP projects had been assigned to students who  work under the supervision of senior staff.   There are about  100,000 professionals in the metropolitan Detroit area, employed  primarily in the automobile and related industries, and the  school is strategically located to allow for innovative  curriculum development to benefit both local and national  industries.   The project has an interdisciplinary thrust that  provides all engineering students with an opportunity to learn  the theory and practice of DSP techniques.   This is ensured  through the creation of two new undergraduate courses, which  include innovative experiments and projects that emphasize both  theoretical and practical aspects of DSP are proposed.   Also,  graphical tools are used to teach the basic concepts of DSP more  effectively.   Further, the DSP laboratory and capstone design  course provides students with practical skills in applying DSP  software and hardware tools for solving real-world problems.    The DSP laboratory operates cooperatively with the Vehicular  Electronics Design Laboratory (VEDL) has been developed as part  of the strategic plan of the School of Engineering.   Both  undergraduate students and practicing benefit engineers from  industry (through the continuing education program) benefit from  the establishment of the laboratory.",
