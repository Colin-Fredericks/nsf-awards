Bercaw, Chemistry Department, California Institute of     Technology, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for synthetic,   structural, and mechanistic investigations of early transition metal   complexes having reactive ligands. A series of Lewis acidic group 4 and 5   metal complexes which contain adjacent Lewis base sites contained in   coordinated ligands will be prepared. Because of the amphoteric nature of   these compounds new pathways for the activation of H-X sigma bonds will   be opened and the oxidation state of the metal can be adjusted through   the control of pH. The mechanisms of new reaction types will be   determined and comparisons will be made with the more usual bent sandwich   analogues of the metals.  Catalysts based on transition metal compounds are used extensively in the   chemical industry and important new developments in organo-transition   metal chemistry often center on the development of new catalysts or on   the optimization of existing ones. The objective of this research is to   prepare and structurally characterize new types of early transition-metal   compounds that contain `non-innocent` groups attached to the metal. These   groups, called ligands, will bear reactive sites that will allow the   behavior of the transition metal to be altered in novel, systematic ways.   The new compounds should activate bonds involving hydrogen and may   catalyze olefin polymerization. The ultimate goal is to develop catalysts   to selectively transform readily available substances such as   hydrocarbons, water, and ammonia into more valuable products.",
