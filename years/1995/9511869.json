 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511869  Day  Some estimates state that as much as one third of the mammalian  genome, some 30,000 genes, are expressed in the brain, but only a  very small number have been assigned clearly defined roles in  neural development or function.   Increasing our knowledge of the  genes involved in synapse formation and stability is fundamental to  our understanding of neural development, learning, and memory.    The major goal of this research is to identify genes with roles in  the compensatory synaptic reorganization that occurs after surgical  alteration of the adult brain.  The studies to be performed will  identify changes in neuronal messenger RNAs induced by cutting  neural connections to the hippocampus, a region involved in  learning and memory.   Molecular cloning will then be used to  identify genes with increased activity during the brain's attempt  to compensate for the loss of these hippocampal connections.  The  cloning strategy involves subtraction hybridization of  complementary DNA libraries constructed from brains having two  different types of hippocampal alterations.  The complementary  nature of these cloning strategies will remove gene products  associated with the non-specific effects, and enrich the resulting  cDNA library with synapse-specific neuronal clones.   Careful  screening of these candidate clones will determine their roles in  synapse formation and stability.   This research will identify  specific genes that are involved in neural development and  regeneration and, ultimately, define the role of these genes in  these fundamental neural processes.",
