 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Worcester Foundation is an independent nonprofit  research institute devoted to basic  research in the biological sciences. Much of the research  conducted in the 22 laboratories  at the Foundation deals with the functioning of proteins in  cells. To provide the high quality sequence information  required for the research programs at the Foundation, a  protein chemistry core facility was established in 1989. The  core facility is used  extensively by faculty members for protein microsequencing  projects, using two state-of-  the-art peptide/protein sequencers. The project described in  this proposal involves the  acquisition of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization  (MALDI) mass spectrometer  with a time of flight (TOF) detector to be used as shared  equipment in the protein  chemistry core facility. Applications of mass spectrometry  (MS) for protein analysis are  developing rapidly and the mass spectrometer must now be  considered an integral  component of the modern protein chemistry lab.    The Worcester Foundation core facility does not currently  have a mass spectrometer. The  acquisition of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer will complement  the existing  microsequencing capabilities and add important  new capabilities to the protein chemistry  core facility. MALDI-MS is particularly useful for projects  involving biological samples  because of its soft ionization technique (polypeptides are  not fragmented), the ability to  resolve complex mixtures, sensitivity in the femtomolar  range and enhanced tolerance to  sample impurities. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer that has  been selected is the  LASERMAT 2000 manufactured by Finnigan MAT Corp.  The  considerations affecting the selection of this particular  instrument are its sensitivity, resolution, high throughput,  computer capabilities and ease of operation. These  characteristics are most desirable for an instrument with  multiple users that will be extensively used to analyze  small quantities of protein obtained from biologic al  samples.    Ten investigators have described research projects that can  benefit immediately from the         incorporation of MALDI-  MS into their research programs. The number of users is  expected to increase as results are communicated within the  Foundation community and as new applications are developed.  The projects described here cover a wide range of subjects,  including the development of advanced materials, studies of  protein damage and post-translational modification, the  identification of regulatory proteins in cells and chemical  adducts formation resulting from environmental  proestrogens. Many of the projects combine mass spectrometry  and peptide sequencing to identify modified peptides and  provide information regarding the modification itself.  Understanding the      distribution of a protein between  modified and unmodified forms is a critical element in  elucidating signal transduction pathways and understanding  the regulation of protein activities and functions in cells.  The femtomolar sensitivity of the instrument permits  analysis of very small quantities of cellular protein.    The instrument will also be used routinely to screen samples  prior to sequencing. MALDI-         MS can readily establish  the presence of contaminants in protein and peptide samples.  In addition, proteolytic digests of newly isolated proteins  can be mass mapped and compared to protein sequences in the  existing databases, possibly leading to much earlier  identification of the protein and reduced  sequencing  requirements. The instrument will also be used as an  analytical tool to evaluate the integrity of recombinant  proteins with a much greater resolution than the commonly  employed electrophoretic systems. Plans are to develop MALDI-  MS as a primary sequencing tool, as well, using new  degradation chemistries.    Dr. John Leszyk, the director of the protein chemistry core,  will be responsible for         instrument supervision and  the training of new instrument users. It is an ticipated that  the instrument will be used by at least half of the  laboratories at the institution and that users will include  approximately 8 principal investigators, 26 postdoctoral  associates, 8 graduate students and 4  professional research  assistants.",
