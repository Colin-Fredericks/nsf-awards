Two faculty members from Mission College, part of the  California Community College System which supplies 70% of the  incoming studnets to the California State University System, are  also involved in the laboratory development.  In addition to new  course development significant improvements will be made in 4  exisiting courses and 5 existing laboratories.  The long-term objective of our activities is to establish a center  for Mechatronics engineering education built on the success of the  above short-term effort. This center will assist other institutions  in the nation to establish mechatronic curricula for single or  interdisciplinary engineering departments, as well as for human  resource development for industry.  The proposed curriculum will be built on three pillars: (1) the  fundamental principles of Mechatronic Technology, (2) the hands-on  experience, and (3) the application of Mechatronic Technology to  the industry in the region. Contents in Pillar (1) and (2) will be  made readily transportable to other institutions whereas the  content in Pillar (3) can be developed with assistance of local  industry and can be transported to other institutions in a similar  industrial setting. This model will benefit universities and  industries in other regions who seek to develop similar models.  Instructional materials developed from this project will be  disseminated to other institutions and industry through computer  links by means of multi-media CD-ROMs. Every effort will be made to  present results at conferences of various professional societies,  as well as publications in open literature. The Taskf orce will also  host a faculty enhancement workshop to disseminate initial results  and to gather additional input after the first year of the project.   An effort will be made to garner additional funding in the future  in order to offer workshops in the project's second and third years  of the development.",
