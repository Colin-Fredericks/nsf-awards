The course is being offered in three  modules of 5-weeks each to non-science majors, electronic  engineering technology students, and internationally educated  students who have had little opportunity to use laboratory  equipment.  High school students as well as technicians working in  local industries have opportunities to learn to use the equipment  as well.  The project is having a significant impact on  undergraduate students by providing access to science within a  positive, non-intimidating environment.  The challenge is to  provide learning experiences and curricular content that are  relevant, learner-friendly, interesting, and exciting, and which  stimulate the interest of non-science students to enroll in  subsequent science courses.  A pre and post survey will be given to  assess the student interest/knowledge in science.  The impact of  the project will be disseminated to regional and national ACS and  science education conferences.",
