 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500882  Effros    Effros will continue to investigate the mysterious mathematical world of   quantum group analysis, in collaboration with his former Ph. D student   Z.-J. Ruan. This work is based on his new approach to quantizing functional   analysis - the theory of operator spaces. Popa plans to broaden his wide-ranging   studies in the rapidly evolving field of subfactors, using both analytic and   algebraic points of view. Popa is one of very few researchers who has been   working on theanalytical aspects of subfactor theory. It may be argued that this   technically difficult area has thus far constituted the deepest aspect of   the subject. Takesaki, together with several coworkers, has very recently   completed one of the central classification programs for discrete amenable   group actions on operator algebras.  He would like to build on this success   by returning to the largely unexplored area of continuous group actions.    He also plans to work once again on his earlier theory of duality, which   is currently playing a major role in quantum group theory.    Quantized analysis was introduced in the 1930's by John von Neumann in   order to provide a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. This   development has had a profound effect on the field of mathematics itself,   since it has enabled researchers to formulate non-commutative or   \"quantized\" versions of many quite distinct mathematical disciplines. We   now have quantized versions of ergodic theory, the non-commutative geometry   of Alain Connes, the non-commutative probability theory of Dan Voiculescu,   and the remarkable interactions of operator algebras, knot theory, low   dimensional topology, and conformal quantum field theory in large part   pioneered by Vaughan Jones.  Effros, Popa and Takesaki have been actively   involved in working on the frontier of some of these exciting new areas of   mathematics.  ***",
