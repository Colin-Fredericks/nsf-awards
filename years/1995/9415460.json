 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415460  Levine  This research project involves analytical and computational studies  in non-equilibrium condensed-matter physics aimed at elucidating  the interplay between ordered and disordered structures.  One  aspect of the research involves using continuum field theoretic  methods to analyze the recently discovered connection between the  disordered (often fractal) structures seen in diffusion-limited  growth and ordered patterns in the same systems.  Also, it is hoped  to develop related methodologies to understand this interplay in a  variety of fluid systems (Faraday ripples, rotating convection,  etc.) where similar connections have been discovered by recent  experiments.  In addition, the study of ordered non-equilibrium  structure and their breakdown by focusing on non-linear spiral  waves in a variety of systems and models will be continued.  The  eventual goal of this effort taken as a whole is to push forward  the ability to go from the microscopic physics of non-equilibrium  systems to the observed macroscopic complex behavior.  %%%  When condensed-matter systems are driven far from equilibrium, they  exhibit a variety of complex behaviors in both time and space.  The  goal of the research in this area is to understand which features  of a non-equilibrium system are most crucial for determining the  degree of order in the spatial structure and which aspects of the  states which are disordered (\"chaotic\") in space and time are truly  universal.  To answer these questions, a variety  of systems will  be studied, ranging from spiral non-linear waves in chemical and  fluid systems to fractal patterns in solidification using state of  the art techniques.",
