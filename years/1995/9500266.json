 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500266  Barber   This award is for the purchase of computer system and support equipment which will be dedicated to several research projects, including in particular:  (1) a virtual decision making environment for the evaluation of graphics and interface software, (2) an interactive virtual environment to promote distributed scheduling in manufacturing arenas, (3) a visual specification environment for the development of safe, dependable, time-critical systems,  (4) analyzing aural and visual effects on the software evolution process, (5) simulation and evaluation of robotic systems in virtual environments, and (6) recognition of interactive cues in the virtual decision environment.   The research to be performed using this equipment seeks to develop tools to support the fast but accurate decision-making needed for agile manufacturing.  Decisions made in a virtual decision environment can be easily evaluated for effectiveness without the time and capital expense required in the operational factory.  The results of simulations can then be implemented on the factory floor, thus minimizing down time, equipment modifications, replanning and rescheduling.  A virtual decision environment would not replace human decision-making, but would offer a level of support that improves the ability to make frequent, rapid and vital decisions in the manufacturing enterprise.",
