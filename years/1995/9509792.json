Learning Bayesian Networks that Contain both Discrete and  Continuous Variables    Probabilistic belief networks are increasingly being used to  model belief in a great variety of domains in knowledge-based  systems.  Some of the most extensive work has been done in the  area of medical knowledge and beliefs, and this project  continues previous work in that domain.  One of the problems  that has continued to bedevil probabilistic network knowledge  bases, as well as other knowledge bases, is knowledge  acquisition.  The goal in this work is to enable the use of  medical and other types of databases and Bayesian learning  methods to develop probabilistic networks.  The particular type  of  probabilistic network structure being used here is called a  Bayesian belief network.  The method being investigated uses  two stages.   The first stage is a relatively generic technique  for learning the qualitative, structural relationships among  the model variables; and the second stage uses distribution-  specific techniques for quantifying the relationships among the  model variables.  The hypothesis, to be tested on a variety of  simulated and real-world databases, is that  this method will  produce more predictively accurate Bayesian belief network  models.",
