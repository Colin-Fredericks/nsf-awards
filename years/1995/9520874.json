 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520874  Murnane    This grant supports a US-Bulgaria Research Project on \"Cooperative Research in  Ultrashort-Pulse Laser Optics\" between Drs. Margaret M. Murnane and Henry C.  Kapteyn of Washington State University, and Prof. Ivan P. Christov of the  Department of Physics of Sofia University.  This project will perform  coordinated experimental and theoretical work on novel techniques in  ultrashort light pulse generation and measurement.  The project will combine  the experimental expertise of the group at Washington State University with  the theoretical capabilities of the group at Sofia, to address important and  significant problems in ultrafast optics.  The investigators will perform: (1)  experimental and theoretical studies on ultrashort-pulse modelocked  Ti:sapphire lasers, to investigate the fundamental limits of modelocking, and  study the physics of the modelocking mechanisms with a view to design more  efficient and better femtosecond lasers; (2) studies of fundamental limits on  the electronic nonlinear response of materials, using light pulses of  unprecedented short duration, with a view toward impacting the design of  efficient frequency conversion techniques for ultrafast studies in many areas  of science, heretofore experimentally inaccessible; and (3) the generation of  1-10 femtosecond optical pulses in the ultraviolet and x-ray region of the  spectrum using novel and speculative methods, sources which would have uses in  the study of ultrafast chemical and material dynamics.    This project in physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in Bulgaria and the United States to  combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual  interest and competence.  ***",
