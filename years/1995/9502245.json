 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexibility  and  adaptability of a robotic  manipulator  can  be  achieved by incorporating vision and sensory information  in  the  feedback loop. Previous research by the PI introduced a framework  called ``controlled active vision'' for efficient integration  of  the vision sensor in the feedback loop. This framework emphasized  eye-in-hand robotic systems (where the vision sensor  is  mounted  on or close to the manipulator's end-effector) and was applied to  the  problem  of robotic visual tracking and servoing  with  very  promising results. This research extends the framework  to  other  problems of eye-in-hand robotic systems such as the derivation of  depth  maps from controlled motion; the vision-guided,  automatic  grasping  of  moving  objects;  the  active  calibration  of  the  robot-camera  system;  the  problem  of  automatically  detecting  moving  objects of interest; and the computation of the  relative  pose  of  the target from the camera. In addition, the  new  work  investigates  issues such as the stability and the robustness  of  the  algorithms. All the work is experimentally verified  on  the  Minnesota Robotic Visual Tracker (a flexible eye-in-hand  robotic  system).   This   research   has   potential   applications    to  transportation   (e.g.,   pedestrian  detection   and   tracking,  vision-based vehicle following), inspection, and assembly  (e.g.,  vision-guided manipulation of moving objects).",
