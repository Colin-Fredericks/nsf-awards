Several experiments will be developed with the new and upgraded  instrumentation and will be integrated into the new Chemical  Engineering elective option of Powder Technology, specifically into  the \"Unit Operations II\" laboratory. The new and the upgraded  instrumentation will be state of the art equipment and will be used  for undergraduate and graduate instruction.    Additionally, a piece of industrial equipment will be used as a  demonstration unit in Freshman Engineering classes for all  engineering students to show them the very different and peculiar  behavior of powders as compared to gases and liquids. It is  expected that the demonstration unit will convince and encourage  students to pursue the powder technology option (elective) in  Chemical Engineering and to enter this new and promising field of  engineering.",
