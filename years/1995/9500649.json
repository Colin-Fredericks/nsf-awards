 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the action of a Hopf algebra H on an  algebra R.  These actions generalize the more familiar actions of  groups as automorphisms, of Lie algebras as derivations, and of  coactions of groups which give group-graded algebras.  The  principal investigator will study crossed products; duality  problems involving the action of a Hopf algebra; the structure of  general pointed Hopf algebras; the generalized Lie structure of  associative algebras, where this Lie structure means that the Lie  bracket is taken in a category of comodules of a suitable  bialgebra; and extensions of Hopf algebras in categories.    This research is concerned with an algebraic object called a Hopf  algebra.  While the area is quite technical, Hopf algebras are  becoming of increasing interest, even to non mathematicians.   Hopf algebras are useful in the type of knot theory that is of  interest to molecular chemists.  Certain types of Hopf algebras  are now referred to as quantum groups in recognition of their  applications in physics.  Hopf algebras are used to study  differential operators and to make combinatorics more like  calculus.",
