 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peressini  9353689    This proposal is an invited revision of an earlier NSF proposal  \"Using computer networks to provide interactive university calculus  instruction and in-service technology training for teachers in  rural and inner-city high schools\" (NSF-ID-9353689) with a reduced  budget and scope of activities.    During the past four years, a modem-based network connecting the  University of Illinois to approximately twenty-five rural and  inner-city high schools and a distance interactive instructional  strategy have evolved that are capable of delivering a college-  credit, electronic text-based calculus course, Calculus &  Mathematics, to these schools in an educationally sound and cost  effective manner.  Arrangements are now being made to sustain this  model for course delivery independent of grant funds beginning with  the 1996-97 school year.  The direct instructional costs, including  network costs, will be shared by the participating school districts  and students, while the administrative cost will be borne by the  University.    This proposal seeks funding to expand and enhance this existing  network testbed by:       1) implementing and evaluating two new networking models that  are based on ISDN or T-1 line connections and that are not only  capable of enhanced interactive course delivery, but also the  delivery of Internet instructional resources to the participating  schools;       2) designing, implementing and evaluating teacher enhancement  activities (on-site and electronic) to develop a community of  school-based personnel whose members are equipped to provide  leadership in technology-based mathematics and science education in  their schools;        3) establishing appropriate linkages between our network and  other networks here and elsewhere that are delivering mathematics  and science resources to high schools including the NSF-funded  Urban Systemic Initiative in Chicago.    The evaluation program for the project will be both formative and  summative, and will ad dress: 1) course delivery performance of the  new models with the current model; 2) effectiveness of the teacher  enhancement activities; 3) changes in the instructional environment  in the participating schomls resulting from the project.    The ultimate objective will be to develop a sustainable (i.e.  grant-independent), cost effective Internet-based network model  linking the University and the participating high schools for the  purposes of course delivery, teacher enhancement activities, and  instructional resource access.  ***",
