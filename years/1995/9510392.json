 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning theory is concerned with the rigorous study of concept classes under  well-  established criteria for learnability.  Most of the current research  focuses on expanding the  frontiers of the concept classes known to be  learnable.  Two different but related models for learning  are the probably  approximately correct (PAC) model and the exact learning model with equivalence  and  membership queries. This project derives its motivation from recent results  in exact learning with  queries and from practical considerations of limited  data available for inference.  Many concept  classes which are not efficiently  learnable with queries if cryptographic assumptions hold are  possibly exactly  learnable in a model where considerations of time-efficiency  are relaxed, but  considerations of limited data are made paramount.  Such a model is formalized  along with a discussion  of partial results.  This project concentrates on the  reinvestigation of the learnability of natural  concept classes which have been  neglected in view of known negative results.  Where possible,  efficient  learning algorithms are  developed according to both exact and PAC criteria.",
