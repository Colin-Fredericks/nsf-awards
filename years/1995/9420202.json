 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hirth    In 1992 and 1993, with NSF support, Dr. Kenneth Hirth conducted  extensive excavation at the site of Xochicalo an archaeological  site located in Mexico. Xochicalo is important because it marks  the capital of a pre-Columbian state which was a major regional  power and because a survey of surface remains indicated that it  was rich in archaeological materials. During the course of two  seasons excavation, Dr. Hirth and his team uncovered three intact  and well preserved residential compounds with rich and  undisturbed artifact assemblages. Large quantities of household  goods, domestic tools and the remains of obsidian (volcanic  glass) stone tool production were recovered. The unusual  preservation makes it possible to engage in a detailed analysis  of domestic activity patterns which usually can not be attempted  using archaeological remains and Dr. Hirth will undertake such  work with support of this grant.    Archaeologists want to understand how complex societies arose and  how they were maintailed in technologically simple societies  which lacked written language and computation systems. Evidence  has shown that societies developed systems of economic  specialization in which production took place in varied and  carefully regulated contexts and that control over this  production helped to reinforce the centralization of power which  state control requires. Obsidian played an important role in pre-  metal societies because this glasslike rock can we worked to  produce sharp cutting edges. At Xochicalco obsidian is abundant  and is present in both the residential structures and other  workshop areas. Through the analyses which Dr. Hirth plans to  conduct insight will be gained into the organization of this  important industry.    This work is significant for several reasons. It will produce  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase  our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of complex  societies.",
