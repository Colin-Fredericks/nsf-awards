 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528615  Ishii   This project develops a method to evaluate the environmental impact of  electromechanical products by focusing on modularity, material/process selection, and retirement specification.  The method will address the entire product line (families) and product changes over time (generations).  The project focuses on identifying the data and formulae necessary to evaluate reusability/recyclability.  The pertinent factors include:  (1) technology life-cycle of embedded functions;   (2) demand for reuse as service parts;  (3) value of recycle materials versus the reprocessing cost;  (4) destructive or non-destructive disassembly;  and (5) trade-off with manufacturing and service costs.  Industrial collaborators will provide validation examples in developing the method.    If successful, the project will produce an Internet accessible tool that simulates the product retirement process, identifies cost-drivers, and improves the life-cycle design.  The tool will enhance the recyclability and reusability of products, while reducing life-cycle costs and improving quality.  The method should reduce solid waste and extend the life of resources by addressing not only individual products but their families across product line and generations over time.  The project will contribute to engineering education through a graduate course on Design for Manufacturability delivered to over twenty companies through Stanford Instructional Television Network.",
