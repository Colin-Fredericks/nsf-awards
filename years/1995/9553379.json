 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553379  Mortz    In order to maintain our nation's technological leadership, young women need to be encouraged  to explore careers in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM).  Currently many middle  school girls lose interest in math and science, thus failing to take the requisite courses which  could open career options in SEM fields.  This model project is designed to counteract factors  which influence girls' decisions away from SEM fields by enrolling young women from middle  schools and their parents in monthly Saturday programs with opportunities to enjoy fun, hands-  on, SEM activities, exposing the girls and their parents to positive SEM role models, and to  providing activities designed to help the girls' parents recognize and counteract negative social  pressures.  The girls are to be chosen from three urban Denver middle schools, which serve  substantial numbers of ethnic minority or socio-economically disadvantaged families.  The  format involves eight Saturday sessions for the girls, three of which have activities for parents  and for parents and girls together.  These sessions include \"coping skills\" activities, hands-on  SEM activities, and presentations and group discussions with SEM female professionals.  The  most effective components of this program will be determined by the use of a control group and  administration of various outcome measures throughout the program.  The following formal  measures have been prepared:  student questions on knowledge and attitudes, parent questions  on knowledge and attitudes, knowledge about careers, children's self-efficacy scale, science  career predictor scale for children and the science career predicator scale for parents.    A major outcome of this study will be an evaluation of how effective a comprehensive program  of this type can be in changing the attitudes and interests of the girls, and increasing their  commitment toward taking prerequisites for pursuing SEM careers.  The project also would  evaluate effectiveness of the pro gram in changing parents' attitudes.  Informal written and verbal  evaluations of each workshop should identify the most effective activities.  Written lesson plans  and videotapes of the workshop activities can provide useful documentation for future programs.  ***",
