The  conference serve as a welcome  for students to the professional life of the mathematician and  contributes to the evolution of a  regional community of students and faculty mathematicians.  At  such a conference, students from  all four undergraduate classes experience, as presenters or as  audience members, a professional  meeting designed primarily with the students in mind.  Student  and faculty talks are included in  each session, and incorporated in our program are not only talks  that would appeal to specialists  but also talks that are accessible to freshman and sophomores.   Presentations involve research  (by students, by faculty, and by student-faculty teams), original  expositions of known results, or  description of student projects.    The first HRUMC was held at Siena College in April, 1994, and the  second is planned for April,  1995, at Siena college.  In 1996, HRUMC will be held at Skidmore  College.",
