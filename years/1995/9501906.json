The research this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward establishing an  efficient optimal design algorithm for decontamination of water  in aquifers that have been contaminated with hazardous materials.  The investigator's education plan involves development of  effective skills for teaching engineering courses and to use  those skills to enrich courses she will be responsible for  teaching.  Her goal is to bring students to a level of  understanding that allows them to analyze problems relating to  decontamination of aquifers and to design appropriative  engineering solutions to those problems.    Results of this investigator's research are likely to improve the  approaches taken toward engineering design of procedures for  decontaminating groundwater.  Her teaching plan is expected to  result in increased participation in engineering by women and  under-represented minorities.  ***",
