 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information is passed from cell to cell in the brain by functional contacts called synapses.  The rate, pattern and precise timing of those signals represent aspects of coding by the nerve cell that brings information to the synaptic junction, and so is called the pre-synaptic neuron.  The transmission to the post-synaptic neuron then determines the pattern of activity of that neuron in turn.  The synaptic transmission is not perfect, but has some factor of reliability, so that a sequence of pre-synaptic nerve impulses turnq into some sequence of post-synaptic responses that may not be identical.  This project utilizes a preparation of an isolated slice of brain tissue from the visual cortex, as a model system where individual neurons can be visualized under the microscope while electrophysiologically recording their signals.   Recordings are made simultaneously from connected pairs of neurons, identified by injected fluorescent tracers.  Results will give estimates of the reliability of this important stage of visual cortical processing, and will be important to the current controversy about bursting and oscillating activity in areas of the cortex.  These studies will have an impact not only on visual neuroscience, but also on general aspects of synaptic function, computational neuroscience, our understanding of cortical organization and perception, and even on understanding mechanisms of learning.",
