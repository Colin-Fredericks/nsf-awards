 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drawing on the research and teaching expertise of the  Museum's outstanding scientific staff, the AMNH program  provides students with a coherent, hands-on introduction to  research in systematics and evolutionary biology, areas in  which few undergraduates have a solid grounding.  Entering  into the Museum community, our students are offered an  extraordianry opportunity to step outside of their immediate  university environments, broaden their experience of  biological disciplines, and participate in the highest  caliber research at a premier academic institution.    The program is a comprehensive, interactive learning that  centers around research projects carefully designed to  introduce undergraduates to the excitement, challenge, and  relevance of systematics and comparative evolutionary  biology.  In addition to hand-on experience of research and  publication, our students participate in a comprehensive  program of round-table discussions where they discuss their  research progress and problems, \"show and tell\" their latest  findings, and thrash-out ideas in an informal and supportive  setting.  A Special Lecture Series introduces students to  eminent Museum faculty whose lectures address current  debates in systematics and contemporary evolutionary theory.  And students participate in a REU Student Seminar where they  give formal slide-illustrated presentations to a supportive,  yet critical audience of mentors and peers.",
