 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project increases the exposure of biology majors to modern  biological techniques and the research process.   Through this  grant, two new educational experiences are being added to the  biology curriculum.   The first is an upper division course in  molecular biology, which engages students in a thematic series of  laboratory experiences based on a specific research problem.    The second is a program of supervised undergraduate research,  which provides students with the opportunity to apply the tools  of recombinant DNA technology to their own investigations.    Specific hands-on applications that are being incorporated into  these two new educational opportunities include CDNA library  screening, nucleotide sequencing and computerized analysis,  reporter assays for the analysis of gene promoter function, and  the use of the Internet in scientific communication.   Given  these new opportunities, many biology majors may discover a  previously unrecognized interest in basic science and view  careers in academic and industrial science as less mysterious.",
