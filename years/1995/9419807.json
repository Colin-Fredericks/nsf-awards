 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419807  Cox-Foster    Luteoviruses are small RNA viurses that infect all major  food crops causing severe economic losses worldwide, yet  they receive relatively little attention.  To be transmitted  by the insect vector, the aphid, the virus must enter the  circulatory system through the gut and enter the salivary  gland. The work in this proposal builds on the observation  made by the principal investigators that the extracellular  glycoprotein matrix of the basal lamina surrounding the  aphid salivary gland regulates, in part, luteovirus  transmission and vector specificity.  The first objective of the work is to determine whether  species-specific components of the basal lamina associate  with transmissible viruses, but not with nontransmissible  ones.  The second objective is to identify specific surface  domains on the virion protein capsid that interact with the  basal lamina and function as virus-specific recognition  sites permitting virus attachment and pentration into the  salivary gland.  Since almost nothing is known about virion  penetration of the extracellular matrix components which  comprise the basal lamina, the proposed work may give  fundamental insight into the mechanism by which large  protein aggregates, such as virions, actively move across  these semipermeable barriers which would otherwise exclude  them on the basis of size.  %%%  If the underlying hypothesis on basement membrane  recognition is correct, the research is likely to make a  major impact on our understanding of luteovirus biology and  basement membrane fucntion.  It would, furthermore, likely  lead to new strategies to interfere with luteovirus life  cycle, impacting on a significant agricultural problem.  ***",
