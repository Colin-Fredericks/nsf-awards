Measurements of velocity at a single  point are seldom sufficient in nature; when only single-point  velocimeters are available, profiling is employed to obtain  information regarding structures of a flow-field. Profile  information has invariably been derived by mechanical traversing of  a sensor 'head'.  Not only is synopticity sacrificed in this  manner, causing loss of order in structure data, but also all  information on spatial structures, coherent motions, and space-time  scales is lost. Driven by needs in his research, the P.I. has  devised a multi-point velocimetry system which forms several sample  volumes in the flow field simultaneously. Signals from these sample  volumes are separately carried to photo-detectors.  A multi-signal  processor is then required to convert the signal to simultaneous-  multi-point velocity data, retaining information on order inherent  in the flow, and all information for deriving space-time scales of  fluid structures.  In Phase-I, we have successfully demonstrated  the principle of the method by constructing a single-velocity-  component multi-point velocimeter, as first explained in the Phase-  I proposal.  In Phase-II, we shall expand capabilities to a 2-axis  multi-point velocimeter, with direction discrimination optics and  a complete multi-signal processor. The instrument will be tested in  the laboratory and the field.",
