Two types of projects will be offered: five-  week summer projects for students who have completed their  sophomore year and year-long projects for students who have  completed their junior year.  Students will be paired with faculty  from their home institutions to assure oversight and suppmrt during  the academic year.  Both the supporting faculty and the minority  students will participate in the annual Keck Research Symposium in  Geology.  Past experience in this program indicates that these  students will continue successfully into post-baccalaureate  education and/or careers in geology.",
