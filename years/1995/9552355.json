Several goals of our core curriculum aim at educating WCCC students  to become computer literate, to develop critical thinking and  problem solving skills and to learn to work as a team. Through the  National Science Foundation (NSF~ grant, computer, printers,  software, and other multimedia material can be purchased to equip  each Biology lab on each of the 4 academic campuses. Thus, our  students will be able to enhance their abilities and become  competent and confident with using a computer and other  instrumentation. In addition, the software will allow the students  and instructor to simulate real life problems i.e., B/P readings,  temperature, heart rate and plot graphs as well as many other lab  simulations.",
