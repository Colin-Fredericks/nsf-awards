 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1995 Aspen Winter Elementary Particle Physics Conference  will, for the first time, devote a fourth week, January 22-  28, 1995, to a conference on Gravitational Waves and their  Detection.  The Conference provides for approximately 65  participants, six days of close interaction where problems  and recent results can be discussed in detail.    The Aspen Winter Conference on Gravitational Waves and Their  Detection has several aims.  One of these is to involve  physicists from other fields.  To this end, physicists from  the frequency stabilization, quantum optics and elementary  particle physics communities will participate.  In order to  familiarize the newcomers with the status and aims of the  field, the program will begin with overviews of  gravitational wave physics, of astrophysical sources, and of  detectors such as interferometers, resonant bars and space  based detectors.  Another aim is to bring together  gravitational physicists who have varying perspectives on  how to best accomplish the task of detecting gravitational  waves.  The program, will thus include detailed discussions  of acoustic detectors-both bar and spherical, as well as a  historical perspective.",
