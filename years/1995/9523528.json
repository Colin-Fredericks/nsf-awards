In the spirit and in  consideration of past involvement  of the US-China Earthquake  Engineering Program, meetings and  coordinated visits are organized  for an official Chinese Earthquake  Engineering Research Delegation in  August 1995.  The Chinese  delegation is assembled by the  Chinese Ministry of Construction,  NSF's counterpart in Annex III of  the US-PRC Earthquake Protocol,  which was just officially extended  for five more years until January  23, 2000.    This project is supported as a part  of the Agreement of Annex III to  the U.S./P.R.C. Protocol for  Scientific and Technical  Cooperative Research Earthquake  Studies on earthquake engineering  and hazards mitigation for the  purpose of international  cooperative  exchange.  ***",
