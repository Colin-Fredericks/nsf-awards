 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420424              Prosodic Morphology (PM) is the study of how prosody plays a  role in word formation. Prosody deals with the structure of  syllables and the larger units into which they are grouped,  stress-feet and phonological words. Prosody impinges on word  formation in various ways, but particularly conspicuously in  phenomena like reduplication.        Optimality Theory (OT) is a model of how constraints on  linguistic form interact with one another. A fundamental notion  in OT is the idea that constraints are ranked with respect to one  another, and that constraints are violated when violation leads  to satisfaction of a higher-ranking constraint. Because it is a  very general approach to constraint interaction, and because it  can deal with the interaction of very diverse constraints (such  as constraints on prosody and constraints on morphology), OT is a  particularly apt framework to apply to PM.       The goal of this project is to study the areas where the  theory of PM intersects with OT. Preliminary results strongly  indicate that each of these theories will lead to a better  understanding of the other, and that the two together will shed  new light on linguistic phenomena. Based on previous work, a  number of likely hypotheses and potentially productive research  questions have been identified. These hypotheses and questions  will be studied through extensive empirical investigation of  phenomena like reduplication, infixation, root-and-pattern  morphology, and morphological truncation. Both cross-language  surveys and intensive study of the systems of particular  languages will be undertaken. The results will be reported in  several articles and, at the conclusion of the project, in a  monograph summarizing all of the material.",
