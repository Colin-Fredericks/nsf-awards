It involves the development of   algorithms and, where needed, supporting theory. Issues that are  addressed include blocking in mixture experiments, avoiding  undesirable level combinations in factorial experiments, and  converting a given block design to a trend-free or nearly trend-free   version of that design. A critical concept is a generalization of the  idea of trade-off in block designs.    Designed experiments are essential in most industrial experiments and   in many areas of scientific research. It is almost always crucial to   use limited available resources efficiently, and to assure that the  collected data can be used to answer questions of interest reliably.   Areas of application include experiments for product quality   assessment and improvement in industrial production processes, and   experiments for quantitative research in, for example, agricultural   sciences, social sciences, and engineering disciplines. Much of the  research in design of experiments concentrates on identifying  efficient designs for a specific problem, often not broad enough to  be relevant for more than one area of application. The usefulness  of previous work has at times been limited by restrictions on the  results induced by the mostly mathematical tools used to derive  the results. Application of some of these methods has also suffered  from the mathematical sophistication that is required from a user.   The investigator develops new methods and algorithms to find   efficient designs for various specific problems. These algorithms,   which can be implemented easily with existing computer software,   facilitate use of the new methods, and do not require any   mathematical sophistication of a user.",
