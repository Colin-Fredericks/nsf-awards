The reason for such a new  laboratory is to transform the laboratory into one of a greater  creativity, student involvement, and relevance.  The course is a  one year non-calculus based physics course for students with  prehealth and life science majors at the University of Southern  California (USC).  This course has high attendance with an annual  enrollment greater than 330 students increasing at the rate of 10%  per year.  While this course attempts to present physics in an  interesting way, the experiments are classical and are not  particularly related to the primary interests of our students.   This lack of relevance impedes the learning process.  The new  laboratory program has three components: new mechanics experiments  with increased student participation and involvement, fluid  mechanics experiments due to their importance for life sciences,  and electrophysics measurements on living systems, primitive  animals and finally the students themselves.  The new laboratory,  which is highly relevant to the primary interest of the students,  will be designed to achieve high student participation and interest  in physics.  It will be instrumented with high accuracy sensors and  their accompanying electronics.  The training of the students in  the use of such devices will be beneficial to them in preparing for  their professional careers.",
