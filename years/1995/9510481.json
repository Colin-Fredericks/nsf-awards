 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lori A. Vermeulen, Chemistry Department, Southern Illinois   University, is supported under a Research Planning Grant for Women   Scientists and Engineers by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the study   of supramolecular materials. A new electrochemical reduction of silicon   and germanium chlorides will be developed as a route to the preparation   of silicon and germanium based polymers. This technique will permit the   preparation of polymers with well defined cross linking and with   controlled structural and photophysical properties. Additionally, layered   metal phosphonate thin films with organized donor/acceptor multilayers   will be prepared and studied as potential solar energy conversion and   storage devices.  The development of new materials for energy storage and conversion   systems, non-linear optical devices, and molecular electronic devices   demands substances in which the constituent atoms are well defined and   ordered in specific ways. In this project new techniques will be devised   for synthesizing polymers in which chains of silicon and/or germanium   atoms form specific three dimensional networks. Further, techniques of   preparing thin films composed of layers of metal and non-metal atoms will   be developed. Both of these new materials will have important energy   conversion or optical properties.",
