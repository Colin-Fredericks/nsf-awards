 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552593  Maly    Building on its expertise in networking, computer supported  collaborative work, and remote learning, Old Dominion University  will prepare to build a statewide highly Interactive Remote  Instruction (IRI) testbed based on networked workstations.  Technology and pedagogical methods developed in testbed will be  integrated into TELETECHNET, a state funded program in which Old  Dominion University and community colleges will provide four-year  programs.  The first two years will be taught at the community  colleges with the last two being provided by Old Dominion  University to remote community college campuses via networked and  televised course instructions.  The project will consist of a one-  year preparatory phase, covered by this proposal, and a three-year  phase of research, development, and implementation to be covered by  a follow-on proposal.    Significant contributions of the proposed one-year project include:  1) refining an existing IRI prototype to provide an open-ended  teaching/learning environment with a set of basic features easy to  use by students and faculty of all disciplines; 2) developing the  basic concepts of new instructional methods to exploit the  interactivity of the system in support of higher domains of  learning; and 3) preparing to bring together a consortium of  government, industry and academic individuals who are   dedicated to innovative approaches to education for the 21st  century. This will lay the foundation in providing Virginia with a  cost-effective method of delivering high quality education remotely  in support of some of the 50,000 additional students expected to  enroll in Virginia's public colleges and universities by the year  2001.    The proposed hardware/software architectures use existing  technologies but anticipate the wider availability of a high-speed  Information superhighway and multimedia workstations in the near  future.  The architecture provides an open environment in which  many types of teaching materials and inst ructional software can be  incorporated.  The prototype provides two-way video to remote  sites; shared operation of X-window tools and applications;  interactive note-taking; a VCR-like replay of past classes and  ancillary material and a full motion video window which can display  the instructor, a classroom demonstration, or any PC, Macintosh or  X-window application.    This instructional capability goes beyond traditional TV courses  and traditional classrooms by enabling instructors and students to  access multimedia generated from a variety of sources and to use  group collaboration tools for interaction between two participants,  among small groups, or entire classes.  The system will provide  audio-visual interaction and allow faculty and remote-site students  to share the manipulation of software tools, such as spreadsheets  or chemistry models.  While the elements of IRI are currently  technically feasible, a major portion of the project's efforts are  directed to the developing of new student-centered teaching methods  and paradigms which take advantage of the environment and to  refining the hardware and software through experience of actual  instructional needs. Key to the success of our approach is an  interface which students and faculty from all disciplines can use  with intimal training.  This system will provide access to higher  education, not only for traditional students, who for personal or  financial reasons choose not to reside at a four-year institution.   IRI will promote effective use of network and computer technology  for all participating students and faculty.  Exposure to  technology-enabled interaction will help prepare students for the  challenges of increased global competitiveness.    Old Dominion University will consider the total project a success  in developing a long-term self-sustaining system if half the  TELETECHNET courses use IRI within five years, both faculty and  students accept and benefit from this mode of teaching as  demonstrated with such metr ics as cost satisfaction and there is an  increase in the number of students completing four-year degrees.   We will consider the one-year phase successful if we shall have  used a version of the IRI system in a real class environment and  identified the problems in that version.  ***",
