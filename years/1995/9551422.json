 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the environment and the many factors that must, of  necessity, contribute to decisions regarding the management of  the environment, depend on one's ability to access stored data.   The most effective way to make sense of this type of data is with  the system called Geographic Information Systems (GIS).   GIS is  an essential tool in the management of spacially distributed  information.   The students of today are the managers of  tomorrow; they must, therefore, be familiar with GIS.   This  project funds the software and instrumentation necessary for  students to learn the GIS applications.   In order to learn how  to use a data management system, students need to connect the  learning with a real-life application.   This project introduces  students to the GIS system in three introductory geology courses.    The courses have a steady high enrollment, they are populated by  students within the geology major and well as from other majors,  and they are popular choices to fulfill the college's general  education science requirements.",
