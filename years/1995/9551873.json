 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving and upgrading the Electronics  Engineering Technology laboratory in order to provide  undergraduate students with high quality laboratory experiments  and exercises in the area of Digital Design and Advanced  Microprocessors.   The ultimate aim is to improve student  understanding of basic and advanced digital/microprocessor  technology by providing quality education in this field.   To  meet the challenges of the digital industry and to better prepare  students for the \"real world\", it is essential that students  should be well-versed in the use of commercially available  digital CAD tools (including hardware description languages) and  modern workstations.   This affords students the opportunity to  see the conceived hardware as a working model.  The project is  replacing the old Digital Design course with two new courses,  Digital Design 1 and 2, and adding a third course in Advanced  Microprocessors.   The addition of these courses is significantly  strengthening and improving the entire curriculum in electronics  engineering technology.   Other courses including Advanced  Electronics 1 and 2, the Senior Capstone Technology Project, and  Automatic Controls & Instrumentation  also directly benefit from  this project.   The laboratory contains six modern workstations,  four PC 's, four logic analyzers, and four In-Circuit  Microprocessor Emulators.   This project has the potential to  advance scientific education beyond the local setting.",
