The principal users are members of the Department of Molecular           Genetics and Cell Biology. The research themes of the users are united by interests in           gene organization and regulation, with the organisms being studied including bacteria,           yeast, and plants. The bacterial work concentrates on the photosynthetic Anabaena           bacteria. More than 1,000 genes are being studied whose expression is differentially           induced by the production of heterocysts. Yeast work is concentrating on regions of the           chromosomes that are relatively silent in gene expression and the identification of other           genes that can induce expression in the silent regions. The plant work is primarily on           Arabidopsis, where genes required for interaction between pollen grains and the pistil           during fertilization are being identified. Genes from other organisms that have similar           DNA base sequences are being isolated and sequenced. A gene family that codes for the           chloroplast processing enzyme is being identified. This family is responsible for enabling           proteins to enter the chloroplasts, where photosynthesis occurs. Finally, genes from           wheat that are involved in herbicide resistance are being sequenced in order to see how           they differ from the genes in sensitive plants.           %%%           The sequencing being carried out with this machine is important for our understanding of           bacterial development, gene expression in yeast, and mechanisms of herbicide resistance           in crop plants.           ***",
