The long-term goal of this research is  to understand the physiological regulation of ion channels in the  cardiovascular system.  The identification of the mechanism  underlying sympathetic modulation of the cardiac L-type Ca2+  channel is a key step in achieving this goal.  Specific aims are:  (1) To establish an useful expression system in which the molecular  events which govern  AR/L-type Ca2+ channel interactions can be  deducted; (2) To define the relative contribution of  -adrenergic  subtypes ( 1AR and  2AR) to cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel regulation.   The receptor subtype-specific regulation (both direct and indirect  responses) will be compared in transfected cells; and (3) To  investigate, at the molecular level, the regions of the  AR which  are critical for subtype-specific interactions with the Ca2+  channel.  %%%  The long-term goal of this research is to understand the  physiological regulation of ion channels in the cardiovascular  system.  The research will take advantage of the cloning of the  distinct beta-adrenergic receptor ( AR) subtypes and of the cardiac  Ca2+ channel, and examine directly the regulatory mechanisms of    AR on the Ca2+  channel at the molecular level.  The results  obtained from this research will serve as an initial data base for  a more thorough study of the physiological regulation of ion  channels.  ***",
