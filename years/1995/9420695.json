 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420695  Watts    Underground pipelines and storage tank systems can develop leaks  over time and cause significant environmental damage.  A number of  Government Agencies have jointly recognized this concern and are  joining together to facilitate a research and development program  to be undertaken jointly by the New Jersey Institute of  Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Emission Reduction and Iowa State University's Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation.    This proposal address the initiation phase of an envisaged broad  scope, multi-year project.    The Emission Reduction Research Center (ERRC) will be responsible  for the interface with he sponsoring Agencies, EPA, DOE, DOD, and  NSF.  ERRC is conducting a needs assessment, with particular  emphasis on environmental and regulatory compliance issues.  These  initial activities are to identify existing leak detection/leak  location equipment; assess modifications to regulatory and  operating needs; develop experimental plan leading to  modifications; and develop bench scale studies leading to new  technologies and protocols.  All field testing will utilize the  pipeline systems at the EPA UST/Pipeline Test Apparatus in Edison,  New Jersey.    The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation is responsible for  assessment of technology, based initially on the existing EPA  technology and literature information.  This Center will survey  industry consensus on the effectiveness of available technologies  and conduct experimental studies of current acoustic emission  techniques.    The researchers are fully qualified to perform these studies.    Funding for this project is being provided by EPA, DOE, DOD and  NSF.  Dr. Ken P. Chong, Program Director of the Structural Systems  and Construction Processes Program, provided the NSF funds.    The Program Manager recommends New Jersey Institute of Technology  be awarded $348,440 for one year for its portion of this project  with funds pr ovided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S.  Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation.",
