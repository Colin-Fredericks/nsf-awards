 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523809   Irani    This research focuses on the development of hybrid shop floor layout based on  cellular manufacturing concept. Hybrid layout refers to a layout with both dedicated and shared machine cells. In cellular manufacturing, parts and machines are formed into  clusters. Parts in the same cluster constitute a family. The machines in a cluster are formed into a  machine cell. A machine cell is dedicated to the processing of  parts in the same part-machine  cluster. The aim is to form cells that are independent and having no intercell material flow. This approach differs from the traditional method, which emphasized independent cells for all part families, by developing a functional cell, for machines shared by multiple parts families, and placing machines, that are not shared by multiple parts families, into dedicated cells. Hybrid layouts will  be developed based on the use of an heuristic algorithm for machine-part matrix clustering. The algorithm will integrate a number of search strategies including string matching and tabu search. The subsequent layout will be tested using simulation. In addition, scheduling rules for machine and material handling will be developed to support the simulation analysis. The suitability of VLSI CAD  algorithms for generating these hybrid layouts also will be investigated, and industrial data will be used to validate these layout methodologies.   The project presents a different  perspective or look at the cellular machine layout problem. In the traditional cellular layout  problem, creation of independent machine cells with shared machines duplicated over multiple cells is the norm. This research advocates the creation of a functional cell for shared machines instead of  machine duplication.  The results of the research may make it easier to create virtual  machining cells to support such modern production concept as agile or lean manufacturing.  Improved material handling systems planning and control are critical to the competitiveness of our nation's  economic system. The outcome of this research will increase use of  material handling and layout systems planning, design, and control algorithms. This will enhance material flow and will improve production time on the shop floor.",
