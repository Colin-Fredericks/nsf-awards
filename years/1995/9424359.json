 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continuing research of Jason Rush at the  University of Washington. In prior work, Rush introduced a family  of metrics, the use of which has led to improvement of the  Minkowski-Hlawka lower bounds on lattice packing density for  various families of bodies in Euclidean n-space. In this project,  he will continue the study of properties of these metrics and  their application to problems of constructing dense lattice  packings for additional types of geometric bodies, to multiple  packing and covering, and to the construction of error-correcting  codes.     This research is in the field of  the geometry of numbers. The  geometry of numbers is a blending of number theory - the study of  properties of the whole numbers - and the geometry of variously  shaped bodies in Euclidean n-space. An example of a fundamental  problem in this field is the determination of what configuration  of spheres in Euclidean n-space will contain the maximum possible  volume. Such sphere packings are closely related to efficient  error-correcting codes, such as those used to store data on  compact discs, and also have applications to problems in  information transmission which occur for example in the  construction of modems.",
