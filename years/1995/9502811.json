 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brian Laird is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the theory of solid-liquid   interfaces.  Molecular dynamics simulations of solid-liquid interfaces   will be performed for a variety of materials using both idealized and   realistic models.  Existing density-functional theories will be evaluated   in light of the simulation results and modified in order to correct   observed deficiencies in an attempt to extend the level of theory to   materials displaying long range intermolecular interactions and   multi-component systems.  The long term objective of the research project   is to understand, at a microscopic level, the solid-liquid interface of a   variety of materials, primarily mixtures (alloys),  and molecular systems   with orientationally dependent interactions.  Most crystals of current technological interest,  such as semiconductors,   metals and alloys, are grown from the melt, and information on the   microscopic structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of such interfaces is   of fundamental importance in studies of crystal growth and homogeneous   nucleation.  A better molecular level understanding of the solid-liquid   interface in such systems could help to produce better defect-free single   crystals of such technologically important materials.",
