 "awd_abstract_narration": "For four weeks during the summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998, Jackson  State University will conduct the JSU-Summer Science Camps for  fifty rising seventh and eighth grade black students.  The students  will be exposed to life science, physical science, mathematics,  computer science, and communication skills in an intensive four-  week residential summer session.  This exposure will take the form  of classroom instruction and laboratory activities, e.g.,  demonstrations and experiments.  These activities will involve  individual as well as group interaction with communication skills  (oral and written), applications of mathematical concepts, computer  applications, and laboratory experimentation and demonstrations.    Participants will identify either an individual or group science  project with guidance from faculty mentors.  Once the project has  been identified the faculty will work with students in four major  areas--research, laboratory work, problem-solving, and computer  skills.  Students will attend seminars and go on field trips.  This  will provide opportunities to interact with practicing scientist  and observe activities at the planned site visits.    During the school year, students will come to Jackson State  University once a month on a Saturday to participate in scheduled  activities and continue to develop their science fair project with  assistance from their faculty mentor.  ***",
