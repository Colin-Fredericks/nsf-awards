 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development of a method for analyzing the structure and orientation  of molecular species at buried interfaces.  During the tenure of  this three-year continuing grant, Professor Rowlen and her students  at the University of Colorado will apply the newly developed  technique of angle-resolved photoacoustic spectroscopy (ARPAS) to  parallel studies of the relationship between the chemical nature of  molecules and their orientation at surfaces and in thin films.  In  the first, the orientation of a variety of phenylazo dyes within  zirconium phosphonate interlayers will be investigated and compared  with each layer's nonlinear optical characteristics.  Additionally,  the relatively slow kinetics of orientational relaxation will be  investigated for phenylazo dyes trapped within the transparent  polymer matrix of an optical waveguide.  In the second study, which  focusses on understanding retention in liquid chromatography, the  question of phase transitions within covalently immobilized  alkylsilanes will be addressed by monitoring the degree of  orientation as a function of temperature and solvent overlayer.   Also during this grant period, Professor Rowlen will pursue an  educational development plan that includes course development,  acquisition of equipment for teaching laboratories, increased  opportunities for undergraduate research participation, and  introduction of industrial research internships for both  undergraduate and graduate students.    A method for analyzing the structure and orientation of molecular  species at buried interfaces is of considerable technological  importance.  In this CAREER research project, angle-resolved  photoacoustic spectroscopy will be used to develop new insights  into  molecular structure and orientation of phenylazo dyes and  alkylsilane thin films that could lead to improved design of  organic-based optical waveguides and  also to an improved  understanding of retention in liquid chromatography.  The  educational development aspects of this CAREER project should  enrich and broaden the chemistry educational experience of  University of Colorado students.",
