 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer laboratory projects are being introduced in all sections  of  the basic multivariable calculus course at the University  of  Michigan  (1500-1700 students per year). The  computer  is  being  used  as  a  discovery  tool. The projects'  main  features  are:  promotion   of   active   learning   and   hands-on   experience,  visualization  through  computer graphics,  gradually  introduced  Maple  syntax, furtherance of conceptual understanding,  critical  thinking, and quantitative reasoning.    Several  activities  are included in the project:  to  develop  a  library  of  laboratory projects (long term: each project  is  to  culminate  with  a  problem  applied  to  science,  economics  or  engineering);  to  develop  and  implement  cooperative  learning  techniques in the computer laboratory environment; to develop and  implement  motivational material suitable for feedback techniques  in  large lecture classes, using a workstation in every classroom  connected to an LCD plate; to write TA and instructor manuals and  videotapes,  and  to create an intensive TA and Faculty  training  program.    The  composition  of  the  student  body  is  very  diverse.  The  materials  are  being  written with the consideration  that  some  students  have  no  prior computer experience. Diversity  in  the  cooperative groups will strengthen them.",
