 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buller  95-54472    This project will provide interested Native American communities and schools with relevant technology infrastructure, training for use of the technology in the community and in mathematics and science education, training to maintain the hardware during and beyond the project, on-going technical assistance, technology needs-assessment assistance through community-school alliances formulated through the project, and a variety of data bases containing relevant information to Native Americans. Specifically, this project has three interrelated objectives: 1 ) Provide infrastructure technology in rural and reservation communities and schools in 15 Native American communities (5 per year). This objective includes needsassessments, installation, training, and technical assistance to develop their own wide area network; 2) Improve K- 12 mathematics and science education through the access and use of the Internet. This objective includes preparing teams of educators and community members in the use of the Internet to improve teaching and learning as well as daily living. This project will prepare 150 K- 12 teachers (50 per year) and 75 community members (25 per year) in 15-20 Native American communities nationwide. Action Plans for use of the Internet in the classroom will be developed and follow-up site visits will occur; and, 3) Establish and maintain a variety of data bases and specialized bulletin boards.    Participants who lack local access to the Internet will access it via 1-800 numbers through the Electronic Pathways server funded by NSF in 1995 and housed and maintained at the University of Colorado, Boulder Computer Center. The project also includes a three-pronged approach to its evaluation: 1 ) Implementation Evaluation; 2) Progress Evaluation; and 3) Summative Evaluation. Experts in technology and program evaluation will evaluate the project. Sustainability has been addressed from the beginning of the development of this project with input into its development by numerous  Native and non-Native American individuals with expertise in technology, Indian Education, teacher enhancement, mathematics and science, and community development. A critical component in this project is the exploration with the end-users of the potential cultural implications of the technology they will be employing. These discussions will occur prior to installation of any hardware. Also, Electronic Pathways is committed to training Native Americans in the technology and related aspects of this project and will include 12 interns (four annually) in the program.",
