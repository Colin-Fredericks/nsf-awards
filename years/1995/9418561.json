 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418561  Ge    Fluid flow, rock deformation , heat transfer, and ;mass transport  are coupled processes in deforming geologic systems.  The coupled  effects among these factors have been recognized for their  importance in thrust faulting, ore formation, metamorphism, and  lubrication of faults during earthquakes.  One or more of the  coupling processes are often simplified or overlooked.  A fully  coupled numerical model will be developed and applied to study and  physical interaction processes in two geologic settings:  sedimentary basins and accretionary prisms.  As new features, heat  and mass transport are coupled with tectonic deformation, hydraulic  permeability is considered a functions of stress and time, and  tectonic loading is simulated as a gradual process rather than an  instantaneous event.  There are two main objectives of this study.  The first is to  construct a generic model to solve the coupled equations of  deformation , fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transport in  geologic medial.  The second is to apply the model to study two  geologic systems: a sedimentary foreland basin, the Arkoma Basin in  Arkansas, and an accretionary prism, the Barbados Accretionary  Complex.  This research will improve current understanding of the  processes involving heat and mass transport in fluids during the  history of the tectonic evolution.  The application to the  sedimentary basin provides a quantitative connection between  tectonic events, fluid migration, and ore deposition.  The  application to the accretionary prism will contribute to the on-  going efforts to explain the thermal and chemical anomalies  observed in the Ocean Drilling Programs.  The work combines analytical scaling, numerical modeling, and case  studies.  Scaling analysis of the governing equations identifies  the relative importance of different coupling mechanisms under  simplified conditions.  The numerical modeling provides detail  solution to the coupled processes under more complicated and  realistic geologic  conditions.  The generic simulations will be  designed to test sensitivities of hydrologic, mechanical, and  thermal parameters.",
