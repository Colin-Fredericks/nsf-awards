 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a model to be a workable component of a parallel  processing system, it must be scalable.  Researchers often  design algorithms so  that the assumed machine size for  running the algorithm grows with the problem  size. (This  is particularly the case with algorithms for  reconfigurable  busbased models.)  A physical machine size  is, of course, fixed.  For a  scalable model, however, the  arbitrary sized machine for running the algorithm  can be  mapped to the smaller physical machine that actually  solves the problem  without loss of efficiency.  A compiler  can perform this mapping, so algorithm  designers and  programmers can design algorithms for arbitrary size  machines  and need not design different algorithms or write  programs for different sized  problems.    No reconfigurable bus-based model is known to be scalable,  however, unless its computational power is significantly  reduced. To better  understand the extent to which these  models are scalable, the investigator is  less restrictive  than traditional scalability.    This research will  investigate scalability of two main  types of reconfigurable bus-based models,  namely, the  Reconfigurable Mesh (R-Mesh) and the Reconfigurable  Multiple Bus  Machine (RMBM).  The RMBM comprises four  versions:  the B-RMBM, S-RMBM,F-RMBM,  and E-RMBM.  The  investigators have previously established relative  scalability results for the S-RMBM and for `separable`  algorithms of the  E-RMBM, the most powerful version.  The  research will seek to investigate  scalability of general E-  RMBM algorithms and study different scalability  approaches  for different ranges in the relationship of simulated to  available  machine sizes. Scalability questions for the R-  Mesh will also be investigated.  These will include  relative scalability and scalability of certain classes of  algorithms, topics not yet examined for the RMesh, and  extensive attempts at  complete scalability of the RMesh, a  topic that has received only to narrow  attention in the  past.   Scalability questions will also be studied for  directional versions of the R-Mesh and RMBM, which have  proven particularly  useful for directed graph algorithms.",
