 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of Facilities for Structure  Determination and Analysis             Due to parallel developments in molecular biology,  instrumentation, and computers, the field of structural  biology has been growing at an explosive rate over the past  5 years. This has been manifested both by a significant  increase in the productivity of existing researchers and a  tremendous growth in the number of the active research  groups.  Several units at The Johns Hopkins University have  been active participants in this growth. Building on a long-  standing history in X-ray crystallography, the Department of  Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry at The Johns Hopkins  University School of Medicine has grown from three faculty  members in 1990 to seven in 1995, all of whom are actively  involved in macromolecular structure determination and  analysis. In addition, united by the Institute for  Biophysical Research on Macromolecular Assemblies, founded  through a National Science Foundation Biological Research  Center grant in 1989, a much larger group of researchers  throughout the School of Medicine, the School of Hygiene and  Public Health, and on the Homewood Campus in the School of  Arts and Sciences  and the Engineering School, are pursuing research and  training young scientists in this area. With this large  number of active researchers, our needs for instrumentation  have continued to grow.  The powerful methods of gene  cloning, protein expression, and biomolecular synthesis have  greatly increased the number of important problems that can  be addressed at a detailed structural level. This explosion  has increased the demands on instrumentation infrastructure.  With over 20 currently active crystallographic projects and  a number of others in earlier stages of development, our  current facilities for data collection, data processing,  structure refinement, and structural analysis are no longer  adequate. In the same way, both the power of computer  modeling techniques and our faculty  representation in this  area have increased. Our ability to carry out both  computer modeling and crystallographic and NMR structural  calculations is increasingly limited by our present computer  facilities. Access to these facilities and their inherent  speed have become rate limiting in our research efforts.             To address these issues, the acquisition of a new  high performance computer system and an additional X-ray  diffraction position sensitive detector are proposed. The  computer system, such as the Silicon Graphics Power  Challenge XL system, will provide a ten-fold (or greater)  increase in computation speed with parallel increases in  memory and data storage capabilities over our current  facility. Such an increase will remove current impediments  to structure refinement and will make accessible computer-  based approaches to important problems in macromolecular  folding, dynamics, and thermodynamics that are currently out  of reach. Examples include calculations of  side chain entropies at individual sites within structurally  characterized proteins, Monte Carlo calculations related to  protein folding and to the properties of unfolded peptides  and proteins, and molecular dynamics simulations of membrane  proteins including ion channels. The detector system, such  as an R-Axis II imaging plate system, will increase the rate  at which structural problems of current interest can be  solved and will allow development of new projects that are  not being actively pursued due to limited detector time at  present. These projects include proteins and proteins  fragments involved in interactions with DNA, in mediating  cell-cell interactions, and in catalyzing important  metabolic processes. Both systems will significantly improve  the training environment for graduate students and  postdoctoral fellows in macromolecular structure  determination and analysis methods both as part of our  graduate training programs which include formal courses in X-  ray crystallography and in molecul ar modeling methods and as  part of research laboratory experience.",
