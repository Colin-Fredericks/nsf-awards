 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421695  William F. Collins      The ability of the central nervous system cells to reconfigure  their structure and contacts as result of environmental or chemical  queues is paramount to learning, memory, behavior and brain  function, in general.  Reconstruction occurring in the central  nervous system is defined as plasticity.  Moreover, the impact of  gonadal hormones, such as androgens, on brain structure and  function is only beginning to become evident.  However, other  studies suggest that these powerful hormones are essential for the  normal function of neurons and their loss results in atrophy and  cell loss.  Dr. Collins will use a well-characterized motoneuron  model system to explore the anatomical and electrophysiological  consequences of gonadal androgen deficiency on central nervous  system motoneurons.   Initially, Dr. Collins will assess the  electrophysiological properties of motoneurons and their anatomical  structure before and after androgen withdrawal, in some cases up to  6 months after the last exposure to androgens.  Specifically,  androgen dependence among dendrites will be examined.  Finally, Dr.  Collins will examine the efficacy of synaptic inputs to the  identified motoneurons by electrically driving presynaptic cells  and assess their post-synaptic influence in the presence or absence  of androgens.  These studies will reveal novel mechanisms of  steroid hormone action on brain motoneurons and begin to elucidate  mechanisms of androgen-dependent neuron plasticity.  While little  is understood about the role of neural plasticity in brain  function, gonadal steroid hormones are effective in their ability  to reorganize the critical brain centers that may be essential for  such critical tasks as learning and memory in man and all species  alike.",
