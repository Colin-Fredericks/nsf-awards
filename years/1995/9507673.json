 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Helen Pollard will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research in the Lake Patzcuaro basin in the west-central highlands of Mexico. This project follows on previous work designed to document the rise and nature of the Tarascan state which emerged during the Postclassic period (AD 900-1520). Despite the fact that the Tarascan Empire was the second largest and most powerful state at the time of European contact, extremely little archaeological data is available and most of what is currently known falls within the realm of legend. Dr.Pollard will focus attention on the role of elites in state emergence and will determine the demographic, economic and political resources available to this group during the period of political and economic transformation associated with the emergence of the state. To accomplish these goals the project will: conduct a 100% surface survey of the region, including agriculturally related areas; conduct limited test excavations at larger centers; produce detailed maps; conduct field laboratory analysis of all archaeological material within the survey region. On this basis it should be possible to: determine changes in population size and the nature of settlements; determine the location and potential significance in the use of agrarian resources; determine changes in elite social identification within different centers and changes in social boundaries over time.   The Tarascan state is marked by the incorporation of three distinct political entities into a single group. Dr. Pollard has hypothesized that the reason for this rests with environmental changes which resulted in drought and increased pressure on available agricultural lands. She thus wishes to examine the process of climate change and human response. Archaeological evidence indicates that the emergence of elite social groups is closely tied to the development of complex societies and the Tarascan case offers the opportunity to study elite behavior before during and after this period of environmental fluxuation and incorporation into the larger state.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our understanding of the relationship between environmental change and the development of social complexity and provide training for the students who will participate in the project.",
