 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506089  Rothman    This proposal will investigate the molecular processes required for  establishment of a complete organ, the intestine, during  embryogenesis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This organ is  clonally derived from a single, exclusive progenitor called the E  cell, in the seven cell embryo and constitutes the entire endoderm.  A genomic region required zygotically to produce the intestine has  been identified in a screen of genetic deficiencies (deletions).  The relevant locus, referred to as the end-1 gene, was localized to  a DNA fragment that rescues the gut differentiation defect of the  deficiencies and of a putative point mutant. The end-1 gene will be  expressed ectopically to assess whether it is sufficient to promote  intestinal differentiation from non-intestinal precursor cells.  Gene fusion constructs and antibody to the end-1 product will be  made to characterize when and where the gene is expressed during  embryogenesis and where its product is localized within cells.  Interactions between end-1 and maternal genes required for normal  specification of the intestine will be examined by characterizing  double mutants and analyzing expression of end-1 in maternal  mutants. These studies will assist in understanding the molecular  function of the end-1 gene product in specifying an entire organ,  the intestine, thereby elucidating molecular processes that specify  the identity of a single organ and a single germ layer during  animal development.  ***",
