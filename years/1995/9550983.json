 "awd_abstract_narration": "In view of the rapidly growing applications of ultrasound and  optics (lasers in particular) in research, industry, and  medicine, it is imperative to give students some hands-on  experience with these techniques.   Ultrasonic and optical waves  are alike in the sense that they both belong to wave-related  phenomena.   This project funds the purchase of the equipment  necessary to develop a modern undergraduate laboratory in  wave-related phenomena, which can eventually replace obsolete  equipment in the Mechanics and Optics Laboratory.     In this  laboratory, four novel experiments that cover basic linear and  nonlinear wave phenomena are taught.   They are (1) interaction  between light and sound; (2) ultrasonic Doppler effect used in  medicine; (3) radiation force and optical tweezers; and (4) chaos  and solitons.   The primary purpose of these experiments is to  teach students physical principles.   Students also learn how to  apply these principles to challenges in real life.    Additionally, students have the opportunity to learn computerized  data-acquisition and analysis techniques, which are essential for  success in the present-day workforce.",
