 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the strengthening and streamlining  of high school and community college technological education  programs.  To achieve this goal, a partnership between Adirondack  Community College, four area school districts, and area business  and industry will develop and implement an advanced applied  mathematics course AM4 to follow and extend Tech Prep's Applied  Math 1, 2, and 3.  The courses and materials will conform to reform  guidelines (Standards) established by the National Council of  Teachers of Mathematics, the American Mathematical Association of  Two-Year Colleges, and the New York State Curriaulum, Instruction,  and Assessment Framework for Mathematics, Science, and Technology.  Mathematics will be viewed as a powerful tool for real world  problem solving; calculators and computers will be integrated  throughout this contextual approach.  Labs will emphasize the  hands-on nature of the course.  The mathematics departments from  Adirondack and the four area high schools have worked closely in  the implementation of AM1, AM2, and AM3.  Initial feedback  indicates substantial success with the Center for Occupational  Research and Development (CORD) materials.  Desired student  outcomes measured include an improvement in problem solving and  critical thinking skills, concept attainment, motivation, and  making connections.  The project will serve as a model for  cooperation between high schools, community colleges, and area  business and industry in extending these desired outcomes to AM4.   Materials will be produced for use by interested school districts  from the Capital Region Consortium and throughout the nation.  The  course and materials will be widely disseminated through  conferences and workshops, in journals, and possible publication as  texts.",
