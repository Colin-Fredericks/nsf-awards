 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order for mechanical engineering technologists to make  informed material selection decisions from the rapidly increasing  number of choices, they need a logical and systematic technique  by which the selection of material can be made.   The technique  must be based upon physical properties of materials and a  performance index, a ratio of properties raised to an appropriate  power, which characterizes the particular design.   For this  purpose, the university's engineering materials course and  laboratory have to be designed with a goal of presenting a  logical and systematic technique to choose the optimum material  for each design.   The focus is still on both micro and macro  structure, but the Cambridge University materials selection  approach is being used to focus on critical property ratios that  are design dependent and to relate the laboratory experience to  support the lecture.   This project obtains the modern laboratory  equipment that will substantially enhance the undergraduate  laboratory experience.    The unique approach taken for the  laboratory is to select representative materials for each of the  basic classes of materials, and then concurrently characterize  these materials with a series of experiments.   By following the  same set of materials through the same sequence of experiments,  the students grasp and retain the concept of property  measurements and the difference between and within material  groups.   The laboratory experience concludes with the students  conducting a case study.",
