 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421759  Roselli  Gonadal steroids have profound sex-specific effects on reproductive  function and behavior.  For instance, testosterone, which  stimulates a repertoire of masculine sexual behaviors in males, is  much less effective in eliciting these behaviors in females.  This  sex difference in androgen responsiveness is established during  early life and is believed to be related to sex differences in  brain structure as well as the concentrations of neural androgen  receptors.  Less attention has been paid to the possible  contribution of sex differences in neural androgen metabolism.   Aromatization of testosterone to estradiol by the brain is required  to activate male copulatory behaviors.  The levels of aromatase  activity are sexually dimorphic in medial preoptic area of the  brain which is essential for the display of male sexual behaviors.   Dr. Roselli proposes a model to explain the role of aromatization  in the development of sex difference in behavior.  The model  predicts that the aromatization pathway of androgen metabolism is  more active in the male than in the female brain because of  increased capacity to up-regulate aromatase activity.  Thus, when  adult males and females are given identical stimulation with  testosterone, more estrogen is produced in the male medial preoptic  region which contributes the greater behavioral response in males.   Dr. Roselli will investigate whether perinatal androgen exposure  increases aromatase activity and androgen receptor binding in the  brain of females, establish whether testosterone increases neural  estrogen receptor binding more in males than females, determine if  androgens increase brain aromatase synthesis and activity more in  males than females, and examine if estradiol stimulates male  behavior in females to the same level as males treated with  testosterone alone.  The proposed studies have the potential to  further our understanding of brain-related sex differences in  behavior in mammals, including man.",
