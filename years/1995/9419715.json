University of Arizona  Title: Land-Atmosphere Interactions - A Core Program in Support of Community  Climate Modeling    This project focuses on understanding and parameterizing the interactions between  land and the atmosphere in the context of global change models.  Its objectives  are: to establish, through data analyses, numerical process studies and model  stimulations, the function of the most important atmospheric processes, from the  viewpoint of coupling to land-surface processes; and on the basis of these  studies, to develop new or improved parameterizations for GCMs, implement and  test these parameterizations in NCAR community climate system models, and provide  successful parameterizations to the NCAR climate modeling community.    This proposal brings together and supports a strong research team with a wide  variety of background and experience, each with important individual skills.  The  proposed work will: expand the basic understanding of the processes responsible  for land-atmosphere coupling; determine how these operate in NCAR community  models; determine how these processes differ, if they do, from those in other  climate models of comparable merit; determine how these observations, sensitivity  studies, and model intercomparisons are necessary to clarify the relative  correctness of differing parameterizations; and develop indicated new treatments  that are suitable, in the context of GCM's, for future improvements and upgrades  by the scientific community.    Individual subprojects designed to pursue these objectives include: studies of  interactions between the land surface and clouds in the planetary boundary (PBL);  characterization of cloud radiative fluxes and their coupling to the land  surface; parameterization of the effects of mesoscale circulations in a GCM,  including moist processes, clouds and precipitation; observation characterization  of relationships between cloud properties, atmospheric thermodynamics propert ies,  and land cover; observational search for effects of Amazon deforestation on cloud  processes; further exploration of climate effects of Amazon deforestation to  better understand land-surface interactions; and paleoclimatic linkages.    These studies will use satellite, radiosonde, and surface data for their  observational analyses.  Satellite data analyses will emphasize the use of a  local archive of high-resolution (30 km) ISCCP data.  They will also use  integrations of mesoscale and global climate models, with an  emphasis for the  latter on NCAR community models.  Theoretical and parameterizations analyses will  use mesoscale model integration and various 1-D convection parameterizations.    The proposed work will contribute substantially to great understanding of and  confidence in the use of NCAR climate system models for projections of future  climate.  This will be done by promoting major advances in what is arguably now  one of the weakest aspects of model performance from the viewpoint of scientific  understanding and practical aspects of climate simulation.  The performance of  the proposed research will provide training and education on these questions for  a generation of graduate students and post-doctoral trainees.    This award is under the USGCRP, Climate Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (CMAP)  project.",
