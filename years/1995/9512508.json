 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five  natural  science  departments and  programs  at  Trinity  College  (Hartford CT) join to request matching funds from the NSF to purchase a  Transmission  Electron  Microscope (TEM) and  ancillary  equipment,  in  order  to  incorporate  their use into faculty research,  undergraduate  research  training, and collaborative faculty/student research  at  the  college.    As  a  highly-selective,  secular,  liberal-arts  institution,  Trinity  College   maintains  a  long-standing  commitment   both   to   quality  undergraduate  education and to faculty research. Trinity's  laboratory  facilities  are excellent, and its science faculty is highly productive  in  research and scholarship. Nevertheless, until last year the college  entirely  lacked  electron microscope facilities. Drawing  on  its  own  resmurces,  the college has now procured and installed both a  scanning  electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM), and has  located  and  designed space for a TEM facility. The college  has  made  acquisition  of the TEM a top priority, and requests NSF assistance  in  order to make this acquisition a reality.    The  presence of a TEM on campus will have a multitude of benefits.  It  will (1) provide an important instrument needed in research by existing  faculty;  (2) substantially increase the opportunities for research  by  Trinity  undergraduates; (3) permit development of upper-level  courses  that  provide training in EM techniques; (4) allow incorporation of  EM  technology  into  several existing laboratory courses  that  deal  with  research methods; and (S) help the college recruit science faculty  for  several  key  positions that will become vacant  during  the  next  few  years. It should also help the college in recruitment of undergraduates  to programs in the natural sciences and engineering.    TEM  capabilities are needed for investigative research currently being  conducted  by  nine members of the science faculty in five departments/  programs:  Biolog y, Engineering, Neuroscience, Chemistry, and  Physics.  Each  of  these  faculty members would expect to develop  collaborative  student/   faculty  research  projects  involving  TEM.  In   addition,  acquisition  of  TEM  technology will permit  development  of  two  new  research-oriented  courses (\"Electron Microscopy\"  and  \"Principles  of  Crystallography and Transmission Electron Microscopy\") and the addition  of  new  laboratory  exercises  for at least  ten  upper-level  science  courses.  Most  students  majoring in the sciences  at  Trinity  choose  careers in scientific research or the health professions. Consequently,  introduction  of EM technology will have a substantial  impact  on  the  college's  ability to attract and train students who will  be  research  scientists and medical professionals well into the next century.    Trinity College is committed to providing 50% matching funds.",
