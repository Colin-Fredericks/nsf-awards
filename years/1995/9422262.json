Relationships to be tested include whether self-assessment improves results of planning efforts, whether self-assessment accelerates systematic improvement efforts, and whether self-assessment increases commitment to quality improvements.  The research will be conducted in eight organizations (Allied Signal, American Express, Henry Ford Health Systems, IBM Credit, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Union Pacific Railroad, Xerox Business Services), and will include a series of working conferences to share results among cooperating organizations",
