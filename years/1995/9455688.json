 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia's Department of Geological Sciences and Barnard's  Department of Environmental Science are in the process of  developing a new curriculum in Earth and Environmental Science  that builds on the intellectual and information resources of  Columbia, Barnard, Teachers College, Lamont-Doherty Earth  Observatory and the NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies  (GISS).  This two-year project involves design of a  multidisciplinary introductory core curriculum, for both geology  and environmental science majors. This three semester core,  serving both Barnard and Columbia, focuses on three interacting  global systems: the lithosphere, the climate system, and the  biosphere. Women form a key target audience of this enhanced  curriculum, through merging of the Barnard introductory sequence  with that of Columbia    The core incorporates new technologies for accessing, analyzing  and transmitting information, thus shortening the information  path between research scientist and undergraduate.  An electronic  library containing data, text, models, graphics and analytical  tools is being developed. Through this electronic library  students can explore features of the three systems and processes  that operate within and among them. The design team, brought  together from within the Columbia community to develop and  implement the curricular revisions, engages a wide variety of  scientists and educators in the process.",
