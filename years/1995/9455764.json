 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455764  Dolan  This project is Phase II of a two-phase project to develop a two-  course sequence in Manufacturing Systems. The sequence can serve as  a model for manufacturing systems nationally. The project involves  the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) as the lead  institution for the North/Central Educational Technology  Educational Consortium and Camden County College as lead  institution for the Southern CIM Technology Consortium. The  consortia operate fully articulated programs aimed at the AAS and  BSET degree in Manufacturing Engineering Technology. The consortia  involve all community colleges in New Jersey, 13 in the Northern  Consortium and 6 in the Southern Consortium.  Articulated curricula  of the two consortia include a two-course sequence in Manufacturing  Systems. The sequence is critical to the success of the program. We  have noted significant deviations in course content and emphasis  amongst the consortial colleges.  This project will involve faculty  from the consortial colleges in development of model curricula and  training modules for the Manufacturing Systems sequence. It will  also identify possibilities for sharing of laboratory resources in  support of the model.  The first phase of the project is complete.  This involved soliciting input from the manufacturing sector on  required skills which should be attained from the sequence. It also  involved the development of the model curricula and training  modules for the first course in the sequence, Manufacturing Systems  I (Introduction to Manufacturing Systems). Draft copies of the  first modules have been distributed to consortial colleges and were  also distributed at the  NSF Project IMPACT Conference held in June  1994 in Washington, D.C.  The second phase of the project involves  the development of model curricula and training modules for the  second course in the sequence, Manufacturing System II (Advanced  Manufacturing Systems). It also involves identification of  laboratory resources throughout the  consortia and procedures for  arranging use in support of the model. Pre-publication editing,  printing, and distribution of the final products are also included  in this second phase.",
