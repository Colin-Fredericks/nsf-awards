 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521170  CANUEL      Lipid biomarkers, elemental (% organic carbon, C/N ratios), and  isotopic (C-13) information will be used to: (1) characterize  primary source materials in order to develop reliable chemcial  tracers for their input, (2) identify temporal and spatial patterns  in the sources of suspended POM in the Chesapeake Bay, and (3)  evaluate historical changes in the delivery of organic materials  using sediments cores. Because of high variability in the delivery  processes, the study will focus on processes likely to be most  important, namely, freshwater inflow, phytoplankton blooms, and  microbially-medicated degradation.    The educational component of this career development plan has as  its objectives: (1) the development of graduate level courses, (2)  mentoring  of graduate and undergraduate students, and (3)  establishing a summer program to initiate high school girls into  scientific research.  The Female Initiation into Research in  Science and Technology (F.I.R.S.T.) program will place precollege  girsl in labs where they will work closely with female mentors.   All of the education objectives will utilize research experience as  a teaching tool.  Together the research and education plans  outlined in this proposal will build a framework for understanding  key processes controlling the delivery and fate of organic  materials in near shore environments, including other estuaries,  and the continental shelf and slope. Specifically, results from  this study will identify the important sources of organic matter  and their relative abundance in the water column and sediments of  the Chesapeake Bay.",
