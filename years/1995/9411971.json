The purpose is to shed new light on each of these important                topics.  Building on our previous work in this area, data from                  firms in the information processing, electronics, chemical,                     instruments, pharmaceutical, metals, and petroleum industries is                collected and analyzed as well as data/information from a sample                of academic researchers who have been cited by firms in these                   industries as having made particularly significant contributions                to their product and process innovations.  Based on detailed data               of this sort, statistical analyses will be carried out, the                     results of which should be of  u  se to decision makers attempting                 to increase the economic payoff from the nation's academic                      research.",
