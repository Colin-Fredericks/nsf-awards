 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests matching funds to purchase a Field  Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) for the a  multi-use facility at the University of Connecticut Storrs  Campus.  The proposed instrumentation will replace an  existing 16 year old FESEM which is heavily used, but is now  out of date and increasingly difficult to maintain.  The  instrument will be available to investigators within and  outside of the main campus of the University of Connecticut.  Over the past five years 83 individuals have used the  existing FESEM.  The requested instrument will ensure  continued availability of high resolution scanning electron  microscopy for research and training at this institution.  It will also introduce useful capabilities not available on  the existing instrument.  In particular, variable scan rates  and high resolution low voltage operation will permit high  magnification imagine of radiation sensitive material and  uncoated samples difficult or impossible to study in the  existing instrument.  Other improvements such as high vacuum  gun design, digital control electronics, and capabilities  for digital image acquisition and replay, will greatly  facilitate operation and maintenance, increase throughput  for users and reduce photographic costs.  This instrument  will be used to carry out planned or ongoing projects of six  major users.  These include investigations of phylogenetic  relationships of parasitic worms, the role of development in  evolution and ecology of plants, cell death during  neurogenesis, effects of heat shock on renal function,  effects of land use on plankton biodiversity in lakes,  larval and pupal morphology in insect development.  It is  expected, based on previous experience at this facility,  that the requested instrument will also be heavily used by  many additional projects in years to come.",
