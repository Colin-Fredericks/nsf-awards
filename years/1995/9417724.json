The workshop will be held in Canberra,  Australia in mid-February 1995.  The American coordinator is   Prof. Donald H. Madison from the Department of Physics at the  University of Missouri - Rolla.  The Australian organizer is  Dr. Stephen J. Buckman from the Electron Physics Group at the  Australian National University in Canberra.  The workshop is  being conducted under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science  Program and support in Australia primarily is provided through  the Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST).    The workshop will bring together a wide diversity of expertise  from both countries for the purpose of discussing the current  status and future directions for research in the area of AMO  physics.  The expected outcome is the identification of important  problems that need to be solved and the formation of  collaborations which will address these problems.  Among the  topics to be considered at the workshop are the following:  Fundamental Scattering Processes, Laser Assisted Collisions and  Laser Spectroscopy, Cluster Spectroscopy and Collisions,  Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Surface/Solid Studies.  The   proceedings of the meeting will be published in a special issue  of the Australian Journal of Physics.",
