 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wailes    Under the direction of Dr. Bernard Wailes, Ms. Elizabeth Ragan  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She and numerous  volunteer assistants will conduct an archaeological survey of the  South Argyll coastline of Scotland to search for prehistoric  seaports. Because the area is extremely large, she will limit her  work by focussing on areas with the greatest natural potential to  serve this function. These will then be walked over and all  cultural remains, both structural and artifactural, will be  recorded. Collections will be made of cultural material exposed  on the surface and limited excavation will be conducted where  concentrations of materials are located. These materials will  then be analyzed to determine both cultural affiliation and age.    Archaeologists wish to understand how state level societies  arise, and on the basis of work done to date, it is known that  the State of Scotland appeared ca. the 9th century AD. It was  then that groups from the South Argyll region extended their  control over the region coincident with Scotland today and  archaeologists wish to understand what underlying factors led to  this process. The hope is that the conclusions drawn here can be  applied to other temperate regions in Europe. It has been  hypothesized that trade played a major role in the consolidation  of power and, given the extreme difficulty in overland travel in  this region, water travel was likely the primary mode of  transport. Although an elegant model has been developed, it is  difficult to test because very little is known about coastal  settlement at this time. Through her survey, Ms. Ragan wishes to  collect the data necessary to address this issue.    This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on the development of state level societies. It will  provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
