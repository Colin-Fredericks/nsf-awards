 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522105  Solo-Gabrriele    This is a planning award the objective of which is to determine  the feasibility of the approach the investigator plans to take in  conducting research on the factors that influence the movement of  chemical contaminants from surface water systems to groundwater  aquifers.   The investigator's objective is to incorporate  factors that influence movement of contaminants from surface to  groundwater aquifers in development of a mathematical model that  can be used in engineering design of water supply systems.  Factors that are planned for consideration include the relative  importance of storm events that yield contaminated surface water  to the duration of the period between storm events.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 93-130, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement  Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers.  An understanding of  the mechanisms by which pollutants move from surface to  groundwater aquifers is necessary in the formulation of  mathematical models that can be used in the engineering design of  water supply systems.  Results of this project are expected to  guide the investigator in development of a competitive research  project that advances our understanding over how contaminants  move from presence in surface waters to aquifers used to supply  water for domestic and industrial uses.",
