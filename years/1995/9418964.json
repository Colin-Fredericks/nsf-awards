 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418964  Doniach  New computer simulation techniques for representing the  conformational kinetics of polypeptides and proteins in solution  will be developed.  These techniques will comprise two  developments: the use of overdamped constrained Langevin dynamics  to represent the kinetics of a polypeptide chain, in which the  positions in Cartesian space and forces on all atoms of the  peptide are taken into account; and the development of the  representation of the interaction of the peptide with solvent.  The overdamped constrained Langevin dynamics, which has recently  been published by Gronbech-Jensen and Doniach, is obtained by  projecting out all components of the force field which would tend  to alter constrained bond lengths, and hence, bond angles in the  peptide backbone and side chains.  The treatment of solvent will  be based both on a Langevin dynamics approach to explicit water  molecules, their interactions between each other and with the  peptide, and on a novel \"mean-field\" approach to the calculation  of the hydration shell of a polypeptide out to a distance of 8  Angstrom from the surface atoms.  These new techniques will be  applied to the simulation of the helix-random coil transitions in  small polypeptide chains  13 to 20 residues  which are known to  have nascent helix properties.  ***",
