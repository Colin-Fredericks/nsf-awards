 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports an investigation into the use of  type  theory and operational semantics in the design and implementation  of  programming languages.  Type theory has proved to be an  important organizing  principle in programming language design.  This is well exemplified by the use  of type theory in the design  of modularity and abstraction constructs.  This investigation seeks to consolidate  advances in type theory into the design of the ML2000 programming language.    Type theory  has proved important for the implementation of  programming languages.  Conventional syntax-directed compilation  methods are generalized to  type-directed compilation, allowing  type information to be exploited during  compilation.  Sophisticated type systems such as those derived from the Girard-  Reynolds polymorphic lambda-calculus suggest new implementation  strategies  based on passing type information at link- and run-  time.  This research  investigates the use of type-based  compilation techniques.  Operational  semantics provides a  suitable framework for addressing issues of compiler  correctness  and proving properties of programs.  Typed programming  languages such as  Standard ML provide a rich setting in which to discuss  high-level  programming techniques such as data abstraction, modularity, and  separate compilation.  Types are essential for reasoning about  programs.  A procedure can in general be deemed to have certain  input/output properties only  under the assumption that its  arguments have suitable types.  Operational  semantics is a useful pedagogical tool for  teaching undergraduate   programming, both as an explanatory device  and as  the basis for proving properties of programs and  languages.    Important  advantages are expected through the interplay between  research and education.",
