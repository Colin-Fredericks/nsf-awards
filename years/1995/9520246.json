Two complementary approaches are indicated.  The first approach involves the use of results about the fluctuation of Gaussian processes to explain the variability of the partition function and the convergence of the free energy of the S-K spin glass.  Preliminary results suggest that this approach is quite useful.  The second approach involves investigating the weak convergence of weighted sums of dependent random variables.  This will have immediate consequences for the understanding of the S-K spin glass model, as its partition function can be represented as the moment generating function of a weighted sum of dependent random variables.    The work of the investigator on this proposal is directed toward finding relatively simple mathematical models which provide an accurate description of the complicated probabilistic behavior of so-called \"spin glass\" models.  Spin glass models provide a theoretical description of those magnetic systems for which the interaction strengths (coupling constants) are random.  These systems are found in structurally disordered materials with behavior depending on a threshold transition temperature.  The randomness of the interaction strengths arises because of impurities within the materials.  The theoretical work proposed here promises to provide a better understanding of the variability in the behavior of these materials when they are synthesized under different temperature regimes.  This research draws on recent advances in the study of random processes.",
