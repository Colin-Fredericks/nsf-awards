 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402968  Booker    This U.S.-Argentina Program award will support a visit by  Dr. John R. Booker, of the University of Washington, to go  to Buenos Aires, Argentina to work with Dr. Maria C.  Pomposiello, of CIRGEO-CONICET, to finalize a project on  Andean tectonics and to assess feasibility of  magnetotellurics (MT) surveys in field areas.  Recently  there have been major advances using MT to image  conductivity structure, making it an important tool for  solving  geological problems where interconnection of water,  other fluids, or conductive grain boundary phases such as  graphite or metallic sulfides are important.   Experiments  considered for collaborative research are: detailed imaging  of an important geothermal resource in the context of an  experiment to investigate the thermal state of the deep  crust of the Altiplano, investigating deformation mechanisms  associated with the high seismicity and extremely rapid  vertical uplift in the region around the city of Mendoza, or  the potential for oil and gas reservoirs associated with  large scale overthrusting in the pre-Cordillera.  These  experiments, while of global significance, will also meet  clear Argentine priorities.     The Andes mountain range has many parallels to the geologic  history of the U.S.  Using them as a field site allows the  time required to study  tectonic processes to be accelerated  from decades to years or less, because of their extremely  high deformation rate.  In addition to the merit of this  site, a member of the research team has been able to modify  the use of MT that will allow its use during field campaigns  in remote areas, permitting interpretation of data collected  in early stages to guide deployment at additional sites.  This new technique is expected to be learned quickly by  members of the  Argentine group, allowing them to become  equal partners with U.S. colleagues in the near future.      ***",
