 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9415657  Totik    Totik will investigate several problems in the general areas of approximation theory with special interest in applications of potentials and in polynomials.   The main topics include logarithmic potentials in the presence of an external field, polynomial approximation with varying weights, fast decreasing polynomials, asymptotic for orthogonal polynomials, zeros of polynomials, and approximation by positive operators.     Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics  best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose  complex problems into fundamental components.  These components  are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.  Finally, the  solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the  components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are  examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  representing a continuous decomposition.  Orthogonal polynomials  play an important role in certain segments of harmonic analysis  because (a) they arise naturally in the study of differential  equations (b) they can be used to represent large classes of  functions and (c) they are often easily computable.",
