 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the acquisition of a state-of-the-art electron  microscope by the newly created Skirball Institute at New York  University Medical Center for determination of protein structure at  nearatomic resolution. The microscope has a Schottky field emission gun  and is capable of operating at 200kV. In addition, accessories will  make it possible to image frozen-hydrated biological specimens at high  resolution. Finally, digital and analogue interfaces will allow control  of the microscope by external computers and will be used to customize  the operating modes.    Two projects are described that use methods of electron crystallography  to study the molecular structure of Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic  reticulum and of the anion transporter from erythrocytes (Band 3). In  the case of Ca2+-ATPase, thin, multilamellar crystals diffract to 3.5    resolution and 3-D data will be collected by tilting specimens and  recording both electron diffraction and images. The same strategy will  be used for 2-D crystals of Band 3, which in initial studies have  produced optical diffraction to 12  . In both cases, the aim is for 3-D  reconstruction at ~7   resolution, from which elements of secondary  structure will be identified and related to the extensive set of  biochemical and biophysical data for each protein. For Ca2+-ATPase, the  relatively strong electron diffraction provides hope for a  reconstruction at higher resolution, which may eventually allow tracing  of the peptide chain. Both of these projects also involve tubular  crystals of their respective proteins, which provide structural data at  more moderate resolutions (~15  ), but which offer the opportunity to  study conformational changes of the molecules. Such conformational  changes are integral to the respective mechanisms of ion transport and  elucidation of the corresponding structures will be essential for fully  understanding these mechanisms.    A collaborative project with the Neurobiology Program at the Skirball  Institute  is also described. This involves immunoelectron microscopy of  tissue sections in an attempt to understand the sequence of signals  that lead to formation of a neuromuscular junction during development.  In addition, other investigators are being recruited into the  Neurobiology Program with interests in structure/function relationships  of voltagegated ion channels. Ultimately, active collaborations between  the electron microscopists and the neurobiologists are likely to  engender a crystallographic project involving these channels.    The building of a structural biology group at the core of a major new  research institute at New York University Medical Center will not only  provide extensive training opportunities for the graduate students, but  also bring New York University to the forefront of this important  field. The lack of structural information for membrane proteins  represents an acknowledged problem for the basic research community and  all of the projects to be pursued on the requested electron microscope  would specifically address this problem. In addition, the unique  capabilities of this microscope for high resolution imaging of  biological molecules would make it a major resource for structural  biologists throughout the northeastern United States.",
