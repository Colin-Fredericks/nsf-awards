 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511201  Lai    A long term objective of Dr. Lai's research is to elucidate the  inhibitory mechanisms of cell fate determination and cellular  differentiation. Inhibitory signal transduction plays a critical  role in development, but little is known about the mechanisms.  Using the Drosophila eye system, a negative nuclear regulator of  photoreceptor cell specification, the product of the yan gene, has  been previously characterized. Dr. Lai hypothesizes that Yan  normally acts to maintain photoreceptor precursor cells in an  undifferentiated state, and such inhibition can be overcome by  proneural signalling, for example, the Sevenless tyrosine receptor  kinase and Ras1 protein that promote the development of  photoreceptor cell. To understand how Yan acts to maintain  precursor cells undetermined, and to reveal the functional  significance of negative control in nuclear signal transduction,  Dr. Lai's team will use a combination of genetic, molecular and  cellular approaches. The specific aims include: 1) a genetic screen  for Enhancers of yan, 2) genetic characterization of E(yan)  mutations, and 3) molecular cloning of E(yan) genes. To accomplish  these aims, a sensitized and efficient assay has been devised by  Dr. Lai for identifying mutations that interact with yan. Selected  E(yan) genes will be genetically and molecularly characterized.  Methods to be used include mutagenesis of the Drosophila genome,  phenotypic analysis of isolated mutations, molecular cloning and a  P transposon mediated transformation. The Drosophila photoreceptor  cell provides an amenable system for molecular genetic studies of  key regulators of development. The work proposed here will lead to  the identification of key inhibitory regulators of cell fate  determination, whose structural information can be used for  identifying their vertebrate homologues. It will yield valuable  information on how negative control is integrated into the  regulatory hierarchy of signal transduction in the nucleus.  ***",
