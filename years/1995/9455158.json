 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is flexible, consistent introductory  engineering design education for a diverse pool of students who  follow single-institution or transfer paths to their baccalaureate  engineering degrees. The project links universities to community  colleges to produce design education that is \"integrated throughout  the curriculum\" as needed for accreditation. Project objectives  are:    * Establish a curricular structure for well-defined, transferable  introductory design education in an environment of diverse  institutions, curricula, and students;    * Produce transportable curricular materials and instructional  methods that support effective \"integrated\" engineering design  education in transfer environments;    * Enable faculty at a variety of institutions to adopt, implement,  and evaluate exemplary materials and methods suitable for their  programs and their students; and    * Achieve increased enrollment and retention of students,  especially women, minorities, and disabled, in early engineering  design courses.    Curriculum materials are developed to meet learning objectives for  introductory design, to fit a variety of institutions, and to serve  students with diverse backgrounds and interests. Faculty workshops  transfer these learning objectives and strategies for achieving  them in a variety of settings, and they prepare faculty to adopt  materials and methods to use in classes with diverse student  populations. Exemplary curricular materials are packaged for  distribution.",
