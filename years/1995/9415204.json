This particular meeting is one of many Winter Gordon Research Conferences, a highly-respected and influential series of conferences that emphasizes the most recent developments on the frontiers of modern research.  The Gordon Research Conference on Quinone and Redox-Active Amino Acid Cofactors, to be held in February 1995, provides an unique and proven format for scientific exchanges among the numerous investigators concerned with this rapidly developing field.  At this conference the most current research on quinone and amino acid radical cofactors in enzymes will be presented and discussed.  All aspects of the basic biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology of these systems  will be covered. NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of well-qualified young investigators who otherwise would have a difficult time attending, especially those from groups who are under-represented in U. S. science.  %%%  This Gordon Conference is concerned with the generation, fate, and roles of oxidized amino acids and protein radicals. Collectively the topics to be covered are relevant to a wide variety of biological and physiological processes,  including cell proliferation and differentiation, connective tissue metabolism, aging and cell death, and energy conservation.  ***",
