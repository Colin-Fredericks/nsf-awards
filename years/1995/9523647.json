 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project automatically detects discourse structure in digitally recorded lectures and uses this  structure to facilitate rapid browsing of the recording.  Discourse structure is the relationship  between topics, including sub-topics and embedded remarks.  Boundaries of the segments representing  the structure (but not content) are conveyed by pauses, pitch range variation, and cue phrases.  Discourse structure is hierarchical, with multiple levels of major and minor topics.  Analysis of a  corpus of lectures provides quantitative correlation between acoustic features and discourse  structure, and the basis of an automatic segmentation algorithm.  A unified approach merges hints from  these multiple acoustic cues to map hierarchical discourse structure to time offsets in the recording.  Derived discourse structure is used to browse the recording, at various levels of detail and  summarization.  Presentation is highly interactive, allowing the user to manipulate playback via a  physical interface which is the product of iterative design and evaluation.  Hand gestures control the  level of detail, speed, an d random access during playback.  More productive access to audio  recordings makes it possible to manage information from a wider variety of sources and in more  situations than conventional computer graphic displays.",
