 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project restructures two core courses in a Biological  Psychology Concentration offered to biology and psychology  undergraduate majors.   A large number of courses in the  concentration have a significant laboratory component.   However,  as a result of insufficient instrumentation, Introduction to  Neuroscience and Neurochemistry and Behavior courses had been  offered in a lecture format.   The Introduction to Neuroscience  is a gateway course into the concentration.   Students completing  this course can make a more informed decision concerning their  choice to continue study in this area and be better prepared for  future courses.   Similarly, concepts in neurochemistry and  psychopharmacology taught in the Neurochemistry and Behavior  course are most effectively conveyed by active student  participation.   It is for these reasons that systemic reform for  these courses is sought.   This project reforms the structure of  these courses by providing experiments that will serve as the  centerpiece of the student's learning experience.   Thus,  important concepts in neuroscience are first discovered in the  laboratory.   Discussion of experimental results that follow  leads to unveiling of general principles.   Only then is the  student asked to integrate reading assignments from the textbook  and primary literature on the topic with the specific experience  gained in the laboratory.   Students can gain proficiency in a  number of important techniques currently used in neuroscience,  and more importantly, they are actively involved in the process  of learning, thereby reducing the difficulty in comprehension of  technical jargon that characterizes scientific information  transmitted either verbally or in writing.",
