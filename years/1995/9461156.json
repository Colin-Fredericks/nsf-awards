 "awd_abstract_narration": "A method is proposed to enable full-energy injection in an x-ray lithography machine used for etching future high-density computer chips and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A high-gradient accelerator, which utilizes a high-power microwave source to drive electrons through a linear accelerating structure, can be used as a full-energy injector to an x-ray superconducting synchrotron radiation ring (SSRR), or to a granular e-beam driven x-ray source. Examples of microwave sources capable of producing the high power needed to drive the HGA are a relativistic klystron, a high-power X-band klystron combined with an rf pulse compression system, a sheet-beam klystron or a cluster klystron. Full-energy injection increases the stored current in the SSRR by eliminating energy ramp-up of electrons in the SSRR, a main source of current loss during injection. Higher stored current generates more intense x-rays, which in turn reduces the exposure time and increases the throughput, thus saving the unit cost of production. Development of the method and apparatus of an integrated system combining a full-energy HGA injector and the SSRR technologies is the main thrust of the present NSF SBIR project. Technical issues to be addressed in Phase I include continued R&D on the rf power source, feasibility of gridded gun modulation at the rf frequency of the ring, design of the septum and kicker magnets for high-energy injection, and optimization of the injection beamline layout in relation to the x-ray beamlines to minimize interference in a compact space.",
