The  economic,  public health, and ecosystem impacts of PSP  outbreaks take a variety of forms, and include human  intoxications and death from contaminated shellfish or fish,  stages of fisheries species, and death of marine mammals,  fish, and seabirds.  These impacts are caused by the  saxitoxins, a family of neurotoxins produced by the  dinoflagellates and accumulated in zooplankton, shellfish,  or fish during feeding.         The overall objective of this project is to identify  genes involved in toxin production in Alexandrium spp. and  other saxitoxin-producing organisms and to study the manner  in which they are regulated.  The approach will use  differential display to identify messenger RNA differences  between cells that differ in their ability to make toxin.  Differentially expressed sequences can then be used to  screen for the putative toxin genes in a wide range of toxic  and non-toxic species of dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria.  Other indirect evidence for the toxin-specificity of the  identified genes will derive from manipulations of  dinoflagellate metabolism using inhibitors that block toxin  biosynthesis at different levels.  If the differential  display approach is not successful because the toxin genes  are not regulated at the transcriptional level, traditional  methods of two-dimensional protein electrophoresis will be  applied to extracts of Alexandrium from different cell cycle  stages to address the remaining possibility of  translational/post-translational regulation.  This in turn  will lead to the identification and isolation of genes  implicated in toxin production.  Both of the above  approaches will provide genetic tools needed to conduct  regulatory studies to determine the mechanisms  by which  these genes are turned on and off.   The information gained  will aid in deciphering some of the long-standing mysteries  surrounding the metabolic role of saxitoxin in  dinoflagellates and the toxin variability observed in  different isolates or in individual isolates under different  environmental conditions.",
