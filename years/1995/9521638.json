 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, R. Bruce   Weisman of Rice University will use laser pump-probe techniques to   investigate the rates at which triplet excited states of molecules   undergo vibrational energy relaxation and redistribution, electronic   energy transfer, and reaction.  Systems to be studied include triplet   pyrazine and methylpyrazine using the rare gases, CO, methane, ethane,   water, and benzene as relaxers.  These relaxers span a range of mass,   polarizability, and polarity, and will provide information to help   clarify mechanistic differences between triplet and ground state   relaxation.  Further studies include the triplet decay mechanisms and   kinetics of fullerenes in various solvents and in aqueous micelles.  The   fullerenes have been shown to produce triplet excimers, and these studies   will determine the equilibrium constant for excimer formation and its   variation with solvent and temperature.  Due to their unpaired electron spins, triplet state molecules often   exhibit rates of reaction and relaxation which are entirely different   from those of the ground electronic state.  Professor Weisman's studies   will enhance our understanding of these important chemical differences   and will clarify the mechanisms involved in excimer formation and   vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation.",
