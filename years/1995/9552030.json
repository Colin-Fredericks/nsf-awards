 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is purchasing six automatic titrators to acquaint  students with the capabilities and limitations of these devices  which are routinely employed in many working laboratories.   The  units are being used for three experiments (oxidation-reduction  titration, neutralization titration, and direct potentiometry  with an ion selective electrode) in the Introductory Analytical  Chemistry Laboratory, and one experiment (Karl Fischer titration)  in the Instrumental Analysis Laboratory.   Both laboratories are  required of chemistry majors.   The introductory course is also  heavily populated by students from other departments, including  microbiology, zoology, and allied health fields.  The automated  systems include modules for both potentiometric and  spectrophotometric endpoint detection, so that students are able  to compare the capabilities of the two methods.   Two video tapes  are being produced to reinforce these concepts and to teach the  theory of operation of ion selective electrodes.",
