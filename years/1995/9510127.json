 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award through the Collaborative Research in Undergraduate   Institutions Program for support of a research center under the   leadership of Robert F. Pasternack of Swarthmore College for the study of   synthetic and biological light-harvesting systems, with emphasis on the   technique of resonance light scattering.  Supported through the Special   Projects Office of the Division of Chemistry, the center is a   collaboration of faculty and students from Swarthmore, Haverford, and   Goucher Colleges.  The interdisciplinary research seeks to determine the   molecular parameters that are necessary for resonance light scattering   from aggregrated chromophores and to formulate a general theoretical   description of the process.  Further, the research will develop   techniques of dynamic resonance light scattering to study the dimensions   of chromophore aggregrates and the mechanisms of aggregation and of   time-resolved resonance light scattering to probe photochemical processes   involving energy and electron transfer.  A central facility, to be   located at Swarthmore, will house a versatile laser light scattering   apparatus capable of both static and dynamic light scattering   experiments, angle-dependent scans, and polarization-dependent   measurements.   Center research into the interactions of light with synthetic and   biological systems contributes to the new NSF initiative in optical   sciences and engineering.  In addition to generating new knowledge on   light-harvesting systems, the center provides undergraduate students from   three colleges with an interdisciplinary, collaborative research   experience.  The center is a premier example of the integration of   research and education.",
