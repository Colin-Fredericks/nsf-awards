 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509624  Rigney  The tribological behavior of aluminum alloys containing hard  and/or soft components will be studied.  The purpose is to  develop guidelines for the design of bearing materials for  use in sliding applications, such as automotive uses, with  the hope that the results will allow the gradual phase-out  of lead in these  materials.  The work is primarily  experimental and involves tribological testing and post-test  characterization of Al-Pb, Al-Si, Al-Pb-Si alloys as well as  more complex compositions with closely controlled size and  distribution of the secondary phase.  The work includes a  collaboration with the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute  of Solid State Physics in Chernigolovka.  That institute has  developed a technique based on the use of magnetic and  electric fields for producing very fine microstructures in  bulk materials of immiscible components, such as Al-Pb and  Al-graphite and will provide the various alloys for testing.  ***",
