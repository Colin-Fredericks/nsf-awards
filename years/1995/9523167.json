The equipment will become  permanent part of the Power Electronics Research Laboratory at  UCF, and will be used to support the three research projects  proposed here.  These projects will investigate the dynamic  behavior of high frequency, high power density power converters  and their use as power factor correction.    The PI has developed an innovative analysis technique to obtain  frequency response for high-frequency dc-to-dc resonant  converters by using improved dynamic modeling.  Based on the  derived model, a closed loop controller design methodology for  such converters was developed.  In this project, experimental  investigation of the derived small signal modeling will be  carried out.  Specifically, the objectives of the proposed  research are:       1) Develop dynamic models by including the high frequency             parasitic components such as transistor and diode             junction capacitances and power transformer leakage          inductances, in the power converter models.         2) Based on this modeling, the design of a suitable feedback          controller for various resonant converter topologies will          be investigated.  Also by using the u-synthesis approach,          the design of robust controllers for both high order               series and parallel resonant converters will be carried            out.              3) Using the Zero-Voltage Switching technique, high power             factor correction resonant circuits will be designed,              tested and evaluated.         4) Experimental studies will be conducted to verify the               theory and the practicality of the developed dynami c          models for high frequency converters, and their                    applications as power factor correction.    ***",
