 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409824  Jagannathan    A substantial part of the research effort in finance is directed  toward improving our understanding of how investors value risky  cash flows.  It is generally agreed that investors demand a  higher expected return for investing in riskier projects, or  securities.  However, we still do not fully understand how  investors assess the risk of a project's cash flow and how they  determine what risk premium to demand.  The contribution of this  grant comes from a reassessment of the Capital Asset Pricing  Model (CAPM), the framework used most often by financial managers  to assess the risk of the cash flow from a project and the  preferred model for classroom use in MBA and other managerial  finance courses.  The empirical evidence accumulated over the  past two decades on the CAPM is weak, but CAPM continues to be  used because the empirical support for other asset pricing models  is also weak and the theoretical underpinnings of CAPM are better  than those for alternative models.  The investigator builds on  his previous theoretical and empirical research on CAPM.   Specifically, the investigator shows that by relaxing  unreasonable auxiliary assumptions usually made in empirical  studies of CAPM and by taking the return to human capital into  account in measuring the return to aggregate wealth, he is able  to obtain surprisingly strong empirical support for CAPM.  In  this research the investigator will use standard tests of asset  pricing models with time varying parameters and develop some new  statistical tests and examine their small sample properties.",
