The number of  new myosin motors identified by molecular and genetic  techniques has grown explosively in the past few years but  the functional roles of these new motors have not been  determined. This project tests the hypothesis that  microtubule-dependent motors drive movement of organelles  over long distances while actin-dependent motors drive  movement to local sites along the axon. The broad objectives  of the research project are to determine the actin-dependent  motors involved in fast axonal transport, the  interrelationship between the actin-dependent and  microtubule-dependent forms of organelle motility and the  mechanism by which the motors involved in organelle motility  are regulated. The squid giant axon and optic lobes (brain)  will be the primary biological materials used in these  studies. Squid axoplasm is one of a small number of in vitro  systems where myosin-dependent organelle motility can be  studied directly. Therefore, it represents a unique system in  which to study (a) organelle associated myosins, (b) the  regulation of these motors and (c) the relationship between  membrane trafficking on microtubules and actin filaments.  Extruded axoplasm is particularly useful for motility studies  but the amount of material is too small for biochemical  purification of myosin motors. Squid brain, however,  represents an alternate source of material for purification  of myosins, therefore, motors identified in axoplasm will be  subsequently isolated from squid optic lobes. The primary  goal of the research project is to use an identified  organelle, the tubulovesicular organelles (TVOs) in the squid  giant axon, to study the properties and regulation of  organelle-associated myosins. Purification of TVOs will be  achieved by generating axoplasmic ghosts; the highly  extracted remnant of axoplasm. Motility of purified TVOs will  be reconstituted on actin f ilaments and the parameters of  movement determined by quantitative motion analysis. The  function of these compartments as Ca stores will be  determined with Ca-indicator dyes. In addition, antibodies to  known smooth ER proteins will be used to establish the  identity and purity of the isolated compartments. Another  specific goal is to identify factors that influence binding  of motors to the tubulovesicular organelles. The location of  the actin-dependent motors on the surfaces of TVOs will be  determined using immunofluorescence microscopy. This  technique will make it possible to establish whether the  motors are uniformly distributed or localized to the  vesicular domains of TVOs. Properties of the motor, such as  whether the motor is a peripheral protein and whether soluble  factors are involved in its attachment to the membrane will  be determined. Myosins will be purified from squid brain by  conventional biochemical methods or from axoplasm by  immunoprecipitation. Purified motors will be biochemically  and functionally characterized using in vitro motility  assays. An antibody to squid brain myosin V has been  generated for use in localization and functional studies.  Antibodies to other organelle-associated unconventional  myosins will be generated and used to inhibit motility in  extruded axoplasm thereby verifying the role of these motors  in the movement of organelles.  %%%  The work described in this proposal will provide new  knowledge on molecular motors and will aid our understanding  of fast axonal transport as well as our understanding of many  other fundamental cellular processes including secretion,  cell division, cell motility and the organization and  transport of organelles. The new knowledge from these studies  has applications in biotechnology and research on molecular  nanostructures.  ***",
