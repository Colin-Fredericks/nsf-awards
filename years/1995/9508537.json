 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508537  SHEAR  Professor Shear is a recognized leader in the fossil studies of early land dwelling arthropods, including insects, spiders, mites, scorpions, etc..  His previous work, dealing mostly with materials from the Devonian Gilboa formation, has included several important discoveries and shed significant light on the transitions of animal life to a terrestrial existence.  This award will provide funding for preparation (by hydroflouric acid maceration techniques), photographic documentation and comparative study of fossil arthropods from two new Devonian sites in New York and New Brunswick.  Initiation of work on material from two older Silurian sites is also proposed.   Specimens from the Devonian sites are exceptionally well preserved and should provide important paleontological evidence of character conditions in extinct taxa that will be valuable for polarizing characters for phylogenetic analysis of various groups.  %%%  This project will undoubtedly result in important fossil finds and contribute to our understanding of extinct communities at the important juncture of the transition to dwelling on land.  While Professor Shear's scientific contributions are important, equally important is his active involvement of students at a predominantly undergraduate institution in the research process.  Such contributions to the training of future scientists are essential and Dr. Shear is one of the few workers with the background specialization to train students in this exciting area.  ***",
