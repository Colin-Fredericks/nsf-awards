 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David R. Tyler, Chemistry Department, University of Oregon, is  supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  Program of the Chemistry Division for studies on the reactivity of  organometallic free radicals. As one portion of the investigation the  cage effect, i.e. the effect responsible for the greater reactivity of a  radical pair in solution than in the gas phase, will be probed. A variety  of `cage efficiency factors`, a number that expresses the efficiency of  radical cage pair combinations, will be accumulated for a variety of  radical pairs which differ in mass, size, and shape. These data will  provide predictive understanding of the cage effect. The second part of  the project involves an investigation of the reactivity of 17- and  19-electron organometallic species in aqueous solution. New methods for  generating water soluble organometallic radicals will be developed and  the fundamental reactivity and catalytic properties of the radicals will  be systematized.  Each electron in a chemical compounds is usually paired with another.  However, there are some compounds which contain an  unpaired electron.  These are called radicals, they often are quite chemically reactive, and  there is a growing realization that they are involved in many chemical  processes. The object of this project is to uncover the principles which  control the chemical behavior of metal containing radicals and to  develop radicals which can dissolve in water. Since water is an  environmentally friendly solvent, the ability to generate radicals in  aqueous solutions will permit reactions which normally must be  carried  out in organic solvents to be performed in a less polluting medium.",
