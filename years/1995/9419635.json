 "awd_abstract_narration": "An energy-resolving x-ray fluorescence detector system has been  proposed. The detector system uses the concept of selecting x-ray  fluorescence from an elastically scattered background by the  diffraction from a synthetic multilayer. The multilayer will be  linearly graded as to satisfy the diffraction condition everywhere on  the multilayer. Preliminary evaluation shows that such a detector can  be made with a good energy resolution (sufficient background  rejection), large solid angle, and fast time response. The project will  be carried out in two phases. The first phase of the project is to  simulate the performance of such a detector and to fabricate a  prototype detector with 3-4 multilayer elements. Based on the results  of Phase I, a multilayer analyzer array detector containing 40  multilayer elements will be developed in Phase II. The detector will be  tested and used by research groups on various metalloproteins. Since  the use of graded synthetic multilayers for fluorescence energy  selection, to our knowledge, is an original idea, we try to come up  with more detailed designs and procedures. The evaluation of the  performance of the proposed detector shows that it is more efficient  than the currently operating detectors, such as the 13-element Ge  detector and ionization chamber, when collecting data on a bending  magnet beamline using a few mM sample. The advantages of the array  detector become more evident under the conditions of increased photon  flux and/or decreased sample concentration. The detector will provide  tremendous opportunities for conducting XAFS experiments either on  time-resolved transient states or on very dilute systems at third  generation synchrotron sources, such as the APS. The detector will  greatly benefit the research projects of the P.I. in the same fashion  by largely improved efficiency and data quality. However, due to the  page limitation and the nature of this proposal, the scientific aspects  of these projects are not discussed. The cost for co nstructing the  detector is comparable to the cost for purchasing a 13-element Ge  detector, and is well justified in view of the efficient increase and  the cost for building new beamlines. In addition, long term operation  and maintenance are planned (see Section I. Special Information) to  insure the access of a wide circle of potential users to the detector  through its useful life.",
