The African state has a determining  influence on these institutional structures.  This research  investigation explores how the existing institutions surrounding  African medical practice do and could work and the political  dynamics of their change.    A model is developed of the demand for \"credible medical effort\"  which is based on the value of future working potential.   Incentive aligning contracts between the patient and the  clinician are shown to achieve a superior solution to 'classical'  markets in this unobservable good.  The introduction of an  institution which can collect 'hostages' of value to the  clinician in a renegotiation-proof manner also is shown to be  able to achieve a yet superior solution.  Theoretical  investigation on the necessary characteristics of such  institutions identifies a range of possible alternatives.    The project's model of the economic costs of illness allows  examination of the role of emergency and long run credit as well  as insurance in the purchase of health care.  The role of the  extended family in the willingness to pay for health care is  tested.  Traditionally viewed as an insurance scheme, it is  hypothesized that the extended family may function as a source of  emergency credit.  This potential distinction has direct policy  implications.    Given these two economic tests, research is proposed at three  sites.  The structure and success of clinics in Tanzania, which  are operated on a franchise basis, will be investigated.  It is  hypothesized, first, that the franchising observed is indeed an  economic institution designed to provide credible medical effort,  and, secondly, that patients exhibit patterns of use which are  consistent with their awareness of an willingness to pay for its  provision.  Hou sehold surveys in Cameroon and Ethiopia will be  administered to investigate both the awareness and willingness to  pay for credible medical effort and the role of the extended  family in the ability to pay for health care.  At all three sites  the politics of institutional change and the issue of what  institutional structures are consistent with the managerial  capabilities of the African state will be explored.  ***",
