 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to convene a three-day working conference to design an  undergraduate curriculum for the 21st century.  The conference will serve as a forum  for consensus-building on the guiding principles for undergraduate education in the  next century. Representatives from business/industry, mathematics, science,  engineering, and technology disciplines will share their expertise and experiences and  exchange ideas on curriculum design and delivery through plenary sessions, working  groups, and other activities. The primary outcome of the project, a comprehensive  model for undergraduate education in the form of a conference report, will serve as a  curriculum-building resource and model for the new Florida Gulf Coast University and  other institutions across the nation. By synthesizing new ideas in one place at one  time, the conference report is likely to have a significant impact on existing structures  of institutions and their curricula.",
