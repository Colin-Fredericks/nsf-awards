 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424636  Ma    This proposed research project, to be conducted jointly by  researchers at Yale and at the Xinjiang Institute of Physics of  the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is designed to answer some  important scientific questions concerning advanced thin gate  dielectrics for future generations of MOS (Metal-Oxide-  Semiconductor) integrated circuit technology.    The objective of this collaborative research project is to  achieve a better understanding of the role of nitrogen and  fluorine in improving the thin gate oxide reliability.  In  particular, we hope to answer the questions as to (i) how the  concentration and spatial distribution of nitrogen or fluorine  affect the electrical properties of the gate oxide, (ii) how the  concentration and spatial distribution of nitrogen or fluorine  affect the hot-carrier effects (including dielectric breakdown)  as well as radiation effects in MOS devices, (iii) whether/how  the incorporation of nitrogen or fluorine affect the hydrogen  migration in the oxide, (iv) whether/how the incorporation  of  nitrogen or fluorine causes strain relaxation near the SiO 2/Si  interface, and (v) how the processing parameters affect the  concentration and distribution of nitrogen or fluorine.  The  knowledge to be gained from this research could serve as a useful  guide for the semiconductor industry in their process  development, and thereby help to accelerate the development of  this advanced gate oxide technology to commercial maturity.",
