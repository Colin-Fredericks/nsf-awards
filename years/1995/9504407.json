 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Ungar  Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are a class of artificial neural networks for process  control applications.  Commonly, the k-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the predictor (  independent variables), after which a linear regression layer maps the hidden unit activations to the  appropriate responses (dependent variables).  The PIs plan to explore an RBF architecture which is  suited to statistical analysis.  The statistical model underlying the architecture is a mixture model  in which the mixture coefficients are radial basis functions and the mixture components are constant  or polynomial functions.  Depending on the assumptions used to generate the model, different  generalizations of radial and elliptical basis functions result.  This allows the use of the  expectation maximization (EM) technique for finding maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters.  In addition, algorithms will be developed to partially invert the networks, estimate the local  prediction error of the network, recognize novel data points, automatically select the number of basis  functions, and incrementally  update the network efficiently as data are collected.  The techniques  will be tested on real data from chemical plants, compared to other approximation methods with respect  to speed and accuracy, and modified as needed to achieve fast, accurate, and robust performance.  This  is a coordinated project between two investigators, a mathematician and a chemical engineer, at two  different institutions.  Industrial data are to be provided by the DuPont Company.",
