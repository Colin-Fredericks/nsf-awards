One goal of the Center  is to strengthen science, mathematics and technical curricula,  pedagogy and student support systems to provide the knowledge and  skills base required for advanced technological education.   Curriculum templates are designed to provide a model for  articulation of advanced technological education from high school  through four year college. The program also includes refresher and  remediation options for students lacking the college level skills.   A comprehensive system is developed attract and retain students as  well as monitoring and assessing their progress through core  competencies, job placement and career advancement.   A second  goal is to improve technological education through development of  courseware and the coordination of professional development  programs for faculty and for professional technicians.  Computer  technology is applied to core science and mathematics, as well as  to specific technological curricula.  The Center has strong  commitments of time, personnel and financial support from major  industrial partners.",
