A full comprehension  of the  behavior of composite  structures is still to be  achieved.  The behavior of  composite members involves  complex phenomena such as the  partial bond transfer between  steel and concrete subjected  to cyclic loadings.   The  ability to understand and  model this behavior is  important for the evaluation  of existing civil  infrastructure systems as well  as for the design of new  structures.    A novel frame element  formulation based on the  flexibility method of  structural analysis will be  made:  The new formulation is  effective in modeling the  nonlinear response of  reinforced concrete frames  subjected to seismic inputs.  The new formulation offers  several advantages over  classical stiffness  formulations.  The new  formulation will be applied to  formulate new member models  for composite beams and SRC  columns.  These models will  include the effects of partial  bond between steel and  concrete under large element  deformations.  It will also  consider both nonlinear  material and geometric  effects.  A small series of  experimental tests on SRC  columns will be performed to  better understand the behavior  of  composite columns and to  calibrate the new analytical  models.  The proposed models  will be validated through a  set of correlation tests,  using  advanced identification-  optimization techniques.  Finally, a set of parametric  tests on small scale composite  frames under both quasi-static  cyclic loadings and input  ground motions will be  conducted.    The flexibility-based models  investigated here in this  project will lead to a  reliable assessment of the  state-of-health and safety of  existing civil infrastructure  systems.  The new models can  be used as a research and  practical tool for attaining a  better understanding of the  complicated behavior of  composite frames, wh ich can  eventually lead to the  development of improved design  procedures.    This is a project supported  under the year 1 program on  the Civil Infrastructure  Systems initiative NSF 94-145.  ***",
