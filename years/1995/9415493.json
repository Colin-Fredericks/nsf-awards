 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in applied mathematics between the University of Delaware's Center for Waves, directed by Ralph Kleinman, and Dominique Lesselier of the Division of Waves at the French National Center for Scientific Research, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. The participants include postdoctoral researchers and graduate students from both countries.  The objective of their research is to develop theoretical aspects and practical numerical codes for the detection of the size, shape, location and properties of objects embedded in inhomogeneous or layered materials.  They will apply mathematical techniques to the following problems:  (1) nondestructive detection of cracks or other faults in a known host medium;  (2) location and identification of objectives buried near the earth's surface (pipelines, land mines, or cables); and  (3) remote determination of the composition of the structure of the earth's crust.  The proposed collaboration takes advantage of complementary mathematical techniques developed by the U.S. and French groups and access to experimental data which will be supplied by the French group.  The project will advance theoretical understanding and may result in new computational techniques for studying problems in remote sensing and electrical engineering.",
