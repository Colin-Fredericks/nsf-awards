A novel protein whose synthesis is induced as cells approach stationary phase and whose accumulation is not detectable until 2 to 3 weeks after culture inoculation has been identified.  This protein, called p35, belongs to a family of proteins that is extremely conserved between prokaryotes (Archaea) and eukaryotes.  This gene family has not been isolated previously in yeast nor has it been described in the literature.  The broad phylogenetic conservation of the p35 gene family makes further study of this family compelling.  The novel, statimnary-phase expression of p35 makes studies of the function and regulation of the p35 gene family extremely likely to yield significant insights into the overall process of stationary-phase arrest in eukaryotes and, perhaps, also in prokaryotes.  This research involves classical genetic analysis in combination with molecular biological and biochemical approaches.  The specific aims are to:    1.  Characterize the p35 gene family.  This includes:   A) Isolating stationary-phase specific p35 and related genes as recombinant clones.    The method used for gene isolation will also allow the determination of how many  p35-related genes there are in yeast and their location in the genome.   B) Sequencing the isolated genes.   C) Preliminary examination of phylogenetic conservation. Hybridization analysis will be used to  determine the extent to which related genes are present in other eukaryotes and  prokaryotes.   D) Northern analysis to determine when mRNAs encoded by the p35-related genes  accumulate during the culture cycle.    2. Gain insight into the importance and function of p35 and related proteins in yeast.   This includes:   A) Disruption of p35 and related genes to determine if they encode essential proteins or if they  encode proteins with redunda nt, essential functions.   B) Phenotypic characterization of strains carrying mutations in p35 or p35-related genes.  Redundant genes will be identified by constructing strains carrying disruptions in two or  more p35-related genes. GALI promoter-p35 gene fusions, (which are repressed in  glucose and induced by galactose) will be constructed so  that 1) cells dying from lack of  p35 or a related protein and 2) cells expressing p35 at high levels in exponential phase  may be studied.   C) Generation of an antibody to the conserved amino terminus of p35 and, later, to a  nonconserved region of the stationary-phase p35 to aid in identification of p35 related proteins and in quantitation of their accumulation during the life cycle.    3. Examine the regulation of expression of stationary-phase specific p35.  This includes:   A) Analysis of the relative importance of p35 transcription, mRNA stability, translation, and p35  protein turnover in regulation of p35 expression in stationary phase. Transcription will  be measured using a p35 promoter:lacZ fusion vector; mRNA stability will be  determined using a temperature sensitive  RNA polymerase II mutant; translation will be  measured by in vivo incorporation of labelled amino acids, and protein turnover will be  evaluated by a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches.  %%%  The study of yeast genes expressed during growth to high cell densities has application to the isolation of large quantities of gene products in industrial applications.  ***",
