 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses the computer as a learning tool during in-class  instruction on a continuous basis, beginning with the critical  \"gateway\" courses Intermediate Algebra, Statistics, Trigonometry  and Calculus/Analytic Geometry.   Students will use computer  software to explore concepts as they occur during instruction, to  perform arduous computation, and to produce graphs and numerical  tables quickly.   They collaborate on real world problems and  create written and graphical presentations for understanding  mathematics.   Project students construct mathematical meaning,  learn to monitor and control their own learning, have the  benefits of social interactions, and move back and forth between  symbolic, graphical and numerical representations of mathematical  problems and concepts.  A dedicated technological mathematics  classroom will be created during the summer of 1995.   It will be  equipped with 20 powerful networked student workstations running  sophisticated software; an instructor's workstation; a capable  fileserver; an overhead projector and LCD display; and  Mathematica, Maple, Geometer's Sketchpad, and other useful math  software.    Team members will evaluate the project by analyzing  student performance data, surveying student attitudes, and  studying further math course-taking by these students.   They  will disseminate their findings through papers, presentations at  conferences, and hands-on workshops in the laboratory for high  school and community college colleagues in math and other  scientific and technical disciplines.",
