 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB 9506051  David Gard    Substantial evidence suggests that microtubules play important roles in the establishment of two important developmental axes that are specified or established prior to the cleavage of fertilized amphibian eggs: the animal-vegetal (A-V) axis of oocytes and eggs, and the dorsal-ventral (D-V)  axis of the developing embryo.  The proposed experiments investigate the role that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) play in regulating microtubule assembly and organization during formation of the A-V and D-V axes in Xenopus oocyte and embryos.  Three biochemically-distinct XMAPs have been isolated from Xenopus eggs.  Confocal and electron microscopy will be used to examine the distribution of XMAPs during oogenesis and early development.  Microinjection of XMAPs and XMAP antibodies will be used to probe the function of these proteins in oocytes , eggs, and embryos.  The effects of XMAP phosphorylation  on microtubule assembly will be addressed in vitro and in permeabilized oocytes and eggs.  Finally, molecular cloning will be used to examine the structural relationship between XMAPs and MAPs from other species.  Results from this project will provide new information on the role of the microtubules in the formation of cellular and embryonic polarity.  %%%  This project will examine the regulation of a cytoskeletal network (i.e., microtubules) using oocytes, eggs, and embryos of the frog as a model system.  Results from this project will provide information on mechanisms establishing cellular polarity and embryonic polarity during early development.  Consequently, this project should provide insights into the mechanisms that establish the body plan of an organism.  ***",
