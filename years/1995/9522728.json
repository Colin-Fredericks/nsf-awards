 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522728  Smith   Gasoline is produced through a costly and complex chemical process which relies heavily on sulfuric acid to convert less desirable alkenes to more productive high octane components.  The acid is expensive in itself, and monitoring the acid concentrations to ensure peak performance is currently a rigorous task, compounding time and expenses.  This research is to develop a diode laser-based, full-spectrum Raman scattering instrument prototype to safely and precisely monitor the required acid concentrations and reduce the cost of gasoline production.  Fiber optic-coupling will allow for safe remote monitoring, and an inexpensive CCD array will offer full spectrum capabilities that can reduce or eliminate lag time.  Maintenance of this system will also be reduced in comparison to other sample handling systems.      The successful development of this instrument will allow for rapid, continuous on-line and remote monitoring of the sulfuric acid concentration in the presence of hydrocapbons.  This will minimize the use of excess acid in the production of gasoline, and therefore reduce material expenses, as well as the related costs of transportation and handling.",
