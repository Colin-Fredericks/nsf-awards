 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521039  Wright    This project is supported under the NSF Faculty Early Career  Development (CAREER) Program. It provides support over four years  for a new Oregon State University faculty member, Dr. Dawn Wright,  to develop new, interdisciplinary courses in the marine and  geological sciences, to promote scientific careers to;  undergraduate and high school students, and to carry out a two-  pronged research program in different aspects of marine geophysics.  The first part of the proposed research focusses on a study of the  geophysical development of the Tonga forearc, a region formed in  response to ocean crust subduction and characterized by uplift of  volcanoes and deep ocean crustal material west of the Tonga trench  in the western Pacific Ocean.  This study will be carried out in  collaboration with Dr. Sherman Bloomer, Chair of the Oregon State  University Department of Geoscience. The second focus of Dr.  Wright's research will be the investigation of crustal faulting and  fissuring along the Juan de Fuca Ridge, a highly active ocean  spreading center located offshore western North America from  northern California to Canada.  This part of the project will  include the integration of several existing data sets of side-scan  sonar and photographic data along the spreading axis to define the  distribution and characteristic of cracks developed in response to  the stresses involved in ocean crust formation.  Understanding the  distribution, length and shape of these cracks will improve our  understanding of the mechanisms involved in sea floor spreading;  study of the Juan de Fuca Ridge expands on Dr. Wright's study of  the processes of crack formation on the East Pacific Rise, a  faster-rate spreading center further south in the eastern Pacific.  The Juan de Fuca Ridge region is a highly active area seismically,  with numerous earthquake reported annually.  Dr. Wright will be  working on this project in collaboration with researcher at the  Hatfield Marine Center in Newport, Oregon,  and will integrate her  study of crack distribution with the ongoing study of earthquakes  on the Juan de Fuca carried out at Hatfield Center.  The research  program on Juan de Fuca Ridge tectonics will be integrated into new  courses developed for graduate and undergraduate education, and  will allow a hands-on introduction to research techniques to  students at Oregon State University.",
