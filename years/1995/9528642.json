 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9528642    GLEZER  GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY       A key problem in manufacture of multi-layered printed  circuit boards is rapid and uniform deposition of copper on  inner surfaces of plated \"through-holes.\"  For conventional  boards (in which all interconnects are by means of through- holes) as well as boards also using surface-mount technology,  the trade-off between plating speed, uniformity, and deposit  ductility is such that acceptable yields are achievable only at  the cost of reduced speed, requiring large capital investment  and in-process inventory costs.  For holes of higher aspect  ratio in future boards, incremental modification of the  existing process will be incapable of providing the desired  uniformity at acceptable processing rates.          This project consists of a fundamental study  of the fluid mechanics and mass transfer of a radically new  approach to plating high aspect ratio holes.  The key idea is  to operate rotating screw electrodes (RSEs) in through-holes  of submerged boards.  The RSE generates radial, azimuthal,  and axial flow, leading to much more effective mass transfer  into and within the hole than is possible using conventional  technology.  Experiment shows the thickness of the resulting  copper deposit has much greater axial uniformity than is  achieved using the popular oscillating board technique, which  establishes time-periodic Poiseuille flow in the hole.  Flow modification by an axial pressure gradient,  whose magnitude will be chosen to give flow reversal, will also be considered.  This  will provide countercurrent mass transfer between oppositely  directed portions of the flow and suppress formation of  cation-depleted boundary layers in the central section of the  hole.          This approach will lay the foundation for  industrial evaluation and development of an improved plating  process for high aspect ratio through-holes currently being  developed.  The results will also have implications for  enhancing heat and mass tra nsfer in other applications.",
