 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  OPP-9423329    This project takes a novel approach to observing and  understanding zooplankton patch dynamics, supported by  recent developments in both theory and instrumentation.  The  species for this research project are the northern boreal  euphasiids Thysanoessa raschii, T. inermis and  Meganyctiphanes norvegica.  These are ideal subject  organisms for this study, because much is already known  regarding their basic physiology and ecology.  Strong diel  and seasonal changes in their physiological activity are  expected to provide measurable differences in both  metabolism and aggregation behavior.  The ability to measure  such significant differences is important, because the  research emphasizes observations of metabolism, using a  novel application of bioacoustic technology.  This project  will explore a new application of the acoustic Doppler  current profiler (ADCP), using measurements of Doppler  spectral broadening to quantify locomotory activities of  these euphasiids in situ.  The relationship between  locomotion and respiratory metabolism, which is well  established for other euphasiid species, will be measured  for the three species in the proposed study area of  Balsfjorden, northern Norway.  This research will provide an  assessment of a new, non-invasive method for measuring the  in situ metabolic state of macrozooplankton.  The results  will lead to a better understanding of how locomotory  behavior, per se, influences patterns of patch formation,  maintenance and dissipation.  These findings will be  interpreted within the framework of a mew model that  describes patch dynamical processes in terms of statistical  mechanics.  It is expected that new basic knowledge will be  added to the understanding of aggregation behavior of the  three species of euphasiids that play a central role in  Arctic ecosystems.",
