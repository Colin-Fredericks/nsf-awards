 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constructed in 1938, the Engineering Science Building is one of three buildings that houses the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Mississippi.  However, the majority of research and research training activities are performed in the Engineering Science Building.  Faculty research in the department can be broadly described as Applied Electromagnetic Theory, which is based on the extensive use of high performance computers and instrumentation.  Current research is conducted in the areas of dielectric resonator antennas, antennas near lossy media, crosstalk on IC interconnections, material properties measurements, and microwave hardware description languages and development.  Faculty members are, however, severely limited by inadequate conditions in their pursuit of research because of insufficient heating and cooling systems,  poor acoustics, and deficient lighting.  The most serious problem that impedes research performance is related to the poor control of temperature and humidity within research laboratories, which is detrimental to the operation and maintenance of computers, workstations, and equipment. Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to assist the University of Mississippi in its effort to renovate research and research training space in the Engineering Science Building, the center for all electrical engineering research.  Renovations will consist of:  reconfigured space,  an upgrade of heating, cooling and electrical systems, improved lighting,  and installed acoustic tile.   The new facility will eradicate an enduring  impediment to the performance of quality research, and the recruitment, retention, and training of students and faculty for research careers.",
