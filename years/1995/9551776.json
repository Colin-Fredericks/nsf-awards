The use of computers  to perform data acquisition and control of laboratory optical  instrumentation, optical image processing, modeling, simulations,  numerical analysis and presentation capability, is now standard  procedure within the photonics industry. The Laser Optical  Engineering Technology (LOET) program has been utilizing computers  to accomplish a very small subset of the above mentioned tasks in  a number of LOET laboratory classes and with senior projects with  only three (3) Macintosh computers for laboratory use by the entire  cadre of LOET students. Important experiments that are absolutely  essential to a well-rounded optics education simply cannot be  performed due to the lack of sufficient computers, data acquisition  hardware, and software. Currently, no capability exists to do any  optical image processing. The objective of this grant request is to  acquire additional computers, CCD cameras, and data acquisition  hardware and software that will allow the LOET program to expand  its capability to run meaningful lab experiments which routinely  use such equipment. In addition, this grant would also allow the  LOET students to be exposed to experiments and techniques in  optical image processing, an important topic in modem optical  engineering. The equipment requested by this grant would be  configured within the existing LOET laboratory computer network in  such a manner as to be portable from one LOET laboratory to the  next. This hardware/software  would be utilized in many of the  existing LOET laboratory courses, solely for the purposes of  undergraduate education in photonics. The results obtained from  student laboratory experiments using the above mentioned equipment  will be disseminated at both national and regional ASEE and SPIE  conferences, as well as in the ASEE Journal of Engineering  Technology.",
