 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511090  Blank    There has long been substantial interest in the relationship  between movements in the macroeconomy and changes in the economic  behavior and well-being of low-income populations.  In  particular, a growing research literature has investigated the  relationship between poverty, inequality, and aggregate economic   growth.  Less studied has been the relationship between economic   growth and the use of public assistance programs.  Recent trends   indicate the value of such research, however.  Public assistance   caseloads exploded in the early 1990s.  While at first this was  ascribed to the economic slowdown and the rise in unemployment,  the increase in program participation was unduly large relative  to the magnitude of unemployment changes, and caseloads did not  fall rapidly once unemployment began to decline.  his project  studies the determinants of public assistance caseloads and  benefit expenditures over time, bringing together the literature   focusing on individual decisions to participate in public  assistance, and the literature that investigates the role of the   macroeconomy on poverty and inequality.    This project will focus on four primary questions:   How are public assistance caseloads and benefit expenditures    related to macroeconomic movements and how has this changed    over time?  How have changing demographics among low-income families affected    these trends?   1.   How have changes in program eligibility and benefit rules       impacted public assistance usage?  2.   How do these three factors relate to changes in eligibility        versus changes in take-up rates among the eligible?",
