 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527181  Wagner  The establishment of a Center for High Performance Computing in Structural Biology will tackle computationally intensive problems that have been difficult or impossible using conventional laboratory computational resources, but that will be solvable in the HPCC environment.  The emphasis is on the reduction, analysis, and interpretation of experimental data in structural biology.  The primary goal will be the implementation, validation, application and dissemination of parallel protocols for the computational tasks, focusing on problems in macromoleculap NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, including advanced signal processing, molecular modeling, and ligand design.  The Center will have a high impact on basic science in structural biology, and on the development and application of new hardware and software technologies to problems that are manifestly important.  The broad aims of the Center are to extend the reach of structural biology to greater sensitivity and  higher resolution, to larger and more complex structures and phenomena, and to reduce the time required for structure investigations.  %%%  The Center's structural biology focus provides a set of problems that embody a rich diversity of mathematical and algorithmic expression, creating a fertile testbed for the development of HPC algorithms and software.  The emphasis on experimental aspects of structural biology, in particular, will bring HPC to bear on new problems that are not being pursued by groups developing applications of HPC to theory and simulation in structural biology.  The architecture of the planned computational facility will provide a versatile and cost-effective computational environment for this effort.  ***",
