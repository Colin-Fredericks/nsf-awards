 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500741  Rau    This   program   focuses  on  the  synthesis,   processing,   and  characterization of new magnetic heterostructure with  dimensions  at   the   nanometer  level,  including  one-,  two-  and  three-  dimensional  patterned structures. Besides the application  of  a  series    of    high-sensitivity   magnetic    and    nonmagnetic  spectroscopies,  a  newly  developed  technique,   scanning   ion  microscopy  with  spin analysis (SIMPA) will be used.  SIMPA  not  only  allows for element-specific, micro-magnetic domain imaging,  but  also provides for in situ sample processing using a  focused  ion  beam  of  35  nm  spot-size. The new  magnetic  systems  are  expected  to  exhibit  novel magnetic  properties  that  contrast  strikingly with the properties of presently known materials.  %%%  This program focuses on the study of novel magnetic materials and  systems which are engineered at the atomic scale and do not exist  in nature. These new systems are expected to exhibit specifically  tailored  macro-  and  micro-magnetic  properties.  The   design,  synthesis  characterization and processing of  such  new  systems  will  not  only  lead to new or advanced materials with  superior  properties  and  performance, but will also help to  improve  the  fundamental knowledge base in materials research. These one, two,  and three-dimensional patterned structure are expected to be used  in new applications and devices of potential future technological  importance  such  as  ultra-high  density,  thin  film   magnetic  recording media and heads or high-speed devises, where a detailed  physical  understanding of their micromagnetic properties,  which  are studied using a novel technique at Rice, will determine their  ultimate performance.  ***",
