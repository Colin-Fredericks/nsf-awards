This interplay between the macroion and its counterions can in turn play a principal role in determining the global conformation of the macroion, or in directing the binding of proteins and small ligands. However, except for linear nucleic acids, little is known regarding the nature of counterion accumulation. In order to address this issue, the current research combines computational and experimental approaches to the characterization of two specific structural elements in nucleic acids, namely, the helix terminus and the four-way junction. The former represents a simple paradigm for the contribution  of peripheral portions od nucleic acid structures to counterion accumulation, while the latter provides a system for studying the contribution of elements of higher-order (tertiary) structure. The computational approach used to describe the degree of counterion association (Aim 1) involves grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations  to predict Donnan distribution (preferential interaction) coefficients  (( ) the principal observable in an equilibrium dialysis experiment. The experimental determination ( of values for the linear and branched nucleic acids represents Aim 2. Finally,  the technique of steady-state electrophoresis will be employed to examine the relationship between thermodynamic ion binding (reflected in () and the effective charge of a nucleic acid undergoing electrophoresis.  %%%  One important aspect of a general understanding of gene expression is an appreciation of the means by which regulatory proteins interact with DNA. While it is clear that one component of such interactions involves specific recognition of DNA sequence, another, less well understood component involves the interplay between charges on the DNA molecule,  the  regulatory proteins, and small ions in the vicinity of the DNA.  Based on  prior research it has become apparent that the distributions of small ions in the vicinity of DNA can direct the binding of proteins to particular locations, particularly when the DNA contains elements of higher-order structure (e.g., branches, as found during recombination).  The current research represents a direct extension of the previous studies and will continue to rely heavily on high-performance (supercomputer) computational work in combination with experimental studies, both aimed at the further characterization of small-ion distributions in the vicinity of DNA.  Such studies will yield direct predictions regarding the nature of the interactions between gene-regulatory proteins and DNA.  ***",
