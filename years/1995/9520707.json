 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520707    Woody  plants vary in their ability to tolerate wind stress.  Many  trees respond to wind stress by adding woody secondary  growth  which  increases wind tolerances,  but  the  genetic  basis  of  traits  that  improve wind  tolerance  is  nearly  unknown.  This research will compare the genes expressed  in  poplar  trees  subjected to wind stress to  those  in  trees  which  have  not been stressed.  Poplars are selected  as  a  model woody plant system because of their economic value  in  biomass production, ease of propagation, small genome  size,  ease of isolation of DNA and RNA, and transformability.  The  comparison  of genes will be accomplished using differential  display  of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products.   This  technique  enables  a  side  by  side  comparison  of  those  messenger  RNAs (mRNAs) which become active in wind-stressed  versus  the  unstressed plants.  These mRNAs will  represent  genes  which are activated by wind stress and may contribute  to   the   structural   tolerance  of   the   plants.    The  differentially expressed genes will be cloned, sequenced and  used  to probe (screen) poplar varieties which vary in their  response  to  wind stress. That procedure will identify  the  role  of  the genes in the signal cascade pathway  for  wind  stress  response in plants having secondary growth.   Plants  that are successful in wind exposed sites should possess and  express  these  genes.  Identification and  cloning  of  the  genes  will  allow  early  identification  of  wind-tolerant  individuals  and  strains, and may allow  transformation  of  poplars  and other woody plant subjects to improve tolerance  to wind and decrease the risk of wind damage.",
