 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418694  Ohnishi  This research involves studies on the molecular mechanism of electron and proton transfer processes in two segments of the respiratory chain, (1) the quinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, and (2) succinate-quinone oxidoreductase, with a particular emphasis on their structure-function relationships.  1  Quinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase: The Rieske iron-sulfur protein plays an essential role in quinol oxidation at the Qo site of quinol-cyt. c oxidoreductase. We plan to delineate amino acid residues that are involved in quinone binding at the Rieske domain of the Qo pocket. We also plan to investigate quinone interactions with its surroundings via hydrogen bonds and the weak interaction with the aqueous medium by 17O-quinone EPR and 1H- and 2H-ENDOR techniques (with Dr. G. Babcock) combined with site directed mutagenesis.  2  Succinate-quinone oxidoreductase: We will investigate the molecular mechanism of quinone binding and protein architecture of the Qs domain utilizing three different bacterial systems, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis succinate-quinone reductase (with Drs R. Gennis and L. Hederstedt, respectively) and E. coli quinol-fumarate reductase (with Dr. G. Cecchini). We will use advanced EPR, ENDOR and genetic engineering techniques. The structural implication of these findings will be studied using site-directed mutagenesis in combination with various spectroscopic methods including EPR and 57Fe-ENDOR (in collaboration with Dr. B. Hoffman's group). A soluble 7 kDa Streptomyces griseolus ferredoxin bearing a single trinuclear iron-sulfur cluster will be analyzed as a model system for a cluster which is not readily converted to a  4Fe-4S  cluster.  %%%  This research covers studies on the molecular mechanism of electron and proton transfer in two segments of the respiratory chain, the quinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, and succinate-quinone oxidoreductase, with particular emphasis on their structure-function relationships. The strength of this research is the com bination of molecular biological approaches with biochemical and biophysical techniques. The experimental outcome will provide detailed insight on the energy coupling mechanism at two crucial proton and electron interaction sites and on a non-energy coupling site.  ***",
