 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to renovate and consolidate engineering research  laboratories and related facilities in Goddard Hall, a 81 year old facility, on the  campus of New Mexico State University.  The modernized space will be used to  consolidate the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department s  strong  communications, telemetry and electro-optics research program, currently dispersed  throughout three different buildings.  Present conditions of laboratories, dedicated to  research activities, are poorly configured and inappropriate to support the rapid  growth of research and research training activities that are occurring in the discipline.   In addition to modernizing research space, ARI funds will be used to upgrade  infrastructural utilities including: power, communication, security and HVAC  systems.  Improved upgrades will provide adequate cooling capacity for computer  equipment throughout the year and computer linkages within the research space.   Research  currently not feasible will be enabled upon completion of the project.   Benefits will include: synergy among research faculty and students, ability to share  equipment among users, and improved network capabilities, providing more effective  student training on computing hardware. Due to the large population of minorities in  the state, it is anticipated that the project will have an impact on engaging more  minority students in engineering.  Coupled with the coordinated efforts through the  NSF s Alliance for Minority Participation and the Research Improvement in Minority  Institutions Programs, the  number of underrepresented minorities entering science  based professions will increase.",
