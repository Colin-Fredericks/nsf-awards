 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454425  Barnhart      This project implements a 5-year, multi-phase Teacher Enhancement  program consistent with the West Virginia Science Curriculum  Framework (WVSCF). As a statewide project it will reach all 7-10th  grade science teachers. It is a leadership project congruent with  the national science standards, Project 2061's tenets and the  tenets of SS&C. The project develops a Cadre of change agents and  teams of Science Mentor Teachers(SMT), at least one team for each  of West Virginia's 55 counties, and empowers them to provide high  quality professional development in science education to their  peers in West Virginia.    Workshops and institutes will immerse: 35 master teachers in 30  days of classroom/laboratory/field experiences; 150 leader teachers  in 25-days of such experiences; and 1000 s/m/t educators in 12-days  of such experiences and teleconferencing. Content specific courses  will be delivered by satellite to meet content enhancement needs of  the teachers. There are 55 implementation outreach workshops which  will reach teachers who have not participated in NSF/TE workshops  previously. Administrators and guidance counselors will also  participate in the training. Participants may earn graduate or  continuing education credit. Indeed, one component of the project  is a Master of Arts Degree in Coordinated and Thematic Science  offered jointly by the graduate institutions of the state.",
