 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Departments of Geological Sciences and  Physics are provided funding for an x-ray diffractometer (XRD)  with a host computer and associated software for use in  undergraduate education.  This project provides instruction that  integrates science and technology in both geology and physics for  the following student groups:  (1) undergraduates that are  planning careers in precollege teaching, (2) current science  teachers enrolled in an M.A.  in Teaching Science, and (3)  science majors in geology and physics.   This goal is  accomplished by providing students with direct access to a modern  instrument for student research at the introductory science level  and in more advanced science laboratory courses.  XRDs are  central components in industry and the research community.   If  our students are to function effectively in these  technology-dependent environments, they need experience with such  equipment.   Students in both disciplines learn about the  principles of x-ray diffraction and the utility of such  equipment.   For the non-science-majors, experience with an XRD  system will take away the abstract nature of what they learn and  make it a practical reality.  The choice of an XRD system is  based upon issues of utility, dependability, and safety.   This  instrument is powerful enough to serve adequately in the advanced  laboratories and in directed student research.   The new  interlocks and remote computer control help ensure the safety of  the students and protect the equipment from abuse.",
