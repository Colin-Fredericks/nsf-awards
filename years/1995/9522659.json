The research approach is to take advantage of high thermal conductivity of diamond by growing  a multilayer composite coating to prevent the common failure of delamination of the diamond layer from the substrate.  The composite coatings are designed to consist of diamond, aluminum nitride or silicon carbide layers.  A discontinuous layer of diamond crystallites is grown on copper or molybdenum or silicon nitride substrates either by hot filament chemical vapor deposition or microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition.  The diamond crystallities are further embedded and anchored to the substrate by deposition of an interposing layer of aluminum nitride or silicon carbide layer by laser physical vapor depostion.  A second and continuous layer of diamond is deposited on the top with a smooth surface.  Metallization of diamond layer with deposition of thin layer of tatanium and a barrier layer of tungsten or chromium to prevent interaction of titanium with the gold-tin eutectic solder will also be carried out in-situ by laser physical vapor deposition in the multi-target high vacuum chamber.  The heat spreaders will be soldered to the device wafer using a eutectic alloy of gold-tin or gold-silicon that can withstand temperatures up to 500K.  Selective deposition of diamond multilayer structure to absorb heat from the devices, maximization of contact area to increase the heat flux, and epitaxial growth of diamond and interposing layers to reduce the thermal resistance of the interfaces in the composite layers are the important goals of this research.  The thickness of the interposing layers, the microstructure and the epitaxial growth of the diamond and the interposing layers will be optimized to give the highest thermal conductivity and good adhesion.  Improvement in resistance against failure from stresses generated due to high frequency thermal cycling is the expected bene fit of this project.  In an attempt to quantify the benefit, the failure mechanisms of the new and conventional heat spreaders will be determined by subjecting them to laser pulse radiation or high power heat bulb radiation and quantified by measuring the energy density at which peeling takes place.  The effective thermal conductivity perpendicular to the film will be determined by the Flash method.  Thermal cooling pattern of the power devices with the new heat spreaders will be investigated using the infrared detection of the temperature of different regions of the device.  Modeling of the thermal conductivity and thermal stresses in the multilayer structure will be carried out by numerical solution of the non-linear heat equation and finite element analysis, respectively.     As electronic devices shrink in size while packing more information per unit area and frequencies increase to speed information processing, local heating becomes a major problem.  The ability to effectively cool these devices becomes the technical barrier to further progress.  With the advent of diamond coating technology, an opportunity arises to use its high thermal conductivity to dissipate the heat.  However, another property of diamond, non-stickiness makes it difficult to apply as an adherent coating.  Successful solution of this problem as addressed in this project may have a major impact on the electronics industry.",
