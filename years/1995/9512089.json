It is now well established that attention applied to  incoming stimuli improves perception and memory for that  material.  This research will explore the converse:  When as much  attention as possible is allocated to one source of incoming  information, does other arriving information receive any  processing whatever?  The answer is not presently known, but has  critical import for theories of cognition.  The answer also will  provide crucial information needed to design training programs  for tasks with cognitive and motor components.    The research will explore this issue within the visual system.  A  number of letters will be presented briefly and simultaneously in  a circular array.  Prior to presentation, attention will be  directed to one position in the array.  Since timing will be such  that eyemovements cannot be made, movement of attention will be  internal.  Control conditions will be used to verify that as much  attention as possible is directed to the cued position.  Most  decisions will be made about the letter presented at the cued  location, but occasionally the subject will be asked to make some  simple decision about the letter presented at a distant location.   The research will ask whether the accuracy of such decisions is  greater than what would be predicted from pure guessing.   Theories of automatic processing mandate that unattended  information receives processing, but research to date, because of  some critical flaws, does not provide the needed evidence.   This  series of studies is designed to provide definitive answers.  It  will also ask what types of information get processed in such  unattended conditions.    An important feature of the research project will be the  development of a mathematical/simulation model of attention,  automatic processing, and their relationship, extending research  that has already b egun in the investigators' laboratories.    ***",
