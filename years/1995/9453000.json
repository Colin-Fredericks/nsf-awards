 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453000  Marks    The Health Museum (THM) is requesting $868,108 over 30 months to  create a 3,600 sq. ft. permanent exhibit containing seven Body  Stops components, which will maintain THM's science literacy focus  by linking concepts of human biology to everyday experience through  visitor exploration of the human body's seen and unseen operating  systems.  Ancillary instructional materials and programs will be  produced.    The educational goals of the project are to:       1. Promote understanding of the basic biological sciences in       the context of the human life cycle and health;       2. Present vital basic science information through an active       and accessible exhibit environment which complements formal       science education;       3. Develop an appreciation of basic human biological sciences       as they are presented similarly across all people and an       appreciation of human variability as these biological       processes are played out in the individual.    The target audiences are families, urban youth, and student and  teacher groups.",
