Krishnamoorthy, Professor of Civil Engineering  at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT),  Madras, India.  The project aims to merge US  research results in genetic algorithms (GAs)-  search procedures based on the mechanics of  natural selection and natural genetics- and  Indian research on structural optimization and  the application of knowledge-based systems,  thereby producing a set of computer tools that  can substantially improve the breadth and  efficacy of structural design in both  countries.  The computer work is viewed as the  development of a prototype GA shell tailored to  structural optimization.  When possible, public  domain codes such as Genesis and Splicer will  be used to save effort.    Scope:  This research project is suitable for  the objectives of the Division of International  Programs in linking US and foreign scientists  with complementary talents and experiences.   The US scientist has experience and research  results in the area of GA that can benefit from  the extension of the methodologies to practical  settings in the field of structures.  The  Indian scientist at the IIT has experience in  knowledge-based design of structures.  This can  benefit from applying the current GA theory and  techniques.  ***",
