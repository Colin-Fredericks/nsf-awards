To introduce principles and procedures  before laboratory exercises and to reinforce key experimental ideas  after laboratories, a series of interactive computer simulations of  laboratory devices and accompanying text materials will be  developed. These simulations allow students to explore instrument  concepts at their own pace, alone or in groups. Using an icon-based  simulation engine/environment which embodies a block diagram  approach, realistic and sophisticated simulations (with on-line  help, text and graphical output, and animation) can be created much  more rapidly than those written in higher-level languages and can  be easily tailored to specific courses and audiences.  The  exercises promote logical thinking, active learning, and the  formulation and testing of hypotheses.",
