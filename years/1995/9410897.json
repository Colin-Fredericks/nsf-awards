The task of designing feedback laws for linear systems with  saturating inputs is very complex and challenging.  Perhaps due  to this complexity, the effect of saturation of actuators has  been ignored in most of the modern control literature.  This  proposal seeks to develop both the analysis and design tools for  systems with saturating actuators.  Our initial work shows that a  semi-global framework is a natural and desirable framework for  the design of such systems.  Our recent effort also indicates the  emergence of powerful techniques for designing systems with  saturating actuators.         This proposal focuses on some of the central and fundamental  control problems for systems with saturating actuators.  Among  the many problems which must be confronted are: robust semi-  global stabilization, robust semi-global disturbance rejection  and semi-global output regulation and tracking.  ***",
