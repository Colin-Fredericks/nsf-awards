Input from the WTSAMA collaborative partners has  formed a solid ground for the planning of this project as well as for continued monitoring to  ensure consistency and quality of effort.  Project GET SET, GO (Girls & Educators Teaming  in Science Education) will focus on four major objectives:  (1) to build an awareness, raise  expectations, and change everyday practices among teachers, parents, and school administrators  at WTSAMA middle schools, thus assuring equal access to opportunities and education in  science; (2) to bridge the educational levels in science through peer mentoring, cross-age  teaching, and role modeling; (3) to create a physical, social, and psychological environment  within each school that reinforces the importance and relevance of women in science; and (4)  to research, locate, modify/design hands-on science activities which complement the science  curriculum and are adapted to promote equal participation of all students in the classroom.   These objectives are to be matched with activities specifically suited to the needs and population  of the region.  Activities are to include the Teacher Institute for Gender Equity Training and  Science Research, Parents' Night Presentations and Activities, Saturday Science Symposiums,  and the Science Women's Studies Program.  These activities should increase the interest and  involvement of students, teachers, parents, and administrators in science, and create an  environment that supports and encourages young wome n to pursue studies and careers in science  and related areas.    Because this region is representative, in microscale, of the entire state, this project serves as a  model for statewide implementation.  The WTSAMA and its key collaborators provide an  essential operational structure and support network that ensures project success.  GET SET, GO  builds on current successful programs, and introduce new activities and opportunities, to create  a cohesive whole.  Extensive dissemination is planned at regional, state, and national levels.    ***",
