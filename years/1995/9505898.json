 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505898  Salyers  DNA transfer by conjugation from bacteria to plants and from bacteria to yeast has been demonstrated, but transfer of bacterial DNA to mammalian cells has not been reported. The lack of evidence for DNA transfer from bacteria to mammalian cells is probably due to the failure to look for such events in the right way rather than to the absence of such events in nature.  The first systematic attempt to determine whether bacteria can transfer DNA to mammalian cells under laboratory conditions is being undertaken.  Since this is a high risk project, the project is focused on a single achievable goal, whose accomplishment will determine the feasibility of further work in this area.  Specifically, shuttle plasmids that can replicate in mammalian cells as well as in bacteria are being constructed, and broad host range conjugal elements of bacteria are being tested for the ability to mobilize the shuttle plasmids to mammalian cells.  %%%  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research takes advantage of the unique qualifications of this researcher to test for the possible ability of bacterial cells to transfer genes to animal cells.  If such transfer is demonstrated, it would have important implications for genetic studies of animals, both from an evolutionary point of view and as a new technique for the genetic manipulation of animal cells  ***",
