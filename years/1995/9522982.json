 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522982  Khoshnevis   The current state of the art of rapid prototyping technology is limited by parts size, surface quality and geometric tolerance.  In this one year research project, a novel approach to improving surface quality will be attempted.  It is a synergistic approach combining extrusion of a paste like consistency materials with a trowel like smoothing tool controlled by a robot.  Eventhough this contour crafting approach builds on established 3D additive fabrication techniques, several fundamental design issues of components and their assembly into a prototype machine need to be addressed in order to test out the feasibility of this innovative approach.   Rapid prototyping technology has been well accepted by designers to test out form and fit of new parts.  The technology is slowly evolving to the stage of making final parts directly from a computer design eliminating several manufacturing steps.  This leads to the potential of very fast cycle time from design state to the product launch.  Additional benefits could be envisioned in reduced work in process and reduced inventory of finished goods.",
