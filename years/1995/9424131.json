The presence of impurities modifies  the  phase  diagram  of  pure 3He in ways that  are  incompletely  understood  and  are often surprising. The research  will  employ  both  pure  3He  and  mixtures of 3He and  4He.  Of  considerable  interest  is  the  distribution of 3He and the 4He  in  mixtures:  Phase   separation   may  occur,  one  of  the   isotopes   being  preferentially adsorbed near the aerogel colloid, the  superfluid  properties  of  the  system may be changed,  etc.  There  is  the  possibility  that the work could lead to discovery of  conditions  in  which two different superfluids coexist in a mixture  of  3He  and  4He.  The  work  will use torsional  oscillators  and  sound  resonators   to   map  the  transition  temperature,   superfluid  fraction,  sound  velocity  and heat capacity  of  these  quantum  fluids  in aerogels. The research is of a fundamental nature  and  will   provide  important  information  about  the   physics   of  superfluid behavior.  %%%  This  is  an  experimental low temperature physics  project.  The  research deals with superfluid liquids consisting of the isotopes  of  helium:  helium-3, helium-4, or mixtures thereof. Separately,  helium-3  or  helium-4  can be cooled  to  the  superfluid  state  (vanishing  viscosity).  Very recently, it  was  discovered  that  mixtures   of   helium-3  and  helium-4   can   have   properties  surprisingly different from the parent superfluids.  Further,  it  has  been  found  that the presence of a filamentary  aerogel  (a  silica-gel) \"impurity\" colloid, which comprises only  1%  of  the  sample volume, can profoundly affect the superfluid properties of  the  isotope  mixtures. The effect is related to the  very  large  surface   area  of  the  aerogel.  A  range  of  low  temperature  techniques  are  being employed to investig ate these  fundamental  problems,  which bear of the physics of superfluids. The  results  may  also  be  relevant  to  other  quantum  phenomena  such   as  superconductivity.  ***",
