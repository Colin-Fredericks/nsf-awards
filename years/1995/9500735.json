 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Thomas   Farrar of the University of Wisconsin will use NMR relaxation techniques   to investigate liquid phase interactions and hydrogen bonding between   solvent and solute and their effects on structure and dynamics.    Experiments include measurements of the temperature and solvent   dependence of nuclear quadrupole coupling constants in simple systems,   characterization of spin coupling effects and their application to   solution phase structure and dynamics, and NMR and infrared studies to   determine the relationships between chemical shift tensors, quadrupole   coupling tensors, and force constants.  Theoretical studies will also be   conducted to interpret these measurements in light of existing NMR   relaxation theory and to test the limits of current models.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies have already provided a great deal of   information on the way molecules interact with one another in the liquid   phase.  Professor Farrar's work will help extend our understanding of   these interactions to more complex systems such as those involving   hydrogen bonding.  Systems such as these are common in biochemistry, and   the results of this work may have important ramifications in this area",
