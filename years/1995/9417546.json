 "awd_abstract_narration": "Richard Stratt, Brown University, is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his   theoretical research in the short time dynamics of liquids.   Stratt   seeks to interpret  recent spectroscopic data obtained from   time-dependent-Stokes-shift measurements of solvation dynamics as well as   Fourier transform Raman (Optical Kerr effect) spectra of neat liquids in   terms of the instantaneous normal mode (INS) theory of the liquid   vibrations.   Two fundamentally disparate research directions to be   undertaken are: 1) to explore the ways in which INS analysis can assist   in the interpretation of ultrafast spectroscopic experiments; and 2)  to   find ways of extending the workable time span into the nonlinear regime   as much as possible, and to discover where the true limits of the   technique lie.  The effects of nonlinearity will be studied by examining   the time evolution, both via exact simulation and somewhat more   analytically, by considering the nonlinearity formally as  a   perturbation.   A significant fraction of what one thinks about as chemistry takes place   in solution, and chemical processes often look far different in a liquid   environment than they would if the molecules were completely isolated.    Just what the origins of these differences are, and precisely how these   distinctions arise from the molecular  properties of the solvent are   questions that have been pursued repeatedly with each new generation of   spectroscopic technique.   Recent theoretical progress in elucidating the   concept of linear excitations in liquids suggests that it may indeed be   useful to think in terms the short time evolution in the liquid-state   being governed by a set of liquid vibrations -- the so-called   instantaneous normal modes of the liquid.  The major purpose of Stratt's   research is to see if this theoretical construct can lead to   interpretation of recent results obtained from ultrafast spectroscopy,   and to provide a molecular level interpretation of the structure and   dynamics of the liquid state.",
