The specific goals of this project are to fulfill an  important part of GLOBE's objectives dealing with the atmosphere and climate. Three tasks  are to be accomplished: 1) To teach K-12 students about atmospheric composition, global  change and climate by providing hands on experience, real data and computer based  learning tools. 2) To obtain new data on key trace gases involved in climate change and  ozone depletion, at continental sites, where such measurements are needed and have not been  taken. The atmospheric measurements are supplemented by direct flux measurements to study  sources and sinks. And 3) to establish a methodology that is inexpensive and ef  ficient so that in the next phase of GLOBE, after this project ends, atmospheric      composition can become a core measurement.",
