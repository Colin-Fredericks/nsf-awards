 "awd_abstract_narration": "We ape conducting a three-year dissemination of our  NSF/FIPSE project, \"Workshop Biology for Non-Majors.\"  Workshop Biology is a successful non-majors' biology course,  taught in the context of a major research university, that  addresses the serious problem of scientific literacy in a  world with growing biological concerns.  The course aims to  develop students' understanding of biological concepts,  scientific processes, and critical thinking skills to help  them make decisions about important scientific issues.  The  project has generated a great deal of enthusiasm among  science faculty at many other institutions, who have clearly  articulated to us their need for extended collaboration,  using effective models, in improving their approach to  instructional problems.    The project's primary goal is to improve student learning in  general education science courses at other institutions, by  helping instructors clarify their educational goals and  implement and assess learning experiences designed to  achieve these goals.  The Workshop Biology project provides  models for goals, teaching strategies, and assessment  methods, as well as processes for developing new ones.  Our  project offers intensive collaboration, experimentation, and  reflection by all participants, to develop effective  educational practices for their own situations.  In the  first and second years we are focusing on regional  institutions, whom we have already identified, and who  represent diverse contexts:  both two- and four-year  institutions with different missions (including a state  teacher's college) and different student populations than  that served by the University of Oregon.  These institutions  will help us create development materials that we will  disseminate, in workshops and conferences the third year, to  other institutions around the country.  We will assess the  extent and duration of change at other institutions, the  reactions of participants to the process of dissemination,  and the effectiveness  of their new programs.",
