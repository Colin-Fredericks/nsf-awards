The plan focuses on enhancing  the research capability and productivity within South Dakota, building upon previous EPSCoR programs  and independent research accomplishments.  Three institutions will be involved: the University of South  Dakota, South Dakota State University, and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.      The plan is organized into two fundamental parts, the building of infrastructure and scientific research  focus areas.  Infrastructure development will include:  1) strategies that build a sustained research base  in South Dakota;  2) strategies that impact short-term research productivity; and 3) strategies that  relate to economic development.  The infrastructure activities will be implemented within the context  of three interdisciplinary and interinstitutional scientific research foci.  The first group, \"Surface and  Interfacial Science,\" builds upon developing expertise in structure and processes occurring at the  junction of two dissimilar phases.  The second project, \"The Role of Membranes in Cell Regulation,\"   involves scientists from various disciplines within the biological sciences.  A third project, \"Imaging and  Modelling of Coupled Environmental Processes,\"  will build upon cooperation of the universities with the  EROS Data Center north of Sioux Falls.",
