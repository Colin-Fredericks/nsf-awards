 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses computational issues for finite  groups that are currently beyond the scope of current    algorithms and existing  technology. The groups are  represented either as permutation   groups or as  matrix groups  defined over finite fields. The questions of   interest  concern  both group theoretic structure and applications of  the group   theory.    A  central motivation for the research is the construction of    representations for matrix groups defined over  finite   fields.  This is an  important part of a large-scale  international effort to   develop a suite of  computational  tools for performing matrix group   computations.  The tools  to be  developed have application to problems in the  physical   sciences,  engineering, and those parts of  mathematics dealing with   high dimensional  matrix  representations of groups.    A second research area   computational techniques for  solving the minimum word   problem for finite  groups.  This  problem arises in many contexts, such as   routing in  interconnection networks and coding theory, and is known to    be computationally  difficult.  The research will lead to new  algorithms which    use group  automorphisms to prune the search tree of possible    solutions.    A third  research area is the development of a software  architecture   to bring parallel  computers to bear on large  scale problems in computational   group theory, such  as the  construction of very large matrix and permutation    representations.  Such as integrated, interactive environment  will enable   researchers to quickly  overcome the initial  learning barrier for effective use of   parallelism.  They  will  be able to combine readily available networks of   workstations  at their  home site (such as student labs), with an already  familiar   language, such as GAP or LISP.",
