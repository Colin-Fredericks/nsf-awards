This exchange program will enable extended  research leaves for researchers at IMS and the UR in order  to conduct research that cannot be done at their own  institutions.  Through NSF funding, two UR postdoctoral or  graduate students will spend up to six months in IMS  laboratories per year; in addition, their research advisors  will make short-term visits to Japan at the beginning and  end of each research exchange.  Through funding from Japan,  IMS research scientists will work in laboratories at the UR.    Research to be conducted under this exchange examines  fundamental factors that control the rates and efficiencies  of electron transfer, charge separation, and charge  transport in various media and systems.  It further examines  how these factors can be manipulated to obtain new chemistry  and useful reaction products that may have application to  materials and devices for photoscience-based technology.  The research will take advantage of highly advanced  equipment available at one or the other of the sites.  The  quality of the work done by the American students and  faculty will be significantly enhanced by access to  additional resources both in instrumentation and expertise.  ***",
