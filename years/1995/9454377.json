 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454377  Moreno    This is a three year project which will provide intensive staff  development in integrated science, mathematics and technology for  three, two teacher teams from 12 elementary schools in Harris  County.  In turn, these teams will be lead teachers in their home  districts.  The project will involve principals and superintendents  in each of the 12 districts.  The project will be accomplished by  (1) involving participating district and school administrators,  teachers and parents in the 12 schools; (2) training three, two-  teachers teams from each to serve as lead teachers through  participation in an intensive four-week integrated science,  mathematics and technology institute for three consecutive summers  and through workshops held during the school year (two per year);  (3) sponsoring school-year inservice sessions for all teachers in  the targeted schools to be conducted by program participants; and  (4) providing the teacher teams with additional activities and  guidance during the school year to increase the probability of  success in achieving sustained improvement in integrated  instruction.    The project will result in the professional development of 72  teachers in the areas of science, mathematics and technology.   These teachers in turn will provide teacher inservice training and  collaboration among their teacher co-workers.  Sustained  improvement is expected as trained teachers promote their schools.   The project is supported by the 12 superintendents whose schools  are involved.    The project requested $699,586 from NSF with institutions/agencies  and school districts providing 38% in cost sharing.",
