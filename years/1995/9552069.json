 "awd_abstract_narration": "In reply to student requests and in recognition of the rapid  advancement of the neurosciences over the past decade, the  Psychology Department has set a goal to establish a neurosciences  curriculum.   This series of lecture and laboratory courses  provides a structured approach for studying brain and behavior  interaction.   The equipment requested through this grant  significantly enhances the science education of lower- and upper-  division students through demonstration and active participation.    However, the greatest impact is being achieved through the  creation of a Neurosciences Laboratory facility.   This  Laboratory supports three new courses and four new laboratory  classes in which psychology students first learn, and then  empirically validate, scientific concepts and theories.    Included in the new curriculum are laboratory sections for  existing basic courses in physiological psychology and learning,  as well as completely new courses with Laboratories in  Experimental Neuroanatomy, Electrophysiology and Behavior, and  Neuroimaging in Neuroscience.   With over 550 undergraduate  majors in psychology, the cost effectiveness and educational  impact of this new science program can be significant.",
