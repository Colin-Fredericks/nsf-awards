 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423650  RICKLIS       Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding the  contemporary dynamics of different facets of the Earth system.  Of particular concern have been the analysis of interconnections  among terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean systems related to  climatic change and sea-level rise.  A growing number of  scientists are turning their attention to analyses of past  changes in order to better understand present and future changes.  By enhancing the empirical record of conditions during the  Pleistocene and Holocene epochs, expanded knowledge of the  dynamics of change and of the consequences of those changes can  be used to validate mmdels of contemporary processes and to  improve predictions of the impacts of future changes.  This  collaborative research project will examine the development of  fluvial, estuarine, and barrier-island systems along the central  Texas coast in response to late Pleistocene and Holocene climate  and sea-level changes.  The primary goals of this project are  (1) to develop a chronologically controlled general stratigraphic  framework for different environments over the last 10,000 to  20,000 years; (2) to compare this framework with independently  defined records of climate and environmental change for central  Texas and the Gulf of Mexico; (3) to refine the record of  Holocene sea-level change as a potential analog for future  events; and (4) to evaluate the effects of sea-level change on  fluvial, estuarine, and barrier-island systems as possible  analogs for future changes.  A diverse set of geomorphological,  sedimentological, geophysical, micropaleontological, and  archeological techniques will be used to gather data used in this  study.  The archeological work will focus on examining changes in  human use of estuarine resources in order to ascertain possible  future changes in productivity of fisheries resources when  natural systems undergo human-induced and natural change.       This project will provide new information about differe nt  facets of Pleistocene and Holocene change in coastal  environments.  Analyses of these and other data will provide  valuable new insights into the timing and character of change in  fluvial, estuarine, and barrier-island systems.  This project  also will help determine the degree to which historically based  models can be used to predict future changes.",
