 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9421529  Michael Ferkin      Seasonal reproduction is typical of most species of animals.  The  mechanisms that underlie seasonal changes are not well  characterized.  The proposed research examines a new and unique  effect of prolactin, a pituitary hormone, on reproductive behavior.   There is considerable evidence that prolactin inhibits  reproduction.  However, recent evidence suggests strongly that high  prolactin levels may be needed for the behaviors and physical  characteristics necessary for males attract females.  The apparent  paradoxical role of prolactin will be examined using an unique in  vivo model.  Prolactin levels tend to be higher during the long  days of spring and summer which corresponds to the time of year  when animals are reproductively active, whereas, such levels tend  to be lower during the short days of fall and winter, and  correspond to the time of year when animals are reproductively  quiescent.  These studies will contribute results that can furnish  a new perspective on physiological mechanisms and behaviors  facilitating reproduction.  They will provide a context within  which we can understand the mechanisms underlying reproductive  behavior and hormone-behavior relationships and the evolutionary  processes leading to seasonal rhythms in reproduction.",
