 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field Museum requests funds to purchase an automated DNA  sequencer, the Applied Biosystems 373A, for its Biochemistry  Laboratories, a core facility that provides opportunities for  Field Museum staff and students to use gene amplification  (PCR) and DNA sequencing in basic research and research  training in systematics.  Examination of the levels and  patterns of Lab use indicate why this instrument is needed.      The Biochemistry Laboratories, which are undergoing NSF  funded renovation in 1994, are heavily used:  10 curatorial  staff and research associates independently have used the  facilities, and at six of these research staff are now  pursuing or planning major DNA sequencing projects in the  near future.  The effect of this increasing demand on the  facilities and the concomitant establishing of reliable  protocols in the preceding steps (DNA extraction, PCR, and  amplicon purification), is that sequencing and base calling  have now become the primary factors limiting the Labs'  productivity.  Productivity and cost analyses support the  contention that acquisition of the 373A will result in:  1)  greater lab productivity; 2) an increase in lab capacity by  freeing otherwise dedicated lab space; and 3) a cost savings  of about 40% per sequencing reaction.  The latter will allow  the Labs to recoup purchase costs iTI less than three years  at present productivity levels.      The Applied Biosystems 373A has several advantages over  competing instruments, including:  1) a 4-dye  fluorescent-labeling system that enables running up to 4  times as many samples per PAGE gel; and 2) patented  dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators that permit use of  unlabeled oligonucleotide primers in both ~q cycle sequencing  and Sequenase formats.  Ability to use unlabeled primers  offers an economy and versatility for Field Museum projects,  as sequencing is entirely from PCR products amplified from a  myriad of plant, fungi, and animal sources.      Field Museum has well-developed training pro grams at all  levels.  Scientific staff have adjunct appointments at  neighboring institutions (e.g., U. of Chicago and U. of  Illinois, Chicago) and offer graduate training in systematics  through these institutions.  These students generally use the  Labs for their graduate research projects.  Finally, the  Laboratories are an active participant in Field Museum's  summer intern program, which targets high school and  undergraduate students, especially those representing  minority groups.  llhe Labs' capacity will be significantly  augmented by the acquisition of this instrument, providing  additional opportunities for students to gain research  experience in systematics.
